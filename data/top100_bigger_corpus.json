We are veterans of the United States Armed Forces, including the U.S. Army, United States Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Coast Guard and we are calling for our fellow veterans to assemble as a peaceful, unarmed militia at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation on Dec 4-7 and defend the water protectors from assault and intimidation at the hands of the militarized police force and DAPL security. 2K EVENT CAPACITY ACHIEVED: Event capacity based on accommodations, travel logistics and supplies; given the time we have to coordinate, resources available and the shipping and weather conditions in the region has been set at 2,000 rostered participants. We currently have over 2,100 Veterans on the roster. Our goal now is to prioritize this list to Veterans and Civilian personnel involved with operations, planning & onsite execution. next mission could be as early as the 2nd week of December. More to come The funds we raise on this page will go towards providing transportation and supplies for the brave patriots that come and stand with us. We have full support of the Sioux tribe elders and will be cooperating with them every step of the way. Several had to be treated for hypothermia and one protestor who was hit directly with a grenade has reportedly had her arm amputated as a result. Everyday becomes more evident that the defenders of America must stand with the Water Protectors. Let's stop this savage injustice being committed right here at home. Not if you allow this the be the United States. Please donate and pass this page along to your friends, family, coworkers and community members. It's time to display that honor, courage, and commitment we claim to represent. It's time for real Patriots. In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community. We are launching this second GoFundMe to create a Standing Rock Fund to address the ongoing needs at Standing Rock and our partners in camp. Please take moment to check out our new campaign and share with your networks. We are formulating organizational structure under a 501c4. This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement. This has been a life-changing experience for everybody involved and we plan to keep fighting for you as long as we have to. Please try again. I have 5 more seats in my Grand Caravan.

Jose Torres, 26, and Kayla Norton, 25, cried today in a Douglas County court as they were sentenced to 20 years and 15 years in prison, respectively. In July 2015, Torres and Norton, who have three children together, were part of a group of Confederate flag supporters called Respect the Flag. For two days that summer, the group rode around in pickup trucks threatening black families and calling them racial slurs across two counties in the Atlanta suburbs. The group targeted black families shortly after the Charleston, South Carolina, church massacre because its members were upset that the state responded to the brutal slayings by removing the Confederate battle flag from various sites. Philadelphia Jewish community feels 'threatened' after gravestones toppled At one point, the group pulled up to a birthday party for a black child in Douglasville. The group's members allegedly threatened to kill the partygoers, with Torres confronting the family with a gun that Norton loaded. The family called the police. Video of the incident was posted on YouTube by the Southern Poverty Law Center. In an indictment, Torres and Norton, among others, were charged with aggravated assault, terroristic threats and violation of Georgia's Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act. Through tears, Norton addressed the relatives of the child whose birthday she and others disrupted. That is not me. In addition to Torres and Norton, two people were charged with felonies, according to ABC affiliate WSB-TV.com; the two others pleaded guilty and were sentenced to shorter prison terms. The judge, saying Torres and Norton committed a hate crime, barred them from entering Douglas County after they are released from prison. 0 Shares Email Star Comments Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

Ben Van Heuvelen October 2, 2007 8:08pm (UTC) When Blackwater contractors guarding a U.S. State Department convoy allegedly killed 11 unarmed Iraqi civilians on Sept. 16, it was only the latest in a series of controversial shooting incidents associated with the private security firm. Blackwater has a reputation for being quick on the draw. According to the New York Times, Blackwater guards were twice as likely as employees of two other firms protecting State Department personnel in Iraq to be involved in shooting incidents. On Tuesday morning, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, will hold a hearing on the U.S. military's use of private contractors. When Waxman announced plans for the hearing last week, the State Department directed Blackwater not to give any information or testimony without its signoff. After a public spat between Rep. Waxman and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the State Department relented. Blackwater CEO and founder Erik Prince is now scheduled to testify at 10 a.m. Tuesday. But the attempt to shield Prince was apparently not the first time State had protected Blackwater. A report issued by Waxman on Monday alleges that State helped Blackwater cover up Iraqi fatalities. The ties between State and Blackwater are only part of a web of relationships that Blackwater has maintained with the Bush administration and with prominent Republicans. Good timing, and the connections of its CEO, may be the answer. His late father, auto-parts magnate Edgar Prince, was instrumental in the creation of the Family Research Council, one of the right-wing Christian groups most influential with the George W. Bush administration. At his funeral in 1995, he was eulogized by two stalwarts of the Christian conservative movement, James Dobson and Gary Bauer. Edgar Prince's widow, Elsa, who remarried after her husband's death, has served on the boards of the FRC and another influential Christian-right organization, Dobson's Focus on the Family. She currently runs the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation, where, according to IRS filings, her son Erik is a vice president. The foundation has given lavishly to some of the marquee names of the Christian right. Both Edgar and Elsa have been affiliated with the Council for National Policy, the secretive Christian conservative organization whose meetings have been attended by Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Bremer, and whose membership is rumored to include Jerry Falwell, Ralph Reed and Dobson. The former Betsy Prince -- Edgar and Elsa's daughter, Erik's sister -- married into the DeVos family, one of the country's biggest donors to Republican and conservative causes. She chaired the Michigan Republican Party from 1996 to 2000 and again from 2003 to 2005, and her husband, Dick, ran as the Republican candidate for Michigan governor in 2006. Erik Prince himself is no slouch when it comes to giving to Republicans and cultivating relationships with important conservatives. During college, he interned in George H.W. Bush's White House, and also interned for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif. Rohrabacher and fellow California Republican Rep. John Doolittle have visited Blackwater's Moyock, N.C., compound, on a trip arranged by the Alexander Strategy Group, a lobbying firm founded by former aides of then House Majority Leader Tom Delay. ASG partner Paul Behrends is a longtime associate of Prince's. Prince's connections seem to have paid off for Blackwater. But Prince's most important benefactor was fellow conservative Roman Catholic convert L. Paul Bremer, former head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, the American occupation government in Iraq. In charge of the Blackwater team guarding Bremer was Frank Gallagher, who had provided personal security for former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger when Bremer was managing director of Kissinger's consulting firm, Kissinger and Associates, in the 1990s. Blackwater's benefits from government largess haven't ended with Iraq. Blackwater also became involved in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and profited handsomely. Joseph Schmitz, chief operating officer and general counsel: In 2002, President Bush nominated Schmitz to oversee and police the Pentagon's military contracts as the Defense Department's inspector general. Unlike previous I.G.s, Schmitz reported directly to the secretary of defense -- a setup that both Democratic and Republican lawmakers objected to, given Schmitz's oversight responsibility. His father, John G. Schmitz, was a two-term Republican congressman, and his brother, Patrick Schmitz, served as George H.W. Bush's deputy counsel from 1985 to 1993. Joseph himself worked as a special assistant to Reagan-era Attorney General Edwin Meese. Schmitz resigned in 2005 under mounting pressure from both Democratic and Republican senators, who accused him of interfering with criminal investigations into inappropriately awarded contracts, turning a blind eye to conflicts of interest and other failures of oversight. According to an October 2005 article in Time magazine, Schmitz showed the White House the results of his staff's multiyear investigation into a contract in which the Air Force leased air-refueling tankers from Boeing for more than it would have cost to buy them, then agreed to redact the names of senior White House staffers involved in the decision before sending the final report to Congress. Schmitz informed his staff on Aug. 26, 2005, that he was leaving the Pentagon; in September of that year, he went to work for Blackwater. J. Cofer Black, vice chairman: Black spent most of his 28-year CIA career running covert operations in the Directorate of Operations, where he worked with Rob Richer (below). Black is, according to published accounts, a man with a flair for the dramatic, the kind of briefer President Bush likes. Black is also one of the more prominent faces associated with the Bush administration's interrogation and extraordinary rendition policies. And the group within the CIA responsible for extraordinary renditions -- operations in which covert agents grab terror suspects and take them to secret prison facilities for interrogations that would normally be prohibited as torture -- fell under Black at the CTC, Priest has reported. Black later went to the State Department, where one of his roles was to begin coordinating security for the 2004 Olympics in Greece. In 2003, the State Department gave Blackwater a contract to train the Olympic security teams. In addition to his work with Blackwater and his own company, Total Intelligence Solutions, Black also recently joined the presidential campaign of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, where he serves the Republican hopeful as senior advisor for counterterrorism and national security. Rob Richer, vice president for intelligence: Richer was head of the CIA's Near East division -- and the agency's liaison with King Abdullah of Jordan -- from 1999 to 2004. In 2003, he briefed President Bush on the nascent Iraqi insurgency. In late 2004, he became the associate deputy director in the CIA's Directorate of Operations, making him the second-ranking official for clandestine operations. He left the agency for Blackwater in the fall of 2005, effectively taking the agency's relationship with Abdullah with him. The CIA had invested millions of dollars in training Jordan's intelligence services. There was an obvious quid pro quo: In exchange for the training, Jordan would share information. Jordan has now hired Blackwater's intelligence division -- headed by Richer -- to do its spy training instead. Fred Fielding, former outside counsel: After four Blackwater employees were tortured and killed in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004, their families brought a wrongful-death lawsuit against Blackwater, charging that the company had not provided adequate arms, armor and backup. Blackwater feared that if it was found liable for its employees' deaths, a floodgate of future litigation could be opened. To fight the suit, Blackwater hired Fielding, the consummate Republican insider. Dan Callahan, a lawyer representing the families, told Salon he was shocked when he learned Fielding would be representing the company. Fielding has had a long career as a lawyer to prominent Republicans. From 1970 to 1972, he was an associate White House counsel in the Nixon administration; from 1972 to 1974, he was present for the denouement of that administration as deputy White House counsel. Under President Reagan, he served as White House counsel from 1981 to 1986, where he was the boss of a young assistant counsel named John Roberts, now the chief justice of the United States. In January 2007, Bush chose him as White House counsel. Ken Starr, outside counsel: According to Callahan, Fielding represented Blackwater as outside counsel for about six months beginning in February 2005. After Fielding left the case, the law firm Greenberg Traurig, which was once home to Jack Abramoff and worked for George W. Bush in the Florida recount, represented Blackwater till October 2006. Blackwater then hired another high-profile lawyer with impeccable Republican credentials -- Ken Starr, now the dean of Pepperdine Law School in California. Starr was appointed to the federal bench by Reagan, was U.S. solicitor general under George H.W. Bush and was on Bush's shortlist to replace William Brennan on the Supreme Court. He is best known, however, as the independent counsel who investigated Bill Clinton. He revealed the intimate details of Clinton's affair with intern Monica Lewinsky in the infamous Starr Report and set in motion Clinton's impeachment by Congress. Blackwater continues to assert that the state of North Carolina lacks jurisdiction in the wrongful-death lawsuit against the security firm. Roberts denied the petition on Oct. 24. In December, Starr filed a motion to bring the matter before the entire Supreme Court. The motion was denied in February. Additional reporting by Tracee Herbaugh.

Citizens delivered a Notice of Probable Violation and Summons to Governor Wolf. The action happened prior to a State Senate hearing on the Mariner East 2 pipeline, which was called after massive sinkholes emerged as a result of pipeline construction. Residents testifying and attending the hearing took the opportunity to remind Governor Wolf that while a growing, bipartisan group of local, state, and federal officials is calling for a halt to the pipeline, the approval and continued construction of Mariner East 2 is his responsibility. The 350-mile pipeline is being constructed in order to carry highly volatile liquids, most of which will be exported to Europe to make plastics.

      "Sentences":["While the U.S. government has never officially apologized for the genocide it committed upon tribal nations, these courageous veterans accepted responsibility for the actions and asked the tribe for forgiveness. And within that conscience we must first confess our sins to you because many of us, me particularly, are from the units that have hurt you over the many years. We came, we fought you, we took your land, we signed treaties that we broke, we stole minerals from your sacred hills, we blasted the faces of our presidents onto your sacred mountain. Then we took still more land, then we took your children and then tried to take your language and tried to eliminate your language that God gave you and that the Creator gave you. Leksi Leonard Crow Dog on behalf of the tribes in attendance accepted the apology and in turn asked for forgiveness for any hurt that might have been caused from the defeat of the U.S. 7th Cavalry by the Great Sioux Nation on June 25, 1876. The Tribal Historic Preservation Officer for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Jon Eagle Sr., posted a stunning summary of the monumental occasion. These gestures of peace, love, and forgiveness are the start to healing the brutality of the past. Winning this battle is as simple as choosing to abstain from the violent corrupt old system and participating in the new and peaceful system that hands the power back to the people. We feel that PIVX is this system. PIVX takes the control the banking elite has over money and gives it back to the people. It is the ultimate weapon in the battle against the money changers and information controllers because PIVX is the only cryptocurrency in existence that allows for completely anonymous storage while simultaneously paying interest.

      "Sentences":["She left New York City several weeks ago to help with the struggle at Standing Rock. She been an active participate and family to the activist groups NYC Shut It Down and Hoods4Justice. Sophia has always been committed to confronting injustice through vigilance and resistance. Sophia was giving out bottles of water to protectors holding down the space when she was shot with a concussion grenade. This was the response of police and DAPL mercenaries as she and other brave protectors attempted to hold the line against the black snake in hservice of protecting our water. Please consider donating to help pay for her treatment. We must to support our comrades when they need us the most. She needs all of us right now. After all she is our family. My name is Michael Basillas, I live in NYC. Sophia Wilansky is a fierce friend of mine. We've known each other for almost a year now from participation in various demonstrations focused in the city. Sophia and I share passion addressing social justice, vigilance, and resistance , and understanding this world is unsuitable and required drastic change. Sophia is family to many affinity activism groups from The Base, NYC Shut It Down, and HOODS4JUSTICE. I'm this money with the help of several other people to provide medical relief funds after what had happen on Nov 21, 2016. HOW THE MONEY WILL BE SPEND: Funds raised in this campaign will go directly to provide financial aid towards 20 surgeries Sophia needs to save her arm. Funds also provide Sophia's father some financial support to take care of his daughter. Their insurance will not cover all of the expenses and can only cover a certain percentage of it especially with this type of surgery. So we are asking to donate gracefully because this will help provide financial support toward Sophia's long recovery. The rest of the money will be delivered to Mr. Wilansky when he gets back one in NYC. They frequently post information about Sophia's well-being. Thank you for the support you have given us. Please try again. She stood in silence. She was sanding to close to a truck and they didn't like that. I suppose an unarmed, unarmored young woman is threatening to them. They ordered for her to retreat, the whole time shooting rubber bullets. When they finally stopped, she attempted to retreat, as they ordered. She took a few steps towards us, and that's when they directly launched the flash grenade at her. It exploded right on her. I want people who are not here to understand, we assemble in PEACE. Sophia said not a word to them. She is the proof that they will use violent tactics no matter what. We are not to blame here. Anyone who would blame the people and not the government in this situation astounds me... Wilansky family, please contact me. I am a witness to what Morton County did to your daughter. I think it's beautiful for everyone to help but that is a lot of money and maybe we can petition for them to donate their fee to her medical bills. It would be an estimate of half a million dollars if she needs a prosthetic arm. Calling the FBI could result in you providing information that could be potentially incriminating to yourself and others. Many of these police do not see your constitutional right to peacefully assemble. They do not see your point of view or what you are fighting for. Clearing a public road resulted in use of deadly force against hundreds of people. They have responded to us with escalating violence, and increased charges. Put pressure on your legislators, federal agencies, and the White House. Put pressure on North Dakota's governor. Call on the Department of Justice. Please keep eachother safe, and learn about your rights. May she recover more beautifully than could be imagined. May she know the love of thousands. May all her old ones enfold her now. May her story wake up the hearts of tens of thousands. May the protectors and the waters they protect be kept safe from harms way. Sorry for my skepticism. I should have researched better. They are just jealous they don't have this kind of support. And the police will be looking at serious charges against them for crimes against humanity. Thank you all water protectors for the fight. Sending troops in to back you up and lots of them. Below is her statement as conveyed by her father, lawyer Wayne Wilansky. A grenade exploded right as it hit Sophia in the left forearm taking most of the undersurface of her left arm with it. Both her radial and ulnar artery were completely destroyed. Her radius was shattered and a large piece of it is missing. Her medial nerve is missing a large section as well. All of the muscle and soft tissue between her elbow and wrist were blown away. The police did not do this by accident - it was an intentional act of throwing it directly at her. Additionally police were shooting people in face and groin intending to do the most possible damage. Sophia will have surgery again tomorrow as bit by bit they try to rebuild a somewhat functioning arm and hand. The first surgery took a vein from her leg which they have implanted in her arm to take the place of the missing arteries. She will need multiple surgeries to try to gain some functional use of the arm and hand. She will be, every day for the foreseeable future, fearful of losing her arm and hand. There are no words to describe the pain of watching my daughter cry and say she was sorry for the pain she caused me and my wife. I died a thousand deaths today and will continue to do so for quite some time. Prayers for her healing. And for a good attorney. This needs to be taken to court. The sacrifices that this young woman made to be there to support an important cause will be with her the rest of her life. She chose to stand up, she chose to help others that were in need that night and ended up getting severely injured. The least we can all do is come together and support her in her recovery. Her physical, emotional and mental state are fragile at this time and in need of lots of support to assist her. I don't know her personally but thank her from the bottom of my heart. I love that so many folks are pulling together and showing so much love and support. Let's keep this momentum going and make sure all her expenses are covered. We are in this together and together everyone achieves more. Please. Water is life. Let's try to do better and be better. Best wishes for Sophia and her family. She was just passing out water and helping This gotton of control when this girl could loose and an arm or hand. The violent use police are doing is wrong. This has to stop before more people get hurt. Thank you. Victory to the protectors. You can bring a horse to water but cannot make them drink.

We are veterans of the United States Armed Forces, including the U.S. Army, United States Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Coast Guard and we are calling for our fellow veterans to assemble as a peaceful, unarmed militia at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation on Dec 4-7 and defend the water protectors from assault and intimidation at the hands of the militarized police force and DAPL security. 2K EVENT CAPACITY ACHIEVED: Event capacity based on accommodations, travel logistics and supplies; given the time we have to coordinate, resources available and the shipping and weather conditions in the region has been set at 2,000 rostered participants. We currently have over 2,100 Veterans on the roster. Our goal now is to prioritize this list to Veterans and Civilian personnel involved with operations, planning & onsite execution. next mission could be as early as the 2nd week of December. More to come The funds we raise on this page will go towards providing transportation and supplies for the brave patriots that come and stand with us. We have full support of the Sioux tribe elders and will be cooperating with them every step of the way. Several had to be treated for hypothermia and one protestor who was hit directly with a grenade has reportedly had her arm amputated as a result. Everyday becomes more evident that the defenders of America must stand with the Water Protectors. Let's stop this savage injustice being committed right here at home. Not if you allow this the be the United States. Please donate and pass this page along to your friends, family, coworkers and community members. It's time to display that honor, courage, and commitment we claim to represent. It's time for real Patriots. In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community. We are launching this second GoFundMe to create a Standing Rock Fund to address the ongoing needs at Standing Rock and our partners in camp. Please take moment to check out our new campaign and share with your networks. We are formulating organizational structure under a 501c4. This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement. This has been a life-changing experience for everybody involved and we plan to keep fighting for you as long as we have to. Please try again. I have 5 more seats in my Grand Caravan.

MORE TOP NEWS: Pence's mission in Europe: Clarify Trump's foreign policy vision Trump administration proposes stricter Obamacare rules Lawmakers push for answers on Trump team's Russia ties Ethan Dettmer, a partner in the law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher and one of the lawyers representing the man, Daniel Ramirez Medina, said he is not aware of any other DACA recipient who has been arrested. Richeson declined to elaborate further on how ICE established the man was a member of a gang. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In an interview with ABC News last month, Trump said his administration was devising a policy on how to deal with people covered by DACA, without indicating any concrete plans. I do have a big heart. Court documents do not make clear why the father was taken into custody. Ramirez, now detained in Tacoma, Washington, was granted temporary permission to live and work in the United States under DACA in about 2014, according to the lawsuit, and his status was renewed in 2016. Reuters viewed a document attached to the lawsuit that appeared to confirm his DACA approval. Trump, a Republican who took office on Jan. 20, has promised a crackdown on the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, most of whom come from Mexico and other Latin American countries. Reuters could not independently confirm whether other DACA recipients have been detained since Trump took office. Ramirez filed a challenge to his detention in Seattle federal court on Monday, arguing that the government violated his constitutional rights because he had work authorization under the DACA program, his lawsuit said. Ramirez was in custody and unavailable for comment. Under 2014 guidance from the Obama administration, someone would be a deportation priority for gang activity only if they had been convicted of an offence in connection with the gang, not for gang affiliation alone, although there was room for discretion on the part of immigration officials. U.S. immigration officers last week arrested more than 680 people in the country illegally. Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said the operations, conducted in at least a dozen states, were routine and consistent with regular operations. Ramirez in his lawsuit is seeking immediate release and an injunction forbidding the government from arresting him again. A hearing in the case has been scheduled for Friday. When they entered, they asked Ramirez if he was in the country legally, and Ramirez said he had a work permit, the lawsuit stated. ICE agents took Ramirez to a processing center in Seattle and he again disclosed his DACA work permit, the lawsuit stated. Ramirez was fingerprinted, booked and taken to a detention center in Tacoma where he remained on Tuesday, said Rosenbaum.

      "Sentences":["This is nothing new from this Administration, since over the last four months the Administration has demonstrated by its action and inaction that it intended to delay a decision in this matter until President Obama is out of office. For more than three years now, Dakota Access Pipeline has done nothing but play by the rules. The Army Corps of Engineers agrees, and has said so publicly and in federal court filings. As stated all along, ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe. Original Story: The US Army Corps of Engineers has denied the final permit of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Instead, the Corps will be undertaking an environmental impact statement to look at possible alternative routes. We wholeheartedly support the decision of the administration and commend with the utmost gratitude the courage it took on the part of President Obama, the Army Corps, the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior to take steps to correct the course of history and to do the right thing. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and all of Indian Country will be forever grateful to the Obama Administration for this historic decision. We want to thank everyone who played a role in advocating for this cause. We thank the tribal youth who initiated this movement. We thank the millions of people around the globe who expressed support for our cause. We thank the thousands of people who came to the camps to support us, and the tens of thousands who donated time, talent, and money to our efforts to stand against this pipeline in the name of protecting our water. We especially thank all of the other tribal nations and jurisdictions who stood in solidarity with us, and we stand ready to stand with you if and when your people are in need. With this decision we look forward to being able to return home and spend the winter with our families and loved ones, many of whom have sacrificed as well. We look forward to celebrating in wopila, in thanks, in the coming days. We hope that Kelcey Warren, Governor Dalrymple, and the incoming Trump administration respect this decision and understand the complex process that led us to this point. When it comes to infrastructure development in Indian Country and with respect to treaty lands, we must strive to work together to reach decisions that reflect the multifaceted considerations of tribes. Treaties are paramount law and must be respected, and we welcome dialogue on how to continue to honor that moving forward. We are not opposed to energy independence, economic development, or national security concerns but we must ensure that these decisions are made with the considerations of our Indigenous peoples. To our local law enforcement, I hope that we can work together to heal our relationship as we all work to protect the lives and safety of our people. I recognize the extreme stress that the situation caused and look forward to a future that reflects more mutual understanding and respect. Again, we are deeply appreciative that the Obama Administration took the time and effort to genuinely consider the broad spectrum of tribal concerns. However, it was becoming increasingly clear he was punting this issue down the road. Roads, bridges, transmission lines, pipelines, wind farms and water lines will be very difficult, if not impossible, to build when criminal behavior is rewarded this way. In my conversation with Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy today, she was unable to give any legal reasons for the decision and could not answer any questions about rerouting the pipeline. I feel badly for the Corps of Engineers because of the diligent work it did on this project, only to have their Commander-in-Chief throw them under the bus. The pipeline still remains in limbo. The incoming administration already stated its support for the project and the courts have already stated twice that it appeared the Corps followed the required process in considering the permit. For the next month and a half, nothing about this project will change. For the immediate future, the safety of residents, protesters, law enforcement, and workers remains my top priority as it should for everyone involved. Additionally, our federal delegation and governor have been working together in a bipartisan effort to push for more federal resources for law enforcement who have worked day and night through weekends and holidays to support the safety of our communities. It does nothing to resolve the issue, and worst of all it prolongs the serious problems faced by North Dakota law enforcement as they try to maintain public safety. Instead, it passes the decision off to the next administration, which has already indicated it will approve the easement, and in the meantime perpetuates a difficult situation for North Dakotans. By staying on the site, the protesters subject residents in the area to additional weeks of disruption and hardship. That will make our nation vulnerable and less secure."],

      "Sentences":["But the electoral trends that put Donald J. Trump within striking distance of victory were clear long before Mr. Comey sent his letter. They were clear before WikiLeaks published hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee. They were even clear back in early July, before Mr. Comey excoriated Mrs. Clinton for using a private email server. It was clear from the start that Mrs. Clinton was struggling to reassemble the Obama coalition. In 2016, the Obama coalition crumbled and so did the Midwestern Firewall. The Obama Coalition Falters The countryside of Iowa or the industrial belt along Lake Erie is not the sort of place that people envision when they think of the Obama coalition. Yet it was an important component of his victory. He would have won even if the electorate had been as old and as white as it had been in 2004. Largely overlooked, his key support often came in the places where you would least expect it. He did better than John Kerry and Al Gore among white voters across the Northern United States, despite exit poll results to the contrary. He excelled in a nearly continuous swath from the Pacific Coast of Oregon and Washington to the Red River Valley in Minnesota, along the Great Lakes to the coast of Maine. In these places, Mr. Obama often ran as strong or stronger than any Democrat in history. In 2016, Mr. Trump made huge gains among white working-class voters. It was often in the places where Democrats had seemed resilient or even strong, like Scranton, Pa., and eastern Iowa. Image It was a decisive break from recent trends. White voters without college degrees, for the first time, deviated from the national trend and swung decidedly toward the Republicans. No bastion of white, working-class Democratic strength was immune to the trend. She was thought to be fairly strong among the older white working-class voters who were skeptical of Mr. Obama from the start. His gains among younger working-class whites were especially important in the Upper Midwest. Young white working-class voters represent a larger share of the vote there than anywhere else in the country. The Clinton team knew what was wrong from the start, according to a Clinton campaign staffer and other Democrats. The campaign looked back to respondents who were contacted in 2012, and found a large number of white working-class voters who had backed Mr. Obama were now supporting Mr. Trump. The same story was obvious in public polls of registered voters. Most of this data is only beginning to become available. The same appears to be true in Florida. Nationally, there is no relationship between the decline in Democratic strength and the change in turnout. Mr. Trump made gains in white working-class areas, whether turnout surged or dropped. The exit polls also show all of the signs that Mr. Trump was winning over Obama voters. It strongly suggests that Mr. Trump won over large numbers of white, working-class voters who supported Mr. Obama four years earlier. The Obama-Trump Vote The notion that Mr. Trump could win over so many people who voted for Mr. Obama and who still approved of his performance is hard to understand for people with ideologically consistent views on a traditional liberal-conservative spectrum. But the two had the same winning pitch to white working-class voters. Mr. Obama and his campaign team portrayed Mr. Romney as a plutocrat who dismantled companies and outsourced jobs. The implication was that he would leave middle-class jobs prey to globalization and corporations. There was one place where Mr. Romney was able to effectively argue that he could protect the industrial economy and the people who worked in it: coal country. There he made big gains after the Obama administration pushed climate-change policies that would reduce the production and use of coal. In retrospect, the scale of the Democratic collapse in coal country was a harbinger of just how far the Democrats would fall in their old strongholds once they forfeited the mantle of working-class interests. She, too, would leave workers vulnerable to the forces of globalization and big business, he said. The various allegations against Mrs. It was a far more appealing message than old Republican messages about abortion, same-sex marriage and the social safety net. There was no relationship between the change in Democratic support and the change in turnout, or the change in turnout and Democratic strength. But the Democrats did have a turnout problem in November. It was a black turnout problem. The conclusive data is available in the Southern states where voters indicate their race on their voter registration forms, and they point toward a considerable decline in black turnout. In Georgia, the black share of the electorate fell to 27.6 percent from 29.9 percent, and in Louisiana it fell to 28.5 percent from 30.1 percent, according to the completed state turnout data. In all of these states, the black share of the electorate is still poised to be higher than it was in 2004. Young black voters appear to be a key driver of the decline. They registered at a lower rate than they did ahead of the 2012 and 2008 presidential elections, causing the black share of registered voters to dip. And those who were registered turned out at a far lower rate than black registrants did four years ago. The data is not so authoritative elsewhere in the country, but it tells a similar story. Turnout dropped by 8 percent in the majority black wards of Philadelphia, while rising everywhere else in the city. The turnout in Detroit fell by 14 percent. Turnout fell in other industrial centers with a large black population, like Milwaukee and Flint, Mich. It should be noted that the decline in black turnout appears very consistent across the country, regardless of whether states put in new laws that might reduce turnout, like those cutting early voting or requiring a photo ID. It seems so. If black turnout had matched 2012 levels, Mrs. Clinton would have almost certainly scratched out wins in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Florida and North Carolina would have been extremely close. Mr. Obama would have easily won both his elections with this level of black turnout and support. These demographic shifts have benefited Democrats over the last decade, but most of these gains have come in noncompetitive states. This year, the exit polls again exaggerated the importance of well-educated and Hispanic voters. But the preliminary Upshot analysis of voting returns, census and pre-election polling data suggests that Mrs. Clinton was stronger among well-educated white and nonwhite voters than the exit polls imply. It is important to emphasize that these estimates are preliminary. They will change over the next few years with more data from the Census Bureau and additional polling. The Upshot estimates suggest that Mrs. Clinton really might have become the first Democrat to win white voters with a college degree (although it is very possible that Mr. Obama did so in 2008 as well). There was a similar pattern by income. These gains helped her win huge margins in the most well-educated and prosperous liberal bastions of the new economy, like Manhattan, Silicon Valley, Washington, Seattle, Chicago and Boston. There, Mrs. Clinton ran up huge margins in traditionally liberal enclaves and stamped out nearly every last wealthy precinct that supported the Republicans. You could drive a full 30 miles through the leafy suburbs northwest of Boston before reaching a town where Mr. Trump hit 20 percent of the vote. Every old-money Republican enclave of western Connecticut, like Darien and Greenwich, voted for Mrs. Clinton, in some cases swinging 30 points in her direction. Every precinct of Winnetka and Glencoe, Ill., went to Mrs. Clinton as well. Her gains were nearly as impressive in affluent Republican suburbs, like those edging west of Kansas City, Mo., and Houston; north of Atlanta, Dallas and Columbus, Ohio; or south of Charlotte, N.C., and Los Angeles in Orange County. A similar divide may have helped obscure whether Mrs. Clinton improved among Hispanic voters, a question addressed in depth by Harry Enten at FiveThirtyEight. The pre-election polls generally showed Mrs. Clinton poised to make good on that possibility. Our estimates suggest that Mrs. Clinton did about the same as Mr. Obama among Hispanic voters over all. The estimates hint at a potential explanation for the results in some heavily Hispanic areas: Mrs. Clinton may have faltered among Hispanic voters without a high school degree, while making gains among those with some college education or better. She won the popular vote. But it did not do nearly enough good in the decisive battleground states. The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

This because he resisted assimilation and the theft of the Black Hills. For those who arent aware this was one of the causes of colonial violence that caused the Dakota conflict to happen. The process of genocide associated with the redskins slur aside from (hunting for Native scalps) and mocking deaths of wounded knee victims, as well as execution of Natives such as the case with Dakota 38, also included starving Natives to death. In sources I posted red devils and redskins are used in the same context, therefore sharing the same Negative connotations. If you claim you want to honor Natives, start by treating us as people. That means acknowledging chiefs by names and not associating them with racial slurs that were used to dehumanize and undermine their efforts to defend land and traditional culture.

The Water Protectors are leading the way against this same evil which we must all face globally, saving ourselves and our children from the apocalyptic outcome of climate change. Standing Rock people are Sitting Bull people and the strength of their backbone, not hate as old grumbling republican white men like to portray, is being demonstrated to change the course of world fossil fuel use in the era of climate change and where our fundamental western water courses are at risk, despite devious silver-spooned and greedy advocates like Kochs and Trump. yuk The ferocity of North Dakota winters has made these people survivors of spirit despite the government policy of genocide employed against them. Trump ignores these realities in favor of spreading the Assad-Iran-Russia narrative about the war in Syria: The only forces in the country are the Syrian government and radicals, so the rest of the world must stop condemning Assad for his crimes and instead support him.

We currently have over 2,100 Veterans on the roster. Our goal now is to prioritize this list to Veterans and Civilian personnel involved with operations, planning & onsite execution. next mission could be as early as the 2nd week of December. More to come The funds we raise on this page will go towards providing transportation and supplies for the brave patriots that come and stand with us. We have full support of the Sioux tribe elders and will be cooperating with them every step of the way. Several had to be treated for hypothermia and one protestor who was hit directly with a grenade has reportedly had her arm amputated as a result.

It's time to display that honor, courage, and commitment we claim to represent. It's time for real Patriots. In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community. We are launching this second GoFundMe to create a Standing Rock Fund to address the ongoing needs at Standing Rock and our partners in camp. Please take moment to check out our new campaign and share with your networks. We are formulating organizational structure under a 501c4. This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement.

A protest camp, set up over fears the pipeline will poison water and destroy cultural heritage, has been the scene of repeated clashes between protesters and Energy Transfer Partners security staff. A court challenge has allowed the project to go ahead but the federal government, which initially approved the project, is now reassessing its decision following an outcry by tribes and has placed a temporary halt to construction on federal land. He vowed that Energy Transfer Partners will press ahead with the project. Warren has been an enthusiastic backer of Republican politicians, contributing the maximum allowable amount to the campaigns of the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and Fred Upson, chairman of the energy and commerce committee. Dakota Access has sparked the most vociferous protests, however, with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe escalating its grievances to the UN and, most recently, the US justice department. On Tuesday, the tribe requested that the US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, investigate alleged strip searches, dog attacks and pepper-spraying by police and security personnel against Native American protesters.

The Army Corps of Engineers declined to grant the permit needed to finish the Dakota Access Pipeline earlier this month, but the decision has left many activists unconvinced the fight is over. Young Peoples Action Coalition, which was co-founded by Northfield local Cliff Martin in an effort to organize high school students around various causes, presented its case at Northfield High School Tuesday and took a group of students through what they called dangers of pipelines. The tribe argues it was not adequately consulted in the historical surveying process. Chase Ingraham, a ninth-grader at Arcadia Charter School, told the group about the militarization of police forces he saw during his three trips to Standing Rock. After helping set up one camp, he told the group of how he gained respect and admiration for the conditions Native Americans lived in, enduring years of maltreatment by the federal government. Some who attended had not heard the details of the controversy surrounding the pipeline, like 10th-grader Diana Montero. Martin ended the presentation with ways they could help, though traveling to to Standing Rock was not one of them due to current temperatures and potentially being a burden to those there. Wells Fargo and Bank of America are two of the banks investing in the pipeline and are now facing added scrutiny. The coalition also has connections with Arcadia Charter School and more than 10 other high schools around the Twin Cities metro, made while attending protests. Martin said that organizers tend not to invest in high school students, perhaps assuming apathy. The group at NHS, which might join with other high school students, is planning to drop banners in some of the banks investing in the pipeline in the next couple days while the coalition continues to keep the conversation going.

Al Franken urged the Department of Justice to take action to protect the safety and First Amendment rights of Dakota Access Pipeline protestors following reports that law enforcement used water cannons for crowd control in sub-freezing temperatures. In a letter sent today to the Department of Justice (DOJ), Sen. Franken said that he is extremely concerned after hearing reports of dangerous clashes between police and individuals protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline project near Cannon Ball, ND, and said the use of water cannons for crowd control in sub-freezing temperatures is excessive, unnecessary, and extremely dangerous. These tactics against protestors exercising their Constitutional rights threaten to add another layer of trauma to these communities. You can read the full text of today's letter by clicking here or reading below. November 21, 2016 The Honorable Loretta Lynch Attorney General United States Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, DC 20530 Dear Attorney General Lynch, I am extremely concerned after hearing reports of dangerous clashes between police and protestors of the Dakota Access Pipeline project near Cannon Ball, ND. The reported use of water cannons for crowd control in sub-freezing temperatures is excessive and unnecessary, and I urge you to take action to protect the First Amendment rights of protestors, and the physical safety of all involved parties. Video of the incident appears to show that the water cannons were not simply being used for fire control, or even crowd control, but were often directed at small crowds or even individual protestors. Combined with the onset of wintry weather, water cannons are extremely dangerous and potentially lethal weapons, and I urge you to investigate their use on protestors. On November 14, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that additional analysis of the Dakota Access Pipeline project is necessary and invited the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to engage due to potential impact of a pipeline leak on the Tribe's drinking water supply. In the interim, the Army Corps has made clear that pipeline construction under Lake Oahe - where the Tribe gets its drinking water- cannot occur without a federal easement. Native American populations have struggled for decades under the complex burden of historical trauma, and I have witnessed and admired how these communities have turned to their cultural foundations to build strength against that burden. These tactics against protestors exercising their Constitutional rights threaten to add another layer of trauma to these communities. I urge you to do everything in your power to prevent further escalation of violence. Thank you for your attention to this matter. -- Brenda, Censored News. Al Franken may turn out okay. It can only mean that Obama's role in the Dakota Access Pipeline is far greater than any of us even imagined. -- Brenda, Censored News.

In that day, there will be those among the Lakota who will carry knowledge and understanding of unity among all living things and the young white ones will come to those of my people and ask for this wisdom. I salute the light within your eyes where the whole Universe dwells. Thank you for offering material help and laying your bodies on the line. I am proud that you are defending our nation's water and helping stop the depredation of First Nations land. I wish I could have given more. Thank you for yet another sacrifice you are doing for the American people. Please sign the petition to President Obama. Petition The Dakota Access pipeline poses a catastrophic threat to Native American sacred lands and to the critical water source for more than 17 million Americans down stream of the Missouri River crossing. We know that President Elect Trump has a serious conflict of interest by owning large investments in DAPL and other fossil fuel assets; and his energy team includes Harold Hamm, billionaire founder of Continental Resources oil company, and someone Mr. Trump might name as his Secretary of Energy. Mr. Trump and the Koch brothers said they support extractive exploitation of public lands and National Parks. After suffering centuries of persecution and exploitation, Native Americans deserve justice. This land belonged to the Standing Rock Sioux Nation Rez before it was taken back. President Elect Trump has stated he will quickly approve the Dakota Access pipeline and also reverse President Obama's decision to deny approval of Keystone XL pipeline. We have an enormous glut of oil reserves at Cushing, Oklahoma. The clear purpose of Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines is not to make America energy independent but to reap enormous profits for greedy oil interests exporting oil to China. We must protect our environment and our oil resources. This outdated fossil fuel infrastructure is not needed and railroads serving the Bakkan North Dakota oil fields have invested heavily in improved railroad oil tank car safety and have stated that they have more than enough railroad capacity to transport the Bakkan oil. They will also be able to permanently rehire thousands of laid off North Dakota railroad workers.

For more than three years now, Dakota Access Pipeline has done nothing but play by the rules. The Army Corps of Engineers agrees, and has said so publicly and in federal court filings. In spite of consistently stating at every turn that the permit for the crossing of the Missouri River at Lake Oahe granted in July 2016, comported with all legal requirements, including the use of an environmental assessment, rather than an environmental impact statement, the Army Corps now seeks to engage in additional review and analysis of alternative locations for the pipeline. As stated all along, ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe. Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way.

Cable 24 hours a day and Apple TV too. However, under EPA's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) authority we provided comments in January and March of 2016 to the Army Corps of Engineers regarding its draft environmental assessment for the Dakota Access Pipeline. Without saying more on the matter, the spokesperson directed us to the agency's comments on the Army Corps of Engineer's first environmental impact statement. The agency spokesperson also noted the Corps chose not to hold a public comment period before posting its final review, as the EPA encouraged it to do. Today, after months of protests, the remaining portion of the Dakota Access pipeline was greenlit by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps approved an easement, or building permit, to finish the 1,170-mile-long pipeline, which will tunnel under Lake Oahe in North Dakota, according to a court filing. The crude oil conduit has been opposed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe for more than a year now. Fearing that the pipeline would contaminate their drinking supply and damage sacred cultural sites, indigenous water protectors have attempted to halt the project, which is owned by Energy Transfer Partners. Last month, the fate of the Dakota Access pipeline was ambiguous when President Trump issued his federal hiring freeze. As we reported, the Army Corps of Engineers was not exempted from the mandate as a defense agency. This meant that staffing issues could have caused it to delay the project. After the Obama administration said it would not allow the Dakota Access pipeline to be permitted, the Corps agreed to conduct another study and offer the chance for public input. The subtext of this command was clear: fast-track the pipeline at any cost. In this case, the cost could very well be human health and environmental integrity. I asked the Army Corps of Engineers to confirm that it had, indeed, bypassed the second environmental impact statement. A spokesperson for the agency sent the following response: The Department of the Army announced today that it has completed a presidential-directed review of the remaining easement request for the Dakota Access pipeline, and has notified Congress that it intends to grant an easement for a right-of-way across government land at Lake Oahe Dam and Reservoir, North Dakota. Mr. Robert Speer, Acting Secretary of the Army, announced the decision. Speer said the decision was made based on a sufficient amount of information already available which supported approval to grant the easement request and as a result, made the choice to terminate the notice of intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement. The current proposed pipeline route would cross Lake Oahe, an Army Corps of Engineers project on the Missouri River. I've also reached out to the Environmental Protection Agency, which would have reviewed the pipeline's impact statement, but have not received a response.

A status conference is scheduled for next week. The pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) announced earlier this month that it started shipping oil to customers. ETP maintains that the 1,200-mile pipeline is safe, but the Standing Rock Cheyenne River, Yankton and Oglala Sioux tribes in the Dakotas fear environmental harm. A spokeswoman for the US Department of Justice, Nicole Navas Oxman, said the department was reviewing the ruling.

      "Sentences":["Today there are over 500 Native American tribes in the United States, each with a distinct culture, way of life and history. Even today, Native Americans face large challenges to cope with the disadvantages history has left them and ongoing cases of discrimination. These people would come to be called Native Americans, numbering over 50 million, and settling from the top of North America to the bottom of South America. By the time Christopher Columbus reached the Caribbean in 1492, historians estimate that there were 10 million indigenous peoples living in U.S. territory. But by 1900, the number had reduced to less than 300,000. Disease was a major killer, followed by malnutrition. Colonists in search of gold staged violent ambushes on tribal villages, fueling animosity with Natives. Several wars broke out between tribes and American settlers which led to large death tolls, land dispossession, oppression and blatant racism. Native Americans gained uniform voting rights in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Determined to find a direct route from Europe to Asia, Christopher Columbus stumbled on the Americas in 1492. Ultimately, while Columbus is remembered as a daring adventurer, he was also a perpetrator of atrocities and his legacy is viewed as the starting point that sparked hundreds of years of exploration and exploitation of the Americas. Unlike the Europeans and Asians, whose lifestyle had a long history of sharing close quarters with domesticated animals, Native Americans were not immune to pathogens spread by domesticated cows, pigs, sheep, goats, and horses. As a result, millions were killed by measles, influenza, whooping cough, diphtheria, typhus, bubonic plague, cholera, scarlet fever and syphilis. Spreading disease was not always intentional on the part of the colonists. In 1763, a particularly serious uprising threatened British garrisons in Pennsylvania. Consequently, settlers spread smallpox to the Native Americans by distributing blankets previously owned by contagious patients. U.S. History of Atrocities After the American Revolution, many Native American lives were already lost to disease and displacement. Between 1830 and 1838, federal officials working on behalf of white cotton growers forced nearly 100,000 Indians out of their homeland. As the United States expanded westward, violent conflicts over territory multiplied. In particular, the 1848 California gold rush caused 300,000 people to migrate to San Francisco from the East Coast and South America. Historians believe that California was once the most densely and diversely populated area for Native Americans in U.S. territory; however, the gold rush had massive implications for Native American livelihoods. Toxic chemicals and gravel ruined traditional Native hunting and agricultural practices, resulting in starvation for many Natives. Further, in 1850, the California state government passed the Act for the Government and Protection of Indians that addressed the punishment and protection of Native Americans, and helped to facilitate the removal of their culture and land. It also legalized slavery and was referenced for the buying and selling of Native children. In the process of arresting Sitting Bull, federal officials actually ended up killing him, causing a massive rebellion that led to the deaths of over 150 Natives in Pine Ridge. At the turn of century, the Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. federal government has the right to overturn all Cherokee laws in the precedent-setting decision Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock. The report went on to influence policy initiatives which improved healthcare, education, and land rights for Native Americans. This was a step forward for the protection of a minority who was still without voting rights. In 1978, Congress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act which protects Native American children and the custody of their parents. Controversy has surrounded cases where state officials forcibly removed children from Native American families. In Maine, the Maine Truth and Reconciliation Committee, for example, seeks to uncover and acknowledge the truth about what happened to Wabanaki children and families involved with the Maine child welfare system. These forcible removals are still happening today. South Dakota continues to remove children at a rate higher than the vast majority of other states in the country. Conclusion For hundreds of years a mixture of colonial conflict, disease, specific atrocities and policies of discrimination has devastated the Native American population. In the course of this time, it is estimated that over nine million Natives died from violent conflict or disease. For too long this history has been under-recognized and too little discussed.

Not if you allow this the be the United States. Please donate and pass this page along to your friends, family, coworkers and community members. It's time to display that honor, courage, and commitment we claim to represent. It's time for real Patriots. In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community. We are launching this second GoFundMe to create a Standing Rock Fund to address the ongoing needs at Standing Rock and our partners in camp. Please take moment to check out our new campaign and share with your networks. We are formulating organizational structure under a 501c4. This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement. This has been a life-changing experience for everybody involved and we plan to keep fighting for you as long as we have to. Please try again. I have 5 more seats in my Grand Caravan.

      "Sentences":["Jan 26, 2017 Why Standing Rock is Fundamental for the Resistance. That this was one of his very first acts as president of the United States is no coincidence. Donald Trump and his team recognize the symbolic significance at stake in Standing Rock. This photo essay is a call for us all to understand why the resistance to the pipeline in Standing Rock is more crucial than ever. It is bigger than one site or one community because its here where the ideologies being aggressively pushed by Republican leaders clearly converge. Energy Transfer Partners, the corporation behind the pipeline, suggests the project will lead to greater economic development and increased efficiency compared to the railroads that currently transport the crude oil. As the protests swelled, water protectors were attacked by heavily armed police from Morton County. Yet, as the repression grew, the people stood resilient and the symbolic power of the struggle continued to grow. At this point we felt we had to go. We needed to support this movement and work to spread its message and report on what was happening on the ground. We were told by friends and fellow supporters to drive up through the south as opposed to the main road through Bismarck. Instead, we went in through Aberdeen, a couple of miles south of the camp. Hundreds of flags representing nations and movements adorned the makeshift road that led us in. We arrived at the beautiful, bitterly cold reservation only days before the announced eviction date. Beyond the Sioux nation and numerous other tribes represented at the camp, supporters continued to pour in from every corner of the country, and the world. We immediately heard the helicopters circling the camp throughout the day, in attempts to intimidate the protestors. The Indigenous Environmental Network handled the film permits. In trying to assure that our time there was as productive as possible, we had been communicating with them about coming to produce a piece. Clearly, we were not the only ones. The Sioux opened each day with prayer and while everyone in the camp was invited, absolutely no cameras were allowed. The kitchens served free meals to anyone who needed it. Folks were busy securing tents and windshields. Organizers kept track and registered newcomers. We spent our days filming, helping out in whatever way we could, and trying to stay warm. The conditions were already harsh when we arrived and it only got colder. Yet, people kept arriving. At least one thousand veterans arrived the day after we did (we heard that in total there were well over two thousand veterans in Standing Rock), committed to supporting and shielding the water protectors. As we reflected on what moved them to make the trip in the first place, it became clear that, like us, they were moved by a formidable sense of justice, an unshakable feeling that we were standing on the right side of history. In 2010, a single pipeline spill poured one million gallons of toxic bitumen crude oil into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. And in January of 2015, more than 50,000 gallons of Bakken crude oil spilled into the Yellowstone River in Montana. It was the second such spill in that area since 2011. When Michigan Governor Snyder took office in 2011, he rapidly pushed a multi-billion dollar tax break for corporations through the Republican legislature. Less tax revenues, translated into cutting costs in pensions, education, and infrastructure. He invoked executive privilege to take over cities by replacing the elected mayors and city councils with his own appointees. Cut services to save money. A largely black and brown community now faces the disproportionate effects of systemic neglect. Few question that the crisis would have been handled differently if it happened in a white suburb outside of Detroit. We were not the first to discern the clear parallels between what is happening at Standing Rock and Flint, Michigan. The mobilization of thousands of veterans from the armed forces speaks volumes. Their declaration as protectors against enemies foreign and domestic reflects a clear indignation with a system many of them have risked their lives to protect, but which now seems to serve the interests of a select group. And as the day of the eviction approached it was these veterans who offered to serve as human shields for the protectors back in Standing Rock. We felt the tension and unease. Then, unexpectedly, the Obama Administration intervened and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers legally blocked the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, denying it the required easement to drill beneath the Missouri River. There were tears of joy and sighs of relief, but the native leaders knew that this was only the beginning. And, of course, they were right. Today, Donald Trump signed executive actions to advance approval of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines. But just as Standing Rock has come to symbolize a greater struggle, so has the Trump presidency come to symbolize something much greater. On the one hand, a Trump presidency signifies an emboldened resurgence of the more outright champions of white supremacist ideology, which has given rise to an increase in racist attacks, and could result in virulent anti-immigrant, xenophobic legislation as well as a critical backtrack to the gains of the civil rights movement and the rights of Indigenous Nations. On the other hand, the Trump presidency appears set to secure, cement and bulletproof the continued privilege and dominance of the super-wealthy minority. One look at his cabinet and this becomes painfully clear. Standing Rock stands out to us because it confronts the ideologies so clearly represented by Trump and his cronies: white supremacy and wealth domination. And although folks will cringe at hearing this, these two ideologies lie deep within the building blocks of this country. Sadly, it takes the Standing Rocks, the Flints, and Fergusons of the country to unveil them. It is clear that the Trump administration will continue to support the DAPL while investors wait to see how long it takes him to reverse the decision. The Sioux hope that the battle over the environmental impact assessment will stall the pipeline long enough that investors will pull out of the deal. If not, they have made it clear they are ready to continue fighting to protect their rights, their land, and their water. We hope the rest of us are too. At Human Pictures we thus recognize and celebrate Standing Rock as not only a catalyst of a new environmental movement that is supportive of indigenous peoples, but as a symbol of numerous ongoing struggles across the world that reject profit as the driver of history and which present different models that allow us to move forward driven by principles of justice, dignity and harmony with our planet. In our efforts, we will continue to highlight connections across these movements and shed light on the struggles where we can all gather strength in the years to come.

Westword sat down with her to get her perspective on the NoDAPL movement, renewable energy, and the future of life on Earth. It was not only 300 tribal nations; it was the Sami from Norway and Sweden, the Mongolians from China and Russia, Aboriginals from Australia, many African nations, aboriginals from India, the Maori from New Zealand. But as far as American history goes, this was the largest tribal gathering ever. This is the first time we stood among our enemies as allies. And then when everybody came in, when we went up to 15,000 people and you came over the hill and you saw all the teepees, the Chippewa lodges, it was overwhelming. I remember the first time I came over the hill and I saw all the people, I pulled off to the side of the road and cried because it was so like a dream. And as you drove into the camp, no matter where you went, you could hear people singing, and each in their own language. You could hear prayer ceremonies going on. You could hear hip-hop music. You could hear country-Western. Everyone who came and stood that ground became family with each other. This is their home now. Prophecy. I always talk about this woman from South Carolina. I asked. Law enforcement and private security forces used dogs, rubber bullets, beanbag rounds, percussion grenades, batons, tear gas, pepper spray and fire hoses in subzero temperatures against protesters. We scared them. It was the first time that I could imagine that our police department was no longer there to protect the people but was there to protect the corporation. They just have to remind themselves. Despite the efforts of thousands of water protectors and support from millions of people around the world, the Dakota Access Pipeline will be built. Depends on what the results are. They have done four tests; all four have sprung a leak, including this morning. We told them it was going to happen. The steel is substandard. Production of crude oil in North Dakota and in the U.S. peaked in 2014. Three-fourths have been shut down, and that is a tremendous amount of oil that is not flowing. We are not doing pipeline by pipeline. We are doing a unified front everywhere. So right now we have Sacred Stone people in Texas, Louisiana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Utah, Oregon, Washington and California.

      "Sentences":["January 2017 Spartacist League: Land Surveyor Socialists Native Americans march at Oceti Sakowin camp north of Standing Rock Reservation, 9 September 2016, to protest Dakota Access Pipeline. According to DAPL owners and the Spartacist League, this is not Indian land. On the other hand, the centrist Spartacist League (SL), in a knee-jerk reaction to the environmentalists, ends up echoing the line of some of the most retrograde, chauvinist sectors of the bourgeoisie. They entirely disappear the blatant environmental racism, and argue that the native people have no legal right to control what happens on the pipeline route. Certainly pipelines in themselves are not inherently bad or good, but this is a subterfuge in order to refuse to oppose the DAPL route at Standing Rock. As Marxists, we defend the oppressed native peoples against this racist capitalist attack. Contrary to the straw-man argument of the SL, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is specifically opposing pipeline river crossing next to their reservation (as one can readily verify from its court suit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and various tribal statements). So say Energy Transfer Partners and the Spartacist League. But the land north of the reservation was stolen from the Standing Rock Sioux. The SL agrees. Pipelines are indeed safer than rail transport of oil, but even so there were 1,739 significant pipeline incidents from 2010 to 2015. In fact, Sunoco Logistics, which is slated to operate the DAPL, has the worst spill record of any company in the U.S., with 200 incidents since 2010. Will Indian families be removed, as the government has done with other victims of environmental disasters, like at Love Canal in Niagara Falls, New York in the 1970s. Map by Carl Sack, cartographer at the University of Wisconsin, showing the lands crossed by the Dakota Access Pipeline which were guaranteed to the Sioux in the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty and then removed in the 1868 treaty. The area between the Cannonball River and Cedar Creek is sparsely populated, inhabited only by a few hundred people (2 per square mile). Then there are the treaties. The Spartacist line reflects the mentality of land surveyors for the bourgeoisie. As a point of reference, if the SL has difficulty visualizing it, that is less than the distance between Washington Square and Union Square in Lower Manhattan. Because the crossing point is half a mile north of the present boundary of the Standing Rock Reservation, it concludes (and the SL land surveyors concur) that the tribe has no legal right to block it. Note existing natural gas pipeline in the same location (shown by solid blue line), thus potentially increasing environmental risk in case of an explosion. Click on map to enlarge. (Map source: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) The potential for a serious environmental incident at this point is dismissed with a wave of the hand by these lawyers and unlicensed surveyors. Consider that a natural gas pipeline (the Northern Border line) and an overhead high-tension power line cross Lake Oahe at precisely the same point. When the pipeline was slated to cross the Missouri ten miles north of the state capital, Bismarck, concerns about possible water contamination got the route changed. But it has had consequences. So with tens of thousands of Syrian refugees being held in inhuman conditions in internment camps, the ICL raises these specious arguments to refuse to demand they be let in.

'script', 'twitter-wjs'); Jun 15, 2017 The Standing Rock tribe and its supporters protested the construction of the pipeline near the tribe's land and under its water supply at a lake it considers sacred. Boasberg did not immediately rule on whether the flow of oil, which started through the pipeline on June 1, should be stopped. The pipeline's construction spurred months of protests and dozens of arrests over its location near the Standing Rock Reservation and particularly its crossing under the Missouri River at Lake Oahe, the tribe's water supply and an area it considers sacred. The tribe filed suit in July 2016 after the Corps concluded that a cursory environmental assessment of the pipeline project was sufficient and released a finding of no significant impact. The EPA said the Corps' assessment did not sufficiently consider the impacts on water resources, and the Corps later agreed to that more in-depth review. In one of his first acts as president, Donald Trump issued a presidential memorandum directing the Corps to expedite the pipeline's approval. But Boasberg said the Corps was looking only at the project's construction, not the potential for a spill. Furthermore, the treatment fell short of the Corps' duty to determine whether the project would have a disproportionate impact on minority and low-income populations, as the agency is required to do by law. Boasberg cited Council on Environmental Quality guidance on environmental justice, and case law under the National Environmental Policy Act. Losing the ability to do so could seriously and disproportionately harm those individuals relative to those in nearby nontribal communities. The pipeline's builder, Dakota Access LLC, part of Energy Transfer Partners, has already faced leaks along the pipeline. Trump has repeatedly cited the Dakota Access project start as proof of his administration's progress on lifting government restrictions on development. And I took none. Actually, none.

The demonstration took place beginning at 4:20 p.m. outside of TD Bank on Chapel Street downtown. As several people streamed onto Chapel with homemade signs, they made way for a sort of human contraption: four protesters, accented with pink heart-shaped signs, who had chained themselves together. joked Tuhus, who remained relatively mum as a customer then opened the door on her back, stepping over her arm-pipe to get back onto the street. On the other side of Chapel Street, police had begun to gather, watching the protesters from the New Haven Green and the corner of College and Chapel streets. They crossed the street and looked on from the intersection of College and Chapel closest to the bank, waiting to see if the protesters would get up. Another held out his phone, as if taking a photo or video. An officer approached the door and removed the chain, allowing the protesters to stay until further notice. As police spoke to each other, members of the group explained that they hoped to accomplish two goals: to get the bank to divest from the pipeline, and to encourage current customers to join credit unions if it refuses to do so. As they chanted and spoke, an officer stopped the flow of traffic on College Street and got use a microphone to offer three warnings to protesters in English and Spanish. Move, he said, or get arrested. A police van had by then moved onto College Street, its doors opened. The four did not move. As an officer issued the third warning, protesters began shouting over them, several lifting flags representing Native American tribes as they chanted. One, Edgar Sandoval, moved in closer to the protesters as if to protect them. He eyed officers who were preparing to move in. A final warning was issued. Ushering free-standing protesters away, the officers moved the four to the College Street side of the bank, where they placed them on the ground and began to ask for identification. Lt. Herb Sharp, the top patrol supervisor at the New Haven police department, directed the operation, turning a flurry of activity into an orderly police ballet. While four officers collected information from the group, a cadre of others formed a semi-circle around them, ordering reporters to stay at a distance. The bulk of protesters outside of the bank continued to chant, lining the sidewalk as a few tried to glimpse at the cohort that had been arrested. McEvoy motioned to Attorney Patricia Kane, whom Sharp let though. Back with the four protesters, police maintained their semi-circle as Sharp spoke quietly to each of them about options, arrests, potential charges. Sharp charged the quartet with disorderly conduct and interfering with an officer, both misdemeanors. After 20 minutes and a court summons, the four were free to go. Meanwhile, other protesters remained at the bank until close to 6 p.m. Police kept a block of Chapel Street closed across from the Green, forcing CT Transit buses to alter their route in jammed rush-hour traffic. Revived Project The Dakota Access Pipeline is an underground oil pipeline backed by Dakota Access, LLC that will run, if completed, from North Dakota to southern Illinois. That path includes stretches beneath the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, as well as clean water sources and burial grounds around the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. For a map of conflicts across its 1,172 miles, click here. The company building the pipeline says that it is thoroughly monitored and shipping crude underground is far safer than doing so by rail, trucks, or in ships. Protesters and environmentalists have disagreed, citing concerns of contaminated drinking water and disrupting historic burial grounds. New Haveners became involved in protests months later, in mid-October of last year. By then, protests had erupted on the national level to put pressure on the outgoing Obama administration to stop construction of the pipeline. That ended temporarily on Dec. 4 of last year, the outgoing Obama administration announced that it would not grant the final easement to the pipeline. Then in late January, just four days after his inauguration, President Donald Trump reinstated construction of both the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, adding a directive to halt environmental reviews that the Obama administration had ordered. On Monday Feb. 13, a judge backed that directive, ruling against Native American tribes. Post a Comment Commenting has closed for this entry Comments posted by: WestHavenBIcyclist on February 14, 2017 10:54pm My wife and i were in town and visited the protest. Glad to see intentional civil disobedience happening, and encouraged to see the correct and measured response from police. This is what should have happened the other week. Civil Disobedience And under a corporate corrupt government that allows the destruction of our water, resources, and Native rights, the correct place to be for just citizens is in the streets and willing to symbolically break laws. That is the right approach. This is first amendment in action. Our family grew too uncomfortable with the actions of corporate banks, and left Bank of America for Sikorsky Credit Union. I hope the protesters took TD Bank customers out of their comfort zone a little and raised awareness of how we vote with our banking dollars. There was certainly nothing threatening or aggressive about the protest. And I thank the protesters for their work and their voice. You are teaching our children how to stand up for what is right. This is a long term investment in creating a culture that cares for creation. Your work has meaning at our family dinner table. Bless you. Otherwise, it is a gross waste of human effort. While the arrest was first class, the protesters were not. We enjoy freedom of speech in this country but it is bastardized and denigrated by these actions. The lawyer is there, the press is there, all to feed the publicity hounds demonstrating for their cause. We taxpayers, pay for the disruption to society by self serving people hawing a cause. The amount of money spent diverting police resources, interrupting bank business, delay of time to bank customers, and rerouting of traffic should be estimated. These people should be required to pay that amount of money along with court costs. They have the right to protest, but they should be required to pay for it. Sooner of later they are going to run afoul of a person having a bad day and someone is going to get hurt. There are a lot of people with personal problems and short tempers. Playing footsies with the New Haven Police is an entirely different thing that chaining a civilian who may have a short temper and a gun in a bank. It is not a question of if, just when it will happen. posted by: jim1 on February 15, 2017 8:38am Nice article, nice people, and Wendy was there passing out gloves and hats. The fight to protect our environment continues and so will these NV protests. We expect many more to join us as spring approaches. Downtown traffic was a mess for over an hour Chapel St. wesbound was blocked off at both Church St. and Temple St. , and College St. was blocked off southbound towards Chapel St making it a traffic nightmare. They should have been put in the cell block and let them wait their turn at being processed, just like every other law breaker, instead of giving them a quick summons. Enough is enough stop pandering these people. posted by: Hamdenresident on February 15, 2017 9:24am I am fully supportive of the goals of the demonstrators but they need to know that they caused a very dangerous delay, which could have been fatal, as I tried to get my husband through the center of New Haven to the Emergency Room at Yale New Haven Hospital. There has to be a way of expressing these important opinions without jeopardizing the lives of others. posted by: the1king on February 15, 2017 9:48am enough already. Do these people have a job. I am so tired of these protest. they are taking police resources away. The organizations that do these protests should be sent a bill. posted by: alphabravocharlie on February 15, 2017 10:39am Lugo should have been arrested, again. Chaining a door shut is reckless endangerment and unlawful restraint. That is absurd. They do not have a right to lock people in a bank. You are trying to obscure that fact with racist commentary. I did not see any black faces on those people who chained themselves to that door. You raise a smokescreen using slavery and abortion rights, because your argument is baseless. If they (the protesters) keep doing stupid, illegal and confrontational things somebody is eventually going to get hurt for no good reason. posted by: Noteworthy on February 15, 2017 3:08pm RealMom - The rights of protesters only extend to the point where they directly infringe on the rights of others. The right to protest, to voice your opinion, freedom of speech is all great. Do it often. These people do not have the right to chain doors, block entrances, block traffic and hamper the free flow of ingress, egress and movement of others to go about their daily lives. Trying to tie this protest with civil rights, the right to vote - is not on parity in either foundation or importance. And yes, they should be held financially liable for the extra cost burden their protest is causing the City of New Haven taxpayers. Just add up all the manpower it took to make the arrests, crowd control, traffic patrol etc. - add up the hours and hourly billing rate. posted by: Realmom21 on February 15, 2017 3:09pm Peter that is the whole point this isnt about race this is about atrocities that have been corrected thru or are route to being corrected thru civil disobedience. perhaps you forget that it was illegal for a black person to sit in the front of a bus or to obstruct traffic walking abreast across a bridge or to sit in at a lunch counter. Or for women to to do many common sense things like own accounts property etc. it was thru civil disobedience that those wrongs were corrected just because something is legal today doesnt make it right in the long run. wait how much municipal and state aid was used to walk a child into a school because she was entitled to go to school but only after civil disobedience that included on the oppressors end locking, blocking school doors. I do agree with the posters who object to such a massive police presence for actions that are clearly non-violent. The gentleness with which we four white folks were treated also stands in marked contrast to how people of color and indigenous folks are often treated by law enforcement. Every employee, potential employee and director, as well as every customer, supplier or other person in a business relationship with TD must be treated with dignity and respect. We are all responsible for treating others with dignity and respect. TD continues to ignore multiple such reports. posted by: alphabravocharlie on February 15, 2017 3:59pm Real mom 21- lynching was never legal in this country. posted by: THREEFIFTHS on February 15, 2017 4:49pm posted by: alphabravocharlie on February 15, 2017 2:59pm Real mom 21- lynching was never legal in this country. Then explain this. Col. Wm. This law continues in force to-day in some of the oldest states of the Union, where courts of justice have long been established, whose laws are executed by white Americans. It flourishes most largely in the states which foster the convict lease system, and is brought to bear mainly, against the Negro. The court summons here for the four who locked down is that responsibility. Fair and appropriate for a minor symbolic act. No oppression has ever been defeated in our nation without breaking of laws. In the spirit of Dr. King, we should all strive to understand the reasons for these actions and support appropriate reactions from the state. But insulting these patriots, calling for vigilante justice, and chilling free speech with outlandish charges, canines, pepper spray, and exaggerated Facebook posts. My wife and I had a very pleasant conversation with Mr. Clement yesterday. These people are trying to keep Long Wharf from going permanently underwater. Think of THAT traffic tie-up.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Now there's a deadline: Authorities say they must leave the camps by December 5. Demonstrators say they aren't budging. Here's a look at what they're battling for and how it got to this point. Dismissing the pinnedPlayer if another video players plays a video. Specifically, it will pass through an oil-rich area in North Dakota where there's an estimated 7.4 billion barrels of undiscovered oil. This oil would be shipped to markets and refineries in the Midwest, East Coast and Gulf Coast regions. This way, the project developer says, the United States could tap its own backyard for oil, rather than relying on imports from unstable regions of the world. But this is the Dakota Access Pipeline on paper. When it comes to the real-world construction, things aren't so clear-cut. THE STANDING ROCK SIOUX President Obama talks with Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault II during the Cannon Ball Flag Day Celebration on June 13, 2014. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe sued the US Army Corps of Engineers after the pipeline was granted final permits in July. The tribe says the project will not only threaten their environmental and economic well-being, but will also cut through land that is sacred. Dismissing the pinnedPlayer if another video players plays a video. Built on sacred land: 'It will be a battle' 02:16 Faith Spotted Eagle, who lives on the Yankton Sioux Reservation of South Dakota, says it's not up to researchers to determine what land is sacred. Ron His Horse Is Thunder, a spokesman for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. She says 38 miles of the Dakota Access Pipeline cuts through territory that still belongs to Native Americans, based on a 1851 treaty signed at Fort Laramie in Wyoming. Dismissing the pinnedPlayer if another video players plays a video. Police remove pipeline protesters 01:20 For months, hundreds of protesters from around the world have traveled to North Dakota to push back on the construction of this pipeline. The demonstrations have turned violent at times, as police dressed in riot gear tear gassed and pepper sprayed protesters during clashes. Just before Thanksgiving, on an evening when temperatures dropped below freezing, police sprayed protesters with a water cannon. Dismissing the pinnedPlayer if another video players plays a video. Police clash with Dakota pipeline protesters 01:42 THE CAMPS A few makeshift camps in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, serve as temporary homes for many of the demonstrators. Tipis, tents and food trucks dot the snow-covered ground as flags from other tribes around the nation billow in the sky above. A Standing Rock Sioux flag flies over a protest encampment near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. But as that deadline looms, the people in the camps are digging in their heels, determined to stay. Snow covers Oceti Sakowin Camp near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on November 30, 2016 outside Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Some residents of Cannon Ball, however, say the camps have been a nuisance. They also say you won't see all Standing Rock Sioux there -- many of the people residing in the shelters are from other parts of the country. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT It's all about who you ask. Dakota Access claims the pipeline would provide a safer, more environmentally friendly way of moving crude oil, compared to other modes of transportation, such as rail or trucks. Supporters cite the 2013 disaster in Quebec, where a train carrying crude oil destroyed downtown Lac-Megnatic when it derailed. But one the Standing Rock Sioux's arguments against it is that it doesn't spur the country's move away from crude oil. Americans should instead look for alternative and renewable sources of energy, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault II said in September. Opponents also worry about what the pipeline, which would go under the Missouri River, could do to the water supply if it ruptured.

He mentioned the Commerce and Education Departments but could not recall the third: the Energy Department. Texas is rich in energy resources, and Mr. Perry is an enthusiastic supporter of extracting them. But it is not clear how that experience would translate into leading the Energy Department. How Trump Can Influence Climate Change A Trump administration could weaken or do away with many of the Obama-era policies focused on greenhouse gas emissions. Still, the former energy secretaries Spencer Abraham, a Republican, and Bill Richardson, a Democrat, said they could envision Mr. Perry adapting. Under President Obama, the Energy Department helped secure an agreement with Iran to dismantle its nuclear weapons program and took on a larger role in efforts to combat global warming, particularly through scientific research. It also established the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to support breakthrough research on clean energy technology. Mr. Perry, 66, would bring a different set of credentials. His views align with those of Mr. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese. Mr. Perry did campaign energetically for Mr. Trump later. When he took the job in 2001, he said, his focus was on rolling blackouts in California and the Enron electric utility scandal. But after the Sept. 11 attacks, his attention shifted to counterterrorism and nuclear weapons and nonproliferation programs. Mr. Chu was brought in by Mr. Obama to focus on climate change programs, but in the summer of 2010, he became consumed with personally helping to engineer a way to stop the oil gushing from a blown BP well in the Gulf of Mexico. Video In November 2011, the former governor of Texas famously forgot that the U.S. Energy Department was one of the agencies he had pledged to eliminate if he were to become president. Published OnDec. Rick Perry has background running a big bureaucracy, the state of Texas. This month, the transition team circulated an unusual 74-point questionnaire at the Energy Department that requested the names of all employees and contractors who had attended climate change policy conferences, as well as emails and documents about the conferences. Former department employees and presidential transition officials said a request for lists of specific people involved in shaping climate policy was irregular and alarming. Employees said Tuesday that the choice of a secretary who has vowed to eliminate the agency compounded those fears. An Energy Department spokesman, Eben Burnham-Snyder, said the agency had refused to give the names.

At first blush, the scenarios seem similar: a group of passionate activists commit civil disobedience in the hinterlands to protest issues that seem beyond their control. Upon moving camp, Standing Rock protestors opened themselves up to charges to trespassing, a crime that provided police with clear justification to disperse them. When the Bundys made their stand, news networks arrived immediately, beaming footage of Ammon Bundy and LaVoy Finicum fielding questions in camouflage jackets and cowboy hats. Many of the reports that have trickled out relied heavily on statements from North Dakota officials, who often portray the Native Americans as dangerous. Beyond the contrast in rhetoric, there are also discrepancies between how each group has been treated by authorities. For the first several weeks of the Malheur occupation, armed protestors could travel to and from the refuge for grocery runs. Ammon Bundy went to local towns for meetings and to negotiate with the FBI. At Standing Rock, Sheriff Kirchmeier quickly established a roadblock on the state highway just north of camp: anyone trying to enter the reservation was sent on a long detour over dirt roads. As of Thursday, more than 400 protestors have been arrested. But a video of the event shows that the first physical contact occurred when a guard tackled a protestor who had blocked the path of a bulldozer. Paradoxically, these unarmed protestors received much harsher treatment from law enforcement than the armed Patriots in Oregon. The Bundy group frequently made the point that, without guns, they would simply have been crushed by police, and this seems to be true. Racism among law enforcement agencies has been well documented: in the wake of police killings of African Americans in Ferguson and Baltimore, the Department of Justice found both departments mired in racial bias. The Malheur Occupiers Were Found Innocent. The Standing Rock Protestors Were Assaulted. Two impassioned mass protests: one led by white people with guns, the other by nonviolent Native Americans. They arrested 141 people who say the pipeline has destroyed sacred sites and in the event of a spill would contaminate drinking water on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The Bundy crew, which included dozens of other armed protestors, opposed what it considers unlawful ownership of federal lands. Occupiers barricaded themselves inside federal buildings for six weeks, swaggering in front of news cameras with pistols strapped to their hips and rifles slung over their shoulders, before finally being evicted by law enforcement officials. At first blush, the scenarios seem similar: a group of passionate activists commit civil disobedience in the hinterlands to protest issues that seem beyond their control. The simplest evidence of the disparities between the protestors at Standing Rock and the ones at Malheur can be found by looking at how each group has been portrayed in the media and treated by law enforcement. The clashes with police occurred when protestors moved onto private property recently purchased from a rancher by Dakota Access, LLC, a subsidiary of Texas-based Energy Transfer, builder of the 1,172-mile oil pipeline from the Bakken to a refinery in Illinois. Upon moving camp, Standing Rock protestors opened themselves up to charges to trespassing, a crime that provided police with clear justification to disperse them. When the Bundys made their stand, news networks arrived immediately, beaming footage of Ammon Bundy and LaVoy Finicum fielding questions in camouflage jackets and cowboy hats. By contrast, Standing Rock protestors, who number in the thousands, have been largely ignored by national television news. Many of the reports that have trickled out relied heavily on statements from North Dakota officials, who often portray the Native Americans as dangerous. Although he did not provide evidence of the explosives, the claim found its way into the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. Beyond the contrast in rhetoric, there are also discrepancies between how each group has been treated by authorities. For the first several weeks of the Malheur occupation, armed protestors could travel to and from the refuge for grocery runs. Ammon Bundy went to local towns for meetings and to negotiate with the FBI. At Standing Rock, Sheriff Kirchmeier quickly established a roadblock on the state highway just north of camp: anyone trying to enter the reservation was sent on a long detour over dirt roads. As of Thursday, more than 400 protestors have been arrested. According to Sheriff Kirchmeier, those arrests were made in response to aggression from the protestors. Several participants and witnesses I interviewed confirmed that protestors on Dakota Access land fought with security officers. But a video of the event shows that the first physical contact occurred when a guard tackled a protestor who had blocked the path of a bulldozer. It also shows guards urging their dogs to attack protestors, six of whom were bitten. Paradoxically, these unarmed protestors received much harsher treatment from law enforcement than the armed Patriots in Oregon. The Bundy group frequently made the point that, without guns, they would simply have been crushed by police, and this seems to be true. Wanting to avoid a repeat of Waco or Ruby Ridge, federal agents took great pains to avoid a gun battle.

Sophia was giving out bottles of water to protectors holding down the space when she was shot with a concussion grenade. This was the response of police and DAPL mercenaries as she and other brave protectors attempted to hold the line against the black snake in hservice of protecting our water. Please consider donating to help pay for her treatment. We must to support our comrades when they need us the most. She needs all of us right now. After all she is our family. My name is Michael Basillas, I live in NYC. Sophia Wilansky is a fierce friend of mine. We've known each other for almost a year now from participation in various demonstrations focused in the city. Sophia and I share passion addressing social justice, vigilance, and resistance , and understanding this world is unsuitable and required drastic change. Sophia is family to many affinity activism groups from The Base, NYC Shut It Down, and HOODS4JUSTICE. I'm this money with the help of several other people to provide medical relief funds after what had happen on Nov 21, 2016. HOW THE MONEY WILL BE SPEND: Funds raised in this campaign will go directly to provide financial aid towards 20 surgeries Sophia needs to save her arm. Funds also provide Sophia's father some financial support to take care of his daughter. Their insurance will not cover all of the expenses and can only cover a certain percentage of it especially with this type of surgery. So we are asking to donate gracefully because this will help provide financial support toward Sophia's long recovery. The rest of the money will be delivered to Mr. Wilansky when he gets back one in NYC. They frequently post information about Sophia's well-being. Thank you for the support you have given us. Please try again. She stood in silence. She was sanding to close to a truck and they didn't like that. I suppose an unarmed, unarmored young woman is threatening to them. They ordered for her to retreat, the whole time shooting rubber bullets. When they finally stopped, she attempted to retreat, as they ordered. She took a few steps towards us, and that's when they directly launched the flash grenade at her. It exploded right on her. I want people who are not here to understand, we assemble in PEACE. Sophia said not a word to them. She is the proof that they will use violent tactics no matter what. We are not to blame here. Anyone who would blame the people and not the government in this situation astounds me... Wilansky family, please contact me. I am a witness to what Morton County did to your daughter. I think it's beautiful for everyone to help but that is a lot of money and maybe we can petition for them to donate their fee to her medical bills. It would be an estimate of half a million dollars if she needs a prosthetic arm. Calling the FBI could result in you providing information that could be potentially incriminating to yourself and others. Many of these police do not see your constitutional right to peacefully assemble. They do not see your point of view or what you are fighting for. Clearing a public road resulted in use of deadly force against hundreds of people. They have responded to us with escalating violence, and increased charges. Put pressure on your legislators, federal agencies, and the White House. Put pressure on North Dakota's governor. Call on the Department of Justice. Please keep eachother safe, and learn about your rights. May she recover more beautifully than could be imagined. May she know the love of thousands. May all her old ones enfold her now. May her story wake up the hearts of tens of thousands. May the protectors and the waters they protect be kept safe from harms way. Sorry for my skepticism. I should have researched better. They are just jealous they don't have this kind of support. And the police will be looking at serious charges against them for crimes against humanity. Thank you all water protectors for the fight. Sending troops in to back you up and lots of them. Below is her statement as conveyed by her father, lawyer Wayne Wilansky. A grenade exploded right as it hit Sophia in the left forearm taking most of the undersurface of her left arm with it. Both her radial and ulnar artery were completely destroyed. Her radius was shattered and a large piece of it is missing. Her medial nerve is missing a large section as well. All of the muscle and soft tissue between her elbow and wrist were blown away. The police did not do this by accident - it was an intentional act of throwing it directly at her. Additionally police were shooting people in face and groin intending to do the most possible damage. Sophia will have surgery again tomorrow as bit by bit they try to rebuild a somewhat functioning arm and hand. The first surgery took a vein from her leg which they have implanted in her arm to take the place of the missing arteries. She will need multiple surgeries to try to gain some functional use of the arm and hand. She will be, every day for the foreseeable future, fearful of losing her arm and hand. There are no words to describe the pain of watching my daughter cry and say she was sorry for the pain she caused me and my wife. I died a thousand deaths today and will continue to do so for quite some time. Prayers for her healing. And for a good attorney. This needs to be taken to court. The sacrifices that this young woman made to be there to support an important cause will be with her the rest of her life. She chose to stand up, she chose to help others that were in need that night and ended up getting severely injured. The least we can all do is come together and support her in her recovery. Her physical, emotional and mental state are fragile at this time and in need of lots of support to assist her. I don't know her personally but thank her from the bottom of my heart. I love that so many folks are pulling together and showing so much love and support. Let's keep this momentum going and make sure all her expenses are covered. We are in this together and together everyone achieves more. Please. Water is life. Let's try to do better and be better. Best wishes for Sophia and her family. She was just passing out water and helping This gotton of control when this girl could loose and an arm or hand. The violent use police are doing is wrong. This has to stop before more people get hurt. Thank you. Victory to the protectors. You can bring a horse to water but cannot make them drink.

She stood in silence. She was sanding to close to a truck and they didn't like that. I suppose an unarmed, unarmored young woman is threatening to them. They ordered for her to retreat, the whole time shooting rubber bullets. When they finally stopped, she attempted to retreat, as they ordered. She took a few steps towards us, and that's when they directly launched the flash grenade at her. It exploded right on her. I want people who are not here to understand, we assemble in PEACE. Sophia said not a word to them. She is the proof that they will use violent tactics no matter what. We are not to blame here. Anyone who would blame the people and not the government in this situation astounds me... Wilansky family, please contact me. I am a witness to what Morton County did to your daughter. I think it's beautiful for everyone to help but that is a lot of money and maybe we can petition for them to donate their fee to her medical bills. It would be an estimate of half a million dollars if she needs a prosthetic arm. Calling the FBI could result in you providing information that could be potentially incriminating to yourself and others. Many of these police do not see your constitutional right to peacefully assemble. They do not see your point of view or what you are fighting for. Clearing a public road resulted in use of deadly force against hundreds of people. They have responded to us with escalating violence, and increased charges. Put pressure on your legislators, federal agencies, and the White House. Put pressure on North Dakota's governor. Call on the Department of Justice. Please keep eachother safe, and learn about your rights. May she recover more beautifully than could be imagined. May she know the love of thousands. May all her old ones enfold her now. May her story wake up the hearts of tens of thousands. May the protectors and the waters they protect be kept safe from harms way. Sorry for my skepticism. I should have researched better. They are just jealous they don't have this kind of support. And the police will be looking at serious charges against them for crimes against humanity. Thank you all water protectors for the fight. Sending troops in to back you up and lots of them. Below is her statement as conveyed by her father, lawyer Wayne Wilansky. A grenade exploded right as it hit Sophia in the left forearm taking most of the undersurface of her left arm with it. Both her radial and ulnar artery were completely destroyed. Her radius was shattered and a large piece of it is missing. Her medial nerve is missing a large section as well. All of the muscle and soft tissue between her elbow and wrist were blown away. The police did not do this by accident - it was an intentional act of throwing it directly at her. Additionally police were shooting people in face and groin intending to do the most possible damage.

      "Sentences":["Now, a group of advisors to President-elect Donald Trump on Native American issues wants to free those resources from what they call a suffocating federal bureaucracy that holds title to 56 million acres of tribal lands, two chairmen of the coalition told Reuters in exclusive interviews. The group proposes to put those lands into private ownership - a politically explosive idea that could upend more than century of policy designed to preserve Indian tribes on U.S.-owned reservations, which are governed by tribal leaders as sovereign nations. The tribes have rights to use the land, but they do not own it. They can drill it and reap the profits, but only under regulations that are far more burdensome than those applied to private property. It could deeply divide Native American leaders, who hold a range of opinions on the proper balance between development and conservation. The proposed path to deregulated drilling - privatizing reservations - could prove even more divisive. Many Native Americans view such efforts as a violation of tribal self-determination and culture. Reservations governed by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs are intended in part to keep Native American lands off the private real estate market, preventing sales to non-Indians. An official at the Bureau of Indian Affairs did not respond to a request for comment. The legal underpinnings for reservations date to treaties made between 1778 and 1871 to end wars between indigenous Indians and European settlers. Tribal governments decide how land and resources are allotted among tribe members. On Sunday, amid rising opposition, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday said it had denied a permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline project, citing a need to explore alternate routes. The Trump transition team has expressed support for the pipeline, however, and his administration could revisit the decision once it takes office in January. Tribes and their members could potentially reap vast wealth from more easily tapping resources beneath reservations. In 2008, the Bureau of Indian Affairs testified before Congress that reservations contained about 20 percent of untapped oil and gas reserves in the U.S. Deregulation could also benefit private oil drillers including Devon Energy Corp, Occidental Petroleum, BP and others that have sought to develop leases on reservations through deals with tribal governments. Those companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A man from the Lakota Sioux tribe with a Native American tattoo on his neck poses for a photograph during a protest against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, U.S. November 16, 2016. At least three of four chair-level members have links to the oil industry. Mullin received about eight percent of his campaign funding over the years from energy companies, while co-chair Sharon Clahchischilliage - a Republican New Mexico State Representative and Navajo tribe member - received about 15 percent from energy firms, according to campaign finance disclosures reviewed by Reuters. ETP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The fourth co-chair, Eddie Tullis, a former chairman of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians in Alabama, is involved in casino gaming, a major industry on reservations. Clahchischilliage and Tullis did not respond to requests for comment. BUREAUCRATIC THICKET Several tribes, including the Crow Nation in Montana and the Southern Ute in Colorado, have entered into mining and drilling deals that generate much-needed revenue for tribe members and finance health, education and infrastructure projects on their reservations. As U.S. oil and gas drilling boomed over the past decade, tribes struggled to capitalize. A 2015 report from the Government Accountability Office found that poor management by the Bureau of Indian Affairs hindered energy development and resulted in lost revenue for tribes. Over the next decade, some 2.5 million acres of land were removed from tribal control, and 12,000 Native Americans lost their tribal affiliation. Mullin and Swimmer said the coalition does not want to repeat past mistakes and will work to preserve tribal control of reservations. Mullin said the finalized proposal could result in Congressional legislation as early as next year. Washburn said he doubted such a bill could pass, but Gabe Galanda, a Seattle-based lawyer specializing in Indian law, said it could be possible with Republican control of the White House and the U.S. House and Senate. Legal challenges to such a law could also face less favorable treatment from a U.S. Supreme Court with a conservative majority, he said. Trump will soon have the chance to nominate a Supreme Court justice to replace Antonin Scalia, a conservative member who died earlier this year.

To guide us along our journey, we invited four well-known speakers from the region that offer unique perspectives on diversity. Speakers will be facilitating post keynote dialogues on creating an action plan. A keynote designed specifically on developing a diversity action plan for you as an individual. The entire conference structure is based on speakers and attendees sharing their own personal stories and not just lecture. Breakout dialogue sessions on issues concerning the current political arena, Black Lives Matter, as well as issues concerning GLBTQ. To reduce costs, attendees can request a Host Family to stay with for free. In addition to hearing from our expert panel of speakers, participants will have a structured dialogue facilitated by the speakers. Afterwards, participants will have the opportunity to create an action plan to take back to their respective campus or organization.

During the simulation, participants role-play the lives of low-income families, from single parents caring for their children to senior citizens trying to maintain self-sufficiency on Social Security. The task of each family is to provide food, shelter, and other basic necessities while interacting with various community resources such as a pawn shop, Community Action Agency, community health agency, and much more. The goal of the simulation is to enable participants to view poverty from different angles in an experiential setting. Participants will begin to understand what life is like with a shortage of money and an abundance of stress and become motivated to be part of the solution to ending poverty in the United States. I only had to experience this for about two hours and by the second week, I was ready to give up. This is a first come first serve basis for the first 80 registrants. Cost is included in the conference registration. The Memorial Union has continually been remodeled to keep up with the growth of the student body, and services change to meet students'needs. Operational funding is provided in part by student activity fees. Beginning in 2005, the Memorial Union underwent a large construction project. The building was re-dedicated on Tuesday, October 2, 2007. Due to the nature of the Critical Conversations Conference and the hope that more stories can be told and voices to be heard, several student affairs staff have volunteered to serve as host families. There is no cost to stay with a host family during the conference. It started as a normal college football game in Neyland Stadium. If anything, the event was an afterthought, dropped into the schedule at the last minute. For Inky Johnson, though, the game changed everything. A routine tackle turned into a life-threatening injury, and nothing has been normal for Inky ever since. Not with a paralyzed right arm. Not with daily pain. Not with constant physical challenges. His dream had always been to play professional sports. You might think his injury would have destroyed his motivation and crushed his spirit. He could be described as the survivor of an underprivileged past. He could be described as a refugee of poverty and violence. He could be described as a success story stained by tragedy. In contrast, inspiration affects people from within, giving them the ability to accomplish what would otherwise be impossible. Through his walk and his talk, Inky embodies and imparts a truly inspirational message. He devotes much of his time to mentoring athletes and underprivileged youth. He joined the NDSU faculty in the fall of 2014. He is Professor and Director of the Tribal Indigenous Studies program at North Dakota State University. Strand lectures and leads workshops extensively with engagements all over the globe. In 2014, Strand was awarded a two-year Bush Foundation Fellowship. With this award he will focus on the potential of functional design to facilitate cross-cultural communication and understanding in political and social spheres extending from his home state of North Dakota to international locations such as Brazil, China, South Africa and Europe. In 2013, Strand was awarded the Alumni Achievement Award for the Hixon-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts at his graduate school alma mater, The University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Currently, Aida serves as the Director of the Lealtad-Suzuki Center at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Her scholarly work focuses on academic bullying, Latina identity, and doctoral education. As a community activist, organizer and mother, Aida is a member of the Saint Paul Integration Task Force that is critically looking at the role of public education in our Democracy, interrogating the idea of what makes an educated person, and centering the experiences of black, brown and low income children. In addition, she is deeply involved with the Saint Paul Federation of Teachers and their fight for equity and wealth re-distribution.

View of the camp from Media Hill. When we arrived at the Oceti Sakowin Camp this morning, we were impressed by its size and organization.

We estimate that at least 1,000 cars and buses came to the camp today.When we arrived at the Oceti Sakowin Camp this morning, we were impressed by its size and organization. From our view on the highway, the camp stretched far into the distance and was packed with all kinds of structures. Two of the Yurts at the MedicHealer Council. The camp looked full and we were concerned that finding a parking space would be difficult. We called Popular Resistance reporter, Crystal Zevon and she met us at the entrance gate to show us around. The main street is lined with flags. We followed it to the MedicHealer area and found a spot not too far away. We had a large bag of donations to deliver. The MedicHealer area consisted of a series of yurts with colorful doors and storage tents and sheds. The daily noon orientation was cancelled due to the overwhelming influx of new people. Margaret set to work helping to organize new donations and Kevin set out to deliver non-medical donations and find the legal tent. People hear the news of the Corps of Engineers decision at the Sacred Circle. The courage and ethics of the participants at Standing Rock, some of whom have been there since April, were like a magnet to those of us who care about justice and the future of the planet. Tens of thousands showed up in solidarity at this ceremonial, prayer camp that stood for Indigenous rights and the people and planet over corporate profit. In the afternoon, the news went around that the Army Corps of Engineers denied the permit for the final phase of the pipeline. At first it was hard to believe and we were skeptical. People whooped and hollered, pumped fists in the air, beat drums and danced in celebration. They were installing military tents with wood stoves, indeed wood stoves could be seen in many parts of the camp ready for installation. Solar panels were also evident in various parts of the camp, ensuring a long-term energy supply. Youth snow sliding down Media Hill. There were so many people there that it would have been very difficult to clear the camp. We recognize this is an important victory, but not a final one. On their Facebook page the Standing Rock Sioux are also clear. They write that there are still many questions to be answered . Here are ten issues they have initially raised, no doubt more information will be coming from them soon. 1. 6. 10. Last week people united stopped ratification of the TPP against transnational corporate power. Now, this is a tremendous victory over the oil industry as well as their big financiers. Watch out, people may soon realize we have power when we join together and mobilize. Kevin Zeese and Margaret Flowers We head back to the Oceti Sakowin camp tomorrow. We look forward to finding out what the next steps will be in this campaign.

      "Sentences":["A celebration erupted at the main protest camp in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, where the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and others have been protesting the 1,172-mile (1,885-km) Dakota Access Pipeline for months. The line, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP, had been complete except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. That stretch required an easement from federal authorities, which delayed a decision on the permit twice in an effort to consult further with the tribe. Jo-Ellen Darcy, the Army's Assistant Secretary for Civil Works, said in a statement the decision was based on a need to explore alternate routes for the pipeline, although it remains unclear what those alternatives will be. They haven't been following the law all along. In a statement, Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II thanked activists for their support in the protest effort. Protest organizers had for months argued that crossing the Missouri River adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation presented a danger to their water source. Protests grew over the months, with hundreds of veterans flocking to the camp in recent days to stand against what they say are aggressive tactics from law enforcement. Activists at the camp were seen hugging each other and letting out Native American war cries on Sunday, but many remained wary, knowing that the incoming administration of Donald Trump has voiced support for the line. Supporters of the line as well as opponents pointed out the Sunday decision does not resolve the issue. It is unclear what the new pipeline route will be and any route would still likely need to cross the Missouri River, probably upstream of Lake Oahe and closer to the state capital of Bismarck. Many pipelines travel under U.S. waterways already, and pipe is considered a safer way to transport crude oil than rail. Energy Transfer has said in the past they did not intend to reroute the line. Even if the easement had been granted, it would have been months before the line was completed. It is unclear whether Trump's incoming administration may consider taking up Energy Transfer's request yet again, and approving it. Trump's transition team last week said he was supportive of the line, in addition to other pipeline development. A number of states and municipalities in the country have made it more difficult to build pipelines in recent years. A spokesperson for Energy Transfer Partners could not immediately be reached for comment. hope they follow through here with this.

      "Sentences":["That's a much higher rate than the company predicted in its risk assessments provided to regulators, Reuters reported. Since the 2,147-mile pipeline began operating in 2010, it has gushed 5,000-barrels just this month in Marshall County, South Dakota, and about 400 barrels each in Hutchinson County, South Dakota in 2016 and in Sargent County, North Dakota in 2011. The spill risk analysis was conducted by international risk management company DNV GL, which did not respond to Reuters' request for comment. TransCanada could lose its permit to operate the Keystone in South Dakota if an investigation into this month's massive leak determines that the pipeline operator violated its license. Conditions include construction standards and environmental requirements. Nebraska regulators approved an alternative route for the Keystone's controversial sister project, the Keystone XL (KXL) Pipeline, just days after the spill in South Dakota. President Donald Trump pushed the KXL forward in March through an executive order, overturning President Obama's rejection of the project. leaks per decade with half of those at volumes of 3 barrels or less. Spills more than 1,000 barrels would occur at a rate of once per century, it estimated. Meanwhile, cleanup efforts for the Nov. 16 spill are underway. TransCanada announced Friday that it has recovered more than 44,000 gallons of oil so far. But in a setback for the pipeline operator, a federal judge on Wednesday allowed a key lawsuit against the KXL's permit to move forward, The Hill reported. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris rejected a request from the Trump administration and KXL developers to throw out the lawsuit. The scorecard shows that 140 House members voted against chemical safeguards every time, while 149 members consistently voted for chemical safety protections. However, the action fund praised the lawmakers that bucked their party to vote for chemical safety, including Reps. voted for funding chemical reviews and against a farm bill that included pesticide safety loopholes. Florida Reps. A Preview of the People, Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule, two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Updated and reissued every five years, these guidelines are the nation's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations. supply. These nominees will be well-known in their fields, and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers, academics and practitioners. part of the process is happening in real time. what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors. Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff, and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally. Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries. And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle. Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance, including the meat industry, dairy industry, and sugar-sweetened beverage associations, as well as formula companies, which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers.

Cyanobacteria can be toxic and can also produce various types of cyanotoxins that have different hazards. With their small, developing bodies, children are especially endangered by algae exposure. was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption. But it probably won't be the last, especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year. Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets. If you believe your pet may have been exposed, be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, diarrhea or vomiting. And as climate change gets worse, the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks, creating a toxic feedback loop. The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish. Communities that struggle with regular, serious toxic algae outbreaks, like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie, can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation. The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth. The women were all non-smokers, had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies. Macrophages, which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body, protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles, such as bacteria and pollution particles. The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants. That's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA's Office of Inspector General (OIG), the agency's internal watchdog. EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement, and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency.

These lands that the pipeline is cutting through right now are their homeland from time immemorial..

      "Sentences":["Your question has been submitted. KARIM-ALY KASSAM: Ladies and gentlemen, we are on the traditional lands of the Cayuga. And, therefore, it is appropriate that this event begins with that acknowledgement. It is my honor to ask Sachem Sam George, a chief of the Cayuga people, to welcome Chairman Archambault, leader of the Standing Rock Sioux Nation. Sachem George. And what happens is usually, when we have newcomers or people come visit, we have a words before all else. And I'll just do a short version today, because we have big, big things going on. I'm a little nervous here. Lot of people in partner. I still get this way. And I have a present for you from all of us. Representatives of the Cayuga Nation; executives of the Seneca Nation; representatives of the Oneida Nation; Dr. Laura Spitz, Vice Provost for International Affairs Dr. Patrick Sullivan, Chair of the Department of Natural Resources; Dr. Jolene Rickard, Director of the American Indian and Indigenous Studies program; students and faculty; ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today. I am told that this event is being watched from California to Central Asia, in the Kyrgyz Republic, in Tajikistan, and in Afghanistan through Livestream. It is tradition in my department that we begin our events by acknowledging those who have made it possible. The work of staff, students, and faculty in the Department of Natural Resources, in the American Indian and Indigenous Studies program, and at the vice provost's office have made this event possible. Thank you, all. Now, it is my honor to introduce a soft spoken, gentle, courageous, and thoughtful man, who needs no introduction. Members of my research group at Cornell University have been undertaking research in partnership with tribal institutions in Standing Rock for nearly a decade. I've had the opportunity to interact with Chairman David Archambault several times. And I'm consistently impressed with his humility and his commitment. He was recently named by Foreign Policy magazine as the global thinker of 2016, for his stewardship of the Dakota-Lakota homeland. Just 24 hours ago, in Washington, he received the Native American Leadership Award from the National Congress of American Indians. We looked around and saw tremendous work being done here and elsewhere, in partnership with communities and scholarly institutions. Concrete efforts were being made to bring about hope for the future. Today, let us listen and then act wisely, because we have a man here, despite recent setbacks, where his community and he are building hope, not just for themselves, but for humanity as a whole. Folks, please help me welcome Chairman David Archambault, leader of the Standing Rock Sioux Nation. You said you're nervous. I just hope that if I have anything that I can offer, that you receive it. And I'll try to do my best. And one of the things that I want to do is make sure that we do create that hope, the hope that is necessary for the future. And so when I look at everything that I do, it's always trying to base my decisions on the best outcome for the kids who are not even born yet. So there's a lot of things that I face with every day. There's a lot of different challenges where I live. And I deal with them on a daily basis. And it's not always easy. But as long as I put a focus on the future, I could sleep at night. So that's kind of how I look at things. So what I'll do is I'll try to-- if I could instill any sense of hope in where we have to go-- and I'll talk a little bit about the history of my nation, of why we are in this stance. And I'll try to tie it into what we can do in the future and the things that we have to be aware of. So with that, I just want to first start by thanking Sam George for the welcome and for letting me be on your lands and all the leadership who has come. I created friendships with many tribal nations across the country. And it's hard for me to remember names, but I know faces, and I know character. And I know I have some really good, close friends that I trust. And that's just because of the support that I got when I was in a time of need for it. So I thank you guys for being here and showing your support. Karim, I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity. Karim was at Standing Rock. And so that was our discussion. And I promised him I would come out, and we could have that conversation here. This was in 2015, before pipeline was a big issue, before Dakota Access Pipeline was a big issue. And so I promised him I'd come. And we set this date. And I made sure that I was going to be here for it. So I'll start by just going with our history. So as indigenous peoples, the first peoples of these lands, we entered into treaties with other nations. And it was something that wasn't uncommon. It was about peace. And so there's different types of treaties that were honored and created. And one of the treaties that we entered into, with our own membership, was not on paper. It was with the peace pipe. So a pipe was loaded. And that pipe was a reminder. And it never was smoked. And as long as that was filled, our treaties were honored. And then, around here, they use wampum beads as a treaty. So each tribal nation had a way, without writing on paper. And it was oral history and something that we've learned and known about. But in the early 1800s, when we started interacting with the Europeans, we started entering into written treaties. And early on, like 1803, our tribes entered into treaty. I want to say 1830s. There was a treaty that was written that put us under the federal government. So that was one of the first things that happened. And then, in 1851, we had a Horse Creek Treaty. And this Horse Creek Treaty was on the North Platte River in Nebraska. And it was a trail from the east to the west. And there was a trail where-- they called it the Mormon Trail. And they were going up towards Oregon. But there was confrontation. So 1851, we said we'll enter into a treaty with the federal government. And it encompassed 60 million acres. And the first thing on there, the first article was there will be no war. So it was a peace treaty with us. And 1868, on the Fort Laramie Treaty, it was because there's a Powder River. There was a finger on our 60 million acres. And the Mormons were cutting across it. And we had a Powder River War. So we had to enter into another treaty. But in this treaty, they took some land from the 1851 boundary. And that was kind of like-- today, what we call it is a poison pill. We'll never get that. So we understood that. And we knew that. Because of this resource that the United States looked for, gold, which is more precious to them than life, they wanted that land. And so they knew that they couldn't get it. So what they did was they came out, and they negotiated with a few leaders. But at the same time, 60 million acres was the territory that buffalo roamed. And buffalo were getting killed. So food was becoming a hardship. So it came to a point where we either have to sign or we have to starve. Sign or starve. And I always resented the leadership at that time for signing, but I really didn't understand until today, in my capacity. I know what they were dealing with. It's hard when you're thinking about the future. So those leaders back then, when I think about it, were thinking about me. And I'm here today because of what they've done. So it was an agreement that they worked not with Congress, but with agents. Federal agents came out. And our 60 million acres was reduced down to the west side of the Missouri River in South Dakota and cut out the Black Hills. When we signed this agreement, the agreement went back to DC. And then, there was an act of Congress. So now, it's no longer treaties or treaty amendments. It's now Congress taking action, Congress saying, OK, we can take land. So another act came in 1889. And this act said, we will reduce that land to today's current day reservation. So the Standing Rock Sioux tribe is on about the size of Connecticut, 2.3 million acres. We straddle North Dakota and South Dakota. We're along the Missouri River. , Today we have about 16,000 members. About 8,000 of our members live there on Standing Rock. So remember this number, 8,000 members. And that's who put me in office, in my office, in my capacity. Soon after that, another act came. It's called Dawes Act. In 1908, we had-- It's also known as the Allotment Act. So what they did was they said, every individual here is going to be a lottee, and you're going to get land. And whatever's left over, we're going to open it up to settlers. So when I think about why are they doing this, why are they continuing to take land, it's for economic development. In North Dakota and South Dakota, you have agriculture, grazing. One good thing about Standing Rock is we'll see a lot of native grass. You don't see a lot of agriculture taking place. So agriculture, they'll kill everything, and they'll put one species, plant species in. With us, we maintain, and we try to protect the Native grasses that exist. In 1876, the Great Sioux Nation and the Cheyenne defeated General Custer in a war, in Greasy Grass, Battle of Bighorn, Battle of Little Bighorn in Montana. And there was lessons from that. Our leader, Sitting Bull-- I always used to say this. And Sitting Bull is a world renowned leader. And they all say, yeah. That's my tribe. But recently, I would say Standing Rock, and people know where Standing Rock's at. So in 1876, we defeated Custer. Sitting Bull took off to Canada. And then, he came back. When he came back, he was considered hostile. So the federal government at that time implemented-- trying to think of the word-- simulation. Or it was to try to make him non-Indian. Assimilation. And it was with his family. So with our tribe, you'll see a lot of the leadership was killed. Sitting Bull was killed. Any tribes that had resistance to the federal government, they would take the heads off. In 1914, we had World War I. So the same names that defeated the United States were the same ones that were fighting alongside US in the First World War. My wife and I-- my wife is with me. And I always have to point her out. She's the most beautiful thing ever. Sorry. We got a chance to visit the President. And when we went to the White House, there's this room, the secretaries' room. And they have flags, all the flags from all the military branches. And they have the United States flag. And then, they have war ribbons hanging off. And one of these war ribbons, it had Pine Ridge. And Pine Ridge is in South Dakota. Every ribbon represents a war that the United States was in. And that was that one. That was a war in, I want to say, 1880, Wounded Knee Massacre. They called it a war. And it was a war where they got the most Congressional Medals of Honor for the guys that mowed down with Hotchkiss guns women and children. And they were from Standing Rock. They left Standing Rock when Sitting Bull got killed. So 1914, we are fighting in World War I. 1918. 1924, they say, you can be the citizens of this country. So before 1924, and in the 1800s, we weren't even considered humans. And if you look at all the acts that were taking our lands, we were not even citizens. We didn't have say. And so this is just the beginning of a lot of the wrongs that were committed. And there's similar stories to other nations, other tribal nations. In 1934, there was an IRA Government Act, another act. You have to create an IRA government. Standing Rock said, no, we're not going to accept that government. We have our own constitution. 1914, we passed the constitution to organize. And we're going to stay with that. But there was two things that came with the IRA. We received the benefits from the government. And we see their Constitution. Who pushed their Constitution aside, but we said, we'll receive your benefits. So in every decade, there was something happening with Indian country and with Standing Rock. In 1944, in that area, there was this act. It was called the Pick-Sloan Act. And it was named after a general in the Army Corps of Engineers and a general in Bureau of Reclamation, Pick and Sloan. And it was an act to create a dam system on the Missouri River. And there were seven dams that were built. So when we had the Allotment Act, our members were given a piece of land, 640 acres. And everybody in our membership said, we want it by the river. We want it on the river bottoms, because there's trees. There's fruits. There's game. There's everything that we need to survive. So if you look at Standing Rock, and you see the allotments, it's all along the Grand River and the Missouri River. And the rest of the farmland was turned into fee land that was settled by non-Indians. So in 1944, Pick-Sloan Act, it was the largest dam system in the world. And by 1958, they completed the dam. And we had our most precious lands flooded. To create these lakes for recreation and for energy independence. So when I look back, the Black Hills, national security, gold is used to back the currency. Taking of our land is economic development to this nation. And then, we have energy independence, hydroelectricity. So these things are coming up. Not only are these wrongs that were being committed to us, but because we were considered aggressive or hostile, our kids were taken and are put in boarding schools. And when our kids were put in boarding schools, they were not allowed to speak. So I have a grandmother. She had passed away. But she was a fluent speaker of our language. And she did not speak to her kids, my dad, because she would get beaten in school if she spoke her language. And she didn't want that pain to go on to her children. So she did not allow them to speak our language. And this was the federal policy at the time. The federal policy is kill the Indian, but save the man. Let's assimilate them as fast as we can. And if your tribe was considered hostile, the assimilation was more forceful. There was a lot of things that were happening that created trauma. It's hard to explain the boarding school era. All I can say is if any of you have children-- I see a little one. Soon as she turns three years old, we're going to take that little one away and put them in another country. And they cannot speak the language, your native tongue. And if they do, they're going to get beat. And not only that, the schools are going to rape them. That's what's happening to Indians in this nation. And so that hardship comes back. And when we have our students graduating high school, all they want to do is be home. They don't want to go to school anymore. They don't want to go to college. What I'm sharing to you is kind of like the wrongs that have been committed to us. And there's been a lot of wrongs. And it's important that you understand that, so that you understand what happened at Standing Rock in this movement. It created trauma. It created hardship. We didn't do it to ourselves. So if I look at the 10 poorest counties in this nation, 10 poorest counties, five of them are of the Great Sioux Nation. We have Pine Ridge, our Oglala, Rosebud. We have Cheyenne River and two of them on Standing Rock. So there's five of the poorest counties in this country come from the Great Sioux Nation. This is because of the treatment of what happened to our people. And with poverty comes all the symptoms. So you have high suicide rates, high abuses, high alcoholism, high drug use, lack of housing, lack of law enforcement. These are symptoms. And it's not just common in any country. It's common in any area where there's poverty. You'll see the same symptoms wherever you go. Nicole and I grew up on the reservation. And we have two children. Our daughter is 23, and our son is 17. I taught them everything I know, but they don't know anything. But you have to have a choice. And our parents made a choice to stay on the reservation. And so when it's our time, we have children. And what we can look at is the environment. And I say, yeah, because even though you have high poverty, there's so much beauty with our culture. There's so much beauty with our land. There's so much beauty with the people. There's so much that is there that we love. And it's our choice. And we know that if we love our children, no matter what, they're going to do good. So it was our choice to stay. And if you ever get a chance to visit any reservation, you'll see for yourself, with your own eyes, beyond the poverty. You'll see the prairie grasses. You'll see the hills, the rolling hills. You'll see the people. You'll see the songs. You'll see the ceremonies. You'll see the things that we cherish. The community, all the communities. So that's why we're there. Now, in 2003, in North Dakota, there was this oil boom taking place, taking off. So North Dakota became a state that was recognized in the nation as the lowest unemployment. But they didn't count the reservations. They just said, it's the lowest unemployment. There's 20,000 jobs. People from all over the country were flocking. People were coming all over. And this oil boom brought a lot of things. Brought money, but it also brought crime, and it brought drugs. When this thing hit North Dakota, I think marijuana was the drug that was on our reservation. But then we start seeing stuff like cocaine. That We never saw that before. It was stuff like heroin, black heroin, meth. Meth became something that is rampant. And it's different. These drugs are completely different. So in 2007, our tribe said, we don't want pipelines in our ancestral lands, because we saw not only the bad that was coming with the social ills with this oil boom, but we saw the environmental ills. And we saw unregulated pipelines being punched in. We saw fracking solutions, fracking water. That's crazy. He was going around buying fee land. And he was going around telling people that he wants to frack. He's going to frack on Standing Rock. So the Standing Rock Sioux tribe said, we don't want that. We know what happens to the environment when you do that. So we said, we don't want this. Not only that we don't want the fracking. We don't want the pipeline. So we took action way before Dakota Access Pipeline. 2013, There's this KXL Pipeline. And it's trying to cut through our treaty lands. And there's this stance. There's a movement by reservation, by tribes in Great Sioux Nation, saying no KXL Pipeline. But we officially opposed it. We also sent letters to the Department of Interior, the EPA, Department of the Army. We sent letters out saying, we oppose this. And we also passed resolutions opposing KXL Pipeline. 2013, I get elected as the chairman of Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. And the only reason I get elected is because I want to try to-- I love our people. I love our home. And I know that we're in a state of dependency. I know that there's poverty. But that's not the only thing there. I know that we can do things like food sovereignty. There's all kinds of opportunities that we can pursue. And if I could just bump us in a new direction, and if I could-- our focus has been focusing on our children. And all the problems, the issues that we have, we create the brilliant minds to solve all the things that plague us. So that's why I became the chairman. And I know this is something that took place over 200 years. I can't reverse that overnight. I can't reverse that in my term. But I can nudge us in a new direction. So that's what it is, showing that I care for kids and that if we invest in them, they'll have the answers in the future. 2014 comes. There's the Dakota Access Pipeline. And we have this company approaching our tribal council, saying we're going to build this pipeline right here, 500 feet away from your lands. And the tribal council and I said, don't do it. You're going to meet resistance. And we have it. It's on YouTube. If you look it up, you'll see the meeting. And it's verbatim, the conversation that we had. I go home, and I tell Nicole about this. Well, it threatens water. Well, she's telling me that-- that's why I said that's funny. She don't even bathe in water. I'm just teasing. I have to pick on Nicole. I love her, so she understands. But water is important to us. Water's a part of our ceremonies. Water is-- it's a source of life. So water is a source of life, just like the sun is a source of life, just like this Earth is a source of life, and just like the air that we breathe is a source of life. Those are sources of life that are beings need to exist, so that our spirits can occupy these bodies that we're in. But it means that everything is connected. Everything is related. So it's important. Water's important. And it was something that started with our kids. Our youth said, we don't want oil in our water. And they made a stance. And they ran to DC. And when our kids speak up, it's time for us to stand behind them. It's time for us to support them. When they want to say something, we encourage them to say it. When they want to do something, encourage them to do it. And it's a different time for me, because when I was growing up, it was hard for me to identify as who I am or what I am. But our kids today are saying, I want to learn the language. I'm proud to be Indian. It's cool to be Indian. And so we are very supportive of them. In 2015, we did everything that we could. We wrote to all the agencies. We visited DC. We went to Department of Interior, went to EPA. We went to Advisory Council Historic Preservation. And we got them to write letters in support. And our argument is that we never had an opportunity to have a say in the scoping of this Dakota Access Pipeline. If we did, we would have said, stay out of our treaty lands, because there are sacred places there, something that's important to us. And so, by protecting the water, it helps us remember and know what our ancestors had left behind. And it also helps us protect the future for children who are not yet born. So in 2016, there was a notice of construction. All of our efforts went to the wayside. This company, Dakota Access Pipeline Energy Transfer Partners just kept pushing through. And when this first notice of construction started, the movement began. There's a huge movement. And it continues today. There's still a movement today. In 2016, it felt like the first time we were heard, on December 4. The Department of Army said we're not part of that. We went to court. We had to file a court case. We knew that our chances were not very good, because throughout history, federal court has never ruled for tribes. So we know that our chances-- and we know that the deck is stacked against us. We know that the federal laws are in place. We know that this company has complied with the federal laws. But yet they didn't consult us. We had an argument, when we took them to court. We wanted to take them to court. It was something that we had to do, even though we knew the deck was stacked against us. And first, we filed a temporary restraining order, saying you're going to destroy our sacred sites. Don't go through there. Company continues to work, and the judge rules in their favor. They destroy sacred sites. So all of our initial court case was on sacred sites and consultation. We lost that. But it doesn't mean that it's over. We're going to continue the fight. When the court ruled against us, the Department Interior, Department of Army, and Department of Justice wrote a memo saying, we're not going to approve of an easement for the company to cross our land, until we take a closer look at this and do some further reviews. And then, in December, 2016, they didn't grant the easement. And they said, until we conduct environment impact statement-- and that was something that we were asking for. To get approval, they will give an environmental assessment. They will get a FONSI, Finding of No Significant Impact. And they will get a 404 permit. And then, the last thing they need is an easement across the federal lands. The agency said, we're not going to give that, until we do an environmental impact statement. They put a notice in the Federal Register, notice of intent in the Federal Registry. And then, the new President took office. And the new President said, we're going to do Dakota Access Pipeline. We're going to restart KXL Pipeline. And he wrote a presidential memorandum. So we're still in court over this matter. We appealed what the judge did. And things were changing, because our complaint that we filed was starting to look like null and void, because they went and destroyed all the sacred sites. And the judge ruled, saying that we were consulted, because we had 380 correspondences with the Corps of Engineers. And those correspondences were, we're not consulting with you until we get an opportunity to share. Well, we need to consult. Well, we don't want to consult until you give us the opportunity. So we went back and forth with emails and phone calls. So in February, this month, February 8, there was-- let's see. The week before that, I was trying to get a hold of President Trump. And I've been trying different angles. I know he said that. I know what he's doing. So maybe if he just hears us-- so I was optimistic. If I just get an opportunity to get in front of him. The President said, in his presidential memorandum, he said, we're going to approve these pipelines, because it creates economic development and jobs, creates national security. And it creates energy independence. So when I hear those things, I said, perfect. I get to talk to him. And I could show him that today, we are continuing to pay that cost for those things. While this nation benefits, there's a cost-benefit. And it's bringing harm on our people. And it's going to create another. So I wanted to have the opportunity. First week of February, I finally got to talk to someone in the White House. His name's William Kirkland. I talked for an hour, said I need to sit down. I need to show you. I need to show you. I need to talk to anybody in the White House, anyone who would listen, that you cannot approve of this easement. And so he says, OK. We'll meet on February 9. February 6 is a Monday. We have a status conference on our court case. And they say not until Friday, which would be February 12 or February 10. OK, I have some time, one last chance. Make a run at it. That was February 6. February 7, I'm flying to DC to meet with William Kirkland in the White House on February 8. February 7, I get a call. I call the general. We're giving the easement. We're canceling the notice of intent for an EIS. And we're going to waive the 14 day congressional notice for the easement. So that's the call I get. And so I feel like I got slighted by this. The reason I feel like that is because we originally had our meeting set up for Monday. And then, they moved it to Wednesday. And then, I go on Tuesday. And Tuesday, they come out and let me know that. So I try to forgive. There's some lessons that I learned. And one of them is to forgive. But it's really hard when somebody does that to you. I feel like I was set up. So that's kind of where we are. And we filed a summary judgment two days ago. And our argument is that there was no change in circumstances. The Department of Army gave a notice to do an environmental impact statement. And because there's no change in status, they need to honor that. But the one question that we always ask the Corps of Engineers, and the reason why we got the environmental impact statement from the beginning was because we asked a question. We will be the first ones that are affected by it. And they couldn't. So that's when Jo-Ellen Darcy, the Assistant Secretary for US Civil Works said, we need to do an EIS. And then, this President comes in and takes away. The Administrative Procedures Act says they can't do that. So we now we are also saying we have treaty rights. We entered into this treaty. So I started talking about treaty. We have treaty rights. And those treaty rights are hunting, fishing, and our water. And those three things have been successful for tribes in the past, when we've filed claims on them. So we're pursuing those. And I believe that we have a strong argument. I know we have a strong argument. It's just going to depend on how the judge sees things. And it's crazy, because we have this billion dollar company, who's coming in acting like the victim, like we are hurting them. We are keeping their project from going. And so we're going to continue to do that. This movement has been something special. It's been something that I never anticipated. I never knew it was going to be like this. I never thought that it was going to be something this special, something this great, something this beautiful. And I know it's because-- and I believe in the creator. So it's not like God or a puppet master. It's more like everything. And I believe in that, because there's been so much prayer. In August, September, October, when you guys came, you felt it. You witnessed it. And then, I had a hard time. It wasn't easy. I have all the things that plague our people. And then, we have this movement. So 8,000 members on Standing Rock. At one time, we had 10,000 members at the camp. So 10,000 members. So that doubled our population. So I always question myself. You can ask Nicole. And I believe that the creator has been guiding me. Every time I had doubt, there was a tribe that showed up. And they shared a song. Or they shared a prayer. And they were behind me. And they gave support. So it wasn't as difficult. There is momentum there. And we can keep that momentum going, regardless of what happens. I call Facebook alternative facts. And there's a lot of things that are said. And there was implosion that took place, imploding. And I was accused of stealing-- or not stealing, selling out, taking money. Or I had a house in Florida. All this stuff was on Facebook. And it's kind of humorous to me. I don't have Facebook. There's a reason, because if I did, I would go crazy. I'm already going crazy. Ask Nicole. So I don't watch social media. I don't pay attention to it. But someone will come, and they'll show me, look at what they're saying now. Well, the sad thing is it's our own members, and it's our own people who do this. But I forgive them. And I understand, especially when it gets tough. So if I didn't love my people, I'd probably be on Facebook myself and firing back. I know what you did. So that doesn't help anybody, though, if you react to negativity. It doesn't help me, doesn't help my wife, doesn't help my kids. So I have to let it go. I have to forgive them. And I could honestly look at them in the face and not have any ill feelings towards them, anybody who says anything bad about me. So this movement is something that started Standing Rock. And it is about water. But it's also about what each and every one of us can do, because we know that this Mother Earth is in trouble. And all we have to do is look at the facts. And I'm not trying to argue. I know there's this debate about climate change and global warming. Let's just set that aside for now. The temperature of this Earth is heating up. The ice caps are melting. Glaciers are disappearing. The ocean levels are rising. Currents are changing. Coral reefs are disappearing. These are facts. So there's something happening. And so we have to make a difference. And this is what this whole thing helped me understand. And I'm guilty too. I drive a car. I wear clothing that has petroleum in it, the dyes. Everything in this-- I could look here, and I could see petroleum products. It's not our fault. I get called a hypocrite because my wife and I own a gas station. But that's because that's the only thing available. And the means of transportation for us, for our community, is our vehicles. So it's OK. But now we have to make a change. And there's movements like this all the time. I like this one. Let's change all our light bulbs, so they're incandescent light bulbs. Now I'll reduce my carbon footprint. That's not enough anymore. And just for my community, we had this hardship that is there. And it's about trying to look at the kids, invest in the kids. We have to believe in them. So when you see someone, when you see a little one, this is the change. It's so simple. Life is simple. The change is acknowledge that little one. We acknowledge the baby. Acknowledge, and you'll see them light up. And believe in them. The children are going to be the ones who make the difference. And then, we can also do things. I don't know why we have plastic bottles. There's a lot of things that we can do. But we have to start creating the demand, because this country is ran with money and greed. We have a President who is driven by money and greed. So we have to create the demand and force that change. The reason why everything is in petroleum is because-- I don't know if you know who the Koch brothers are. They own Congress and all the rules and all the policies that allow for this pipeline. So this thing that happened at Standing Rock is greater than just Standing Rock. And there's something each and every one of us can do. I used to think it was at the individual level. That's not good enough. All of you will make that change individually. And we've seen it with Las Vegas. All the light bulbs are powered with renewable energy. A community doing it. And the only way we're going to change is if we get the United States to change. So it is something that's bigger. And I do believe that the creator is driving this. And it's possible. It's doable. And instead of saying, I'm guilty. I want to say, this is what I'm doing. I walked to Ithaca. I didn't walk here. It's too far to go. But we've got to create the alternatives, so we can all drive Teslas. We have to create the demand. Electricity can be produced with sun or with wind. And I think this is a perfect place to start. I know this community, this campus is moving in that direction. So I don't want to talk. I want to let you guys ask questions. I know there's a lot of questions that you might have. And I'll answer them. I didn't talk too much about the camp. I'll tell you right now, at the camp, there are people there. My focus with the camp is to make sure that we clean it and to make sure that people are safe. It is in the area where there's a flood zone. So we're going to continue to try to make sure people are not there. And it is a real risk, because of the amount of snow that we had, the cold temperatures, and the ice damming up and creating a potential flood. And when that flood hits, if it's not clean, we become the contaminators. And we don't want that. So that's our focus. That's been our focus the past three weeks. Nicole actually was out there and helping clean up. So this is what happened. 10,000 people, December 4. December 5, the snow storm hit. 10,000 people, a lot of them from California and the southern states. So I come out, and I say, it's OK to go home. You can go home. And there was about 1,200 people left. And that's a peace of mind, because I'm not worried about all the other people. But at the same time, when they left, they didn't take everything with them. So the things that they left behind is what we're cleaning up. And I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm just saying that I'm thankful nobody lost their life. And I'm thankful for the support. I'm thankful for this community and all the tribal nations who came. It's powerful when we unite. It's powerful when a collective group come together. And when we do it with prayer, there's all kinds of lessons. And I could tell you a whole bunch of things about the lessons that I was given by the creator. But that's another whole different seminar. It would probably take twice as long. So I'll ask if you guys have any questions. Just raise your hand, and I'll try to do my best to answer them. Go ahead. SPEAKER 2: First of all, I'd like to say welcome. I'm a Cayuga woman, so welcome to our lands here. I have a lot of questions. But we just seen it on the news earlier today that there was a deadline for everyone to move from the main camp. But they said that there was still 200 people there. DAVID ARCHAMBAULT: So what's happening is there is a flood risk. And the main camp is located off Standing Rock. So Standing Rock never gave an order. And in fact, Standing Rock has always been asking that the National Guard, the Morton County Police, the state government, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs do not use force to remove people. And we've always been concerned about safety. Because we're concerned about safety, and because we're concerned about the environment, we ask people to voluntarily leave. Now, that's where the implosion takes place. There's accusations that I'm doing that because I'm helping the pipeline go through. But I'm not. I'm worried about the environment. And I'm worried about the safety. So the orders that are coming out are coming from the state government. And that land, where the big camp is, is off Standing Rock. And it's on Morton County land. And there is an argument, when it comes to treaty land, that there's treaty land and then there's federal lands. Now, the argument that we have is there's a land dispute. We never ceded that land. And this case was tried in 1980 with the Black Hills. And the judge said that this was one of the worst things that ever happened to Native Americans, but you're not going to get your land back, the 60 million or the Black Hills. So there's still a land dispute. Now, what we're arguing with our treaty rights are hunting and fishing and water. We know that those three things have been successful in federal court. We know that the land dispute-- there was an attempt to settle. And we didn't accept that. But if we start that argument up here, I have to make sure all the Great Sioux Nation is on board, because what that's doing is that's putting it at risk. And all it will take is an act of Congress to say, you have to take that money. And it's done. And you don't have nothing. So we're not going there. Now, because we're not going there, the state is going to issue these eviction notice. There are 200 people there. And I'm still maintaining don't use force. We don't want anybody to get hurt. And we're really fortunate, if you think about how everything made out that no lives are lost. DAVID ARCHAMBAULT: And I appreciate all the support. And you can continue to do it I think this pipeline is one-- as a chairman, I deal with health care and the law enforcement. I deal with welfare. I deal with education. I deal with housing. I deal with everything that you could think of. And include the pipeline in there now. And include the people. So these are all the issues that I look at. And so when I base a decision, I look at how is it going to impact everything, not just the pipeline. So this is just one. And what I see with this new President coming in, everything is going to be attacked, our economies, our health care, our education. So it's a real threat. And we have to stand up and make it go beyond this pipeline. I can't tell you how much I appreciate everybody, the non-Indians, the Indians from around the world, who came. If we focus everything on this pipeline, there's a lot of other things at risk. We have to stand up. And on March 10, we're going to rise in Washington to let this Congress know. And then, we're going to let this President, this administration know that we're still here. And we've been here. Regardless of what this country has done to us, we're going to continue to be here. And it doesn't matter which administration. If you can't go to DC at that time, you can have a movement. And I know you have movements here in support. What are some things at home that can change. And I know it's beautiful that we stand up for this. But for my community, I need my members to stand up against meth now, because meth is killing our people. I need our community to stand up against pollution. There's a lot of things that we can start standing up now. And this movement, it's an awakening. It's time now. It's time to do something and no longer sit back. I get two questions asked every time I go somewhere. But it's more like this. I'm fine. I'm good. I have prayer. I have the creator. I have my family. I'm OK. And what I say is follow your heart. You need to follow your heart. And your heart will tell you what to do. And it's that simple. Life is simple. So mni wiconi in our language, it means life giving water. So there are a lot of things that give life. And there is a tag line that says life is war. Our water is life. So if we start to interpret those three words. So if something equals something, it goes both ways. So I would say water is like. Life is water. It's a source of life. So there are many things that are sources. There are four things that are sources of life. So life to me is an experience. We are all here in a moment in time. And we are experiencing things that we have to pass on. And we need to take the lessons that we learn in this moment, pass them forward. And to me, it's precious. Life is precious. DAVID ARCHAMBAULT: No, I didn't. What I did-- KARIM-ALY KASSAM: That's enough questions from one person. Because we don't want to accuse our guests. DAVID ARCHAMBAULT: No, I'll answer that one question. And I never used BIA. What the BIA does is they are the administrators or the trustees of allotted land. And so when somebody is out of compliance with allotted land, this happens all the time. The BIA will issue a trespass order. And so I'm informed when they do things, but it's not something that I have asked for. Again, I asked that there's no force used, whenever they carry out their actions. And I've been thankful for all the support. And I appreciate everybody who has come. DAVID ARCHAMBAULT: Media. So from the beginning, there has been concern that mass media will not cover this. So there's different types of mediums to get the message out. There's different ways to tell stories. And there's radio. There's television. There's news. There's movies. And then, we have social media. So what social media did was it helped this movement go worldwide. When social media came about, people from all around the world got to see firsthand what's happening. And that also allowed for mass media to have to turn and take a look. And so we have had major networks like CNN, MSNBC. There's just different ones that came up and did a story. But it's not the media that we had hoped for. And I think some of it has to do with politics and the type of stories that they want to cover. One time, we had an interview set up with CNN. And then, something happened in North Carolina. So they left. And they didn't want to be here. What I took for granted was all media that was there was there to help with the movement, because we were not getting the attention that we're supposed to. And when I took that for granted, then I did an interview. And that's why the question came up. What they do is they take what you say, and they splice it. And they only show what they want. So it doesn't help. What it does is it creates division. And what made this movement so powerful was the unity and the togetherness. And so when I took that for granted, and these other medias came in to do interview, I assume that they were there to look good. That's OK, though. I don't hold anything against them. I don't hold anything against anyone that has a resentment towards me. I have to let it go. And I have to forgive them. And I believe that the creator's only there to help, and he's going to guide us. Go ahead. We have a lot of relatives that have gone. And we started this two years ago. And we don't have any intention in stopping, regardless of what happens. And we understood that from the beginning that there's always a chance. Even if this pipeline gets through, it doesn't mean that we're going to stop. We're always going to pursue-- we'll appeal. And we'll go as far as we can with this. We won't stop. The big camp is in a floodplain. And there is a little high ground there. But that's off. Now, the other camp that has started-- I was put in a hard position, because my intention has always been for the safety of people. And I wanted to set up an area so that people will move. And this is when it was nice. And I made that available. And then, at that time, people at the camp said, we're not moving. We're not going to move. But I still wanted to make that available. And what happened was the community of Cannon Ball passed a resolution saying, please close the camps. And that was passed, given to our tribal council. So our tribal council has to listen to the members. And then, I follow out the orders of our resolutions that are passed. So it didn't allow me to put the land aside for them. So there are some private landowners that are saying their land is available. So it really gets difficult. And people really don't understand all the things that I have to deal with. They make assumptions. And that's OK. I'm all right with that. They'll attack me. And I just-- I have to listen to our members. And I have to try to do what's best to assure that people are safe and that this environment that we are occupying is safe. KARIM-ALY KASSAM: Well, Chairman Archambault, thank you very much.

      "Sentences":["The pipeline, which has been projected to transport at least 470,000 barrels of oil per day over 1,100 miles from the Bakken oil field to an existing hub in Illinois for delivery to refineries on the Gulf Coast, was rerouted in 2014 from north of Bismarck to the south, taking it through unceded treaty lands of the Sioux. Pipeline construction over this altered route desecrated sacred ancestral sites, and, until last Sunday, was slated to cross the Missouri River at the Lake Oahe reservoir, which would have threatened the safety of the drinking water of the Standing Rock Sioux and millions of people downstream. Veterans For Peace (VFP), on whose board of directors I currently serve, is one of these organizations. We released a solidarity statement in September. A number of our members have been actively involved in the campaign. As of last week, DAPL construction was all but completed. Then, last Sunday, following various legal decisions over many months that allowed the pipeline construction to continue, the easement to cross Lake Oahe was abruptly denied by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The announcement came down just hours before an evacuation order for the Oceti Sakowin Camp, which was issued by USACE in late November, was set to take effect. USACE added that it would be undertaking an environmental impact statement (EIS) to examine possible alternate pipeline routes. After months of waves of brutal crackdown tactics perpetrated against the water protectors by militarized police and private DAPL security forces, which included the use of attack dogs, sonic cannons, concussion grenades, rubber bullets, pepper spray, and water cannons in freezing temperatures, thousands of veterans, under the operation banner Veterans Stand For Standing Rock (VSSR), organized by Wesley Clark, Jr. (son of retired U.S. Army General and former presidential candidate Wesley Clark,) and Marine veteran Michael A. Wood, Jr., converged at Standing Rock to stand in solidarity with the resistance. Based at least in part on their military experience, many of the veterans who joined VSSR wanted to intervene in and stop long-standing U.S. imperial policy of waging war for resources against vulnerable peoples. They understood that this was not something strictly happening abroad; it was also happening at home. They recognized that the violence against the water protectors was an expression of rampant U.S. militarism and structural white supremacy. They were aware that the targeting of Indigenous sovereignty by a colonial power is a strategic tool, used to dispirit, conquer and exterminate. They knew that the genocidal war against American Indians has never ended. Rather, it abates periodically until more resources are coveted, such as oil and lands to lay pipeline. Violation of the basic human rights of our Native sisters and brothers in the name of profit has been a recurring theme throughout U.S. history, often carried out through acts of state terrorism. The militaristic response by the state of North Dakota and ETP toward the unarmed water protectors has been one of the most blatant examples of this theme to unfold in modern times. The veterans of VSSR, like the activists who came to Standing Rock before, could not stand idly by and allow these abuses to continue. This is why especially courageous veterans seem to get along so well with American Indians. It is reasonable to believe that the convergence of veterans at Standing Rock influenced the decision, even if only in some small way. Officials may have been acting to prevent conditions that could have led to a confrontation between law enforcement and the veterans, which would have been a national tragedy and a political nightmare. All things considered, the veterans played a small but important role in a much larger effort to prevent DAPL from crossing Lake Oahe. More specifically, it was a win for the Standing Rock Sioux and the millions of non-Native people who would have been put at risk by DAPL going under the Missouri. It is an affirmation of the strength of the resistance, which demonstrated that prayerful people, guided by the virtues of fortitude, courage, humility and peacefulness, can indeed overcome enormous adversity. The power of nonviolence that was harnessed by the Native-led struggle on the North Dakota prairie over eight long months chipped away at the foundation of plutocratic and corporate interests that frequently put profit over people. Only time will tell if ETP has indeed been defeated. In a statement released by ETP just hours after the easement denial was announced, the company vowed to push forward with the pipeline on the route that takes it through treaty lands and under Lake Oahe. We know that the incoming Trump administration has different financial and business ties to the fossil fuel industry. The fight to force ETP to re-route the pipeline is probably not over. People should continue to divest from the banks financing the pipeline and urge these banks to reconsider their funding. People should contact their elected officials and demand justice for Standing Rock, including investigations into the hostile and unconstitutional acts of Governor Dalrymple and his police. History tells us that settler colonialism, environmental racism and corporate fascism are three very resilient evils. The resistance must be equally resilient. It is imperative that we put our trust not in the promises of government but in the actions of people who hold their government accountable to those promises. Nonviolent direct action has been proven to work in grassroots movements and campaigns against oppression. We are on the same page. I too came up with a ten point agenda for Kerala. 1.

The action came after police in North Dakota used projectiles, chemical sprays and water cannon jets in freezing temperatures Sunday night. Water protectors were attempting to remove barricades on a bridge on Highway 1806 they say prevent emergency vehicles from accessing the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Video from a live stream at the scene showed a high pressure jet of water hitting activists directly in temperatures below 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Medics estimate more than 160 water protectors were injured. The Dakota Access pipeline has sparked unified opposition from Native Americans who say the project violates tribal sovereignty and endangers the drinking water supply for millions of people who depend upon the Missouri River. Water protectors have used both the courts and protest encampments to attempt to prevent the completion of the pipeline that is slated to carry fracked oil from the Bakken formation in North Dakota to a distribution hub in Illinois. The editorial board of The New York Times echoed calls by water protectors Wednesday for President Barack Obama to take up the matter. And the Associated Press reported Friday that President-elect Donald Trump owns stock in companies developing the pipeline. Trump has thus far resisted putting his assets into a blind trust while serving as President, raising concerns about numerous conflicts-of-interest during his administration since the executive branch writes regulations and enforces laws that could affect his businesses and investments in private life."],

      "Sentences":["TransCanada, the company that operates the pipeline, said in a statement that about 5,000 barrels of oil had leaked in Marshall County, South Dakota. One barrel holds 42 gallons, meaning the spill involved roughly 210,000 gallons of oil. According to TransCanada, the pipeline was shut down at 6 a.m. following a recorded drop in pressure. Thursday. The leak happened in a rural area about 3 miles southeast of the town of Amherst. Images from the scene showed a group of trucks congregated along a rural road. He said the oil was unlikely to reach the aquifer in the area, which is located between 800 and 900 feet underground. It is unclear how long it will take to clean up the spill. TransCanada did not respond to multiple BuzzFeed News requests for comment. The pipeline where the spill took place is part of the Keystone Pipeline System, which according to TransCanada stretches across 2,687 miles. An extension of the system, called the Keystone XL, was the source of controversy and protests for years before the Obama administration finally rejected it in 2015. Earlier this year, however, the Trump administration approved the project. A number of environmental groups condemned TransCanada and the pipeline in the wake of Thursday's spill, including Friends of the Earth, NextGen America, and the Center for Biological Diversity. The spill also comes just four days before regulators in Nebraska are set to decide if they will allow the Keystone XL pipeline to pass through their state. Walsh said the section where Thursday's leak occurred began operations sometime around 2010, and Flute said it was greeted with less controversy than the XL project. The pipeline has leaked before. In April 2016, TransCanada told regulators 187 gallons of oil had spilled, but later revised that number up to nearly 17,000 gallons. Submit it here.

The deployment of 17 WSP (Wisconsin State Patrol) personnel syncs with a government-imposed deadline for protests to end. Similar to a blockade of food, water, and supplies months ago, this new eviction is framed as a safety precaution. Following eviction orders, 150 protesters marched out arm-in-arm. According to Wisconsin State Journal, ceremonial fires were lit shortly before arrests began. Numerous sources have reported about 10 water protectors arrested for not leaving. Officials claim the 17 WSP personnel volunteered for a nine-day stint at the reservation. Currently, personnel are arriving as arrests, raids, and surveillance continues. Last time, Wisconsin law enforcement pulled out after mass outrage back home. That force coalesced over 40 officers from various departments, including WSP. Upon returning, however, Wisconsin EMAC (Emergency Management Assistance Compact) produced a telling after-action report. Nevertheless, Wisconsin sought to learn from Standing Rock for similar future actions. The Fifth Column News covered these recommendations, among which included training officers in videography. In the most recent DAPL (Dakota Access Pipeline) raids, officers are doing just that. According to Wisconsin State Journal, the officers sent to Standing Rock were all volunteers. New blazes were then lit by officers, which many incorrectly believed were tipis. Although no clashes occurred, officers did sport Trump 2016 stickers on some vehicles which made protesters uneasy. Officers then left for the opposite hills, setting up entrenched positions until raiding the camp days ago.

      "Sentences":["Resistance to the murder of Keith Lamont Scott took many shapes, ranging from prayer vigils to marches and property destruction. Forty-one people were arrested by Charlotte police (CPD) that night, and an additional twelve would be arrested over the following days for activity that allegedly occurred on the 21st. Through social media, police have made clear they are seeking to arrest more individuals for the events of the 21st, many of them for property destruction. At least 95 warrants have been signed in relation to the Charlotte protest. The circulation of their images serve two purposes: the first is actually crowd-sourcing information, and the second is a reminding demonstrators that they are being watched. State surveillance and the political persecution of people fighting for social justice is well known and documented; it has been ongoing for decades. What is new, however, is that many people are now documenting acts of resistance in real time and publicly sharing their footage. This documentation is being viewed and cataloged by police for general intel purposes and also as evidence used to charge specific demonstrators. Documenting resistance and sharing that documentation is essential for inspiring others and creating a culture of resistance. The question for those documenting resistance in solidarity with the movement is how we can continue our work without assisting law enforcement and thus facilitating the criminalization of our fellow demonstrators. The following is not an answer, but merely a series of suggestions informed by my experience documenting resistance in Chicago; they are meant to provoke a larger conversation around how those with cameras can love and protect our fellow protesters. If you are acting in solidarity with the movement, you have a responsibility to review your content before sharing it on social media. This can mean waiting to upload content or dropping to the back or side to review it before posting. If you capture police brutality on film but are worried that taken out context, it may be incriminating, share that footage with a movement lawyer before publicizing it. For live streamers, it is doubly important to be aware of your surroundings and how action is developing. Live streams provide no opportunity to remove footage from circulation, as most platforms are backing up the video as you stream. Your lens could also be trained on police during times when you need to avoid filming demonstrators. Photos taken by demonstrators, movement media and journalists can also be used for data collection and supporting or creating charges. The frozen-in-time sight of a hand on an officer while reaching for balance becomes felony assault, an arm extended proves a punch thrown, real or imagined. In the past year, Chicago Police have used images from the Chicago Tribune twice to back up or create fabricated charges against protesters. Many news agencies want to be in good standing with police in order to get information when breaking news is happening, and keeping that good relationship means cooperating with authorities. In the past year, there has been a dramatic increase in the infiltration of street actions by right-wing media . Some of these so-called journalists are employed by right-wing media outlets like Breitbart, while others are just overzealous racists and misogynists trying to discredit the movement. Others will silently try to blend into demonstrations, hoping to catch incriminating footage to hand over to law enforcement. It should be noted that many of them have lawyers tailing them, and these right-wing pundits often try to sue people for assault after having been removed from a demonstration. For many people, this means masking up. Although the culture surrounding masking up is often extremely problematic, including heavy doses of toxic masculinity, there are many reasons why someone might want to mask up. For example, in 2012, I was fired from my job for simply appearing in one too many Occupy related press photos. This experience is not unusual; many people are harassed by employers, friends, neighbors, or family members for participating in political activity. If you are documenting protests in solidarity with the movement you have a responsibility to review footage before sharing it online. It is important to remember that on top of unfriendly or irresponsible live streamers, the press, and closed circuit cameras, many police departments are now filming protests themselves. Police footage is used for documenting activity, identifying individuals, and understanding protest tactics. With the proliferation of body cameras, many officers have become walking surveillance units. Surveillance can go both ways, of course. Rather than training our cameras on each other, we could be focusing on filming the police. Copwatching also has many practical applications outside of a protest environment. In the past two years, the importance of documenting police encounters has been made abundantly clear, from Ramsey Orta filming the execution of Eric Garner by NYPD to the countless instances of police brutality captured by live streamers at protests across the country. Even if you feel the footage shows the police misbehaving or being violent, it is best to run footage that features any demonstrators by a movement lawyer before releasing it to the public.
