Another Twitter user said they had witnessed a protestor turn down tap water to spend donations on 'fluoride free' water. It says protestors should avoid drugs and alcohol, engage with the elders, and refrain from playing guitars around campfires. The North Dakota Pipeline protest was sparked by plans to construct a 1,170-mile long pipeline which would run across four states. Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline, says that it has taken measures to prevent leaks, and that there is no archaeological significance to the area. Standing Rock protests continue: 'Water is life' Thousands of people have been gathering to support the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in their legal battle against the plan. On Saturday activists protesting the continued construction of the pipeline were told to shut down one of their camps by 5 December in a letter sent to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's leader by the Army Corps. However US authorities said on Sunday that they had no plans to forcibly remove activists. The US Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the federal land where the main protest camp is located, said in a statement that anyone who remained would be considered unauthorised and could be subject to various citations. It also said emergency services might not be adequately provided to the area. High profile supporters who have expressed their support for the cause include Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, Lupita Nyong'o, Whoopi Goldberg and Mark Ruffalo.

Things went from bad to worse on October 21, when the pipeline's supporters attacked a group of protesters, killing one, wounding eight, and causing substantial property damage. The Yaqui tribe, which has endured a long history of repression, has also a history of resistance. Like other indigenous communities in Mexico, several members of the Yaqui tribe have lost their lives fighting against invasive private companies and non-indigenous authorities. Just two years ago, before the conflict over the Agua Prieta pipeline, the Yaquis protested against a large-scale aqueduct that would have diverted what was left of their sacred river to the city of Hermosillo. According to its design, the Agua Prieta pipeline project stretches from Arizona, in the United States, to Sonora, Mexico. One portion of the pipeline is to cross 90 kilometers into Yaqui territory, which is protected by Mexican law. Building the pipeline without fair, transparent, and inclusive consultations with all the Yaqui communities would be a violation of the sovereignty of the Yaqui land, community leaders say. They are those who do not care if an indigenous government falls. They are those who do not care if the Yaqui culture is exterminated. They have received threats because they opposed the signing of the collective permit for the construction of the pipeline. Last month, Gema Villela Valenzuela reported that members of the Yaqui community are still receiving threats for opposing the pipeline. This article was published previously by Global Voices.

Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the pipeline, released a statement saying it was still committed to building under the river. Tribe members and environmentalists feared damage to local water supplies and the desecration of sacred land. The tribe successfully mobilized national support, with demonstrators marching in Washington, DC, and elsewhere to pressure the government to abandon the construction. Sunday's decision represents a huge win for the local tribe and their supporters, as well as a dramatic shift in the reaction of authorities, who had previously ordered all demonstrators to leave the campsite by Monday.

They are concerned the 69-mile pipeline may be expanded or the amount of oil that flows through it may be increased. They are also worried about plans to expand the larger Trans Mountain Pipeline that runs through Canada and connects with the local pipeline. The Canadian government announced May 29 plans to purchase the Trans Mountain Pipeline system from Kinder Morgan to ensure completion of the planned expansion. That system includes the Puget Sound Pipeline spur. Those four refineries currently receive more than half the oil sent through the Trans Mountain Pipeline across Alberta and British Columbia, according to Kinder Morgan documents. While the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion plan focuses on construction in Alberta and British Columbia, the potential to expand the Puget Sound Pipeline as well is penciled into some Kinder Morgan documents. Local refineries have not said whether the planned Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion or a potential Puget Sound Pipeline expansion would impact them. The Andeavor Anacortes Refinery did not respond to a request for comment. A document filed Feb. 20 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission states that although Kinder Morgan does not have plans to expand the Puget Sound Pipeline, its capacity could be increased from 240,000 to 500,000 barrels per day. In recent years, the pipeline has operated below capacity. Between 2015 and 2017, it moved an average of 180,000 barrels per day to the refineries in Whatcom and Skagit counties, according to Kinder Morgan documents. No plans to expand While there are no current plans to expand the local pipeline, Liestman and several other representatives of environmental organizations and indigenous communities who spoke Thursday said they have concerns about the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion and what it would mean for Washington. Their primary concerns are that the planned expansion would increase tanker traffic in the Salish Sea and increase the amount of oil that would be exported overseas, burned and contribute to climate change. According to Kinder Morgan, the expansion would include building a second pipeline alongside the existing Trans Mountain route between Edmonton, Alberta, and Burnaby, British Columbia. A marine port in Burnaby, near Vancouver, would also be expanded in order to ship more oil overseas, according to Kinder Morgan documents. The Associated Press reported that the number of oil tankers moving oil from Alberta through the Salish Sea would increase from 60 to 400 as a result of the pipeline expansion. Washington Gov. Tribal and environmental leaders in Washington, along with First Nations and environmental leaders in British Columbia, have spoken out against and protested the expansion plans for several years.

'Money is real tight but I've lived this life and I can survive. I'm not going anywhere. 'We'll find out who is going to go and who is going to stay come the blizzard. My family know I'm part of the movement and there's nowhere else I can be right now.

The 1,172-mile oil pipeline, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), is in its final stages of construction apart from a section tunneling under Lake Oahe, a half-mile from the reservation. The pipeline will allow half a million barrels of oil to flow from North Dakota to Illinois each day. A snowstorm and 45mph winds have pounded the nearby Standing Rock Indian reservation this week They also contend that millions of people who live downstream from the pipeline are at risk of crude oil leaks and spills. This week, North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple said it was 'probably not feasible' to reroute the pipeline - which was originally intended to run north of the city of Bismarck, around 50 miles from the Sioux tribe's land. There are other smaller, offshoot camps - Sacred Stone, Rosebud and Red Warrior. The camp was founded by a Sioux family in April but now non-native activists outweigh Native Americans. Hundreds of tribes are represented at the camp and their flags line the perimeter and fly from individual dwellings. At one point, numbers were believed to have swelled to around 8,000 but snowstorms and freezing conditions have driven out many who were ill-equipped to withstand the conditions.

She sounded a note of warning after the blizzard this week left many on the camp in dire situations The campsite is littered with flimsy summer tents which have collapsed beneath piles of snow, while stoves and portable heaters are being moved in by those who remain. Tent and teepee walls are being lined with blankets and sleeping bags to retain warmth. People are being drawn to the sacred fires burning at the camp both as a constant source of heat and to listen to drumming, prayers and Native American songs. Vats of free, hot tea are positioned outside a number of tents as an aid to the 'camp cough' which many activists have developed after months in the cold. Around seven free kitchens dish out plates of pasta and stews, cooked and served by volunteers. Entire families are living at the camp including dozens of children, and three babies have been born there. This coming Monday, an eviction notice from the Obama administration will 'close' all lands where the camps have been established. The camps are located on US Army Corps of Engineers land. State officials ordered activists to leave the camp on Monday, due to 'state of emergency weather conditions'.

The Standing Rock tribe filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming that the US Army Corps of Engineers failed to properly consult them. The lawsuit alleged that the Corps were in breach of the Clean Water Act by allowing the pipe to go so close to their reservation. 'The pipeline has destroyed 86 documented burial sites but they are treating us like domestic terrorists. 'We are the original environmental activists. We have been protecting water and the land for generations and now in the 21st century, we are doing the same. At the camp, preparations are underway to bed in for the rest of the winter amid calls by tribal elders for protesters to remain calm. On Thursday, Faith Spotted Eagle, from the Ihanktonwan Dakota Territory in South Dakota, urged activists not to engage in direct actions against the pipeline workers or authorities which could risk the Treaties of Native American tribes. She asked that those at the camp follow the advice of the Oceti Sakowin leadership and remain in ceremonial prayer. But a violent flare-up last month has left many activists feeling the need to be prepared. Water cannons were sprayed on demonstrators in freezing conditions.

Protesters say she was struck by a police flash grenade, while police have suggested that protesters may have caused the explosion. According to the Morton County Sheriff's Department, more than 500 people have been arrested in the last month. One woman has been charged with attempted murder for allegedly trying to shoot dead a cop as one of the camps was cleared. According to the Morton County State Attorney, Red Fawn Falls, 37, fired three shots at police officers and had to have her gun wrestled out of her arm by cops as she was arrested. Falls allegedly hit one officer in the knee which caused it to 'explode' before she was wrestled to the ground. She has now been charged with attempted murder among other offences and faces 20 years in jail. On Thursday, the Morton County Sheriff's Department released video of two female deputies describing how protesters attempted to use ropes and grappling hooks to break the wiring set up to stop trespassing on private property. According to the sheriff's department, the protestors, who identified themselves as veterans, threatened the female deputies saying law enforcement officers 'should be ready for what's coming'. Lana Jack, of the Celilowy'am tribe in Oregon, is in charge of coordinating the donations. She sounded a note of warning after the blizzard this week left many on the camp in dire situations. 'For three days we didn't have any donations, we were completely cut off. We have not been able to keep people warm. I had a 78-year-old man who came in desperate for help after lying out in the cold. 'We had no propane gas tanks to provide heating for elders and families who were collapsing in the snow. She added: 'We were totally lacking but our people have come together. But we don't have the capacity to take care of more people. We need heavy tents, lumber and propane.' Lana claimed that three trucks had been confiscated by police while bringing supplies to Standing Rock from Bismarck. On Tuesday, state officials said anyone bringing prohibited items into the main protest camp would be fined. There had been threats of a physical blockade on the way to the camp but authorities seem to have retreated from that plan. Instead officers will stop vehicles which appear to be heading to Standing Rock with building supplies and food. that there is a concerted effort going on to make sure people are prepared. Kyle Machulski a volunteer builder from Washington State has come to Standing Rock to lend a helping hand in building shelters and residences at Standing Rock She said: 'The winterization crew is working with elders and Lakota people and guests here at Standing Rock. They have put up kitchens, you name it. Everyone is pitching in and doing good work here at Standing Rock. She said that she didn't believe that the harsh weather or the eviction notice would cause many to leave. So nobody's leaving. Small homes, constructed from plywood and padded with insulation, are popping up around the camp. He has spent the past two weeks volunteering projects around the camp approved by elders in order to help winterize living conditions. Flags border the area surrounding the camp, which sits just on the edge of the Standing Rock reservation 'We are working with donated materials that have been delegated for this project in order to help winterize living conditions,' he said. 'Each house is approved by the tribe's elders. Art coordinator Mary Zeiser arrived at the camp two months ago as part of creative direct action group, Ruckus Society. 'Our message is this is a safe space for people to come and heal. Everyone is welcome. We work through a creative resistance.'

The nine people had refused commands to leave the area, Iverson said. Iverson said authorities had given a group of protesters who agreed to be arrested an additional two hours but that group did not materialize. He said authorities were patient and gave people multiple warnings to back up and leave the roadway outside the camp entrance. Some people backed off, he said.

The band government voted to not renew easement rights of way for the pipeline that runs from Superior east across Michigan. The band also called for the decommissioning and removal of the pipeline from all Bad River lands and the river's watershed. Blanchard told the News Tribune that the action was taken at a council meeting Wednesday. Bad River Band officials have directed staff to begin planning for the Line 5 removal project development and the environmental issues and hazards that exist with removal of old pipeline, including a health study, pipeline contents recycling and disposal and surface restoration. According to the band, 15 individual grant of easement rights of way for Line 5 expired in 2013. The two sides have been in negotiations since then over renewing the easements. The band owns interest in 11 of the 15 parcels of land within the grant of easement rights of way, roughly parallel to U.S. Highway 2. Enbridge, formerly Lakehead Pipeline Co., has leased an easement for the oil line since the pipeline was laid in 1953. Enbridge has responded to the band's requests for information and negotiated in good faith for the past three and a half years. In addition to working toward a mutually beneficial agreement,'' the company said in a statement. The company said it's weighing its options. It's not clear if the pipeline could be rerouted around the tribal land. That was an option considered in 2009 when the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa considered not allowing Enbridge's Alberta Clipper pipeline to cross reservation land in Carlton County. The two sides eventually agreed on an easement fee, however, avoiding a pipeline route that diverted around the reservation. The action comes as the ongoing dispute over the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota settles into a cold winter standoff, with both tribal rights and environmental activists protesting both the potential environmental damage from any spill and the movement of additional oil, the burning of which climate experts blame for global climate change. The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa has about 7,000 members. The reservation covers about 124,000 acres east of Ashland where the Bad River meets Lake Superior. Enbridge's Line 5 hasn't received much attention in the Northland compared to other Enbridge projects but it has become a focal point of concern in Michigan. Critics fear the line could pollute the Great Lakes where a segment of the line runs underwater at the Straits of Mackinac, which link Lake Michigan and Lake Huron."}

The standoff to stop the Dakota Access pipeline is reaching a fever pitch, and this may be our last chance to halt construction before Donald Trump takes office. Militarized law enforcement and private security firms are harassing, assaulting and jailing hundreds of non-violent protesters who are fighting for indigenous rights and to curb climate change. They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The push for a Standing Rock national monument is picking up steam and has the backing of progressive powerhouse Sen. Bernie Sanders. This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. Thanks for all you do. Ibid."}

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has vowed to fight the president's order to push ahead with the pipeline despite the US Army Corps of Engineers stating it would cancel its planned environmental impact study and grant a permit for construction of the final phase of the pipeline beneath Lake Oahe to go ahead. The protest camps are being prepared for flooding that is expected to come as temperatures increase. The veterans' presence will present a challenge to law enforcement wishing to remove water protectors from the area. Previous clashes between security officials and protesters have been violent, with police deploying water cannons, rubber bullets and teargas at protesters. Private contractors also set dogs on the demonstrators. More than 1,000 veterans came to Standing Rock in December. Whilst there, they apologized to Native Americans for the US government's treatment of the country's indigenous people. Veterans Stand doesn't expect the same veteran presence as before, but it will provide support to the camps through its fundraising.

This is a discourse circulated by agents and institutions of the settler state. Settler states manage violence by demanding that Natives be nonviolent, even as the state has itself been animated through, and continues to enact, colonial violence. Photo courtesy of Jaida Grey Eagle. However, an observatory spokesperson clarified the hole was not caused by a bullet but, instead, damage from an adjacent bolt fixture. It has a clear counterpart in the violence at Standing Rock, where Oceti Sakowin oppose another settler-colonial capitalist development, the DAPL. While thousands have organized at Standing Rock to protest the construction of this gargantuan pipeline, the water protectors have been marked violent in their defense of Indigenous life, land, and water against this violence of settler-colonial capitalism. The supposed violence of water protectors produces a discourse that both grants and defers settler state violence. Police, military, and private security forces have subjected water protectors to insidious violence in the forms of tear gas, dog attacks, strip searches, tortuous hooding, sound cannons, concussion grenades, and more. On October 27, approximately three hundred police and military personnel, dressed in riot gear and armed with automatic rifles, raided the front-line treaty camp and arrested more than 140 water protectors. Snipers, armored vehicles, helicopters, and military-grade Humvees were deployed. And yet it is water protectors who have been marked as violent. The Indigenous movements against TMT and DAPL expose the precariousness of the settler state. Lisa Ford (2010, 3) argues that the depiction of Indigenous violence was a precursor of sovereignty talk; the management of violence is thus an originary source of settler state power. Mark Rifkin (2009) suggests such a settler-colonial state of exception demonstrates the emptiness of settler sovereignty over Native peoples and territories. These movements are teaching us just this. References Alfred, Taiaiake. 2005. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. Fanon, Frantz. 2004. In The Wretched of the Earth, translated by Richard Philcox.

Between that and everything that has to be done the blog has taken a back seat while I am keeping track of whats going on in BC politics on my phone. That is, until I found out about this. And to be honest I was so upset when I read this I literally had to go whisper swear words into my pillow because the kids were sleeping. It just goes against every bone in our bodies. Well Merry Christmas Premier Clark. Happy New Year Ms. McDonald. Too late. Its been cleared. Would have made a nice park site to bring tourism into the region along with all the other amazing features in this area of the Peace but no, Premier Clarks vow to get the dam past the point of no return is more important than our collective history, or the Treaty 8 lands the dam infringes on. And now, people are losing their homes and land they have worked for generations and treaty rights are being ignored completely while a decision from the Supreme Court of Canada is waited on that has the capability of putting an end to all of this. The precedent set in the recent Enbridge case bolsters this case. But you will not hear of these expropriations on the evening news. You will hear about someone on instagram winning a KFC scented candle. You will see the latest Christmas fashions or the most tasty cocktails. But you will not hear about these people losing their homes and what Hydro did to get to this point. There will be no critical examination of why or how this dam was refused by the BCUC twice already, so the province exempted it from a third review under the guise of the Clean Energy plan. You will not hear that the power is not needed. Or some kind of bafflegab that inevitably goes unquestioned. Umm. Ok. And you will read Vaughn Palmer gloss over the very big geotechnical issues that have had Hydro execs fly up at a moments notice when the walls of the riverbanks start collapsing onto roads workers have been going up and down. Because the government ignored its own report that said the banks and geology was so unstable and prone to slides further development should be minimized.. Now Vaughn says this project is so advanced no government would kill it. And to be honest, that may be true. But I would remind Premier Clark , Horgan and Vaughn Palmer of the biggest boondoggle Newfoundland Labrador has ever seen, the dam project known as Muskrat Falls. You see, the history of Muskrat and Site C are so very similar. Governments wanting a big legacy project. They stymied their provincial regulator and did not give them all the info they needed. So the good people of Newfoundland Labrador were screwed. Here in BC the government exempted the same review. No independent body has ever examined the info Hydro has concocted and some of it has already been shown to be inaccurate. But the massive geotechnical issues that have resulted in work being redone over and over again, are going to blow a hole in that. And who knows what will happen in the years to come. Research shows mega dam projects often increase in cost to nearly double. On a dam you have to try to find a customer for.. and that no one has verified info on. Having said that, it is unseemly. Like Mike Duffy and Pamela Martin. For years we got faces implying neutrality but who, in the end, showed their bias in the extreme. And, as Laila says, the TRUTH HAS NO AGENDA. Went media-for-money. And then morphed DEEP GREEN. One of a kind. In fact it should have been done 5 years ago. December 9, 2016 12:37 pm at 12:37 pm randyhadland BC Hydro and the BC Liberals have done more damage to the BC economy with their efforts to build Site C than they have done to the valley environment as of yet. To do as much damage as she has and still smile is beyond sick and sociopathic, it borders on sadistic. She is practically salivating. They are the turkeys just before Thanksgiving anticipating the holidays to come. They are right to do so. December 9, 2016 8:39 am at 8:39 am Hugh Using clean hydro power to run natural gas and LNG plants means that the natural gas that would normally power the plant can then be exported and burned, releasing GHGs. There is SO much negative about this project and this government that its difficult to know where to start. My heart goes out to the Boons, but I suppose their case could be worse. With any luck the slopes will sluff in and the project will be aborted. Bet the Fort St. John hoteliers are not to happy with THAT competition. Best of the season to you. BC has indeed killed a project after money has been invested. And it was an NDP government that did it. Makes me even more determined to help the Peace Valley landowners and First Nations in their fight to stop this abomination. December 10, 2016 3:36 pm at 3:36 pm Lew Three questions immediately come to mind with me after reading the Vancouver Sun and New York Times articles. December 10, 2016 4:18 pm at 4:18 pm JDC Ever so slightly off topic, Lew. Apologies. whose business it is to mess in elections believe that the US election was messed with by the Russians. Instead we got the Alex Fraser bridge closure. Maybe a snow depth measurement. Marvel Comix gets closer to the truth than does POSTMEDIA . December 10, 2016 5:32 pm at 5:32 pm Lew Yes. This in the face of extensive evidence and expert opinion that the project is not required, and is not in the public interest for many reasons. And the Vancouver Sun (and most other local media) serves up coverage of it that would result in a failing grade if submitted as a paper in the first term at any school of journalism. Send in the clowns. Even if Horgan says nothing about Site-C, it is still designed to be NDP-toxic. The NDP has to be very, very careful on this issue as a result. A trap is laid at virtually every approach, just as planned from the beginning. Christy will do everything to keep it sloganeering, punchy-one-liners. Christy is very rude and has no qualm about interrupting and drowning opponents out with superior volume during these televised opportunities. Here is one of the places to detail the perfidy of Site-C. And to list all that, take all day. December 10, 2016 5:52 pm at 5:52 pm nonconfidencevote Well, well well. The trouble with this entire construction project is the lack of a budgetting process. car if I cant tell them what the car will cost. Its a violation of every basic accounting principle that large corporations are legally OBLIGATED to follow and most hold dear. Unfortunately this Dam will take years to complete and Clark will probaly walk away at the 11th hour and wipe her hands of the entire fiscal mess. Jail is too good for these lying, theiving scum. If the NDP come to power they should stop it in its tracks and AUDIT EVERYTHING. She deigned to visit our community exactly twice in all that time and sat there smiling and asking what the community volunteers had done. She acted like our proud mom, not our champion. They are willing accomplices. They are useless. They are getting paid to do nothing. A jellyfish has more of a spine that a career politician. Please go back to high school and learn how to write. December 17, 2016 8:04 pm at 8:04 pm Jdc Sorry, Astro. You are right. I tried to be too brief in my condemnation when only a tome would have a chance at describing their inadequacy. Mind you, it would take a small library to document the destructive evil manifest by the Liberals insatiable greed and corruption. Let me guess. Banishment forever is a likely result. Then let me make it easier for you. The current system as it stands is failing the voters. Hence the election of the lunatic fringe like Donald Trump. Voters are willing to try anything to shake up the status quo. Democracy is a joke, bought and paid for by special interests. But at least we get to toss out the ruling party every election unless the NDP squanders another election. We do not need the power, not even for LNG. It would not be enough anyway. December 18, 2016 1:27 pm at 1:27 pm John's Aghast JDC usually makes a lot of sense. Unfortunately, a lot this time. December 18, 2016 7:51 pm at 7:51 pm JDC You are partly right, Astro. My apologies. I was being too brief in my condemnation of the NDP where, really, a tome or multi-page indictment is required. One simply cannot write enough bad things regarding the opposition. They do such a poor job. The Liberals do evil and the NDP do nothing. I actually learn more from reading Laila. But thanks for the encouragement to keep on writing. December 18, 2016 1:49 pm at 1:49 pm Blake Newton Ah yes. Site C. Otherwise known as an electorally useful white elephant. December 11, 2016 3:36 pm at 3:36 pm Astro Thank you for another excellent article. It is very informative. December 11, 2016 9:52 pm at 9:52 pm Laila Yuile It gets better. Like I said, this is going to make the Fast Ferries look like candy store change in your pocket. They may have to twin a temporary bridge thanks to so many traffic delays. This will be the biggest boondoggle ever. EVER. There is a good reason the BCUC turned this down twice already. Not a bit. I only visit this site once a day and it gets downright disheartening. I can only imagine what it would be like to dwell on this and other similar problems all day every day. I notice Norm Farrell has been absent for a couple of months. December 13, 2016 6:49 pm at 6:49 pm e.a.f. Nothing is beyond the point of no return except perhaps death and even that has been reversed with new medical procedures and CPR. The building of a dam can stop at any time. Even if a dam has been built it can be de constructed, and the land left to recover. Horgan might want to get that message. Its a waste of money to build the whole thing. Better to take the financial hit now and get over it. The pro media has done a good job of keeping it out of the news. Oh, well one good shake might put it on the front page or a bunch of deaths of workers, but until then, It is doubtful they will say much about it. In my opinion this dam is not about electricity, its about a reservoir and being able to export water. a water pipeline would be a piece of cake. Its all about the water and not about the electricity. What is being done to the families on site C is no different than was done by the Socreds back in the days when they were building dams. In this case though it will be dam Christy clark. I hope its not the same boffleheads that neglected to locate a source for the armour rock and must now haul it from a distant source across a (for now) non existent bridge. I sometimes wonder if its still on budget. And then I wonder if Anyone knows. I mean, you must have budgets and schedules to proceed with a venture like this. Vaughn Palmer says they know to the exact hour some five or six years in the future when the reservoir will be full as well as some 5,500 steps in between. Okay, got that off my chest. Will try to get some sleep now. The United Canada Party (UCP) is opposed to the Site C Dam and needs candidates who oppose it too. December 15, 2016 5:40 pm at 5:40 pm Curt Site C is an expensive venture not needed. Not their money.

I believe their agenda needs to be investigated before they are paid to do irrevocable harm to these horses. They have already changed the genetics and natural herd behavior. Ahimsa, do no harm, applies to animals as well as people. Wild Horse and Burro Advisory Board is useless, yet quite costly to the taxpayers. Fertility control and sterilization at this point endangers the survival of this cherished native species. Wild horses are indigenous to North America yet now the feds and special interest groups want to sterilize them and push them off public land. The advisory board is a joke. PZP is a slow road to extinction. What we need is creditable population counts for all the remaining burro herds. Advocates and BLM should work jointly for the census. But the truth is the BLM staff in charge of the BLM Internet adoption auctions do not make themselves available during the internet auction to process the applications required to bid. Like the buffalo, the wolf, the bear and other animals the horse is just as sacred to our people as the bible is to Christians, the Koran to Muslims, Buddha to Buddhists. There are 5 million cattle and very few Wild Horses. These beautiful creatures need to exist unmolested and unfettered so they may live in harmony with nature, as it was meant to be. we remind you that crimes against humanity also includes animals. It is not only wrong ethically and morally but once again it is wasteful spending of our tax dollars. The legal implications this can lead to will only cause millions of tax dollars to be wasted in the courts. PZP. A government agency is experimenting and exploiting federally protected wild horses and burros. control research trials are big business. Left unchallenged, wild horses and burros will continue to be lab rats for human fertility control research. Rounding up federally protected wild horses and burros has been documented as cruel.

The native wild horse conservation group calls on the Department of Interior to acknowledge wild horses are native, implement holistic land management and reserve design thus creating a win-win for wild horses to help the ecosystem and reverse desertification. Protect Mustangs requests that 'survival of the fittest' should be the only form of fertility control considered because indigenous wild horses must not become domesticated on the range. July 2010, spearheaded by Raul Grijalva D-AZ, members of Congress wrote a letter requesting an investigation of the Wild Horse and burro program by the National Academy of Sciences. This was a direct result of public outcry and media exposure of roundup carnage. Then we have a herd that is not safe on its own range. states Carl Mrozek, filmmaker of Saving Ass in America. caballus originated in North America more than 2 million years ago. Equus survived extinction through migration and E.caballus could have returned to America with the Spanish unless some had remained on the continent the entire time.

These pregnant mares and members of their herd seem to have been rounded up because Country Natural Beef, a supplier of Whole Food Market, was pushing for the roundup. Roundups have been based on fraudulent data. Joseph Mengele. The rights of American wild horses are being violated. The three proposed methods include ovariectomy via colpotomy, tubal ligation and hysteroscopically-guided laser ablation of the oviduct papilla. The proposed studies would be conducted under financial assistance agreements with Oregon State University (OSU), with OSU staff serving as the principal investigators of the research. The three experiments combined would involve approximately 225 wild horse mares previously rounded up and removed from BLM Herd Management Areas (HMA). are encouraged to write in your own words to oppose the wild horse sterilization experiment proposed on innocent wild mares.

Hass: 46 long years John. We met in Vietnam, when we a lot younger my friend (smiles). We were doing wildlife and vegetation studies in your AO (area of operations). Hass: As usual, and as government agencies do and BLM and DOI are extremely guilty, they pretend that science guides its wild horse and burro management strategies. (shakes his head negatively). . There is no pertinent reasoning to use it right now and especially on wild horses or much of anything else for that matter. Our wildlife and environment is simply too important to be so frivolous with such activity, especially an unknown situation, as fertility drugs used in our natural environment.

Such growth is biologically impossible. Kiger is not an isolated example, although it is the worst found so far. An independent study reviewed BLM roundup-records for a representative sample of four herd management areas composed of 5,859 wild horses (Gregg, LeBlanc, and Johnston, 2014). While the researchers found an overall birth-rate of just under 20 percent, they also found that half of foals perish in their first year of life. Thus, the effective foal-to-yearling survival-rate is just 10 percent. Further, adult wild horses also perish. They succumb to illness, injury, and predation. Their death-rate must be taken into consideration as well. Another ruse BLM employs is restricting maximum herd-size below minimum-viable population (MVP) size. BLM is distributing grant-money to universities and researchers to study more ways of dealing with the phantom overpopulation. All manner of sicko experiments are being carried out on the wild horses, such as treating them with endocrine disruptors and sterilizing them surgically.

PZP tricks the immune system into producing antibodies that attack the ovaries, inducing ovarian dystrophy, oophoritis (inflammation of the ovaries), and ovarian cysts. Worse yet, per radioimmunoassay, the PZP antibodies are transferred from mother to young via the placenta and milk. The antibodies cross-react with and bind to the zonae pellucidae of female offspring. Although hyped as a 'non-hormonal' method of birth-control, PZP causes estrogen-levels to plummet as the ovaries degenerate. In herds under PZP 'management,' the birthing season extends to nearly year-round, putting the life of the foals and mares at risk. Filles injected with PZP before they have reached puberty are particularly vulnerable to immediate sterilization. control research trials are big business.

Federal authorities ring the alarm for the overpopulation of wild horses on the land. There will be 150,000 in five years if nothing is done to stop their expansion. The ranchers who share the land with the wild horses won't tolerate limited access to water sources in areas invaded by wild horses. total, 2,000 chevaux were gathered in 2015, an insufficient number to reach the fixed objective, but the animal defenders call the process barbaric. The journalists interviewed BLM staff on the range. They met with ranchers who push the overpopulation myth and are pro-slaughter--including Callie Hendricksen. They interviewed Carol Walker, photographer, legal plaintiff and board member of Wild Horse Freedom Federation at a watering hole with a lot of mustangs. The journalists reported on training at a prison program with failed adoptions being the undertone. The news editor crafted the story from the materials shot in the field resulting in the BLM and pro-slaughter viewpoint out in front.

They are being trapped and attacked. A spokesman for the sheriffs department said that law enforcement was spraying water because protesters were lighting fires on and around the bridge. One person was arrested, according to the sheriffs department . One hundred sixty-seven people were injured and seven were taken to the hospital, according to Jade Begay, a spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network. The tribe fears that the pipeline, which is planned to cross under the river less than a mile from the Standing Rock Reservation, will threaten their water source and argue that construction has already disturbed sacred burial grounds. Pipeline construction is almost completed in North Dakota, but the company building it, Energy Transfer Partners, still lacks a final permit to drill under the river. On Tuesday, 15 November, the company went to court seeking to have a judge force the government to allow it to begin drilling immediately. The trucks have been in place for several weeks, and law enforcement has erected a barricade behind them, forcing all traffic to take an approximately 20-mile detour. Begay said that activists did light two bonfires to keep people warm and make soup and tea. Other fires were sparked by law enforcement weapons, she added. The activists successfully moved one of the trucks before law enforcement responded with tear gas, water cannons, and other weapons, Begay said. The violence comes at a difficult time for indigenous activists at the camps, said Archambault. It was always a day of mourning for the day that genocide began on this continent.

We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient.

Thank you for yet another sacrifice you are doing for the American people. Please sign the petition to President Obama. Petition The Dakota Access pipeline poses a catastrophic threat to Native American sacred lands and to the critical water source for more than 17 million Americans down stream of the Missouri River crossing. We know that President Elect Trump has a serious conflict of interest by owning large investments in DAPL and other fossil fuel assets; and his energy team includes Harold Hamm, billionaire founder of Continental Resources oil company, and someone Mr. Trump might name as his Secretary of Energy. Mr. Trump and the Koch brothers said they support extractive exploitation of public lands and National Parks. After suffering centuries of persecution and exploitation, Native Americans deserve justice. This land belonged to the Standing Rock Sioux Nation Rez before it was taken back. President Elect Trump has stated he will quickly approve the Dakota Access pipeline and also reverse President Obama's decision to deny approval of Keystone XL pipeline. We have an enormous glut of oil reserves at Cushing, Oklahoma. The clear purpose of Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines is not to make America energy independent but to reap enormous profits for greedy oil interests exporting oil to China. We must protect our environment and our oil resources. This outdated fossil fuel infrastructure is not needed and railroads serving the Bakkan North Dakota oil fields have invested heavily in improved railroad oil tank car safety and have stated that they have more than enough railroad capacity to transport the Bakkan oil. They will also be able to permanently rehire thousands of laid off North Dakota railroad workers. America must finally honor the first Americans and our first environmentalists by stopping Dakota Access. Thank you for standing on the right side of history. read Operations Order.

I am proud that you are defending our nation's water and helping stop the depredation of First Nations land. I wish I could have given more. Thank you for yet another sacrifice you are doing for the American people. Please sign the petition to President Obama. Petition The Dakota Access pipeline poses a catastrophic threat to Native American sacred lands and to the critical water source for more than 17 million Americans down stream of the Missouri River crossing. We know that President Elect Trump has a serious conflict of interest by owning large investments in DAPL and other fossil fuel assets; and his energy team includes Harold Hamm, billionaire founder of Continental Resources oil company, and someone Mr. Trump might name as his Secretary of Energy. Mr. Trump and the Koch brothers said they support extractive exploitation of public lands and National Parks. After suffering centuries of persecution and exploitation, Native Americans deserve justice. This land belonged to the Standing Rock Sioux Nation Rez before it was taken back. President Elect Trump has stated he will quickly approve the Dakota Access pipeline and also reverse President Obama's decision to deny approval of Keystone XL pipeline. We have an enormous glut of oil reserves at Cushing, Oklahoma. The clear purpose of Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines is not to make America energy independent but to reap enormous profits for greedy oil interests exporting oil to China. We must protect our environment and our oil resources. This outdated fossil fuel infrastructure is not needed and railroads serving the Bakkan North Dakota oil fields have invested heavily in improved railroad oil tank car safety and have stated that they have more than enough railroad capacity to transport the Bakkan oil. They will also be able to permanently rehire thousands of laid off North Dakota railroad workers. America must finally honor the first Americans and our first environmentalists by stopping Dakota Access. Thank you for standing on the right side of history. read Operations Order.

A spokesman for rebel group Ahrar al-Sham said the evacuations could occur as early as Tuesday night, although reports from inside Aleppo overnight suggested civilians were not yet able to leave. A Syrian military official said the evacuations would begin at 5am on Wednesday. But by 6.30am, no evacuees had left the besieged city. The reports of killings by the advancing regime forces, who are led by Iranian-backed militias, raised grave concerns over the fate of tens of thousands of civilians, doctors and activists who have remained in the shrinking rebel enclaves, and who faced death if they stayed there or being tortured and killed in regime-held areas if they fled over government lines. Under the terms of the deal, negotiated between Turkish intelligence and the Russian military, a ceasefire went into effect at 6pm local time. Rebel territory in Aleppo The United Nations said it had received reliable reports from multiple sources that pro-Assad forces, including the Iraqi Shia militia Harakat al-Nujaba, had carried out summary killings of at least 82 civilians, including 11 women and 13 children in four different neighbourhoods of east Aleppo that had fallen under government control. Condemnable that Russia and Iran abetted this dictator in meting out such suffering. This is the path to yet more war. For this we will stay there finally. Rebel officials from Nour al-din al-Zenki and Ahrar al-Sham, two powerful opposition groups with a presence in the city, confirmed the deal to evacuate, but there was confusion over exactly where the opposition would have to go, with rebels saying they would be transported to the western Aleppo countryside. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had said there were corpses abandoned in the streets with residents too terrified by the shelling to bury them. Real massacres were taking place in the city, the war monitor said. People in east Aleppo issued distress calls and appeals to the international community to rescue them from retribution, continuing to post farewell messages on Monday night and into Tuesday morning, predicting they would either die in the ongoing bombardment or be tortured and killed if they surrendered."}

Tipis, tents, and a geodesic dome dotted the valley below. Nestled along the Cannon Ball and Missouri Rivers in remote North Dakota, the Oceti Sakowin camp had recently grown to over 7,000 people. The 1,170-mile pipeline is slated to transport crude oil from the Bakken shale fields of North Dakota, through Standing Rock Sioux treaty land, under the Missouri River, and on to Illinois. And so they pray and march and refuse to move. By the time I arrived, the Oceti Sakowin camp had been inundated by supporters from across the country: from the environmental movement, Black Lives Matter, the progressive media, and elsewhere. Yet the Standing Rock struggle remains an indigenous-led one, an historic coming together of first nations. As we drove up to the front gate, the security team that waved us through was a mix of old-timers with American Indian Movement logos safety-pinned to their leather coats and the next generation of indigenous youth from Standing Rock. This is not a vacation. The 10 days I was at the camp, which included the presidential election, were a period of relative calm, as the pictures in the accompanying photo essay suggest. The Army Corps of Engineers was set to announce a major decision on whether to grant an easement to allow Energy Transfer Partners to drill below the Missouri river, and the indigenous leadership wanted to keep prayer-based actions outside of camp to a minimum pending the decision. Those who were digging in for the long haul used the respite to prepare for winter by gathering necessary supplies and winterizing their shelters. Each night, temperatures plummeted, a dusting of white frost blanketing the tents. This is not a vacation. This was also a time of prayer and ceremony, which people at camp described as part of an essential process of personal and collective healing, helping them to stay strong in the face of the long struggle ahead. Even the marches and demonstrations were always peaceful and prayer-inflected. According to a report from Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, the protectors were attempting peacefully to move a burned-out truck off the bridge and clear access to the public roadway when police trapped them on the bridge and opened fire with tear gas, rubber bullets, mace canisters, and concussion grenades. Jerky video from the scene shot by witness Kevin Gilbertt shows the police blasting water cannons into the crowd in sub-freezing temperatures. People lost consciousness and dropped to the ground as the freezing water hit; an elder went into cardiac arrest and was revived on site by medics, according to a press release issued by the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council. It also reports that at least 300 people were injured, with 26 people requiring immediate hospitalization. One of them, Sophia Walinsky, is facing amputation after a concussion grenade reportedly exploded on her left arm. While this level of brutality and violence against peaceful demonstrators is clearly extreme, it was not the first time the water protectors have been met by blunt force and intimidation. Nor is it likely to be the last. Native peoples in this country have faced every tool the US government has to displace, dispossess, and destroy them for more than 500 years. Yet as the winter comes, the water protectors are not giving up. Their movement is part of a long history of struggle.

The North Dakota National Guard, law enforcement officials, and private security firms have used unjustified force in their response to opponents of the Dakota Access pipeline, said Maina Kiai, the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. He is concerned over both the scale of arrests and the conditions in which American citizens are being held. Protestors have reported facing rubber bullets, teargas, mace, compression grenades, and bean-bag rounds while voicing their concerns over the environmental impact of the pipeline and throughout their attempts to protect burial grounds and other sites that are sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Construction of the pipeline has continued despite the fact that in September, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples called for its end. The tribe has been denied access to information and was excluded from consultations during the planning stages. The 1,172 mile (1,890km) pipeline is designed to carry crude oil to a refinery near Chicago and is being built by the US Army Corps of Engineers and Energy Transfer. Protestors say that several sacred sites of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe have already been bulldozed. Construction work is now nearing the Missouri River, home to other sacred sites. Protestors believe that the project will create a major threat to the quality of their drinking water. Maina Kiai is from Kenya and was appointed Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association in May 2011. He is part of the Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system. The positions are honorary and they are not UN staff, nor do they receive a salary for their work."}

The Army Corps will apparently research alternate routes for the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners could sue to repeal the refusal, the Trump administration could reverse the Corps. The Army wants the water protectors to clear out, but many are digging in to stay and ensure that the decision sticks. At best, this encampment could be the seed of a new post-Trump resistance that fuses the Occupy movement and movements for justice for indigenous people like Idle No More. But others voiced caution, noting the incoming Republican president and hints that the energy company will appeal the decision. Grassrope added that the tribes would not give up either.

He mentioned the Commerce and Education Departments but could not recall the third: the Energy Department. Texas is rich in energy resources, and Mr. Perry is an enthusiastic supporter of extracting them. But it is not clear how that experience would translate into leading the Energy Department. How Trump Can Influence Climate Change A Trump administration could weaken or do away with many of the Obama-era policies focused on greenhouse gas emissions. Still, the former energy secretaries Spencer Abraham, a Republican, and Bill Richardson, a Democrat, said they could envision Mr. Perry adapting. Under President Obama, the Energy Department helped secure an agreement with Iran to dismantle its nuclear weapons program and took on a larger role in efforts to combat global warming, particularly through scientific research. It also established the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to support breakthrough research on clean energy technology. Mr. Perry, 66, would bring a different set of credentials. His views align with those of Mr. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese. Mr. Perry did campaign energetically for Mr. Trump later. When he took the job in 2001, he said, his focus was on rolling blackouts in California and the Enron electric utility scandal. But after the Sept. 11 attacks, his attention shifted to counterterrorism and nuclear weapons and nonproliferation programs. Mr. Chu was brought in by Mr. Obama to focus on climate change programs, but in the summer of 2010, he became consumed with personally helping to engineer a way to stop the oil gushing from a blown BP well in the Gulf of Mexico. Video In November 2011, the former governor of Texas famously forgot that the U.S. Energy Department was one of the agencies he had pledged to eliminate if he were to become president. Published OnDec. Rick Perry has background running a big bureaucracy, the state of Texas. This month, the transition team circulated an unusual 74-point questionnaire at the Energy Department that requested the names of all employees and contractors who had attended climate change policy conferences, as well as emails and documents about the conferences. Former department employees and presidential transition officials said a request for lists of specific people involved in shaping climate policy was irregular and alarming. Employees said Tuesday that the choice of a secretary who has vowed to eliminate the agency compounded those fears. An Energy Department spokesman, Eben Burnham-Snyder, said the agency had refused to give the names.

Video footage shared by Native Opinion shows Oceti Sakowan Medic, Leland Brenholt, reporting that he had seen at least 3 gunshot wounds to the head from police use of rubber bullets. Live-streamed footage of the police intervention includes statements that some Water Protectors had been vomiting and urinating in response to the aggressive use of tear gas against them. Update: The latest reports (source: the Guardian) are that there were over 300 casualties among the Water Protectors , with 26 of these being hospitalised. Injuries have included multiple bone fractures, as the photographs I have sourced from the Water Protectors show. While the majority of casualties were suffering from hypothermia from the combination of freezing weather and the use of water cannons by the police, other injuries include damage to vision and hearing, one individual suffering a grand mal seizure, and another who suffered internal bleeding. The Water Protectors are primarily an indigenous Native American community comprising a wide range of ages, from youth to the elderly, and including both women and men. Freezing Temperatures Significantly Increased The Danger On a brutally cold night (temperatures ranging between a below-freezing 20-25 degrees, with an additional wind chill factor making it feel even colder), the Water Protectors appeared to have been kettled onto the Backwater Bridge, preventing any means of escape. Police then began using a range of military weapons against them over a period of several hours. It is not clear what, if anything, provoked this level of intervention. Weapons used by the Morton County Police overnight reportedly included: water cannon, tear gas, rubber bullets, concussion grenades, and LRAD sound devices which can induce permanent deafness. The tactics used by the police have been condemned by various civil liberties organisations, including Amnesty International, ACLU, and the National Lawyers Guild. Water Cannons Set A Standing Rock Precedent This marks the first time that water cannons have been deployed by police since this standoff began in April, 2016. Eye-witness accounts from the scene claim ice formed on the hands and clothes of the Water Protectors and on-site journalists, as a result of the combination of cold weather and cold water. This claim is not supported by the video footage I have viewed. There has been a blockade of burned out vehicles at Fort Rice on Highway 1806, erected by the National Guard since October 27th 2016. The Water Protectors have made multiple attempts to remove the blockade since that date, but have repeatedly been refused permission to do so by the police. The blockade has since been reinforced with razor wire and cement barricades. The conflict began around 7pm (ET), when the Water Protectors made a further attempt to remove the burned out vehicles, to restore access to the road. The police responded by forming a line to kettle the Water Protectors on Backwater Bridge, and the situation rapidly escalated from there. The live-streams have dropped signal at various points throughout the night, and it has been widely alleged that this is the result of the police using signal jammers to prevent the streams from being broadcast. I have requested confirmation regarding the use of signal jamming equipment from the authorities in the area, and shall update this report accordingly as and when I hear back from them about this. Protesters in mass amounts, estimated to be around 400, are on the bridge and attempting to breach the bridge to go north on highway 1806. The Water Protectors dispute this account, stating that police started some of the, while others were small-scale attempts to combat the cold weather conditions. They have openly acknowledged returning the grenades fired at them by the police, by throwing these devices at the police. The events of last weekend are the latest aggressive acts since the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe set up camp to protest the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline. It is understood that there is an ongoing legal dispute about the rights to build and drill in the area, to which future reports shall be devoted to examining in more detail. It is now nearly three weeks since that comment. I will continue to report on the situation at Standing Rock, North Dakota, as it develops. The next report is likely to be on the planned deployment of US military veterans to this conflict, so stick around and support the work being made - you power this. If you like the article you just read, please make a pledge to the writer, so that they can keep on doing their valuable work.

Other prisoners remain on hunger strike. Saeed Shirzad, who is in jail for protesting against child labour, and Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese citizen and IT expert accused of spying for the US, are also on hunger strikes.

Larijani belongs to an influential family and he is seen as a potential candidate to succeed the supreme leader, Ayatollah Alli Khamenei. Recently Rouhani and Larijani have been at odds over financial transparency.

On paper, the TransCanada Corporation now has the Trump administration's blessings to add hundreds of miles of pipeline to allow hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude produced by the Alberta tar sands to flow daily into the U.S., a permission twice denied by President Barack Obama two years ago (by veto and by outright denial of its permit), but it's premature to assume the project will actually get built. The international market for oil isn't what it once was. Prices have fallen, and that's a particularly big issue for oil extracted from tar sands which is more expensive (not to mention environmentally damaging) to produce. And the State Department permit is not the only snag. There are lawsuits by property owners in Nebraska which also must issue a permit and where concerns have been expressed about protecting underground water reserves. There are likely to be further protests mounted by Native Americans and environmentalists in South Dakota, Montana and Nebraska as there have been around the Dakota Access Pipeline. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau may have supported the project in the past, but he also must be mindful of his country's overall greenhouse gas emissions and meeting nationwide limits Canada promised in the Paris climate agreement. The Canadian government has already approved other pipeline projects that are essentially using up its cap space, including an expansion of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline that runs to the country's west coast. That raises the distinct possibility that by focusing on backward-looking energy polices (his promise to revive the U.S. coal industry providing the other glaring example), Mr. Trump isn't boosting jobs, he's costing the U.S. important economic opportunities. The more we encourage and accommodate needless greenhouse gas emissions by other nations, the quicker the bill for those decisions is coming due. So much of the Keystone XL project's merits have been overstated. While there may be thousands of construction jobs created on a temporary basis, a 2015 analysis concluded that Keystone will produce just 50 permanent jobs in the U.S. If Keystone merely enables TransCanada to sell its oil on the international market somewhat faster than before, the only tangible effect will be to compound the effects of climate change as the oil is consumed. And even if President Trump and others respond by doing no more than sticking their collective heads further in the sand, the costs associated with climate change from higher temperatures and sea level rise to stronger hurricanes and worsened droughts will dwarf any possible short term benefits of allowing oil and gas producers to run wild. We support job-producing infrastructure investment but not at so high a price. This is short-sighted, self-destructive behavior on the part of president who won't listen to reason or scientific evidence. The only good news is that perhaps Mr. Trump's stamp of approval comes too late to rescue a project that makes even less sense today than it did in 2008."}

The council had delayed the vote twice as Norfolk waited for approvals from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, which had been pending for months. The project recently cleared several regulatory hurdles, including with the state agency. On Tuesday, the council voted 5-2, with one abstention, to grant the company easements to build the pipeline beneath the reservoirs. Half of that payment is earmarked for the Elizabeth River Trail Foundation, which is developing a multiuse nature trail in Norfolk. According to analysis by city staff presented to the council, no negative environmental impacts are expected. They argue the project could leak toxic chemicals into the reservoirs or further increase dependence on fossil fuels, which contribute to the climate change and sea level rise affecting Norfolk.

Shadow Wolf 1 year ago The inciting a riot charge against Chase Iron Eyes is egregious. Simply because he was present at the camp. He had every right to be there, to express his Creator given right to the First Amendment. The Morton County Sheriff Office have no credibility whatsoever. Especially after they tried deleting all the evidence leading up to that Nov. bloody incident. Also, he was unarmed and posed no personal threat to the hired thugs in riot gear. Unlike the Bundy Clowns and their cowardly Malheur Wildlife Refuge terrorists. Meh 1 year ago I am not to be a judge as I was not present to witness. Past happenings of injustice seem to be prevalent and still abound. I especially would like to echo and thank the writer izopnyde for I am also too old to run, so I will do my best to follow and try to understand. I hope in Native American culture that counts as a dance. Takesha 1 year ago I have never met Chase Iron Eyes, but I would way this in a court of law under oath. I have viewed a hundred videos of this man, and not once did I hear him curse or speak disrespectfully to anyone. I never have seen him show anger, he always speaks with knowledge, kindness and softly, even when there is a strong truth that needs to be spoken. He encourages people not to follow him, but to stand on their own to feet before the Creator, whomever they believe him to be, and to stand for what is right, what is pure, what is scared, and encourages them not to speak with his voice but their own, to love, to honor others even if they hate us. He is an lawyer, and educator of the people about the Indian Way and the Constitution of the United States. I speak the truth, unlike the those who are making the accusations, Chase Iron Eyes, did not incite a riot. He has said many times, he is not a chosen leader by any tribe he is but a single person, doing what is right to protect the water from avaricious,unscrupulous men who hide behind the names of an oil company, a governors office, and a police badge. What he is, like many others, is a man of principal, a prime example of an American who knows his rights and as they were given to him by the Constitution of the United States. He is a husband, and a father, a provider for his family. He exercises his rights in a non-violent way and cautions other to do the same. He is a target of the State and Federal law enforcement agencies. I give a word of caution here, whatever Chase Iron Eyes has done in the past, he has paid the price for it numerous times over. He is not the man the state and federal government has, and is, trying to present him to be. This is a sham, a travesty, and a lie. I am disgusted with the government which is not of the people, for the people or by the people. I send prayers, and I stand and dance for your freedom and safety. Will they the law and ect ever leave Native Americans its not their land why cant they honor treaties.

I want to say I got involved in resisting the Sabal Trail Pipeline (STP) back in October of last year. Firster, handed me a flyer about a weekend workshop they were organizing to resist a local pipeline in FL, the STP. Once I went to the workshop I was hooked. I got rid of a lot of my belongings, sold my van, put what I was keeping in storage and by Christmas Day, I had joined Sacred Water Camp. From that point on I lived at the various camps for about 3 months. For me the campaign seemed to start when that first workshop happened. Folks from all over the country came to the workshop, even folks who had been at Standing Rock, it was really successful. It really evolved when Sacred Water Camp became a solid encampment. This gave folks who were traveling some distance a place to stay, do some action, and move on. I see this type of fluidity as very valuable to a movement. Hundreds of people came from all over the country and many of them had been at Standing Rock. Elders and youth were getting involved, protesting, organizing, donating supplies. There have been police stationed at each site where STP crosses under rivers. The State has sent their dogs out in mass during our protests, one in which we had about 300 protesters show up and about 80 police lined the fences, protecting the drill going underneath the Suwannee River. There have been about 30 arrests so far, the most recent was 3 at a protest on June 10th. Other actions have included folks standing directly in front of the trucks that carries water to the drills, multiple lock downs to these trucks, and people locking down inside the pipeline with a 200 pound cement block. The resistance has been strong, but I always feel it can be stronger. There are many ways to support those who put their lives on the line to save the Earth and its inhabitants. A main way is throwing some money their way. Often times folks want to cheer on activists while they are organizing, protesting, and doing direct action, but then folks tend to leave others in the dust during times their support is truly needed. In this case, taking a plea deal with restitution seemed better than being felons for the rest of our lives. Even though the gas has been turned on there are still protests happening, in addition to a memorial service for James Marker, a man who shot up the pipeline with a high powered rifle and was chased and then killed by police. At this point the folks who really need support are the ones who have thrown down and now have to deal with probation and court costs. Some things to keep in mind going forward is that it takes a large amount of bodies in order to get any sort of attention and to make headway, especially folks willing to do direct action. Also there needs to be consistent communication, especially about the various tactics folks wish to use.

You'll receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities. The First Amendment is under attack along the Dakota Access pipeline route in North Dakota. Police and private security forces outfitted in riot gear and armed with assault weapons have unleashed dogs, pepper spray and rubber bullets on peaceful Native Americans and their allies. Overzealous law enforcement officials in North Dakota have jailed journalists and celebrities who were exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech and the press by documenting police attacks on protesters. These actions are a serious affront to the Constitution and sovereign tribal rights and are an egregious abuse of power by the police and government in order to protect the fossil fuel industry. Tell North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple and the U.S. Department of Justice: Stop police abuse and protect the Constitution, not the fossil fuel industry. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and members of over 200 other tribes from across the Americas are leading the resistance to protect sovereign land and drinking water from destruction by the fossil fuel industry. However, in an attempt to quell these historic nonviolent protests, Gov. Dalrymple ordered a state of emergency that has militarized the police force, set up a highway roadblock and mobilized the National Guard to intimidate protesters. Her reporting went viral, with over 14 million people on Facebook and millions more through the mainstream media viewing her reporting. Tell North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple and the U.S. Department of Justice: Stop police abuse and protect the Constitution, not the fossil fuel industry. Based on the reports, it appears that government officials are attempting to intimidate indigenous people resisting the pipeline and silence the press from spreading the word. The injustices perpetrated by the government and the fossil fuel industry against journalists, Native peoples and their allies are an unacceptable assault on the First Amendment. We must stand with them now and ensure their constitutional rights to assemble and report are fully protected. Tell Gov. Dalrymple and the DoJ: Stop police abuse and protect the Constitution, not the fossil fuel industry. Thanks for all you do. 2016. 2016."}

In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community.

That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient.

'script', 'twitter-wjs'); Nov 18, 2016 Arctic drilling opponents got a victory with an Obama executive order stopping drilling leases for five years, an order that won't be easily changed by Donald Trump. Credit: Getty Images No new offshore oil and gas leases will be offered in the Alaskan Arctic through 2022, according to a new five-year plan for offshore drilling released Friday by the Obama administration. President-elect Donald Trump could overturn the ban, but that could take years and may not draw much industry interest if oil prices stay low. The Interior Department's five-year plan laid out all of the proposed auctions for drilling rights on the outer continental shelf of the United States. It allowed for no leases between 2017 and 2022 in the Beaufort or Chukchi seas, Arctic waters north and west of Alaska. A prior draft of the plan included the potential for offshore drilling in both the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas when it was released in March. The current plan limits potential leases in the next five years to the Gulf of Mexico and the Cook Inlet off south-central Alaska. Some Republicans voiced opposition to the plan before it was even published. Sullivan said the ban on Arctic drilling was another Obama administration policy that delays and disrupts energy development in America. He cited the unsuccessful attempt by Royal Dutch Shell to drill in the Arctic, which Shell abandoned last year. Shell left the Arctic after failing on multiple fronts. It encountered costly equipment malfunctions, including a major accident with its drilling rig the Kulluk in 2012. Its lease is one of nearly 40 existing leases in Arctic waters that are not affected by the new five-year plan. Those leases will all expire in the next few years. Trump could reverse the Obama administration's ban by drafting a new five-year leasing plan. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, an ardent drilling proponent, has been mentioned as a possible nominee for Interior Secretary, suggesting the new administration may pursue a new plan. Such a restart, however, would take time. The five-year leasing program announced Friday, for example, took two years to develop. New leases available in the Arctic might not draw the interest of the oil and gas industry.

Native American tribes, led by the Standing Rock Sioux, have been protesting the pipeline project. They fear it would pollute the Missouri River and harm sacred cultural lands and tribal burial grounds. The letter from the district commander of the Army Corps, Col. John W. Henderson, said the emergency services and facilities needed to protect demonstrators camped north of the Cannonball River during the harsh North Dakota winters could not be provided. He said anyone found on the land after Dec. 5 could be charged with trespassing. The project has spurred months of clashes between the police and demonstrators. The most serious injury happened early Monday. An explosion during a protest badly damaged the left arm and hand of woman who grew up in the Bronx, Sophia Wilansky, 21. Her father, Wayne Wilansky, said that someone from the police lines had thrown a device he described as a grenade; the police suggested that fellow demonstrators had caused the explosion, and said officers did not use concussion or flash grenades at any time. On Monday, the police confronted hundreds of protesters. Nearly 300 people were treated for injuries resulting from the use of police force, according to the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council. The pipeline project was delayed in September when the Obama administration temporarily blocked it from crossing under the Missouri River. President Obama called on both sides to show restraint and revealed that the Army Corps of Engineers was considering an alternative route for the project. But Kelcy Warren, chief executive of the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners, told The Associated Press it would not consider a different route. Though the project has been delayed by legal disputes, the pipeline is nearly complete.

Florida Reps. A Preview of the People, Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule, two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Updated and reissued every five years, these guidelines are the nation's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations. supply. These nominees will be well-known in their fields, and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers, academics and practitioners. part of the process is happening in real time. what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors. Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff, and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally. Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries. And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle. Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance, including the meat industry, dairy industry, and sugar-sweetened beverage associations, as well as formula companies, which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers.

But it probably won't be the last, especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year. Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets. If you believe your pet may have been exposed, be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, diarrhea or vomiting. And as climate change gets worse, the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks, creating a toxic feedback loop. The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish. Communities that struggle with regular, serious toxic algae outbreaks, like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie, can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation. The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth. The women were all non-smokers, had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies. Macrophages, which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body, protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles, such as bacteria and pollution particles. The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants. That's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA's Office of Inspector General (OIG), the agency's internal watchdog. EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement, and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency.

Jensen discovered the spill while harvesting wheat on Sept. 29, 2013, on his farm near Tioga. It was almost two weeks after Jensen reported the spill that state officials told the public what had happened, and only after The Associated Press asked about it. Tesoro blames a lightning strike for causing the rupture. The 35-mile long pipeline was restarted last November. The pipeline now has leak-detection equipment installed, and frequent aerial and ground inspections are being done. Jensen blames the company for not detecting the leak. Some 20,600 barrels of oil were determined to have spilled. A barrel is 42 gallons. The state Health Department, which is monitoring the cleanup, said no water sources were contaminated and no wildlife was hurt from the spill. Dave Glatt, chief of the agency's environmental health section, said Tesoro has not been sanctioned for the incident. Cleanup crews have recovered about 6,000 barrels of oil, though more than 14,000 barrels are lost, officials said. Crews initially burned oil from the surface and later used vacuums to recover it. That proved ineffective after the oil seeped far underground, officials said. Tesoro now is using a thermal desorption process that involves excavating contaminated soil and heating it before being replaced. University scientists from North Dakota are studying the soil and plan to plant a test crop there next year, state and company officials said.

His exact intentions remain unclear but the US is reportedly considering a military response. The BBC's North America editor says a US strike could be imminent. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said Bashar al-Assad should have no role in a future Syria. His comments signal an apparent U-turn for the US - only last week the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said Washington was no longer prioritising the removal of the Syrian president. Dozens of people, including at least 27 children, are reported to have died following an attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province early on Tuesday. Syria denies its forces were to blame and is supported by its ally, Russia. Military action looks certain: Jon Sopel, BBC North America editor It is a clear and pretty dramatic shift. A month ago, Bashar al-Assad in the eyes of the US was part of the solution, considered useful in the fight against so-called Islamic State. Then yesterday, President Trump said his position had changed, that the Assad regime had crossed many lines. The implication was that there could be military action. But given everything that's been said in the past 24 hours, I would say military action looks certain and could be imminent. We could wake up tomorrow morning and find out the Americans have taken action. Cast your mind back to what President Trump said about Barack Obama, when the then president said a red line had been crossed and he did nothing about it afterwards. He heaped derision on President Obama. If Mr Trump were not to act now, he would look weak and he wouldn't want that.

His closest neighbor is the tank farm, a sprawling complex of enormous white steel tanks that are nearly 4 stories tall. Each can hold upwards of a quarter of a million gallons of crude oil. Business had been good on this grey winter day. Somewhere, on the other side of tall security fences, that infamous pipeline will join a busy underground hub. Crude oil already flows into the tank farm through the Keystone, Enbridge and Capline pipelines. The oil leaves through outgoing pipes that transport it north and east to about a dozen refineries in Illinois, Ohio, and West Virginia. One pipeline heads west, to the Phillips 66 facility in Wood River. Thousands of demonstrators joined with the Standing Rock Sioux to protest the location of the pipeline in North Dakota. In September, a small group protested at the tank farm. Loading... But Stover has seen few demonstrators. He says the tank farm has been a good neighbor. I know they maintain it well. Stover has little interaction with the tank farm workers, but at Christmas, they bring over a gift basket. Or, the heavy trucks that rumble past on their way to the tank farm. Shortly after taking office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that lifted a previous order by former President Barack Obama that had called for a review by the Army Corps of Engineers. Construction in North Dakota resumed last week. In Illinois, where the pipeline crosses nearly 180 miles and 12 counties, construction was met with little opposition, though Illinois conservationists have expressed environmental concerns. A report by the nonprofit Prairie Rivers Network, for example, found that the pipeline crosses under more than 50 rivers, big and small, in the state and could put the water supplies of nearby towns at risk should there be a spill. And spills do occur. The village, founded as a railroad town in 1854, has a population of about 560, according to the U.S. Census. Everyone knows everyone. Country singer Drew Baldridge, a rising star in Nashville, was one of 17 graduates in the Class of 2010. He filmed a video in town a few years ago. And the oil companies and their employees contribute time and money to community projects. Once construction is complete, tank farms operate with small workforces. So, many Patoka residents commute to jobs in larger nearby towns, like Vandalia, Salem or Centralia. Like many small rural towns, Patoka has lost population and businesses in recent years, Brumfield said. ADM has a grain elevator in the village. Our grocery stores are gone. We used to have an auto body shop. We used to have pizza places. We had a flower shop. An exception is Foltz Welding, a Patoka business that began in the 1990s. Foltz is a pipeline contractor that builds pump stations and does maintenance work for various pipeline companies. The company works all over the country, but it does not lay pipeline cross-country, said Jeff Lauritzen, operations manager at Foltz. He said his company has built a large portion of the tank farm. Foltz keeps about 50 or 60 people employed, he said, adding that his company employed over 400 people last year, when seasonal and temporary construction workers are included. Tank farms help move the volume of oil that Americans use in products ranging from gasoline to hair products, Lauritzen said. People expect to see lots of farmland in Illinois, so the tank farm is a striking sight, even on a Google satellite map. From the air, the 60 or so tanks look like white buttons on a crazy quilt of corn and soybean fields. According to Genscape, a company that monitors oil inventories, Patoka has a storage capacity of more than 18 million barrels. During World War II, the federal government divided the nation into five Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts, or PADDs. Patoka is the second-largest oil storage site in PADD 2; the largest is Cushing. Well, it helps to know that a century ago, oil was king in Marion County. In January 1938, oil was discovered on the Glenn Merryman farm, a half-mile south of Patoka. Soon there were derricks all over the countryside, and by the end of the year, Illinois was producing 7.5 million barrels of oil. Jim Watson of the Illinois Petroleum Council says that geography had a lot to do with it. You have a major tank farm and switching point in Cushing, Oklahoma. Then you have the one in Patoka. He believes that, because oil was being produced in Marion County, there was already a storage footprint there, and from there the tank farm grew. Treffert lives in Vernon, where the population was 129 in the 2010 census. Lots of grain farming. Your soybeans. Your corn. Some milo. The little park has a life-size statue of a Union Army soldier, playground equipment and picnic benches. From her back door, Treffert has an unobstructed view of the storage tanks, about a half-mile away. People around here, we just sort of stick to ourselves. To see more, visit KWMU-FM."}

But we have the collective financial power as consumers and account holders to stop the pipeline. We must call on these banks to divest from this massive project immediately before Trump can approve the construction of the pipeline. Tell the 17 DAPL banks: Stop financing the Dakota Access Pipeline. As of Jan. 1, ETP has effectively failed to meet its contractual obligations to deliver oil through the Dakota Access pipeline. Coupled with declining global oil prices, massive public pressure on the banks financing construction of the pipeline could create a public relations nightmare that persuades the banks to end their investments in the pipeline. By staying invested in these projects, these 17 banks are tacitly waging a coordinated campaign to destroy sacred Native lands and silence peaceful protest. This could be our last shot at stopping the Dakota Access pipeline before Donald Trump takes office on January 20. We stood with the water protectors and our allies in the climate justice movement to put a halt to the pipeline once before, and we must stand with them again to shut this project down for good. Tell the 17 DAPL banks: Stop financing the Dakota Access pipeline. Thanks for all you do."}

Florida Reps. A Preview of the People, Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule, two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Updated and reissued every five years, these guidelines are the nation's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations. supply. These nominees will be well-known in their fields, and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers, academics and practitioners. part of the process is happening in real time. what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors. Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff, and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally. Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries. And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle. Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance, including the meat industry, dairy industry, and sugar-sweetened beverage associations, as well as formula companies, which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers.

Cyanobacteria can be toxic and can also produce various types of cyanotoxins that have different hazards. With their small, developing bodies, children are especially endangered by algae exposure. was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption. But it probably won't be the last, especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year. Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets. If you believe your pet may have been exposed, be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, diarrhea or vomiting. And as climate change gets worse, the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks, creating a toxic feedback loop. The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish. Communities that struggle with regular, serious toxic algae outbreaks, like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie, can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation. The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth. The women were all non-smokers, had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies. Macrophages, which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body, protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles, such as bacteria and pollution particles. The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants. That's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA's Office of Inspector General (OIG), the agency's internal watchdog. EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement, and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency.

But it is now widely understood this Thanksgiving story is a fictional history. It was invented to whitewash the vicious genocide wrought upon the native inhabitants of this magnificent continent. Not only did the Europeans try to eradicate native populations, but they made every effort to eviscerate their culture, their language and eliminate them from these coveted lands. From Plymouth Rock to Standing Rock, this lie has made our Thanksgiving Day a Day of Mourning for the First Nations, all the tribes big and small, those who came before us. A few weeks ago we traveled to visit the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota. We arrived at this unprecedented historical gathering of over five hundred tribes and thousands of others standing on the front lines to protect water, to state the most basic human truth, to say water is life. Despite the painful history, today they fight peacefully for us all. The camp grows as winter comes. Standing in protection of our most vital life support systems, but also for the rightful preservation of Native American cultural ways and their sovereignty.

Thus, it is the ugliness of corporate America, seen around the world. But they stand, their hair frozen from water cannons. They stand for all that is good and they stay strong. We are calling upon you, President Barack Obama, to step in and end the violence against the peaceful water protectors at Standing Rock immediately. We will be going back to support the water protectors again.

For trying to show us a road to survival. We offer our support and our respect. We hear the call to protect the water protectors to listen, learn and get engaged. They are brave. We thank them.

Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use.

I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient.

At the time, there had been about 750 arrests of anti-pipeline activists in North Dakota since August, and also vandalism to company equipment in Iowa and North Dakota during construction. In March, there were confirmed instances in which someone apparently had used a torch to burn holes through empty sections of the pipeline at aboveground shut-off valve sites, though no one was arrested. The Army Corps of Engineers, which also is a defendant in the lawsuit because it permitted pipeline water crossings, maintained that only a limited amount of the information should be kept from public view based on analyses by the Transportation Security Administration and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. The judge is allowing the shielding of documents that include such details as pipeline maps at certain crossings, information on detecting and shutting down spills, graphs of spill risk scores at various points along the pipeline, maps of spill scenarios, oil spill volume predictions and details related to monitoring systems. Standing Rock attorney Jan Hasselman has argued previously that public scrutiny of the documents could help the tribe.

Coupled with declining global oil prices, massive public pressure on the banks financing construction of the pipeline could create a public relations nightmare that persuades the banks to end their investments in the pipeline.

Standing Rock Sioux water protectors have been concerned the blockade was obstructing access by emergency services to the reservation and area residences. Completely blocked from escape by the violent police attack on one side, the 400 water protectors were forced to endure the hours-long offensive rather than trampling over each other trying to escape.

The disheartened impressions I previously had of students and America turned 180 degrees after seeing people flock to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and North Dakota. For most of my life, as I am in my fourth decade of existence (41 yrs. I have experienced racism because people see my dark skin complexion before my Irish side, or elite college experience, or PhD. Regrettably, the world is replete with experiences we cannot witness firsthand with our senses. But we can begin to structurally analyze the systemic issues that shape our planet. We now exist in a capitalist world that allows entities called corporations to push commodities upon the people for the sake of profit for the few, much like the days of feudalism when the wealthy elite were kings, queens, and aristocrats living in castles, while the poor were relegated to throwing their poop onto the streets. The common people get pushed and pulled into wars and battles mystified by ideologies and narratives that keep people divided or apathetic. Standing Rock, as a pivotal moment, epitomizes the struggle and opens the door for a truer historical understanding, one that recognizes that America was built off of slavery and indigenous land dispossession. As you can see in this essay, I do not intend to zero in on a more particular narrative involving the struggles of the Standing Rock Sioux against the corporate interests of the entity known as DAPL. Instead, I implore those of you reading this short composition to examine the issue, to see the coverage, or lack thereof, of this issue in the mainstream media. If you know little of these topics, question why this is the case. In answering these questions, your journey should yield more questions, leading you down a path that avoids apathy. I attended Andover High School and graduated in the class of 1993. This was much like the other mascot issues that confront American Indians, such as the Washington Redskins. It was a tremendous learning experience, one that afforded me an understanding of how to maneuver and operate in a contentious, hostile, and demoralizing political climate. The act of engaging in civil debate and political action is incredibly important. Nothing could be more satisfying than learning of your work and engagement in issues affecting the world we live in. Apathy versus action can frame a narrow view of reality, but learning of your involvement gives me hope for our nation, and I applaud you for resisting the apathy that goes hand-in-hand with the anti-intellectualism in America.

Yet they are too seldom discussed, too often ignored, and viewed by too many today as ancient history. Nonetheless, treaties are legally binding agreements that occur nation to nation . Treaties were made between newly formed European settler governments and the sovereign Indigenous nations that already populated the continent. Today, Natives are often thought of in terms of race, and we are considered people of color. But American Indians specifically are also designated by the federal government as a political classification . This is because we belong to ancient Indigenous tribes that predate the existence of the United States of America and we made treaties with them. These treaties recognized our sovereignty as independent nations. To be blunt, we were lied to. Treaties were used as a ruse to coax tribes out of defending their territory and to steal Native lands and resources. The U.S. made hundreds of treaties with Native nations. The list is exhaustive . I am Dakota and Lakota from the Oceti Sakowin (Great Sioux Nation), so I will focus on treaties that my people have signed with the government and how that has affected us. Minnesota is the ancestral land of the Dakota. More than 1 in 10 treaties ever signed by the U.S. involved land in what is today Minnesota. In the 1851 treaties of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota , Dakota of the Oceti Sakowin (Great Sioux Nation) ceded land in Minnesota to the U.S. in exchange for money, goods, and services. Unbeknownst to the Dakota, Congress eliminated Article 3 of each treaty. This Article set up reservation land within Minnesota for the Dakota to live on. The government also defaulted on payments to the Dakota. Of the payments that were made, the government often gave the money directly to traders who were supposed to supply the Dakota with rations. The withholding of rations by these traders led to the Dakota War of 1862, because the Dakota, of which there were an estimated 6,500 people , were starving. All told, the war lasted a month and a half. About 400 Dakota were arrested by the U.S. military. Ultimately, 38 Dakota men were hung in the largest mass execution in U.S. history , in Mankato, Minnesota, on December 26, 1862, under the orders of President Abraham Lincoln. The Dakota people were separated after the war. We became exiles. The governor of Minnesota put a bounty on the scalps of every Dakota man, woman, and child. Some Dakota were taken to prison camps in Iowa . Others, like my ancestor Chief Wabasha , were marched to the Crow Creek Reservation in South Dakota. More were moved to Nebraska territory . Most Dakota from the Sisseton and Wahpeton bands were moved to the Lake Traverse Reservation in South Dakota. Some managed to escape to the Spirit Lake Reservation in North Dakota and to Canada. Others died from sickness and famine. More than one-quarter of Dakota in 1862 died during the following year. In 1863, more than 150 Dakota were massacred at Whitestone Hill , where the cavalry took out their vengeance for the war on many innocent Dakota by ambushing them. Women and children were slaughtered there. Despite this, Lakota lands were encroached upon by outside invaders in breach of treaty law. The U.S. military launched the 1865 Powder River Expedition to subdue Natives within their own, established territory. The Lakota defended their lands. Oglala and Minniconjou Lakota warriors led by Red Cloud , Crazy Horse, and High-Back-Bone killed U.S. Captain W.J. Fetterman and all 80 of his men in half an hour, in what would become known as the Fetterman Fight . In short, the Lakota, led by the Crazy Horse , were kicking settler butt . The Black Hills are the birthplace of the Lakota. Important ceremonies that bring harmony to the Universe have been held there for millennia. The Lakota refuse to accept the money , because the Black Hills are not for sale. To this day, they rightfully belong to the Great Sioux Nation. Lakota treaty land also includes the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where I was born and where water protectors camped out for nearly a year to prevent the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline through ancient Oceti Sakowin burial sites and under the freshwater source of millions of people downstream, both Native, and non-Native. February 23 marks the anniversary of the final raid of camps there. One of the last arrested was Regina Brave , a Lakota grandmother who was making a treaty stand. She is a veteran of the American Indian Movement's 1973 Occupation of Wounded Knee . We are still fighting to protect our lands and waters. In June 2017, a federal judge ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to reconsider its environmental review of the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline by Energy Transfer Partners, thanks to successful protests and litigation by the Oceti Sakowin and their allies. That process is now underway. Oceti Sakowin tribes are now mobilizing to stop the Keystone XL pipeline from crossing Lakota treaty lands. In January, permits were granted to start additional gold mining operations in the Black Hills. Lakota tribes were never consulted, nor did they consent. But we are on the right side of history.

However, at Standing Rock in North Dakota, Indians from all over North America have been protesting for seven months in some ways never before seen. Protest in this case is related to process. Part of the process was for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the agency that approved the pipeline, to consult with tribes about how the pipeline would affect their reservations and treaty lands, sacred sites and cultural areas. According to documents filed in federal court, the Corps did just that numerous times. In response, officials adjusted the pipeline route. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe chose not to fully engage with pipeline officials until late in the process. The legal and ethical argument is about tribal sovereignty and the protection of natural resources. There is nothing new about such issues. However, what is novel is that the tribe and the outside protesters are working together. The Standing Rock reservation set up a protest camp and made a stand with the protesters. What also makes this Indian protest different from others is its manner and its reach. Theirs is a nonviolent protest that is speaking broadly, in such a way that non-Indians can see that these environmental and policy concerns affect them, too. An overwhelming number of them are women. This all stands in contrast to the American Indian Movement, which flourished in the early 1970s, culminating in the takeover of the Wounded Knee trading post on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and the shootout with federal agents nearby. That movement had few specific aims, a violent tendency and little non-Indian support. The Standing Rock protesters are making the argument that the pipeline threatens not just tribal land and resources but American land and resources. The protesters are making a stand on behalf of all Americans for better decisions for our energy future. This is their sacrifice and this is their new Thanksgiving gift. A non-Indian friend asked me recently, in response to protests about Indian mascots for sports teams, where is our Rev. We Indians are a plurality. There are more than 500 tribes in the United States and we all have different cultures, histories, landscapes and ways of organizing politically. We are united by the legacy, and current practices, of colonialism. Like African-Americans, we have fought for and won some of our civil rights. But we have always fought for something quite different from that, too. We have fought for the recognition that we are American and Indian, and that as Indians we belong to sovereign nations and have treaty rights that have always been our rights. We do not have, like the African-American civil rights movement, a single institution like slavery to define our struggle, and a hard date when that was to have ended. But the protest at Standing Rock does have something Dr. King possessed, and that is dignity in the face of dire opposition. We also have the same kind of ecclesiastical calling, a call from God or the spirits, to not only ennoble ourselves through protest but to ennoble the democratic republic that seeks to diminish us. There is something inside the protest to ponder. And it is grave. We have seen water protectors maced, arrested and fired upon with rubber bullets. David Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, wrote in The New York Times that this is proof that government, once again, is against us. That it is once again cowboys versus Indians. There is, of course, a history of conflict. This is ever more clear in the violent backlash against protesters in recent days. But to say that the story of the Dakota Access Pipeline is another iteration of that old western story is to repeat the mistakes of past protests and movements. We situate ourselves in a position of powerlessness. It absolves us of our own complicity in how the world of power around us has been shaped. It absolves our tribal leaders of their reluctance to show up for meetings and to fight diligently and thanklessly in the trenches of numb process. We have to show up to get up. Neither is irony. The civil rights movement got results not just because activists marched in the street but also because activists marched into classrooms, county board meetings, law schools and the voting booth. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SR 5 of the New York edition with the headline: An Indian Protest for Everyone . Fight. Fight.

They had removed the vehicle from a long-closed bridge on a state highway near their camp. One bill would make it illegal for adults to wear masks. Another would let the state sue the federal government for the cost of policing the pipeline protests. Now, a legislator wants to give motorists a pass if they happen to hit one of the protesters.

He stressed that he is not trying to legalize vehicular manslaughter in the state of North Dakota. Drivers still have to do all they can to avoid protesters. But the law says protesters have to do their part as well to stay on sidewalks and road shoulders. The protesters have created a camp in North Dakota adjacent to the Standing Rock reservation and a mile from where the pipeline is planned to cross the Missouri River. Protesters also built a roadblock on Highway 1806, preventing people from passing by for months. Law enforcement agencies built their own checkpoint, according to Bismark, N.D., NBC-affiliate KFYR. In December, the Army Corps of Engineers denied a permit for the section of the pipeline that would go under the Missouri River, but President-elect Donald Trump has said he supports the completion of the pipeline, Heim reported, which means protests could go on indefinitely.

For those executives and politicians with big dreams of sending batches upon batches of heavy Canadian crude oil to the Pacific and onward to Asian markets, that's good reason to keep any victory dances to a minimum. These fights are far from over. Yes, with new federal approvals in hand, Kinder Morgan Canada and Enbridge Inc. can get on with the business of working through the lists of conditions they must meet before trenching rights of way to points south and west from Alberta. After a decade of planning, discussion and hearings, that proved to be not the beginning of the project's road to construction, but the beginning of the end. Six months later, the Harper Conservative government gave the proposal its green light, providing that the company meet the 209 social, safety, economic and environmental conditions set out by the NEB. Several B.C. aboriginal groups remained staunchly opposed to Northern Gateway. Enbridge chief executive officer Al Monaco pledged to rebuild relationships with First Nations. Many leaders were not swayed. Then came the federal election campaign of 2015, when Liberal candidate Justin Trudeau said that the Great Bear Rainforest was no place for an oil pipeline, and that the northern B.C. coast was all wrong for tanker traffic. Last summer, the federal Court of Appeal reversed the green light, blasting a slipshod approach by the former government to consult with aboriginal communities before it gave final approval. By then few industry officials wagered the line could still be built. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement Tuesday's approvals don't signal clear sailing either. Battles are about to intensify for Enbridge's Line 3 replacement and Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain expansion. The curve ball in the equation is the increasingly likely resurrection of Keystone XL under the administration of president-elect Donald Trump after years as a protest point. The Trans Mountain expansion is seen as the oil patch's best hope to get its crude to the Shangri-La known as tidewater. Today, backers say increasing pipeline capacity to the United States is all fine and good, but that long-relied-upon customer is turning into a fierce competitor as its own exports increase. Kinder Morgan wants to use its existing right-of-way to triple the capacity to nearly 900,000 barrels a day, which would land in Burnaby, B.C., for shipment to Asia-Pacific markets. The Alberta government has been front and centre pushing for such market access, hoping for it to help jump-start its stalled economy while holding out the promise of tougher carbon restrictions. Despite that, the wall of opposition to the expansion has been growing to include the mayors of both Burnaby and Vancouver, as well as First Nations such as the Tsleil-Waututh. Its leaders met with Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr this week to press their case that Trans Mountain should not proceed under any circumstances due to oil-spill risks that could have long-lasting impact on the coastal community. Count on busy courts. It won NEB approval last spring, but is still hung up in the United States, where it faces opposition by environmental groups in Minnesota, including 350.org, one of the leaders of the battle against Keystone XL. Indeed, the protests and blockade of the Dakota Access pipeline have shown opposition to projects is pancontinental in scope. Government approval isn't the end of the fight. Not even close. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau can give his nod to a pipeline to the stars if he wants. That's when the complications really start.

Het besluit is een flinke overwinning voor de milieuactivisten en de indianen die al wekenlang protesteren tegen de aanleg van de lijn. De 3,7 miljard dollar kostende aanleg van de bijna 2.000 kilometer lange pijplijn is zeer omstreden. De lijn, die per dag een half miljoen vaten olie moet vervoeren, gaat onder meer door een gebied waar Sioux-indianen wonen. Zij vrezen dat de leiding kan gaan lekken en zo het drinkwater in het indianengebied kan gaan vervuilen. Bovendien vormt de leiding een bedreiging voor beschermde natuurgebieden en zou de leiding door heilige plaatsen van de indianen lopen. Omstreden pijplijn North Dakota niet door indianengebied De Amerikaanse overheid geeft geen toestemming voor een omstreden oliepijplijn door North Dakota als de geplande route niet wordt aangepast. Dit is een opvallend besluit na wekenlange protesten tegen het project. De lijn, die per dag een half miljoen vaten olie moet vervoeren, gaat onder meer door een gebied waar Sioux-indianen wonen.

De aanleg van de pijp is sinds september vertraagd. De Amerikaanse overheid had beloofd de vergunningen om in het indianengebied te bouwen opnieuw te bekijken. De regering Obama heeft sindsdien al een aantal keer bij de aanleggers van de pijplijn aangedrongen op een beter onderzoek naar andere routes. Maar hier was geen gehoor aan gegeven. De demonstranten hadden aangedrongen op een overheidsbesluit voor half januari, als Donald Trump aantreedt als president. Hard optreden Trump staat bekend als voorstander van dit soort projecten en zou vrijwel zeker toestemming geven voor de aanleg van de pijplijn volgens de geplande route. Bovendien blijkt hij volgens The Guardian nauwe banden te hebben met het bedrijf achter het omstreden project. De protesten namen de afgelopen weken toe. Honderden demonstranten trotseerden vrijwel dagelijks de ijzige kou in North Dakota om hun ongenoegen over de aanleg kenbaar te maken. De politie trad relatief hard op tegen de demonstranten: zo werden ondanks de kou waterkanonnen gebruikt. Nederlandse banken ING verstrekte volgens de Eerlijke Bankwijzer een directe lening van 248 miljoen dollar (233 miljoen euro). ING stelt slechts een krediet van 120 miljoen dollar te hebben verstrekt. Daarvan is minder dan de helft uitbetaald. Het tweede deel van de lening zou pas beschikbaar komen als alle vergunningen zijn afgegeven. De bank kon naar eigen zeggen niet stoppen met de financiering, omdat voor de lening een contract is getekend. Bij ABN Amro zou het volgens de Eerlijke Bankwijzer gaan om een lening van 45 miljoen dollar aan een van de betrokken bedrijven. De bank heeft geld geleend aan Energy Transfer Equity, het moederbedrijf van Energie Transfer Partners dat een aandeel van 38 procent in de pijplijn heeft. ABN Amro liet eerder weten dat het bedrijf dat de pijplijn bouwt geen klant is en dat de bank de pijpleiding dus niet financiert. De bank zei continu met Energy Transfer Equity in gesprek te zijn over zorgen rondom het project. De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) liet eerder weten de gebeurtenissen rond het project te onderzoeken.

Without it, institutions of higher education cannot truly be said to be preparing students for the world outside of the ivory tower. For many, a college campus is the last stop on the train to true adulthood. The Supreme Court has spilled barrels of ink defining the First Amendment rights of students, from kindergarten to post-graduate studies. But as students age, the shadows of the Constitution start to spread across the school day. Remarkably, Jackson was referring to grade school students, and the court rightly held that forcing patriotism on little ones was both unconstitutional and foolish. If we think inculcating constitutional values is important when kids are in K-12, it should be nothing less than a core part of the curriculum at any college or university. Soon, your students will graduate. By constitutional design, ours is a world where homophobic street preachers have a right to accost you at a funeral for a loved one, where avowed racists can bring a Nazi rally to your town, where Congress has no right to criminalize appalling images of animal violence. I suspect that many students would like to be able to effectively counter-protest the Westboro Baptist Church. Or publicize and advocate against animal cruelty. Because we need them to tackle public policy issues with the confidence of a generation determined to better us all. That means being an advocate: speaking out and convincing others. Confronting, hearing, and countering offensive speech we disagree with is a skill. And one that should be considered a core requirement at any school worth its salt. But as students age, the shadows of the Constitution start to spread across the school day. To be clear, I am not suggesting that free speech is without grave costs. We fortunately have federal laws to ensure safe learning environments and equal access for all students. But being offended does not rise to that level. We live in an odd country, where the very First Amendment in our Bill of Rights protects hateful speech until it crosses that line. But that same First Amendment also protects the most heart-swelling markers of our democracy: the right to speak our values, to have a press free from censorship, to gather en masse in the streets and speak truth to power. In that regard, recent incidents suggest that colleges are fundamentally failing their students in imparting these skills. In just the past few weeks, from one campus to another and another and another, liberal students have silenced conservative speakers with violence, outrage, and threats. These incidents have not shut down a single bad idea. When you choose censorship as your substantive argument, you lose the debate. We need a next generation of students trained to take a deep breath, open their eyes, and change that world with their words and ideas. This is the world we cover.

As many of you know, the Black Snake also known as the Dakota Access Pipeline, is trying to make its way through the sacred land of the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota. This is about WATER. For Black, White, Red, Yellow, Brown. All Colors. All Nations. All Tribes. In many ways, I see that we can turn the struggle against the Dakota Access Pipeline into a blessing. A blessing that can wake us all up to the horrors of corporate greed that functions at the expense of our natural resources. A blessing to make all of us come together, no matter who we are and where we came from, to stand up and say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. A blessing of learning to let go of selfishness and greed, to come together for the greater good. But we can stand up where ever we are to show our support and solidarity in many ways. Written by my friend Aaron Edwards and myself, this song is inspired by the land of Standing Rock and all of the warriors out there on the front lines laying down their lives for WATER. But these mountains need their own water in the form of food, tents, blankets, and other materials in order to keep standing tall against the black snake. We are offering this song to help provide them with these things. Our love and prayers are with all people across the earth who are victims of corporate greed and power.

Image Opponents of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines protested near the White House on Tuesday. If the Keystone XL Pipeline is ever completed, for instance, it will employ about 35 full-time workers, relying for its operation on a vast network of sensors, drones and the like.

Standing Rock, the scene of the battle over the Dakota pipeline, stands with Flint., Mich., as the flash points of environmental racism in our recent history.

One of the forms in which the working class exists today is at the various nodal points along global supply chains. HISTORY OF THE PROJECT The project's precursor was an informal group formed in San Francisco, California in the aftermath of the events of September 11, 2001. The original purpose was to research changes in the world political economy; one subgroup studied Islamism and the changes in geopolitical inter-capitalist tensions; the other subgroup researched and attempted to intervene in class struggle. In October 2012 we regrouped as the Global Supply Chains class when we helped co-found the Bay Area Public School. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT Capitalism relies on an integrated infrastructure of production clusters and transportation networks, comprised of ports, warehouses, rail lines, highways, information grids and investment vehicles in order to produce and circulate goods. The physical nodes are arrayed in clusters of factories, warehouses, logistics services, and retail, all tied together by maritime, rail, trucking, and telecom networks. These networks generate flows of commodities and information with ever-increasing speed, as the system strives for just-in-time production and inventory-less distribution for a unified global market. Our project demonstrates how these nodes, clusters, networks, corridors and flows are interconnected within an integrated system of production, distribution and consumption. In providing useful and accessible real time information about conflicts along global supply chains, we aim to facilitate class-based collective action that forges connections and solidarity among related struggles. Our ultimate vision is a world beyond capitalist production and supply chains. In our experience, the ideal outcome is further questions, rather than facile answers.

Get short URL 13 10 9 The European Parliament has approved a mechanism that would allow for the implementation of visa-free regimes with Ukraine and Georgia. The corresponding decision was made by the majority of MEP's earlier in the day. Nevertheless, it is too early for residents of these countries to jump for joy as EU lawmakers still must vote on the issue next year. One of the main reasons which might urge European politicians to change their mind is the ongoing Ukrainian conflict, experts claim. And apart from the warfare, there are a lot of criminal activities which normally happen in such troubled areas. I don't know how Europe is going to handle this. According to the expert, the cancellation of a visa free regime for Ukrainian nationals could result in another immigration crisis for European countries. The EU, which has been struggling to cope with the massive inflow of Middle Eastern refugees for over a year, might prove incapable of bearing another burden of that kind. These people might well just decide and go explore Europe. also believes that the vote of the European Parliament on the visa-free regime suspension mechanism may have drastic consequences for the EU and Ukraine itself, in particular in terms of economy and employment. For example, on the border, citizens of Moldova must show their hotel bookings and documents confirming that they have sufficient finances. This is particularly evident in the case of Turkey, another country striving for liberalization of its visa-regime with the EU. Turkey submitted its EU membership application in 1998 (18 years ago), but talks started only in 2005. Negotiations on Turkish EU membership have been repeatedly suspended due to the Cyprus dispute and Turkey's record of denying freedom of the press, among other obstacles. The fact that the EU prefers to grant visa-free regime to a war- torn country like Ukraine, and has been suspending the same decision in case of Turkey for almost two decades, raises questions about the double-standards of its foreign policy. Making this decision, the EP was not interested whether Ukraine fulfilled the relevant conditions or not. As a pretext to deny the introduction of a visa-regime for Turkey, the EU cited the reaction of the Turkish government to the recent coup attempt that took place in the country in Summer 2016. However, Ozkan views the situation in a different way. Well, Ukraine, as we can see, has been given such a chance. To complete your registration, please follow the link in the e-mail message.

At her change of plea hearing Monday, Fallis pleaded guilty to felony counts of civil disorder and possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon. Under conditions of her plea agreement, federal prosecutors will move to dismiss the most serious charge of her indictment, discharge of a firearm in relation to a felony crime of violence, and recommend no more than seven years at sentencing, as well as no fine or restitution. From here, Hovland told Fallis she will undergo a pre-sentence investigation with a federal probation officer in the weeks ahead. She could be sentenced as early as April or May; however, her attorneys will discuss a sentencing hearing date to be determined, possibly in mid-May or June. Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary Delorme said he may call no more than one or two witnesses at sentencing. Hovland said she was unaccounted for an entire day from the halfway house where she has resided since October. She said her time on pretrial release has allowed her to better her life, from GED testing to diet and exercise to volunteerism.

Local news KXII News 12 in Sherman reports that the Blue Ridge spill was caused by a subcontractor who hit the pipeline with a tractor during a road widening construction project. Video of the spill shows a geyser spouting oil from the pipe several feet into the air and landing on U.S. Highway 121, causing local law enforcement to shut down the road. Of course, local officials have claimed minimal environmental impact in the spill and zero impact to the local drinking water. Enterprise is based in Houston, Texas. Enbridge is based in Canada. What was not widely reported at the time was the fact that the Seaway pipeline had experienced a leak at a hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, just three months earlier in late October. KOCO News 5 in Oklahoma states that the spill in Cushing released less than 50,000 gallons of oil and was quickly contained. Fox 4 News reports that although a man identified as an employee of Enterprise barred people from crossing the highway to the Blue Ridge spill, Plano-based environmental activist Jesse Puente was able to cross over and examine the pipeline spill, where he found pools of oil mixed with water. The Trump administration approved the Dakota Access pipeline just days after the Blue Ridge accident, angering the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and environmental activists known as water protectors. According to a study by Auburn University, if an oil pipeline bursts, it can create a serious health hazard for those who live near it. Crude oil, which is the type of oil spilled near Blue Ridge, contains more than 1,000 chemicals hazardous to humans, such as the carcinogen benzene. It is this reason that the Standing Rock Sioux have fought against the DAPL since last spring. While the Blue Ridge pipeline trails along a major highway in Texas, the DAPL is set to go under Lake Oahe, which provides water to Standing Rock and to millions of people down river. If the DAPL bursts beneath Lake Oahe, the oil and the chemicals in it could leach into the water, rendering it undrinkable. Two months ago, another oil pipeline 150 miles from Standing Rock burst, spilling oil and chemicals into the water, according to a piece in the Inquisitr. Although the Blue Ridge Seaway pipeline accident is far from Standing Rock, it is just one in a series of thousands of pipeline incidents in the last 20 years."}

We currently have over 2,100 Veterans on the roster. Our goal now is to prioritize this list to Veterans and Civilian personnel involved with operations, planning & onsite execution. next mission could be as early as the 2nd week of December.

We have full support of the Sioux tribe elders and will be cooperating with them every step of the way. Several had to be treated for hypothermia and one protestor who was hit directly with a grenade has reportedly had her arm amputated as a result.

It's time to display that honor, courage, and commitment we claim to represent. It's time for real Patriots. In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community. We are launching this second GoFundMe to create a Standing Rock Fund to address the ongoing needs at Standing Rock and our partners in camp.

This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement.

It has become far too easy for these companies to manipulate the deportation system as a weapon against their employees, threatening retaliatory deportation of immigrant workers who try to organize or speak out about wages and working conditions. Bad employers send a powerful, chilling message in the workplace when they deport employees for speaking out. The result is that too many workers are treated as second class and are too susceptible to abuse. The fear of deportation is real. Recently, a group of workers employed on a public workers project in the Washington, DC area came together and organized to protest reported wage theft by their employer, only to have their immigration status used in retaliation against them. As a result, more than half of the workers were fired and many workers and their family members were placed in deportation proceedings. By driving down labor standards to the lowest common denominator, they make it harder to enforce laws and standards even for native-born workers, and harder for employers who play by the rules to remain competitive. Not surprisingly, most Americans are against the deportation of workplace whistleblowers. Communities and commonsense policymakers have had enough of the deportations. signed the TRUST Act into law last weekend, a bill that gives law enforcement much more leeway to respond to immigration detainer requests and sets a minimum standard to ensure that those with most low-level, non-violent offenses are not wastefully held for deportation purposes. All month, immigration advocates have held vigils, concerts, forums, and protests demanding Congressional action. This weekend, thousands more are planning a massive civil disobedience in Arizona aimed at shutting down Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for the day.

Some recent approvals of natural gas pipelines, such as the Atlantic Coast Pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina, have taken two years or more. Chatterjee said he hoped a timeline of two-plus years would not become the new industry norm. He did not identify any specific green groups, but the Sierra Club and 350.org both have campaigns to reject pipelines filled with gas from hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, projects. The groups are fighting development of fossil fuels including oil, coal and fracked natural gas, because they say the production slows the transition to cleaner sources, like wind and solar power, and the conservation and storage of energy. The Trump administration is trying to boost output of the fuels to increase jobs in the industry and sell energy exports to allies. The lawyers with green groups exert pressure on the FERC review processes using legal strategies on federal endangered species, clean water and environmental review laws, said Chatterjee, a Republican. Ultimately, lengthier approvals mean projects are better able to withstand legal challenge, he added. As energy companies seek to transport gas to cities and to a growing number of liquefied natural gas operations for export, the approval of pipelines will top the agenda next year for FERC.

Just minutes earlier, she and the rest of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe learned that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers won't grant an easement that would have allowed construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) to cross under Lake Oahe on the Missouri River. Her joy is tangible, her infectious laugh punctuating every sentence. Klein asks her how she feels about the news. Then, she breaks down in tears. It's a short video, just over a minute long. Now, young Native American activists are looking ahead, focused on the very future Iron Eyes mentioned. While Sunday's victory is historic and certainly cause for celebration, Indigenous people have quickly called for continued vigilance, especially from young activists on social media. She says there's been an atmosphere of celebration as well as apprehension over the past few days, especially because they don't know what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Sunday's decision was made by the Obama administration, which will transition power to an administration that supports the completion of the pipeline project. But we must remain cautious, Trump is right next in line. And many activists and water protectors say the good news won't erase the reported human rights abuses that have taken place. While Reuters reported that Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, asked those who are not Sioux to leave the area for the winter on Tuesday, water protectors aren't planning to leave anytime soon. In March, when they heard about plans to reroute the Dakota Access Pipeline away from Bismarck and through sacred land, they took action. As part of the Standing Rock Youth, a group of about 30 young people from the Standing Rock Sioux community, they decided to go online, and make their issue known. By now, it has more than 460,000 signatures, including endorsements from celebrities and influencers like Leonardo DiCaprio, Shailene Woodley, Bill McKibben and Ndaba Mandela. And those are the very people they wanted to galvanize. Native American Kids Standing Up Against Big Oil Company. READ, SIGN & SHARE our petition. On July 15, the group also organized a 2,000-mile relay race to Washington, D.C. to deliver their petition. That same day, the camp received notice that construction on the pipeline would begin. Like the young people before her, Ladonna Brave Bull Allard grabbed her iPhone, made a video and posted it to Facebook. While Native-led news outlets, such as The Last Real Indians and Indian Country Today, have covered the pipeline and its threat of sacred land since the beginning, most mainstream news outlets didn't give the story attention until August. That's when thousands of water protectors and allies assembled to physically block construction, and when the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia heard the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's lawsuit. Since then, the movement's grown exponentially. When the situation at Standing Rock became especially tense in September, as North Dakota law enforcement unleashed dogs and pepper spray on water protectors, those at Standing Rock uploaded videos to Facebook and Twitter to show the rest of the world what was happening. In October, Native American activists and allies started using Facebook Live and other videos on the social network to further broadcast standoffs with police. She witnessed, in real-time, a police officer macing her little sister in the Youth Council with a large canister for an extended period of time. And they seemed pretty shaken by that. The tool, Wise says, has allowed large numbers of people to understand what's actually happening on the ground. Later that month, thousands of allies started checking in to the Standing Rock Reservation on Facebook, in an attempt to confuse police after rumors that they were monitoring the social network to keep track of water protectors. However, local law enforcement denied this, which meant the effort, while well-intentioned, didn't achieve what allies hoped. Dallas Goldtooth (Mdewakanton Dakota and Dine), an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, told Mashable in October that he felt the Facebook check-ins actually helped generate support. Beyond media attention, the impact of these social media campaigns is felt within Indigenous communities, too. Wise says the movement has very much been about the youth reclaiming their own power, especially since many elders may not live to see the true impact of their decisions. But it's also about showing the incredible solidarity across various Indigenous communities that have converged on Standing Rock, and the powerful moments they share. The wide sentiment among activists is that it's a temporary victory, especially as a Trump administration looms. That includes further honing their social media skills. Wise says one thing Indigenous youth and other water protectors have learned is to make hard copies of everything they post online. They've encountered instances in which Facebook has removed posts, or technical issues randomly shorten or delete posts. They're also learning how best to navigate Facebook's algorithm, working to make sure people can see what's happening in real-time and remain educated. The fight is NOT OVER. Let's kill the Black Snake. The Sacred Stone Camp released a series of 10 questions water protectors encourage everyone to ask in the coming days and weeks, including when the Army Corps will conduct an Environmental Impact Statement, and to what extent will there be tribal input. The Int'l Indigenous Youth Council on the banks of the Cannonball River, Sicangu Camp side, fighting for your right to clean agua. For now, water protectors at Standing Rock are standing firm, showing no signs of going anywhere and making sure their allies know the fight isn't over. I don't know. And that uncertainty is terrifying. But she also feels that the water protectors' prayers have gotten stronger. For the foreseeable future, they still will. youth used social media savvy to start the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Petition Closed Stop the Dakota Access Pipeline This petition had 564,464 supporters Bobbi Jean Three Legs and the Oceti Sakowin Youth started this petition to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Brent Cossette and 1 other We are a group of young people from the Oceti Sakowin area calling on the Army Corps of Engineers to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). We believe that the DAPL has great potential to leak into the Missouri River and cause harm to the great people of this nation whose water and livelihood depends on the river. Sign to stand with us and demand a stop to the Dakota Access Pipeline. Together with People Over Pipelines, we lead a relay race over 500 miles to deliver the signatures from this petition to the Army Corps of Engineers. Young people from across the Oceti Sakowin lands and non-Native youth ran over 8 days through South Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa, from reservation to reservation, through smalls towns and bigger cities along the Missouri River. A lot of lives who will be effected if this pipeline were to be approved. The Dakota Access Pipeline is projected to extend 1,134 miles and connect the Bakken and Three Forks production areas in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois. It is set to be built in May 2016, with construction beginning in the Bakken, and is supposed to be running later this year. The DAPL is designed to transport 450,000 barrels of crude oil per day along this route, and it will cross the Missouri River less than a mile away from the Standing Rock Reservation. We're worried that it could leak and pollute our river, poison our people. The power of prayers carried us at times we couldn't run anymore, but something made us all get out there and keep running. We all understood that the sacrifice was much bigger than ourselves. We wanted people to hear us so we had to show them and bring the Dakota Access Pipeline issue to light to protect Unci Maka (Mother Earth). We saw thousands of faces who would be impacted by the construction of this pipeline. The fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline can only be successful if we have your voice. Please sign your name to tell the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that the Dakota Access Pipeline Project is damaging to all life along the Missouri River.

We believe that the DAPL has great potential to cause harm to the great people of this nation whose water and livelihood depends on the Missouri River. For a long time, man has behaved as though he has absolute dominion over nature, and now we are beginning to see the effects of what this attitude has done to our world. DAPL is a 1,134-mile oil pipeline from the Bakken Shale deposits to Illinois refineries. The pipeline diameter would be 12-30 inches, with an expected capacity of up to 570,000 barrels per day, or more. The DAPL would cross the Missouri River less than one mile upstream of the mouth of the Cannon Ball River, and only about 12 river miles upstream from the Reservation drinking water intake on the Missouri River at Fort Yates. For this reason, there is a great possibility that anyone who gets their water from the Missouri River will be threatened by a potential spill. In North Dakota alone there have been 300 oil spills in the last two years. It is therefore not a matter of if the pipeline will break, but when, and how large the spill will be when it does. the threat to public health both on and off reservations, there is no lead federal agency for DAPL, so there has been no comprehensive environmental impact analysis. The oil company prepared an environmental report for the Corps of Engineers containing general information about certain segments of the pipeline, but there has been no effort to conduct the requisite analysis under the National Environmental Policy act (NEPA). federal agencies have sent letters to the Army Corps with concerns with the draft EA. These organizations are the EPA, the Historic Preservation Office, and the Department of Interior.

She been an active participate and family to the activist groups NYC Shut It Down and Hoods4Justice. Sophia has always been committed to confronting injustice through vigilance and resistance. Sophia was giving out bottles of water to protectors holding down the space when she was shot with a concussion grenade. This was the response of police and DAPL mercenaries as she and other brave protectors attempted to hold the line against the black snake in hservice of protecting our water. Please consider donating to help pay for her treatment. We must to support our comrades when they need us the most. She needs all of us right now. After all she is our family. My name is Michael Basillas, I live in NYC. Sophia Wilansky is a fierce friend of mine. We've known each other for almost a year now from participation in various demonstrations focused in the city. Sophia and I share passion addressing social justice, vigilance, and resistance , and understanding this world is unsuitable and required drastic change. Sophia is family to many affinity activism groups from The Base, NYC Shut It Down, and HOODS4JUSTICE. I'm this money with the help of several other people to provide medical relief funds after what had happen on Nov 21, 2016. HOW THE MONEY WILL BE SPEND: Funds raised in this campaign will go directly to provide financial aid towards 20 surgeries Sophia needs to save her arm. Funds also provide Sophia's father some financial support to take care of his daughter. Their insurance will not cover all of the expenses and can only cover a certain percentage of it especially with this type of surgery. So we are asking to donate gracefully because this will help provide financial support toward Sophia's long recovery. The rest of the money will be delivered to Mr. Wilansky when he gets back one in NYC. They frequently post information about Sophia's well-being. Thank you for the support you have given us. Please try again. She stood in silence. She was sanding to close to a truck and they didn't like that. I suppose an unarmed, unarmored young woman is threatening to them. They ordered for her to retreat, the whole time shooting rubber bullets. When they finally stopped, she attempted to retreat, as they ordered. She took a few steps towards us, and that's when they directly launched the flash grenade at her. It exploded right on her. I want people who are not here to understand, we assemble in PEACE. Sophia said not a word to them. She is the proof that they will use violent tactics no matter what. We are not to blame here. Anyone who would blame the people and not the government in this situation astounds me... Wilansky family, please contact me. I am a witness to what Morton County did to your daughter. I think it's beautiful for everyone to help but that is a lot of money and maybe we can petition for them to donate their fee to her medical bills. It would be an estimate of half a million dollars if she needs a prosthetic arm. Calling the FBI could result in you providing information that could be potentially incriminating to yourself and others. Many of these police do not see your constitutional right to peacefully assemble. They do not see your point of view or what you are fighting for. Clearing a public road resulted in use of deadly force against hundreds of people. They have responded to us with escalating violence, and increased charges. Put pressure on your legislators, federal agencies, and the White House. Put pressure on North Dakota's governor. Call on the Department of Justice. Please keep eachother safe, and learn about your rights. May she recover more beautifully than could be imagined. May she know the love of thousands. May all her old ones enfold her now. May her story wake up the hearts of tens of thousands. May the protectors and the waters they protect be kept safe from harms way. Sorry for my skepticism. I should have researched better. They are just jealous they don't have this kind of support. And the police will be looking at serious charges against them for crimes against humanity. Thank you all water protectors for the fight. Sending troops in to back you up and lots of them. Below is her statement as conveyed by her father, lawyer Wayne Wilansky. A grenade exploded right as it hit Sophia in the left forearm taking most of the undersurface of her left arm with it. Both her radial and ulnar artery were completely destroyed. Her radius was shattered and a large piece of it is missing. Her medial nerve is missing a large section as well. All of the muscle and soft tissue between her elbow and wrist were blown away. The police did not do this by accident - it was an intentional act of throwing it directly at her. Additionally police were shooting people in face and groin intending to do the most possible damage. Sophia will have surgery again tomorrow as bit by bit they try to rebuild a somewhat functioning arm and hand. The first surgery took a vein from her leg which they have implanted in her arm to take the place of the missing arteries. She will need multiple surgeries to try to gain some functional use of the arm and hand. She will be, every day for the foreseeable future, fearful of losing her arm and hand. There are no words to describe the pain of watching my daughter cry and say she was sorry for the pain she caused me and my wife. I died a thousand deaths today and will continue to do so for quite some time. Prayers for her healing. And for a good attorney. This needs to be taken to court. The sacrifices that this young woman made to be there to support an important cause will be with her the rest of her life. She chose to stand up, she chose to help others that were in need that night and ended up getting severely injured. The least we can all do is come together and support her in her recovery. Her physical, emotional and mental state are fragile at this time and in need of lots of support to assist her. I don't know her personally but thank her from the bottom of my heart. I love that so many folks are pulling together and showing so much love and support. Let's keep this momentum going and make sure all her expenses are covered. We are in this together and together everyone achieves more. Please. Water is life. Let's try to do better and be better. Best wishes for Sophia and her family. She was just passing out water and helping This gotton of control when this girl could loose and an arm or hand. The violent use police are doing is wrong.

Those congregating at Standing Rock rely on everything from roadkill deer to donated Funyuns and other dried and canned goods to provide on-site sustenance. Non-perishables like dried seaweed, venison jerky, smoked salmon or pretty much anything that is canned or jarred are helpful to send to the site, and various groups have created lists of necessary supplies to help guide you in what to donate. Sacred Stone Camp Cast iron stove Amazon With cold weather approaching, Sacred Stone Camp is in need of firewood, as well as woodstoves, propane and fire extinguishers. Because of lack of solar and wind energy at the camps, burning wood and gas will be the primary source of warmth (for both bodies and cooking) in the winter months. Supplies as well as donations can be sent to Sacred Stone Camp P.O. Box 1011, Fort Yates, ND 58538 and 202 Main Street, Fort Yates, ND 58538. Sacred Stone Camp has also created an Amazon wish list to assist you in your purchasing of supplies. Oceti Sakowin Camp Bracing for winter, the Oceti Sakowin Camp has a similar need for propane, heating stoves and cold weather attire, as well as bulk food supplies to be stockpiled for winter, as their current stock of bulk food is dwindling or expiring. Pick up a few extra cartons of rice or preserved meats on your next Costco trip and ship them to Oceti Sakowin Camp, P.O. Individual efforts Individuals and businesses across the country are organizing fundraisers and food drives to donate supplies to Standing Rock. Washington resident Ben Sittingbull has set up a donation page to fill a trailer with thousands of pounds of donated organic food. Students and activists near Madison, Wisconsin, activists from Santa Cruz, California, San Francisco, Los Angeles and beyond, as well as Texas-based hot dog restaurant Frank and plenty more concerned people and businesses across the country have volunteered their time and services to collect food and deliver it or ship it to Standing Rock. All it takes is some time and organization to involve your community in a fundraiser and drive to collect supplies and express solidarity with Standing Rock en masse. And, of course, you can donate funds directly to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which will be allocated appropriately to support the on-the-ground efforts. All rights reserved."}

No casting has been announced for the second, royal-focused series, but a similarly high-profile cast is likely to be recruited. The series has been created by Ryan Murphy, who has a longstanding relationship with FX, with shows including American Crime Story and American Horror Story. Speaking prior the announcement, Murphy described his ideal subjects for future series of the show. Charles and Diana married in 1981 but separated after little more than a decade, before divorcing in 1996. Diana died in a car crash in Paris in 1997, leading to a national outpouring of grief across the UK.

They had one of the best band logos in the world, designed by comix artist Gary Panter of Jimbo renown. We thought the Screamers and Tomata du Plenty were fucking unbelievable. They were so way ahead of their time. They were using rudimentary synths and sequencers but with punk energy and aggressive lyrics and theatrical staging with German expressionist lighting. Tomata had been banging around the Seattle scene in the early 1970s before relocating to L.A. After the Screamers broke up in 1981, he switched his attention to painting. Sadly, in August 2000, Tomata died of cancer at the age of 52.

A Lakota Sioux and her 5-year-old son pose for a photo at a protest camp erected to halt the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Case, for instance, traveled quite a long way to the Peace Garden State: she is from the sunny shores of Hawaii, not rugged North Dakota, and she claims a Native Hawaiian identity, not a Native American one. The diverse constellation of Native theologies articulated at Standing Rock and other indigenous protest camps champions the reverse: they seek to protect land, water, and other natural resources from further human development, precisely because they are deemed sacred by indigenous people. And this year, after centuries of struggle, their prayers are starting to be answered. Beginning with just a few tents sprinkled across a barren field earlier this year, protesters now say nearly 10,000 people have visited the thriving camps, with guests hailing from as many as 300 different indigenous tribes. Expressions of solidarity between indigenous groups may sound predictable, but the history of Native American activism is pockmarked with internal squabbles. Early attempts to unify indigenous causes in the United States, such as the creation of the American Indian Movement in the 1960s, have since been marred by controversy and factionalism. Native Hawaiians once avoided connections between their cause and that of Native Americans, lest they suffer the same humiliating defeats as those in the continental United States. In Arizona, members of the Apache nation began occupying an area known as Oak Flat, vowing to fend off the proposed development of a copper mine on land they call holy. And when environmentalists pushed back against the creation of the Keystone XL pipeline, organizations such as the Cowboy and Indian Alliance bolstered the existing climate change movement with Native activists in both Canada and the United States. A Native American prayer stick is held near the capital during a Keystone XL protest in 2014. Meanwhile, something new happened: social media allowed indigenous people across the country to show support for their fellow activists with a few simple clicks, adding hashtags and memes to their own Facebook and Twitter profiles. The digital connections helped elevate their respective causes, but also forged real-world relationships between activists in different tribes. By the time Standing Rock rolled around, a spiritual network of indigenous people was already in full effect. Years later, Case returned the favor by assisting Sisk in her effort to restore California waterways once frequented by millions of local salmon. Virtually all of the protests she has attended, she said, featured some form of prayer or sacred ritual. Native protestors rally on Capitol Hill in 2015 to stop the construction of a copper mine in Oak Flat, Arizona. All of the activists ThinkProgress interviewed insisted they spoke only for themselves when discussing faith, explaining that each tribe harbors its own unique spiritual traditions, practices, and customs forged over the course of centuries, if not millennia. Religion has long been a part of Native American protest movements, as has its connection to the environmentalist struggle. He noted that Native Hawaiian schoolchildren are already singing songs written in the protest camps of Mauna Kea just a year before. While this groundswell of religious generation is rooted in old traditions, it sometimes reawakens ancient elements that can challenge elders. Although traditionally celebrated in many tribes, two-spirit people have not always been welcomed by modern indigenous people. The Hawaii case is similarly rooted in disputes over sacred land, although the lawsuit currently focuses on state laws, not the federal statutes. But according to Johnson, an expert on sacred land disputes, the law is often not enough to guarantee indigenous groups a win. Indeed, the movement thus far has largely been sustained through protest and agitation. Slowly accruing support and attention over time, and leaning on sacred claims, activists whittle away the patience of corporations and government officials until they (ideally) give up. In Hawaii, construction of the TMT is currently stalled while lawyers debate aspects of the construction process, prompting The Hawaii Island New Knowledge fund to begin investigating alternative sites. In March, the Obama administration moved to place Oak Flat on the National Register of Historic Places, adding another bureaucratic hoop preventing the Resolution Copper company from installing a mine on site. The Lummi Nation in Washington State successfully defeated an effort to build the largest coal port ever in North America near their land earlier this year, and Native groups are also credited with helping stop the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline in 2015. And in addition to their secular allies in the climate movement, indigenous groups are also attracting partners in non-Native faith traditions. Representatives from the Presbyterian Church (USA), United Church of Christ, Episcopal Church, and the United Methodist Church have all visited the Standing Rock camp or expressed solidarity with the protesters, as has the Nation of Islam, according to the Religion News Service.

Trump Administration Orders Media Blackout at EPA The Trump administration has gagged employees at two federal agencies. Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Agriculture are now blocked from communicating with the public and the press. But not just that, at the EPA, grants and contract budget have also been frozen. Scientists at the research division of the US Department of Agriculture are no longer allowed to communicate with the public about taxpayer-funded research. The EPA is responsible for passing and upholding regulations on issues such as clean air and water and the carbon emissions responsible for global warming. The USDA is less politically sensitive than the EPA, though it does do some research into genetically modified food and pesticides and it has used research money to investigate how to cut down methane, a greenhouse gas that is a major cause of climate change.

The state of North Dakota issued an emergency evacuation last week for the main camp, formerly known as Oceti Sakowin, that goes into effect today. While the Governor says this evacuation is for the safety of the people and the river, we know better than to believe these claims. Ironically, the Governor also voiced his concerns about flooding and how this puts people at risk. Flooding is happening sooner than anyone anticipated due to warmer-than-normal temperatures. This is why the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, The Indigenous Environmental Network and Native Organizers Alliance among many others have called for Native Nations Rising: Rise with Standing Rock on March 10 in Washington D.C.

Rise with Native Nations. Click here to sign up and learn more. As another transition takes place for the camps and for this movement, it seems like a good opportunity to reflect on how and why this movement began, what we learned, and where we are going next. Three Lessons from Standing Rock 1. We Need to Work Together This movement taught us that we need to work together, that it no longer works to organize or work in silos as if our issues are separate. Respecting Indigenous rights means climate justice, self-determination for Indigenous Peoples means water systems and ecosystems will be protected for generations, and respecting treaties goes go hand in hand with respecting the rights of Black and Brown people across this nation. 2. We Are Powerful We also learned or we were reminded that collectively we can change history. One tactic of colonization that has been used to eliminate our existence is erasure. Excluding our narratives from history books, media, you name it. With Standing Rock and with the sustained support from our allies, the Indigenous voice became apart of mainstream news and media. Because of this, millions of people, not just in America but across the world, can never unknow what they know now. Together we broke the pattern of erasure. On this day, and since the beginning, standing for the water: Joye Braun, Tania Aubid, Ladonna Allard. Photo by: Toni Cervantes 3. Indigenous People Must Lead Finally, we learned that Indigenous Peoples must lead environmental, climate, and political movements. Indigenous Peoples have an inherent connection to how to live in harmony and in reciprocity with the Earth, unlike the colonized mind that is taught to extract and commodify the resources we have been offered. In doing so they also called attention to the appalling racism and colonization that is still alive in America. The Dakota Access pipeline was originally proposed to go through Bismarck, a predominantly White community. After locals pushed back on the pipeline for fear that it would poison their water system, the pipeline was rerouted through tribal land without proper consultation with the Standing Rock Sioux Nation or their consent. In response to this injustice, the youth began a spirit camp on the land that would become known as Oceti Sakowin. Their courage and determination sparked a unified Indigenous-led movement that not only fulfilled ancient prophecies but also elevated and centered Indigenous issues that go beyond Dakota Access. After months of lawsuits and global mobilizations pressuring President Obama and the Army Corps of Engineers, it was announced that the project would undergo an environmental review. Under federal law, pipelines are eligible for a fast-tracked permitting process, which is how Dakota Access bypassed more rigorous environmental and public review. They plan to continue to use all legal avenues available even if oil starts flowing. People are withdrawing their individual accounts and more Divest Your City campaigns are popping up every day. While the ultimate fate of the legal challenges is unknown, with Trump in office, there is reason to believe that oil could soon flow through Dakota Access and under the Missouri River in a matter of months. Yet, despite what we are up against, because of what Standing Rock has taught us, I feel strong, and I know that our collective resistance, if sustained, will have a long term impact on stopping the fossil fuel industry. From the Trans-Pecos Pipeline in Texas to the Bayou Bridge Pipeline in the Gulf and up to the Line 3 and Line 5 Pipelines in the Great Lakes region, there are numerous places where we can continue to put pressure on the Fossil Fuel Industry and demand that Indigenous Rights and climate science be honored.

Author: Antonia Juhasz Publish date: Nov 1, 2016 Oceti Sakowin Camp, the main water protector campsite located just to the North of Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Reservation on Highway 1806, near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, on October 27th, 2016. a youth boldly declares. Visit Website Arrayed against the protectors on this day is a vast phalanx of police from multiple states and agencies, National Guardsmen, and armed private security forces working for Energy Transfer Partners. The equipment, weapons, uniforms, and tactics they deploy immediately bring me back to my 2011 and 2012 reporting trips to Afghanistan. And while it may seem unlikely for such events to unfold in rural North Dakota; the objective is all too familiar: oil. Over the last seven months, thousands of people, including members of over 280 tribes and First Nations, have joined the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline, which passes half a mile from its reservation. A victory for the Tribes came on September 9th, when the Army Corps of Engineers denied permission for the pipeline to pass under the Missouri River while it conducted a more thorough review. Energy Transfer Partners flatly refused. Just four small areas remain for the laying of the pipe: the land immediately to the west of Highway 1806; Highway 1806 itself; under Front Line Camp on the east, which will also serve as a staging ground for the final step; and passage below the Missouri River, a little over a mile away. On October 23rd, a group of hundreds of protectors claiming eminent domain over the land as its rightful owners under the 1851 Laramie Treaty, decided that their bodies would have to act as the final buffer between the pipeline and the water. They established the Front Line Camp directly in its path, blocking Highway 1806 in several locations as well. On almost any other day, in any other year, the site of the protest would simply be a lonely stretch of two-lane highway reaching out across prairie fields barren but for waving yellow strands of grass, some corn, and the occasional bale of hay. Keep going north 50 miles to reach Bismarck; half a mile south to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Reservation. This beauty is under attack. As I detailed in November in an article from North Dakota, in 2006, the onset of a highly unexpected and equally unregulated oil fracking boom from an underground deposit known as the Bakken Formation introduced an economic bounty for some, but also toxic flares, fracking fluid spills, pipeline ruptures, and an economic roller coaster for many more. Nearly 1,800 oil- and gas-related accidents, fires, blowouts, leaks, spills, ruptures, and other problems were reported here in just the 12 months from November 2014 to November 2015. The massive increase in oil production could not stay put for long, and trains and pipelines were increasingly employed to carry the bounty outward to faraway refineries and terminals for overseas export. As with so many locations where oil is produced, few are more harmed here than the Native population. The heart of the Bakken boom lies beneath Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, which is also the site of the majority of its associated harms described above, while its pipelines pass near and through ever more Native land. All of which helped lay the groundwork for a historic moment of resistance. October 27th, 12:40 p.m. Acrid black smoke billows skyward from tires set ablaze, part of a blockade across Highway 1806 devised by the protectors, aimed at keeping the police forces from advancing and taking Front Line Camp. As the day progresses, the constant buzz of a helicopter circling low overhead, combined with the rumbling of a small plane occupying the air above it, is abruptly overtaken by the crushing boom of an exploding concussion grenade, forcing hundreds of bodies to instinctively contract inward as one. With a quiet swoosh, a Taser releases its electrified metal barb into the cheek and hip of a young man; inches away, the liquid flush of pepper spray is felt long before it is seen; a searing and biting sting that forces eyes and throats to immediately lock shut. Rubber bullets smack into flesh; and a burst of police tackle a youth causing skin and bone to whack and tear against pavement. Shouts of fear, pain, anger, and resistance follow, interspaced with periods and areas of a relative calm that is balanced on a pin waiting for the next prick. Clockwise, from top left: Police from multiple states and agencies, National Guardsmen, and armed private security forces working for Energy Transfer Partners gather on Highway 1806 to remove Native American water protectors and their allies from the Front Land Camp and barricades on Highway 1806, on October 27th, 2016. She then points to the west, to a field on the other side of the highway, where construction of the pipeline is actively underway. As we watch, a group of protectors takes to this field. Just as quickly, an armored Humvee and line of police fill the area, pepper spray canisters as large as fire extinguishers and batons at the ready, repelling the protectors with intimidation and arrests. Medics pass out bright orange ear plugs. I later learn from Lyle Jeremy Rubin, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Afghanistan, that the source of the high pitched screeching siren occasionally blasted at us is a Long Range Acoustic Device. The shrill sound, also used to keep pirates at bay and regulate the movements of wildlife, can over-stimulate the heart, resulting in agitation among those targeted. Today, the LRAD is fitted to a massive tan armor-plated International MaxxPro Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle (MRAP) designed to withstand Improvised Explosive Devices in war zones holding court front and center on the highway. A black counter-terrorism vehicle, the Ballistic Engineered Armored Response Counter Attack Truck sits closely at its side. Numerous tan armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (a.k.a. Humvee) are arrayed here, throughout the fields, and on surrounding hill tops, where many remain to this day. Photographs later confirm that the snipers are perched within Humvees, their heads poking out of turrets at the top, rifles pointed and ready. A force flanks to the right, moving into Front Line Camp. They are slow, methodical, and practiced. With tears streaming down her face, she describes the hurt and shame she felt at seeing the exact same equipment used in Iraq deployed on her homeland. The Oklahoma Ponca elder and Tribal Council Member is a figure of calm surrounded by a swirl of chaos. Several people huddle protectively around her, placing their hands on her back and head, using their bodies as shields. Camp-Horinek and the others stand impenetrable as the stream of police engulfs and then passes by them. They are arrested and jailed. A larger prayer circle led by male tribal elders has gathered further south on the highway. When the police line reaches it; they too are arrested. Approximately 4 p.m. A group of about 50 protectors in a large circle on the ground in Front Line Camp, arms intertwined, praying, singing, and holding ground. He is pulled out of the circle, tackled, and arrested. The police then slowly encircle and arrest the remaining group, before continuing their steady forward crawl. Approximately 4:30 p.m. As if out of a mirage, a herd of buffalo appear to the east of the melee, streaming majestic across the hills. The nearby action freezes as one person follows the gaze of another. Shock turns to momentary joy. Whoops, cheers, and ululations fill the air. Two Native horse riders follow the herd, fists raised, only to be chased down by SWAT in ATVs. One horse is so badly injured by police that it is later put down. As they are pushed back along the highway, groups of protectors stop and try to erect further barricades, using hay, logs, and even dismantling and locking themselves under a truck. Over the course of the day, perhaps five to 10 people throw water bottles, some rocks, and even an occasional log at police. Some even fight back. It is a common sentiment. But for most of those with whom I spoke, the worst violence committed on this day was not done by the protectors, nor the police; it took place to the west of the line where the construction equipment dug into the sacred burial ground, moving the pipeline ever forward, with an invading military force to protect it. Approximately 6 p.m. Front Line Camp is gone, and with it the barriers on Highway 1806. One-hundred-and-forty-one people were arrested, the others returning to the two main camps. During the night, three cars are set ablaze further down Highway 1806 in between the camps to the south, and the pipeline construction to the north; a barricade none admit to erecting behind which the Humvees, snipers, and police remain affixed on roadways and hills to this day. Cars sat ablaze the night of October 27th, 2016, on Highway 1806. Humvees, snipers, and police to the north, the Dakota Access Pipeline under construction beyond.

Could Be It' If you live in Denver, you are likely well aware of the scents of the city. The leak occurred at a rural pump station in the northeast of the state as crews worked to get the four-state pipeline fully operational, Walsh said. The oil was contained on site by a plastic liner and containment walls and quickly cleaned up. Some oil-contaminated gravel will be disposed of at an area landfill, he said. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which was the initial plaintiff in the lawsuit, said the leak proves that the pipeline is a threat to its water and cultural sites. Nobody listened to us. Tribal attorney Jan Hasselman said the leak shows the need for more environmental study of the pipeline, which will move oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution point in Illinois. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had planned additional study but scrapped the idea after President Donald Trump earlier this year pushed for completion of the pipeline that had been stalled by months of protests and lawsuits. Energy Transfer Partners maintains that the pipeline is safe.

A professor at the University of Calgary was able to discover a safer way to transport petroleum, which has been a hazard to the environment for many years. Ian Gates, who works at the Schulich School of Engineering at the University of Calgary, was attempting to upgrade bitumen in the laboratory. Bitumen is a mixture of hydrocarbons left over after oil is distilled. Traditionally, this material is used to create hard surfaces like road blacktops. However, in the process they actually degraded it, creating a thick, gummy mixture. By doing this, petroleum could be captured as the mixture hardens. Gates and his team were able to form pebbles of oil that would harden by themselves. These balls of bitumen safely stored oil that could end up being shipped in its new form."}

The pipeline is largely complete except for a short segment that is planned to pass beneath a Missouri River reservoir. The company doing the building says it is unwilling to reroute the project. For several months, the government permitted the gathering, allowing its population to swell. The Seven Council Fires camp began growing in August as it took in the overflow crowd from smaller protest sites nearby. It now covers a half square mile, with living quarters that include old school buses, fancy motorhomes and domelike yurts. Hale bales are piled around some teepees to keep out the wind. The number of inhabitants has ranged from several hundred to several thousand. It has been called the largest gathering of Native American tribes in a century. Increasingly, more permanent wooden structures are being erected, even though the Army Corps of Engineers considers them illegal on government property.

He said he intends to stay indefinitely, a prospect that may cause him to lose his house in Nevada. Camp morale is high, he added, despite the onset of winter. People are taking the shirts off their own backs for other people. On Thursday, the camp near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers was shrouded in snow, much of it compacted by foot and vehicle traffic. Temperatures hovered in the 20s. Camp dwellers are getting ready for the hardships of a long stay. Mountains of donated food and water are being stockpiled, as is firewood, much of which has come from outside of North Dakota, the least-forested state in the nation. A collection of Army surplus tents with heating stoves serve as kitchen, dining hall, medical clinic and a camp-run school. Many of the smaller tents have become tattered by the wind. Tribes from the Great Plains states are adept at surviving brutal winters, he said. Others from warmer climes are being taught how to endure the frostbite-inducing temperatures that are sure to come. Reddog said she has confidence in the camp community. Maxwell put out a call on social media for more donations, seeking four-wheel drive trucks and foul-weather clothing. He also asked for gas masks and protective baseball and hockey gear to shield protesters from any future skirmishes with police. More than 525 people from across the country have been arrested since August. In a recent clash between police and protesters near the path of the pipeline, officers used tear gas, rubber bullets and large water hoses in sub-freezing temperatures. Organizers said at least 17 protesters were taken to the hospital, some for hypothermia and one for an arm injury. One officer was hurt. North Dakota has often conjured images of a wind-swept, treeless wasteland. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier, who is heading the law enforcement effort around the pipeline, said he hopes the harsh conditions force people to leave the encampment, something the state and federal governments have so far been unable to do. But he said Wednesday that the state has no intention of blocking food and supplies from coming into the camp. The federal deadline probably will not have any immediate effect on the camp either. Soon after it was set, the Army Corps of Engineers explained that the agency had no plans to forcibly remove anyone, although violators could be charged with trespassing. Back at the camp, about 75 people lined up Thursday to draw propane for heating and cooking from a fuel truck. The driver, Rodney Grant, said it was his seventh trip in a week. The propane was free to campers. Grant said he did not know who was paying for it. Dani Jo McKing, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux, was among those in line. She and her husband have been sharing cold-weather tips with people who are not from North Dakota. She said people with out-of-state license plates, including California and Nevada, have been seen driving away from the camp. The cruel winter is bound to induce others to head home, she said. The cold weather has never bothered her. Summer Moore arrived last week from Paintsville, Kentucky, and quickly learned the power of the whipping North Dakota wind. When a snowstorm rolled in Monday, it ripped her tent to shreds. She hitched a ride to the casino on the Standing Rock reservation and rode out the storm in a hotel room.

By last year, the U.S. had built 12,000 miles of pipe since 2010. On Monday, TransCanada asked the U.S. State Department to suspend review of its controversial Alberta-to-Nebraska pipeline in the latest episode of a six-year drama that has seen as many as five environmental reviews, numerous legal challenges and a rejection in 2012 by President Barack Obama. The 487-mile southern leg of the project, dubbed the Gulf Coast project, between Cushing, Okla. and Texas refineries came on stream in 2014. While the northern leg of Keystone XL remains under review, the Lower 48s have seen new oil pipes crisscrossing the country. The U.S. midstream infrastructure is responding to a near-doubling of U.S. production over the past six years. The U.S. saw an 11.6 per cent increase in crude oil transport via pipelines in 2014, according to AOPL data. But as U.S. oil production eases in response to lower crude prices, the rapid build-up could see pipeline capacity exceed production in the Bakken in North Dakota and even the Permian basin straddling Texas and New Mexico, Ogunnaike estimates. Armed with shipping commitments despite low crude prices, key pipeline operators are proceeding with many projects to alleviate the bottlenecks, which could add as much as 8.7 million barrels per day by 2018, Reuters data shows. TransCanada has reported higher volumes on the Keystone Pipeline System in its third-quarter earnings, while Enbridge Inc. is also looking to expand its presence in the Gulf Coast. Much of the opposition in the U.S. has focused on crude rail terminals, especially in California and Oregon, which has led to delays on some rail projects. In many states, pipeline is viewed more favourably than the sight of crude-bearing rail cars barreling down town centres. But for many the fight against Keystone XL pipeline remains a high priority in a larger battle to combat climate change. All rights reserved.

Instead, with local law enforcement nowhere in sight, escalating violence and human rights abuses are exactly what was unleashed on the mostly Native American protesters this Saturday. Video taken by the liberal journalist Amy Goodman of Democracy Now show pipeline security workers siccing attack dogs -- first on several horses carrying demonstrators and then on the allegedly trespassing but seemingly mostly non-violent protesters. Other marchers were blasted with some type of pepper spray. The ancient cairns and stone prayer rings there cannot be replaced. The tribal opponents have a powerful moral case against the Dakota Access Pipeline, but the desecration of Native American land is not the only thing driving the opposition. In Iowa, farmers whose land is being taken for the pipeline through eminent domain are up in arms. The risk of a spill that could poison water supplies for thousands in the vast Missouri River watershed looms large. The pipeline would carry as much as 570,000 barrels of crude oil daily through the Dakotas and Iowa; it's unclear whether the fossil fuels are even intended for United States consumers -- or for overseas shipments and big profits. What's more, the Dakota Access Pipeline is objectionable for the same bigger reasons that the similar Keystone XL project was protested by so many and ultimately iced by the Obama administration: It will increase North America's addiction to fossil fuels at a time when -- as the New York Times noted in an remarkable report this weekend -- climate change is already here and rising sea levels are wreaking havoc. Yet the native tribes and other citizens fighting to block this environmental abomination were treated with the same brand of violence and intimidation that the notorious sheriff Bull Connor had sicced on civil rights protesters in Birmingham a half century ago. That's more proof that the arc of the moral universe is bending too slowly. A big chunk of money coming out of Pennsylvania is financing the dog siccers and the pepper sprayers -- including your tax dollars and mine. It turns out that one of the major investors in Energy Transfer Partners is...the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. That's more than any other governmental or quasi-governmental agency. The PSERS link isn't the only local connection. Sunoco Logistics Partners, which is headquartered in Newtown Square, is another key pipeline investor along with ETP, and the Dakota Access Pipeline is slated to feed into a Sunoco Logistics terminal. Sunoco is also slated to operate the pipeline -- if it's ever completed. What an irony: Pennsylvania science teachers are out on the front lines teaching school kids about the impact of global warming at the same time their retirement dollars are hard at work building this monstrosity of a pipeline. What's more, many large entities -- universities as well as some city and state pension funds -- are currently in the process of divesting in fossil-fuel ventures like this one and looking, instead, to finance alternative energy projects such as solar or wind. How typical that the Keystone State is going in the other direction from the rest of the enlightened world. It doesn't have to be this way. If you find these Bull Connor-type violent tactics to be unacceptable, if you find the desecration of indigenous shrines to be a moral outrage, or if you don't want your tax dollars pumping more carbon into the earth's atmosphere, then reach out to PSERS (phone number 1-888-773-7748, or contact them online). Tell them it's time to stop investing in firms like ETP that a) condone violence against protesters and b) contribute to the slow destruction of the planet. Also, pressure elected officials like Gov. Wolf to use their influence with PSERS to start divesting. And it would be fantastic to see Pennsylvania school teachers leading the way on this. I don't know. But the least they can do is call off the dogs. 'Sesame Street': Bert and Ernie aren't gay."}

Yet his execution was a reminder of the kinds of cases Gorsuch would review if confirmed to the Supreme Court. When outside lawyers tried to step in to correct their gross neglect, courts blocked them at every turn. Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch arrives for a meeting at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Feb. 2, 2017. At the center of their argument was midazolam, the first in the three-drug cocktail used to kill Lockett. But sodium thiopental had become unavailable years before, in part due to an international anti-death penalty campaign to cut off supplies. States rushed to find a replacement, tinkering with their formulas. Yet Oklahoma forged ahead. The District Court denied the challenge. Judge Gorsuch joined the decision. Warner was executed three days later. Oral arguments in Glossip v. Gross took place on April 29, 2015. In her dissent, Sotomayor disagreed. In a perverse postscript to the legal saga over midazolam, autopsy records would later reveal that Oklahoma killed Charles Warner using the wrong drug, a discovery made public only after Oklahoma came close to doing the same with Richard Glossip later that year. Judge Gorsuch may be a bit player in this sorry legal episode, but that does not entirely excuse him. Other decisions have inspired reflection in Gorsuch. Francis was removed from the chair and successfully executed several days later. Staunch adherence to precedent is rarely good news for people facing execution, whose challenges can be easily waved away on procedural grounds, even when the facts of their case are objectively egregious. At the heart of this question was the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, otherwise known as AEDPA. More significantly, AEDPA shifted the balance of power in the judiciary, demanding far more deference from federal judges to state court rulings. AEDPA has been especially devastating for the wrongfully convicted. Durbin asked. Yet as a judge, his rare findings of error in such cases have been generally followed by the conclusion that the error was ultimately harmless. When his federal habeas petition was inevitably dismissed as untimely, the attorneys did not bother to tell Christeson, leaving him under the impression that his appellate proceedings were still underway. In the end, state intransigence and procedural roadblocks kept his new attorneys from saving his life. We cannot know how Gorsuch might have handled the case of the man executed on the night of his nomination. And while his record certainly suggests he might have waved it through on procedural grounds, this would hardly differentiate him from judges who have spent their careers doing the same. This includes Merrick Garland, whose nomination was so shamelessly derailed by Republicans last year. With Gorsuch yet to turn 50, he stands to be a conservative force on the Supreme Court for decades to come. Yet Singh points out that Supreme Court justices have very different experiences with death penalty cases. They see the arbitrariness, the flaws embedded in the system.

Today Congress convened its first session of the 114th Congress with Republicans controlling both the House and Senate. Today Congress convened its first session of the 114th Congress with Republicans controlling both the House and Senate. As campaign manager for Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean in 2004, he started a trend that has reinvented that way politicians run for office. But he believes that many politicians are still missing out on the power of the internet once they're elected. That's why Trippi is working with an internet startup called Countable, which seeks to give citizens a greater voice in national politics. The company's online service, which launches to the public today, gives you a simple and concise overview of the bills your national representatives are debating, and it lets you instantly send emails to these representatives, telling them how you would like them to vote. Countable joins a growing wave of online tools that can improve the dialogue between citizens and representatives, including Madison, which lets you add your thoughts to both proposed bills and existing policies, and ThinkUp, a tool the White House uses to gauge popular sentiment through social media. The new service is most similar to Democracy OS, which lets governments and non-profits set up websites where people can discuss issues and vote on particular topics. But instead of building a platform that government operations must install on their own computer servers, Countable is offering a ready-made service. In other words, you don't have to wait for your representatives to adopt anything. All you have to do is sign up and start sending your thoughts to Congress. WIRED Politics in Plain English Countable was founded by Peter Arzhintar and Bart Myers. The pair previously founded the web TV company SideReel, which they sold in 2011. They noticed that there were plenty of sites where you can find lists of bills being debated by Congress, but understanding those bills usually required quite a bit of specialized knowledge. They decided that one of the best ways to improve the political process would be to simply create a site that explained each bill that the House and Senate is voting on in plain English. So they built Countable. For now, you need a Facebook account to use the new service. Countable taps your Facebook profile information to determine your name, location, and your national representatives. It then shows you the next piece of legislation your representatives are expected to vote on, with a short summary of the bill and a list of pros and cons. You can also click on the bill's name to pull up more details, including voting activity, costs, links to media coverage, and the full text of the bill. But the company will also use this data to target adverting. The startup just closed its seed funding round, and it's now working on an iOS app, which Myers says should launch in about a month. So things are just getting started, and the company plans to add more tools to the service in the future, such as the ability to get voting recommendations from advocacy groups that you trust, ask your friends how you should vote, or suggest changes to a bill. It may eventually cover state level politics as well. For example, politicians often add amendments to bills that contain additional regulations or spending unrelated to the bill in question. Myers says that Countable will post updates to bills that have such riders. The company is hiring writers from a variety of backgrounds, including politics and marketing, to ensure that the content is both accurate and understandable. Myers says the company strives to offer a balanced view of the pros and cons of each piece of legislation. To improve develop the editorial process, the company is also advised by former Reuters News publisher Andrew Goldner. The other issue is e-mailing your representatives may not be that effective. And since Countable doesn't do much to verify that you are who you say you are, a lobbyist or advocacy group could sign-up for multiple accounts and make it look like constituents feel more strongly about an issue than they actually do. But Myers says this isn't much an issue, at least for now. Instead, he says, representatives are just keen to find a way to gather data from constituents in a new way. But the biggest issue facing the company is privacy. It's hard not to worry about a company that's compiling dossiers on people's positions on every single bill in Congress, but Myers says the startup won't sell data about how its users vote on particular issues to fundraisers or anyone else.

In spite of having previously announced that they would need to conduct an Environmental Impact Statement, the Corps has now decided that the process can be halted as they suddenly have the information needed to support approval of the project. We are devastated. Our tribe will challenge the easement decision and pursue legal avenues to stop this snake. Meanwhile, Seattle, WA and Davis, CA have voted to pull their city funds out of Wells Fargo due to its stake in the Dakota Access Pipeline. This campaign was always about so much more than one pipeline: it was about building a mass movement to support indigenous rights and youth leadership. The movement brought together young Native people from across the country, and we plan to stick together to support each other and keep fighting for our communities.

We have been doing our best to rest in this interim period, as we wait to see what happens to our movement once president-elect Trump is sworn in. A group of indigenous youth are walking from Saskatchewan, Canada to raise awareness about the fight to protect our water and to join us. They were motivated by a devastating oil spill which sent almost 60,000 gallons into the North Saskatchewan River, near their community. you have a few extra dollars that you are looking to donate before the end of the year, consider sending it their way. They will be using it to secure food, shelter, and supplies for the walkers.

Every time we ask you to make one last call or donate just a few more dollars, you show up in droves. While in Big Sur we received spiritual teachings from Chief Arvol Looking Horse and made plans for how we want to continue our organizing going forward. We participated in rallies in Santa Monica and in Ojai, where we met with the Chumash people in Ojai. many of you know, this weekend we heard about one of the most brutal police attacks on water protectors yet. Troopers used rubber bullets, mace, concussion grenades and water cannons on protectors in the dark, in freezing weather.

California is currently experiencing the worst drought in its history, and dealing with the harmful effects drilling and fracking have on its limited water supply.

Recently a few of us traveled to Flagstaff, Arizona, to join our Hopi brother Riley Ortega who organized a relay run from Arizona to Standing Rock in solidarity with our movement. addition, some of us just finished leading a teach-in in Boston, and another group of us were in New York City, meeting with media and organizing to put pressure on Hillary Clinton to comment on the pipeline. There we organized a march that ended in a rally at her campaign headquarters, where we set up a tipi in the lobby and called on her to commit to stopping this project if elected president.

Saturday, hundreds of people gathered at camp before dawn to walk 8 miles to a site where several water protectors had chained themselves to construction equipment. Some of us were present at this peaceful and prayerful action, walking over the burial grounds of our ancestors. But along the way, we were stopped by a line of military trucks and police officers who used pepper spray and batons to stop us. They body-slammed people to the ground, and arrested elders, journalists, and even a 17-year-old pregnant woman. In fact, just last week police in Washington state shot and killed Renee Davis, 5 months pregnant and mother of three.

On Standing Rock, like many other reservations, there is a severe lack of opportunities and resources for Native youth to grow and learn in a safe environment. Because of this, many young people struggle with addiction, and suicide is an all too common occurrence. you so much for your continued generosity. In a world where indigenous youth often feel like no one cares, this campaign has introduced us to a community of supporters who care deeply about protecting our earth and all those who live on it.

In the past few weeks since the announcement, they have been taking advantage of a lull in media coverage to increase their presence and continue criminalizing us for fighting to protect the water. Last week, 21 people from the camps were arrested while conducting a peaceful ceremony in which they planted corn and willow in the path of the pipeline. Police officers showed up with armored vehicles, in riot gear, and one of them even pointed a gun at the protectors before arresting them. be back soon with further actions you can take to help escalate the campaign.

We are thrilled, and know that this would never have happened without the support of our allies from across the country and around the world. Know that every call you made to the Army Corps, every tweet you sent to President Obama, every dollar you donated to help us deliver signatures in D.C. went towards this day.

Friday, after protesting in front of the Army Corps Headquarters, we had a meeting with several officials from the Army Corps, the Department of Defense, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. We delivered your signatures to them, and told them about why we are fighting to protect our communities from this pipeline. We talked about addiction and lack of opportunity on the reservation, and by the end of the meeting almost everyone was crying. It was an emotional moment, and we were so glad to be truly heard. For hours, we prayed, sang, and danced in the hot sun, calling on President Obama to come out and speak with us. When it started raining, we danced harder, and we sang louder. Sunday morning we left DC and drove to New York City to rally in Union Square. Shailene helped us put out the call, and Rosario Dawson joined us to speak about why she too opposes harmful oil pipelines. We ran around the park and through the streets, and our supporters ran behind us, helping to amplify our call. we are beginning our journey back to North Dakota to join our brothers and sisters at the Sacred Stone camp and await news on the legal battle our tribe has started against the pipeline. Today, we rest. Tomorrow, we keep fighting.

The Standing Rock Reservation has very few resources for young people, and those that do exist are constantly shutting down for lack of funding. We have no teen center and few job or educational opportunities. Our people are dying of drug abuse and alcoholism. shared this with the president when he met with myself and a small group of young people from our tribe in 2014. It was an emotional meeting for all involved. We told him stories about our struggles on the reservation, and he cried with us when one of my friends talked about having to leave college in order to come home and care for his siblings after his mother became addicted to meth. As we move farther east the air is getting more humid, and we are moving through time changes. Back home in North Dakota, our allies are continuing their efforts to stop the pipeline by camping on the lawn of the state capitol.

Yesterday we found out that in spite of months of campaigning, the Army Corps of Engineers has ignored our calls to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. They have granted a construction permit for the project. The Dakota Access Pipeline is a direct threat to the health and safety of those living along the pipeline route, yet our tribe was never consulted in talks leading up to the permit. Not only that, but the project relied on an environmental assessment that did not take tribal concerns into consideration at all. This means that we need to ramp up our efforts even more and increase pressure on them to do the right thing. But before then, we need your to help. The pipeline threatens the health and safety of all those living along its path, particularly the members of the Standing Rock Tribe, whose drinking water will be at risk. Though we are devastated by this news, we are NOT giving up. Please help us stay strong and stop this awful pipeline.

I think what we have done is, number one, demanded that the president do what he did with Keystone. A lot of people put a lot of pressure on the president, and he finally did the right thing. And that is to kill the Keystone pipeline, which, by the way, under a Trump may be reopened again. But that is what he should be doing. And certainly, the demand must go to the North Dakota authorities that the kind of military presence that exists there is simply not what is acceptable. So, we have written to the president.

I would like to explain why this advice is not only spiritually sound, but politically astute as well. I would like to translate it into a strategic compass for anyone who is going to Standing Rock or supporting the Water Protectors from afar. I also want to explain how it contains a recipe for the kind of miracles that we need for the healing of our planet. Let me explain what I mean here by a miracle. A miracle is a kind of a gift, an occurrence that is beyond our capacity to make happen. It is something beyond the normal rules of cause and effect as we have understood them. The halting of the Dakota Access Pipeline would be miraculous simply because of the array of powerful ruling interests that are committed to building it. Those banks, many of whom are facing financial stress of their own, are counting on the profits from the loans at a time when credit-worthy capital investments are hard to come by. Finally, the United States government has (in its estimation) a geopolitical interest in increasing domestic oil production to reduce the economic power of Russia and the Middle East. To hope to halt the pipeline in the face of such powers is in a certain sense unrealistic. The usual pattern has been one land grab after another in which resistance is at best futile and at worst suicidal. But at Standing Rock, something different is possible. It is not because the Dakota Sioux have finally acquired more guns or money than the pro-pipeline forces. It is because we are ready collectively for a change of heart. That would be good news not only for the people directly affected by the pipeline, because the whole planet is in need of similar miracles on a massive scale. Around the globe, powerful interests are destroying ecosystems and landscapes, clearcutting, stripmining, and polluting. In every case, the destroyers have more military, political, and financial power than those who would resist them. If this planet and our civilization is to heal, it cannot be through winning a contest of force. When you have a chance of overcoming an opponent by force, then fighting is a reasonable option. Absent that condition, victory has to come some other way: through the exercise of a kind of power that makes guns, money, and other kinds of coercive force irrelevant. Before I go on, let me convey to you my awareness of the injustice and suffering that the Water Protectors have endured. Many of my friends have witnessed them first hand. These things must be taken into account if a philosophy of nonviolence is to be relevant to the real world. Furthermore, I am no armchair philosopher in this matter. My own son is at Standing Rock as I write this. OK then, love. I am not talking about shying away from confrontation and hoping to stop the pipeline by loving the police or energy company from afar. Standing Rock has given us many examples of love in action that offer a hint of the miracle that is possible. I heard about one incident in which a group of Water Protectors went to talk to the sheriff about the water cannons. They were met with police who began to arrest them. While she was being arrested, one of the women began to sing a native prayer song; soon all of the group were singing in unison. The police began to look uncomfortable; one of them even started crying. Another, who looked like he might have Native heritage himself, started to take off his helmet but thought better of it when he saw none of the other police were doing it. There have been many actions like this at Standing Rock involving song, prayer, ceremony, and nonviolent resistance. To a great extent the urging of the elders has been heeded, and as the above incident demonstrates, these actions have an effect on the police. They disrupt the narratives that legitimize the forceful suppression of the Water Protectors, narratives about violent extremists, criminal elements, protecting the public, and so forth. This has already born fruit: if not for the resolute nonviolence of the resistance, the government would surely have forcefully evicted the Water Protectors by now, justifying violence with violence. If the Water Protectors go onto the warpath and see and treat the police as enemies, they play into the narratives that legitimize state violence. I heard one man shout that a curse was being placed on them and all of their descendants. I saw one man throw a rock at police in a boat and then be shot in the leg with one of their bean-bag bullets. Now put yourself in the shoes of the police officers. Nothing creates solidarity in the ranks like a common threat. They play into the very narratives that justify police action to begin with: maintaining law and order in the face of violent extremists. In other words, by engaging in this kind of verbal violence against the police, the militants comply with their own demonization. They put themselves in a position where the only kind of victory possible is a victory by force. That kind of victory is unlikely. Worse, even if it is achieved, it creates the conditions for an eventual defeat. In the case of indigenous peoples, their oppression is invariably facilitated by their dehumanization or even demonization. This is the deep template of genocide, the primary prerequisite. By demonizing the police or ETP executives, one contributes to the field of dehumanization. That is the essence of racism and the enabler of war. The dehumanization of the Other that happens in war, racism, and genocide is no different from any reduction of the sacred to the profane. It is the same mentality that informs the reduction of nature from a sacred, living intelligence into a collection of insensate things: mere resources to be exploited or an enemy to be conquered. The reduction of humans to enemies or to subhuman caricatures like greedy executives and donut-eating police pigs is the same mentality that makes it OK to threaten a river with catastrophic oil spills. Invoking the principle of morphic resonance, by entering into war mentality we strengthen the field of war, including the reduction and domination of nature. That is why victories in war so often lead to just more war. The war is won, but the ideals for which it was fought remain as distant as ever. So it has been for five thousand years. In other words, if we seek to win a fight using the tactics of dehumanization, we are contributing to the sacrilege that is at the root of the problem. No pipelines would be built if we loved the river like a grandmother. To be prayerful is to be in awareness of the sacred. We too easily forget the sacred, whether in relationship to human beings or to other-than-human beings like trees, soil, and rivers. If prayer is sacred speech, then to act prayerfully is to be reverent in action as well as speech. The dehumanization that leads us onto the warpath is the opposite of reverence. It is not easy to stay off the warpath. Each new atrocity and outrage renews the invitation into hatred. As tempting as it is for me, all the more for people at Standing Rock who have been subjected to violence personally or witnessed it first hand. To counsel forgiveness or nonviolence from afar seems almost arrogant, were it not echoing the elders and so many others on site. Each of these invitations onto the warpath also presents an opportunity to defy the enabling narratives of violence and to take a step toward victory without fighting. Meeting violence with nonviolence invites the other into nonviolence as well. Refusing the invitation onto the warpath automatically extends a counter-invitation to the enemy to cease being an enemy. That is why it is so important to remember that the purpose of nonviolent action is not to make the other side look bad. That would be a kind of attack, a kind of violence, and a tactic of war. No, the purpose is to invite the other side and onlookers alike to join you in courage. Of course, they may decline the invitation, but it grows more powerful with each escalation of violence. Each time you refuse the invitation onto the warpath, you become more powerful. Those who can stay peaceful in the face of any terror or threat become virtual miracle-workers. I am reminded of an Afghan woman I know named Sakena. She does peace and education work in Kabul, including the education of girls. One day Sakena was in a car with her driver, two staff people, and her unarmed bodyguard. Suddenly the driver stopped. A makeshift roadblock was ahead of them, manned by twenty or so young men dressed in fundamentalist garb and armed with rifles, which were pointed at the car. For the next half hour, the four people in the car watched as Sakena talked to the young men. Astonished, her staffers asked what happened. She told them that the young men had decided that they wanted to be educated too, just like the girls, and had arranged to meet her again the next week outside a certain mosque. Such is the potential power of staying off the warpath. Even with guns pointed at her, Sakena refused to see the young men as anything less than divine human beings. She saw them as promising young men who of course wanted an education. Her fearlessness and goodwill exerted an invitation so compelling that the men were nearly helpless to refuse it. The way we see and treat someone is a powerful invitation for them to be as we see them. See someone as deplorable, and even their peace overtures will look like cynical ploys. Distrust generates untrustworthiness. On the other hand, when we are able to see beyond conventional roles and categories, we become able to invite others into previously unmanifest potentials. That question is anathema to the militant and the warmonger, because it rehumanizes those that they would dehumanize. I imagine myself in the ETP executive suite. The stress level is high. The board of directors are freaking out. The banks are threatening to pull their funding. Maybe we have bond payments due. I am not endorsing this viewpoint. I am merely trying to understand it. Similarly, it might take courage for a policeman to defy orders or disbelieve propaganda or break ranks. In a way, we are all in the same boat; we are all facing situations that invite us to choose love over fear, to listen to the heart when it feels unsafe to do so. We need to help each other obey that call. In that, we are allies. We can be allies in calling each other to our highest potential. Another friend described his encounters with pepper-spraying police at Standing Rock. He noticed that in each instance, it was only one or two police who were doing most of the violence. The others were standing around looking uncomfortable, probably wishing they were somewhere else. I am sorry you are under such pressure to contravene your heart. But it is not too late. As I write this, the first of two thousand U.S. military veterans are entering the camps at Standing Rock. They have vowed to stand with and protect the Water Protectors with their own bodies. They are not bringing weapons. Many of them are leaving jobs and families in order to help protect the water. If they too can keep peaceful hearts, they will magnify the invitation to the government, the company, and particularly the police to make the courageous choice themselves. Victory at Standing Rock will have far-reaching consequences. It may seem inconsequential in the macro view if the pipeline is merely rerouted or replaced with rail tankers (which are even worse than pipelines). If a pipeline can be stopped against great odds in one place, similar violations can be stopped in every place. It will shift our view of what is possible. Climate change is the result of a million insults to a million places on earth. Honoring the place of Standing Rock establishes a principle of honor to all places. Writ large, the situation at Standing Rock is the situation of our whole planet: everywhere, dominating forces seek to exploit what remains of the treasures of earth and sea. They cannot be defeated by force. If the Water Protectors at Standing Rock can stay strong in that invitation, they will demonstrate an unstoppable power and win a miraculous victory, inspiring the rest of us to follow their example. Not every nonviolent action succeeds in its explicit aims; not every invitation, no matter how powerful, is accepted. With each choice we face, we are being asked what kind of world we want to live in. The more courage required to make that choice, the more powerful the prayer, because Whoever listens to prayers knows we really mean it. Therefore, when we choose love in the face of enormous temptation to hate, we are issuing a powerful prayer for a world of love. When we refuse to dehumanize in the face of atrocity, we issue a prayer for universal dignity. When thousands of people sacrifice their safety and comfort to protect the water, a powerful prayer issues from their gathering. Some day, in some form, it will be answered.

The project is still being contested in federal court by Native American tribes who fear a leak could endanger their water supply, and protests from August to February resulted in a large-scale police response and more than 700 arrests. Maj. Gen. Alan Dohrmann, who heads the North Dakota National Guard, has said costs shouldn't go past that figure. Burgum said in a statement he was grateful for the contribution. North Dakota officials, including the state's congressional delegation, have long pushed for federal reimbursement to cover all costs related to the protests. Burgum asked President Donald Trump for a disaster declaration earlier this year to cover the costs of the protest, but the request was denied. State officials have argued the federal government should pick up the entire tab because the protesters based themselves on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land without a permit, and federal officials wouldn't evict them due to free speech reasons. ETP had a longstanding offer to help reimburse the state for law enforcement costs. Former Gov. Jack Dalrymple declined the offer, saying it was unclear whether the state could legally accept it. Burgum had long said he was open to the offer. Click any reaction to login. Vacation photographs often capture perfect moments in favorite places.

His brutal arrest is not the only time Morton County Sheriffs enacted such violence on Water Protectors.

And, in a classic blame the victim stance that appears to come out of an Alex Jones playbook, Trump seemed to accuse his opponents of initiating anti-Semitic incidents in order to defame and disparage him. It's not a straight simple question. 'Anti-Semitism has wound its way into mainstream conversations in a manner that many Jews who lived through Nazi Germany find terrifying,' he said at a meeting at the Knesset, which was convened to discuss the plight of American Jewry under the incoming Trump administration. No. But you have some of the signs and some of that anger caused by the other side. They'll do signs and drawing that are inappropriate. It won't be my people. Trump's theorizing about his opponents coincides with a meme that David Duke, former Ku Klux Klan imperial wizard has been circulating. Trump's shabby treatment of Turx also followed on the heels of a woefully inept White House statement about Holocaust Remembrance Day, which left out any mention of Jews or anti-Semitism. Perhaps most frightening and difficult to explain is Team Trump's desire to eliminate neo-Nazis and white supremacists from the US government's counter-extremism program by moving it to focus exclusively on Islamist terrorism.

Subject to the acceptance of the plea agreement by Judge Daniel Hovland, who is presiding over the case, prosecutors and the defense will jointly recommend a sentence of 36 months on the Civil Disorder charge, although the judge does have the authority to go as high as five years. Little Feather and his legal team were facing monumental challenges including the prospect of trial with a hostile jury pool, limited discovery, and the risk of a long prison sentence. In December of 2016, WPLC brought in an expert to poll the potential jurors to determine the extent of local bias against Water Protectors. Little Feather is a member of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, and was raised in Santa Barbara, California.

The whole family loves and adores him. He keeps us strong and we want him home with us. The change of plea hearing will be at 1:30PM on Thursday February 8, 2018 in Bismarck federal court before Chief Judge Daniel Hovland.

,{"URL":"http://fortune.com/2017/02/07/us-solar-jobs-2016/","Timestamp":"20180919053235","Sentences":"That jump was largely driven by a massive increase in solar panel installations, according to a report released Tuesday by the non-profit solar advocacy group The Solar Foundation. The rise in installations was caused by a rapid decrease in the cost of solar panels and unprecedented consumer demand, according to Andrea Luecke, president and executive director of The Solar Foundation. The National Solar Jobs Census 2016, the seventh annual report on solar employment issued by the foundation, says installed solar capacity is projected to grow a record 14 gigawatts in 2016, almost double the 7.5 GW growth experienced in 2015. With such a gain, solar will likely exceed all other sources of new electric generating capacity for the year, according to the report. The solar jobs census follows a U.S. Department of Energy study released last month that found more Americans work in solar than at natural gas or coal power plants. The DOE report says 187,117 workers are employed at coal, oil, and natural gas power plants compared to nearly 374,000 people in the solar industry. The latest solar job numbers are significant. Still, the National Solar Jobs Census 2016 documents the dramatic growth of an industry in less than a decade. However, the growth in residential and commercial capacity deployment may offset utility-scale job losses, according to the report. A few more highlights: One out of every 50 new U.S. jobs was in the solar industry. Solar industry employment growth outpaced that of the overall U.S. economy by 17 times as it increased by over 51,000 jobs, for a total of 260,077 U.S. solar workers. The number of solar jobs increased in 44 of the 50 states in 2016. California employs the most solar workers, followed by Massachusetts, Texas, Nevada, and Florida. Workers who install rooftop solar panels make up the largest share employment in the sector at 137,133 jobs. SolarCity, which merged with Tesla (tsla) in 2016, Vivint Solar, and Sunrun (run) are the biggest residential installers. Manufacturing is a distant second with 38,121 jobs, followed by 34,400 in project development, and 32,147 in sales and distribution.

Transcript DOERING: From PRI, and the Jennifer and Ted Stanley Studios at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, this is Living on Earth. But it also lies along the route that would bring oil drilled in North Dakota to export terminals on the Gulf of Mexico. DOERING: Since the Trump Administration gave the green light to the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners has been working hard to get the Bayou Bridge pipeline across the Atchafalaya built. But a federal judge in Louisiana recently ordered a temporary stop to the pipeline construction, following a court challenge by several environmental groups. KAISER: Here to tell us more is Anne Rolfes, the founding director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. Thanks for having me. ROLFES: Well, the judge agreed that there is a risk to the Atchafalaya Basin that is serious enough to warrant Energy Transfer Partners halting construction of this pipeline. She agreed with the plaintiffs that this pipeline could do irreparable harm. KAISER: So, I mean I do understand that the Army Corps of Engineers gave the Bayou Bridge pipeline its seal of approval some months ago. Now, the judge has ordered this temporary stop because of environmental concerns. An eighteenth-century map of the Atchafalaya Basin. (Photo: Stuart Rankin, Flickr CC BY-NC 2.0) ROLFES: What should have happened from the beginning is that the Army Corps of Engineers should have conducted an Environmental Impact Statement, to really assess what the impacts are along the route. You have drinking water threatened in one area, you have black bear habitat threatened in the basin. You have a community, a historic African-American community, threatened in the community of St. James Louisiana. And the Army Corps of Engineers by refusing to conduct an Environmental Impact Statement didn't acknowledge that. KAISER: So, I understand that as well as some environmental groups, local fishermen are concerned about the construction of the pipeline. Tell me more about that. ROLFES: It's a really wonderful assortment of opposition. You have people in the western part of the state, in Calcasieu Parish, who are concerned about the impacts on their land. I mean, these are ordinary people who happen to own land along the pipeline route, and Energy Partners has seized that land and the people have no power to stop them. You continue down the route and you have indigenous communities that are concerned about the impacts to drinking water, and then if you continue you hit the Atchafalaya Basin where the crawfishermen make their living from the basin. There are wild crawfish there still, and the problem with a pipeline like the Bayou Bridge pipeline is that it acts as a dam and restricts water flow. The water dies, essentially, and then all of the living creatures within that water also die, and so in our case the pipeline restricts water flow, and the crawfish die. And if you're not from Louisiana you might not understand how significant crawfish are to us, but culturally they are a lynchpin for us and at this time of year, the spring is the time of year where we eat crawfish. KAISER: I am one of those people who has never been to the Atchafalaya Basin. I imagine a lot of our listeners have never been there. ROLFES: Yeah, one of the crawfishermen has described the basin as his Yellowstone, and if you think about the magnitude of the national parks that people might be more familiar with, Yellowstone or Glacier or the Smokies to the east, it's that magnitude of natural significance. And so what you see is, you see placid water, flat water, brown, maybe dark green water and you see these beautiful cypress trees and moss hanging down from them, you'll see alligators swimming around. Once night falls you'll start to see frog eyes if you shine a light. So, it's teeming with life. KAISER: So, the pipeline would run through 162 miles of the state, part of it would be sitting right in the water. ROLFES: What we see the impacts of oil spills to be, and we know because we see them all the time, is that they kill the wildlife and they kill the natural world. So, for example, we're having these water protector trainings, and I was speaking with a crawfisherman at one of those trainings and he said he can already see from past oil skills that our red fish population has gone down in areas and that our crabs have also died off. And so this has been a long assault on the state of Louisiana by the oil industry. KAISER: So, the pipeline is being sold as providing jobs and energy independence to the state. So, the fact that our governor and our elected officials are peddling this pipeline is laughable because they're not even hiring people from our state. And then energy independence, I mean, that's hot air also because certainly some of this oil will be for export. Anne Rolfes is the Founding Director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. ROLFES: Yeah, let me just say this because I don't want people to get...before I answer that, I don't want people to get depressed about this fight because it is a great moment in Louisiana. Just yesterday we were out on the pipeline route, we stood in front of backhoes, we stopped their construction. We prevented that backhoe from grabbing a pipe that they were trying to grab and from laying in the ground. So, there is a lively resistance here where you have people who are willing to take action, 50 of us as happened yesterday stood in the way of a backhoe. That hasn't happened here before, and the oil industry ought to be scared, they ought to realize that it's a different day, and that they will have trouble on their hands. And the next steps are, of course, that Bayou Bridge has furiously filed motions to vacate the judge's ruling, and so it's just a matter of waiting, and you know waiting for decisions. KAISER: Anne Rolfes is a Founding Director of the environmental group, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. Ann, thank you so much for coming on the program today. ROLFES: Oh, my pleasure, I'm glad to be here. We intend to seek immediate relief from this decision in the appropriate courts. Beyond that, we will decline to comment on the legal process, but instead defer to our filings.

(Reuters) - More than 2,000 U.S. military veterans plan to form a human shield to protect protesters of a pipeline project near a Native American reservation in North Dakota, organizers said, just ahead of a federal deadline for activists to leave the camp they have been occupying. Protesters include various Native American tribes as well as environmentalists and even actors including Shailene Woodley. State officials issued an order on Monday for activists to vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp, located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, citing harsh weather conditions. The state's latest decision not to stop cars entering the protest site indicated local officials will not actively enforce Monday's emergency order to evacuate the camp issued by Governor Jack Dalrymple. The 1,172-mile (1,885 km) pipeline project, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP , is mostly complete, except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. Veterans Stand for Standing Rock, a contingent of more than 2,000 U.S. military veterans, intends to go to North Dakota by this weekend and form a human wall in front of police, protest organizers said on a Facebook page. Organizers could not immediately be reached for comment. Dull Knife, a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe from the Pine Ridge Reservation of South Dakota, said he has been camping at the protest site for months. Morton County Sheriff's Office spokesman Rob Keller said in an email his agency was aware of the veterans' plans, but would not comment further on how law enforcement will deal with demonstrators. Former U.S. Marine Michael A. Wood Jr is leading the effort along with Wesley Clark Jr, a writer whose father is retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark. U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat from Hawaii and a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, has said on Twitter she will join the protesters on Sunday. The Army Corps, citing safety concerns, has ordered the evacuation of the primary protest camp by Dec. 5, but said it would not forcibly remove people from the land. Local law enforcement said on Tuesday they planned a blockade of the camp, but local and state officials later retreated, saying they would only check vehicles for certain prohibited supplies like propane, and possibly issue fines. Dalrymple on Wednesday said state officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters and there had been no plans to block food or other supplies from the camp. He also warned protesters that while emergency responders will try to reach anyone in need, that would be contingent on weather conditions. That decision has been delayed twice by the Army Corps.

Dozens of insulated tipis have popped up in recent weeks, adding to those that have dotted these barren plains since last summer. Yurts, a round tent popular in the cold tundra of East Asia, have started appearing. Portable toilets are being swapped out for heated, composting commodes. Ice cleats, which strap onto boots to give stability on ice, are now in demand. Taylor Orpin, 23, quit her job to move to the camp last month. Thousands of people, led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, are protesting the pipeline, which would carry crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico. A division of labor keeps many active, with campers volunteering in the four kitchens, shoveling snow, building tents and doing myriad other tasks. The multitudes at the camp defy the predictions of state and local officials, many of whom said out-of-state protesters would flee south like migrating birds. Children can be seen sliding playfully down nearby hills while senior citizens gossip over fire pits. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple issued an evacuation order for the camp earlier this week, citing the weather. The protests started attracting more attention in the late summer, particularly after clashes between activists and private security hired by Energy Transfer Partners (ETP.N), which is building the line. The Obama Administration has twice delayed approval for ETP to tunnel the pipeline under the Missouri River. This one-mile stretch is the last unfinished spot on the line in North Dakota. The Three Affiliated Tribes of the MHA Nation, another large American Indian tribe in North Dakota, earlier this fall funded portable toilets, food and garbage removal. Even though they have earned billions from the extraction of oil and gas from their lands, the MHA have supported the Standing Rock protest. U.S. postal locations in nearby Bismarck and Fort Yates have been engulfed with donated packages. Three UPS (UPS.N) delivery locations in Bismarck have processed more than 5,000 packages in recent weeks. A UPS spokesman said the number well exceeds what is usual for the area. Beyond donations, Hollywood actors like Shailene Woodley and Susan Sarandon have visited North Dakota, though they are not currently at the camp. Some campers bring technical skills. Joshua Tree, 42, has helped install solar panels and wind turbines to power a white, dome-like structure that dwarfs everything else here. The dome, which organizers say can hold 380 people, is where most meetings and press events are held. As the group tries to ward off the cold, challenges loom. One family had to be hospitalized on Thursday due to carbon monoxide poisoning after attempting to heat a tent using propane without proper ventilation. Signs posted around the camp note there are 18 different communal sleeping areas that are warmer than personal tents.

Now, Wood Jr. and Clark Jr. are organizing mass non-violent protection against police violence on protesters in North Dakota. Anti-media reports: According to an article published by Business Insider that first appeared in Task and Purpose, a military-oriented news and culture site, two veterans are leading the charge in a show of dissent against the increasingly aggressive police. Clark would later attempt to distance himself from those statements but still managed to convince his son, a member of the Army at the time, to stay away from Iraq. Now, Wood Jr. and Clark Jr. are attempting to organize a mass, nonviolent protest against police action in North Dakota. Just this past weekend, a female protester was hit with a concussion grenade, causing severe damage to her arm and requiring surgery. Other have been tear gassed, tased, beaten, and shot with rubber bullets. Anti-Media journalist Derrick Broze was tased by law enforcement immediately after he declared he was a member of the media. Another journalist was shot with a rubber bullet while standing away from a gathering of protesters as she interviewed an attendee. Police have made over 470 arrests since August, and the Indigenous Environmental Network claims 167 people were injured just this past Sunday when police deployed water cannons in freezing weather. Clark Jr. was clear he was not looking for violence and that the protest would be unarmed. We can stop this savage injustice being committed right here at home.

In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community. We are launching this second GoFundMe to create a Standing Rock Fund to address the ongoing needs at Standing Rock and our partners in camp.

We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement.

Now, let me quote myself one more time. Of course, as with all great imperial powers, this, too, must end. In a sense, you could even say that the U.S. has been on the decline since it emerged from World War II wealthy beyond compare and untouched in a world largely in rubble. Now, it looks like a man has been elevated to the White House who truly is a suicide bomber. So to be accurate, his guiding policy formula should really be relabeled America Third. He appears to be doing everything in his power to facilitate their advance at the expense of the United States. By largely ignoring them, in just weeks in the Oval Office, President Trump has already enabled China to gain ground on many fronts. This was evident in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. While no senior representative of the soon-to-be installed Trump administration even put in an appearance, China was represented by no less than President Xi Jinping himself, a first appearance for a Chinese head of state. For many of the 1,250 CEOs, celebrities, and government officials in the audience, his appearance and remarks represented an almost mind-boggling shift in the global balance of political influence, as Washington ceded the pivotal position it had long occupied on the world stage. Now, China has an unparalleled opportunity to reorganize and potentially reorient trade in the Asian region in its direction. Among other things, China is expected to encourage Asian countries to join it in an alternative trade arrangement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Including the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as well as China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and India (but not the United States), the RCEP aims to lower barriers to trade -- without the environmental and labor-rights provisions incorporated into the TPP. Above all, his rebuff of Turnbull is thought to be beneficial to China. Recall that in pursuing progress on clean energy, President Obama was driven not only by a concern for the future depredations of climate change, but also by a desire to ensure American preeminence in what he perceived as a global race to master the green technologies of the future, a race in which China was feared to be a likely winner. To assure American primacy in the clean-energy race, Obama channeled vast sums of money into the development and deployment of renewable technologies, including advanced solar power plants and electrical storage devices. He also assumed a leadership role in the diplomatic drive to gain approval of the Paris accord, meeting personally with Xi Jinping and with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, among others. From an international perspective, this lent the United States the aura of an enlightened, forward-looking world power. Donald Trump aims to turn his back on all of this. Whether or not Trump and his prospective EPA director, former Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, succeed in unraveling everything that Obama achieved, the new administration has already ceded leadership in the global climate fight to the Chinese, who have been all too happy to seize the limelight. While gaining international recognition as the new leader in this area, China is also moving swiftly to assume primacy in the development and deployment of new green technologies, assuring future domination of a global market expected to grow by leaps and bounds in the decades to come. This is expected to create perhaps 13 million new jobs. Although detailed spending plans were not disclosed, much of this largesse will undoubtedly be devoted to new wind and solar installations -- fields in which China already enjoys a substantial advantage over the rest of the world. From an economic perspective, the implications of this drive are hard to miss. Many energy experts believe that the demand for oil and other fossil fuels will begin to decline in the years ahead as consumers increasingly favor clean energy over carbon-emitting fuels. If so, the demand for renewables will skyrocket. In other words, the anti-green posture of the Trump administration offers the gift of the century to China: an extraordinary shift in global wealth. This led to the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea and the barely-disguised Russian intervention in eastern Ukraine. Last July, at a NATO summit in Warsaw, he and the leaders of Britain, Canada, and Germany agreed to deploy reinforced battalions to Poland and the three Baltic states as a deterrent to any future Russian attack on those countries. Had she been elected president, Hillary Clinton was expected to step up the pressure further on Moscow. Since assuming the presidency, President Trump has behaved as if Russia were indeed a key ally-in-waiting and the NATO powers were former lovers who had lost their appeal. Yes, he met with British Prime Minister Theresa May before any other foreign leader, but he remained silent when she spoke of the need to maintain pressure on Moscow through sanctions, making her look at that moment like an unwelcome houseguest. Later, he spoke at length with Putin by telephone. From published accounts of their conversation, they avoided awkward topics like Crimea and the Russian hacking scandal of the election past, discussing instead increased collaboration in counterterrorism operations. While the Trump team had little to report on the specifics of what was said, Russian officials were effusive about the conversation. According to the Russian media, Trump and Putin agreed in their January 28th phone call to arrange high-level meetings among their senior security staff to facilitate collaboration in the anti-ISIS war. Whether or not Trump agreed to any such plan, it appears that events are beginning to proceed as if he had, with Russia evidently playing a more aggressive role in eastern Ukraine in recent weeks. The broader dimensions of international relations do not seem to register on his mental radar screen, such as it is. Most important of all, the abandonment of U.S. leadership in the struggle to slow global warming will mean both the surrender of technological preeminence in the fields most likely to dominate the world economy in the decades to come and a far greater chance of planetary catastrophe.

Yes, a miracle happened at Standing Rock. No, it's not the one you thought it was. The Water Protectors have struggled for months, the veterans showed up en masse, and in hours the tide shifted, with the Army Corps of Engineers denying access to the Dakota Pipeline. For the moment. Amidst blizzard conditions, people are leaving the area, although most are rightfully keeping a very wary eye on further developments, well aware of the cunning deception of the Dakota Access Pipeline company. That portion of the story continues to unfold, and should command our attention. But if you weren't watching between the lines carefully, you might have missed the most important American miracle in the last couple of centuries. A miracle that begins the healing of the soul of our country. Wesley Clark Jr. spearheaded the voluntary deployment of thousands of veterans to Standing Rock in support of the Water Protectors, via Facebook post. The project grew from several dozen participants to a couple of thousand in just a few days. And, Clark admits, eventually became a logistical challenge that took a few extra steps to keep up with. That's not surprising, many lofty visions manage to make it over the rocky path to a beneficial goal, finally, as this one did.

(Image by YouTube, Channel: Robert Boudrias) Permission Details DMCA An incredible moment of healing at Standing Rock: Hundreds of veterans ask Native elders for forgiveness. We took your land. We signed treaties that we broke. We stole minerals from your sacred hills. We blasted the faces of our presidents onto your sacred mountain... We didn't respect you, we polluted your Earth, we've hurt you in so many ways but we've come to say that we are sorry. A portion of the letter that Clark posted on his Facebook page after the events follows: Our action was successful thanks to the sacrifice and hard work of those who were on the ground before us and endured the risk, pain and suffering when the eyes of the world were not on Standing Rock - the water protectors, the youth, and the elders who have instructed us from the day we arrived that faith, prayer and peace are the way forward.

For the past few months, I have watched from afar as para-militarized police forces from nine states have targeted peaceful protesters at Standing Rock with tear gas, freezing water, rubber bullets, concussion grenades, and other life-threatening crowd control weapons. They and their supporters have every right to protest this, and the way they were treated really bothered me. So when I heard that military veterans were planning to go to Standing Rock to join the protesters at their camp this weekend, I went to my local thrift shop to stock up on winter gear, packed up my pick-up truck, and drove west. A customer had come in just a couple of hours earlier to do the same. And she herself was planning to go to Standing Rock for the weekend. There were men, women, farmers, students, IT professionals, and preachers, some young, some old. There was even a 97-year-old woman who served as a nurse in World War II. The Sioux served us buffalo stew, and the tribal elders briefed us on the weather and what to expect when we got there. They explained where we could find shelter from the cold and that there would be a medic tent and first aid station (also staffed by vets) should anyone be injured by rubber bullets, concussion grenades, or tear gas. And they reiterated the importance of keeping the protest peaceful and suggested that if we were to get agitated, we could partake of a tribal remedy and chew on a piece of bitter root, which the Sioux believe can relieve high blood pressure and other ailments. The elders said that there were some 11,000 protesters at the camp and urged us to leave our cars at Eagle Butte and take one of the many buses to the Standing Rock encampment. As we slept on cots, buses came and went all night. I got up at 5 a.m. and headed out to Standing Rock around 7:30. I arrived just before midday. The Sioux thanked us for coming, assigned us to tents, and directed us to set up not at the main entrance to the camp but at an unguarded area from which the camp was still accessible. There were rumors that agitators had been sent into the camp to disrupt the peaceful protest, and the tribe thought we vets would be a good deterrent. We built a fire, kept lookout along the camp perimeter, and helped the Sioux build additional shelters for protesters. And then something amazing started happening. The police started backing down. In the face of such an impressive veteran presence, law enforcement vehicles began leaving. Then, a little after 4 p.m., an announcement came over the speakers. The Department of the Army halted the project. Celebratory whooping erupted from within the camp. Tribal members paraded through the camp on horseback, beating drums and gathering around a fire at the center of the camp. It was spiritual. A Native American vet explained that the tribe was thanking the great spirit. There were rumors that the Dakota Pipeline might attempt to drill on Monday anyway and just pay any fines that might be levied against them. Some of us wondered if maybe the Department of the Army and the Dakota Pipeline struck a deal with the incoming Trump administration. Maybe they wanted to trick us into leaving so that they could go ahead building the pipeline. I decided to head home, but many of the younger vets stayed behind.

,{"URL":"http://www.truth-out.org/buzzflash/commentary/the-most-dangerous-bill-you-ve-never-heard-of-just-passed-the-house","Timestamp":"20180919052905","Sentences":"The bill, called the REINS Act, requires that any future major regulation adopted by an Executive Agency -- say a new toxic chemical standard required by the recently enacted Chemical Safety Act, or a new consumer protection rule about some innovative but untested kind of food additive -- must be approved by a specific resolution in each House of Congress within 70 days to take effect. To give a sense of the scale of this road-block, in 2015 there were 43 such major federal regulations passed to protect the public; among them were food safety regulations, the Clean Power Plan regulating pollution from electrical generating facilities, net neutrality rules protecting the internet from monopoly, restrictions on predatory lending and energy efficiency standards for appliances. If the REINS Act had been in effect, it unlikely that the Tea Party dominated Republican caucus in the House would have approved of any of these rules. Future standard setting under the entire body of legislation enacted over the past 40 years to protect the public, from the Clean Air Act to the Dodd Frank financial sector reforms, would be frozen. Over time, as new health, safety, consumer and labor protection issues arise, all of these laws will effectively have been repealed, with no public debate and no accountability. It will also be impossible to restore them as long as the REINS Act is in effect, because by requiring Congress to approve every regulation, it makes it impossible to pass technically complex and scientifically valid rules on any topic of controversy. As one example, the REINS Act would totally neuter the new Chemical Safety Act, just passed by the Republican Congress last year. The act requires U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review and set standards for 10 widely abused chemicals in the next six months alone. The act passed only because in exchange, states gave up much of their power to protect their citizens from toxic chemicals; without that incentive, the Tea Party will certainly act to prevent EPA from restricting the use of these chemicals. But the states only agreed to give up in exchange for the promise that EPA would act. But the REINS act neuters this promise. Even if the House Republican caucus was willing in theory to consider such rules, there is simply no way Congress could add 10-40 new pieces of legislation to its work load in the chemical safety area alone. In fact, the House also just passed legislation to allow it to REPEAL all of President Obama's regulatory acts in the last eight months of his term in office with one vote. Because House members said there was not time for individual votes on each rule -- exactly the requirement they just established for new rules. Worse, Congress totally lacks the technical competence to review these kinds of complex rules. The vote was 237-187. All Republicans voted for it; only two Democrats, Colin Peterson of Minnesota and Henry Cuellar of Texas, joined them. A Google search five days after the bill passed the House revealed no mention in major media except one Reuters story with limited pick-up and a Washington Post op-ed by one of its major supporters. Even on-line virtually all of the commentary was from the backers of the REINS Act; the only significant alerts of the danger came from the Blue Green Alliance and DeSmogBlog. Progressives may be counting on the fact that the Senate has previously refused to pass the bill and that it's broad over-reaching will doom it. But these are not ordinary times and past behavior is far from reliable in predicting today's politics. It's time -- past time -- for a massive mobilization to make clear to Congress and the new President that a wholesale repeal of 40 years of progress in environmental protection, civil rights, labor standards, health and safety and consumer protection is a third rail, and that pretending that the REINS act increases accountability is a fig-leaf that public scrutiny must shred. Ask your favorite public interest organization what it is doing today to stop the REINS Act in the Senate. Nobody Really Knows.

We are veterans of the United States Armed Forces, including the U.S. Army, United States Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Coast Guard and we are calling for our fellow veterans to assemble as a peaceful, unarmed militia at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation on Dec 4-7 and defend the water protectors from assault and intimidation at the hands of the militarized police force and DAPL security. 2K EVENT CAPACITY ACHIEVED: Event capacity based on accommodations, travel logistics and supplies; given the time we have to coordinate, resources available and the shipping and weather conditions in the region has been set at 2,000 rostered participants. We currently have over 2,100 Veterans on the roster. Our goal now is to prioritize this list to Veterans and Civilian personnel involved with operations, planning & onsite execution. next mission could be as early as the 2nd week of December. More to come The funds we raise on this page will go towards providing transportation and supplies for the brave patriots that come and stand with us. We have full support of the Sioux tribe elders and will be cooperating with them every step of the way. Several had to be treated for hypothermia and one protestor who was hit directly with a grenade has reportedly had her arm amputated as a result. Everyday becomes more evident that the defenders of America must stand with the Water Protectors. Let's stop this savage injustice being committed right here at home. Not if you allow this the be the United States. Please donate and pass this page along to your friends, family, coworkers and community members. It's time to display that honor, courage, and commitment we claim to represent. It's time for real Patriots. In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community. We are launching this second GoFundMe to create a Standing Rock Fund to address the ongoing needs at Standing Rock and our partners in camp. Please take moment to check out our new campaign and share with your networks. We are formulating organizational structure under a 501c4. This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement.

Opposition to wealthy oil companies and their potential profits if and after the pipeline is completed would have been sufficient to attract the thousands who came to support Sioux protestors at Standing Rock. Meanwhile, environmentalists, who care and worry about what such a pipeline under the plains and river might do, have raised appropriate questions. The environmental concerns alone would have been ominous enough to agitate the Native Americans on the scene. But the Cannonball River, which flows nearby, and the complex of tributaries connected to the Missouri River, are not merely sources of water. Water is necessary for the sweat lodge, so important in Sioux worship, and it serves as a purifier and calmer in sacred ceremonies. And much more. What motivates her and her fellow worshippers, above all, is concern that the pipeline will profane the burial sites over and around and through which it will flow. All of the governmental action is thus, in the eyes of the Native Americans, a profanation. Weekly, if not daily, we hear and read of the ins and outs, the ups and downs, of this most recent conflict. We observe how readily disdained the protesters are. Many of them know that there are other sides (and undersides) to conflicts like this one. They know how complex are the valid economic issues on the opposing sides of such ventures. Even some close-to-the-scene Native Americans are concerned about the potential economic loss, should the Native Americans win. Sympathetic religious leaders are urging that the spiritual concerns and the human rights of the protesters be respected in the face of often brutal economic and political forces and realities.

It has been a week since Kinder Morgan announced it was halting all non-essential spending on the plan to build a second, bigger pipeline parallel to the existing one between Edmonton and Burnaby, B.C. The company gave the Trudeau government until the end of May to reassure its investors the pipeline would be built, despite mounting opposition. After the meeting, Notley and Trudeau exuded confidence the deadline would be met and the pipeline would proceed. Horgan, however, betrayed no evidence that their confidence had anything to do with him. If anything, the positions of the two NDP premiers appeared all the more entrenched when the meeting was over. Notley said legislation to allow Alberta to cut oil supplies to B.C., sure to send gas prices there soaring, would be introduced in the legislature this week. Horgan said a court challenge testing whether B.C. has the jurisdiction to regulate what can and can't flow through the expansion will proceed before the end of the month. The chasm between them did not go unacknowledged by the prime minister. As such, Trudeau said he has instructed Finance Minister Bill Morneau to sit down with Kinder Morgan to find a financial solution that will soothe their investors. He also promised legislation that would reaffirm Ottawa's authority to press ahead with a development deemed to be in Canada's national interest. He said the negotiations with Kinder Morgan wouldn't play out in public, and he would not elaborate on exactly what the legislation will say. Kinder Morgan, for its part, would not say Sunday whether it felt mollified by the day's events. Trudeau said the pipeline was approved by his government in 2016 after a rejigged environmental assessment and Indigenous consultation process, and only in concert with the Liberals' climate change and oceans protection plan. Approval came in consultation with the previous B.C. Liberal government, which gave its consent to the project after its own conditions were met. Horgan's election last year changed that. His minority government exists at the pleasure of the Green party, and on condition of his continued opposition to the project. Trudeau made it clear Sunday that Horgan and his government are the ones wholly responsible for the impasse. The federal government can and will do more on the pipeline's potential environmental impact, he added. Horgan blamed the lack of specifics on the dispute itself. A lack of scientific clarity on how diluted bitumen behaves in water, and a lack of political clarity over who is responsible to pay in the event of such a spill, are two of his chief concerns, Horgan added. Dilbit spilled into Michigan's Kalamazoo River from an Enbridge pipeline in 2010 cost billions to clean up, with parts of the river closed for years afterwards. Before Sunday's duelling news conferences were even complete, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was front and centre, accusing Trudeau of sitting on his hands for too long and frittering away investor confidence in Canada as a whole. Alberta's Opposition leader, Jason Kenney, also said Sunday's meeting didn't bring the pipeline any closer to construction.

They will do this to create the illusion that the Army Corps of Engineers made the wrong decision. We do not need to engage them in this; we need to go home. Energy Transfer Partners, whose assets were recently purchased by Sunoco, has said it remains committed to the project and will not change the route. With a new blizzard dumping a foot or more of snow onto the camps full of thousands of water protectors, many of them in tipis, and below-average temperatures predicted for part of the week, the conditions were becoming dangerous. Strong winds and very cold temperatures will also yield sub-zero wind chill readings and blowing snow. The bulk of the water protectors are living in fortified tipis and other makeshift shelters outdoors at the camps. Archambault said the priority was keeping people safe, and letting them know that the job at hand was done. The current weather is severe, making travel impossible. If the camp stays, we run a risk of further provocation from local law enforcement. Once one person is hurt or property is destroyed, that will lead to more outsized actions by law enforcement. Putting people at risk in that way is something the ancestral leaders would never have done, he said. I believe in my prayers and in the Creator. Archambault suggested that each resident make a plan for closing and exiting the camp, leaving the land as it was when they got there, and to get home before the bitterest part of winter sets in. The winter, he added, has barely begun, and the current storm is tamer than what the worst of the season will bring. Temperatures drop even lower than they already have, and the shelters at the camps would be no match for blizzard conditions. Acknowledging that people were socked in by the storm, Archambault said it was time to take the water protection battles beyond Indian country, to the rest of the U.S. and the world. This factor makes it hard for some to stand down from continuing with a physical presence and performing direct action at Standing Rock despite the dangerous, and potentially deadly weather conditions they may face. Adding to the concern of water protectors is the possibility of all their hard work being overturned by the new Trump administration slated to take over come January.

The company has said it will consult with stakeholders before May 31 in order to reach agreements that may allow the project to move ahead. Kinder Morgan says it is consulting stakeholders before deciding if it will continue working on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. (Trans Mountain) His organization represents a range of industries, many of which are unrelated to energy. Some Indigenous communities are fighting the pipeline expansion over concerns about the environment, drinking water and land rights. Just this month, two Indigenous leaders went to Kinder Morgan's annual general meeting to present opposition to the project, the City of Burnaby, B.C., filed a pipeline appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the Coldwater Indian Band told the National Energy Board the pipeline posed an unacceptable risk to its sole source of drinking water. People opposed to the pipeline have been rallying and protesting. The trip, which he said is neither funded nor requested by energy companies, is not meant as advocacy.

For months, opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline have been expressing fears that it would affect local drinking water, because it was to be built under the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation - the primary water source of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Last week, the US Department of the Army announced that it would not approve the crossing of the pipeline under the Missouri River. And while local drinking water will not be affected, at least two cows have been confirmed dead in the area, but a definitive connection between their deaths and the oil spill has not been made. Perhaps even more concerning than a freak accident splitting the pipe is the fact that electronic monitoring equipment failed to detect the leak - something that would have prevented the pipe from spilling so much oil out into the countryside. While there's no guarantee that a leak like this would happen at the Dakota Access Pipeline, this kind of thing is not exactly rare in the area. Belle Fourche Pipeline Co. has reported 10 oil spills since 2011. So while none of that means the Dakota Access Pipeline is necessarily a risk, the Billings County leak is making the protesters' point for them: it's clear we need to do a better job at ensuring the structural integrity of those pipes. 5 days ago Politics & Society Semi-Automatic Rifles Really Are More Deadly, New Study Clearly Shows Numbers don't lie. 6 days ago Politics & Society To Save Ourselves It's Time to Rethink Our Economic System, Warn Scientists The market is killing the planet. 3 hours ago HEALTH These Simple Tips For Storing Fruits And Vegetables Will Help You Keep Them Fresh Longer You might be doing it wrong. 4 hours ago NATURE Terrifying 'Rafts' of Stinging Fire Ants Are Now Floating Around After Hurricane Florence Locals are being warned to avoid them at all costs.

Spur line connects to Washington refineries. Source: Kinder Morgan Inc. Approval is not a slam dunk, said Gurpal Dosanjh, a refining analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence in New York. About the DAPL protest The Trump administration has advanced the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipeline projects. And here's what we're reading related to the controversy. March 28: What the completed Dakota Access pipeline means for key players. Feb. 22: Preparing to leave, Standing Rock protesters ceremonially burn camp. Feb. 1: Hundreds rally as the Seattle City Council considers divesting from Wells Fargo because of its role as a Dakota Access Pipeline lender. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says it will push back. Even it if is approved, Kinder Morgan could have a long slog ahead. The project is opposed by the mayors of Vancouver, Victoria and Burnaby, as well as many First Nations, and already faces multiple lawsuits. Major environmental groups, including Greenpeace Canada, Sierra Club BC and Raincoast Conservation, also oppose the project. The company notes that pipelines are safer and cheaper than shipping oil by rail. In Canada, the pipeline has the support of the federal government. That has Canada all the hungrier to move oil to other export markets on the Pacific Rim, Klassen said. Concerns about spills and stoking global warming by increased use of fossil fuels have native nations and environmental groups on both sides of the border fighting the project. They are drafting momentum from the recent defeat by Washington tribes of a major coal-export terminal at Cherry Point, and the fierce resistance led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota that has bedeviled the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Cam Fenton, Canada communications Manager for 350.org, an environmental group focused on climate change, says his organization is preparing for large-scale mass civil disobedience. In Longview, Millennium Bulk Terminals has proposed the largest coal-export facility anywhere in North America. In Vancouver, Tesoro-Savage has proposed an oil-by-rail transfer facility with the capacity to move an average of 360,000 barrels of oil every day. The Westway oil-by-rail expansion in Grays Harbor, home to key bird habitat on the Pacific flyway, and a treaty-protected tribal fisheries, is opposed by environmentalists and the Quinault Indian Nation. Oil to both the Tesoro-Savage and the Westway terminals would be transported in rail cars, which have been involved in accidents and spills, most recently in Mosier, Ore. Kinder Morgan wants to begin construction on Trans Mountain in 2017 and finish by 2019. We have committed shippers with long-term contracts for 15 to 20 years for space on that pipeline. Visitors to Cates Park look across Burrard Inlet to the Kinder Morgan tank farm. Cates Park was once a summer village site of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation. There have been 82 reported spills since 1961 at pump stations and terminals along the pipeline. The diluted bitumen and other products that would be shipped in the expansion is the same as Kinder Morgan ships from its pipeline today, and would be shipped in the same Aframax tankers that take delivery from the existing pipeline. Beyond the soft handshake and diplomatic demeanor of tribal elders in the homeland of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation, where the pipeline terminates in the east end of the Burrard Inlet in North Vancouver, B.C., lies a steely resistance. Amy George, in her 70s, helped lead a demonstration of thousands in Vancouver last week against the expansion. What unites this tribal nation with tribes and communities across the border in Washington is concern for the shared ecosystem. Tsleil-Waututh hereditary Chief Sla-holt (Ernest George Sr.), 76, thinks the Burrard Inlet in North Vancouver, B.C., has already seen too much industrial development. Under the Trans Mountain project, the dock would be expanded from one berth to three. The number of tanks holding the oil would more than double, and those would hold more than triple the amount of oil. Impacts from the expansion would be experienced far beyond the inlet. The project would bring an additional 350 tankers carrying oil a year to the Salish Sea, marine waters shared by British Columbia and Washington state. Spills could be damaging either from fuel-oil transfers to tankers, or from the diluted bitumen the tankers carry, the department warned in a September 2016, letter to the Canadian government. The Salish Sea is particularly vulnerable to a big uptick in tanker traffic because of its swift currents, sharp turns required for big ships and rich marine resources. The assessment by the Tsleil-Waututh Nation found their people would bear the brunt of the impacts at the end of the pipeline. Hereditary Chief Sla-holt (Ernest George Sr.), 76, reminds a visitor his people have been here some 13,000 years, or, as they say here, since time out of mind. He and his neighbors think this stretch of water has already seen too much industrial development. Ed Thomas, 64, says efforts to clean up the inlet have just recently enabled the band to hold its first clam harvest in 30 years. Elk are coming back to the woods.

(CBC) Manitoba opponents were quick to express their disappointment and frustration Tuesday evening after Justin Trudeau announced the approval of two oil pipelines in western Canada. About 20 protesters gathered at the corner of Portage Avenue and Main Street at around 9 p.m. to show their disapproval of the pipeline. Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs Grand Chief Derek Nepinak said that when discussions first started it was a process of manufacturing consent rather than getting true permission. While he was disappointed, Nepinak said he wasn't surprised. Indigenous leaders from across the country, including Nepinak, watched the announcement in Winnipeg after wrapping up the first day of a conference on climate change and the environment with guest speaker David Suzuki. Nepinak said governments and businesses must realize they cannot undertake projects in Indigenous territory without full consent. Trudeau cabinet approves Trans Mountain, Line 3 pipelines, rejects Northern Gateway More indigenous leaders sign pledge to fight oilsands and pipelines 20 of 63 Manitoba chiefs signed on to the growing Treaty Alliance against Tar Sands Expansion, a group pledging to fight oil sands and pipelines.

Van Ineveld is part of the group that occupied Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr's Winnipeg constituency office earlier this month.

Reeve Archie McPherson said he was happy to learn that the pipeline, which runs through his municipality, will almost double.

Carolyn Feldman, 27, identified by police as also being involved in the incident, was arrested and booked into the jail on suspicion of obstructing the legal process, a misdemeanor. About six rows of seats in Section 102 were evacuated below the protesters while dozens of police officers, crisis negotiators, firefighters and stadium security officers swarmed the base of the truss to strategize how to get the protesters down safely. During the second half, as fans used their smartphones to take pictures and video of the climbers, several rescue workers climbed the truss and assembled on a catwalk over the pair. A Vikings source said law enforcement decided not to engage with the climbers until after the game to avoid a televised confrontation. They were handcuffed without incident as lingering fans cheered and heckled them. Another team source said the protesters might have entered the stadium through separate gates and that one or both of them smuggled the bungee cord and canvas banner under their coats and avoided a pat down after getting through metal detectors. No one was injured during the protest, police said, including the protesters, who were examined by medical personnel on site before being booked into jail. It was not immediately clear how Mayo and Holiday smuggled the large banner and climbing equipment into U.S. Bank Stadium, which limits tote bags to 12-by-6-by-12 inches of clear plastic for fans entering the gates. SMG issued a statement during the protest saying the climbers appeared to scale a guard rail surrounding the truss. Roberson provided a cellphone for Mayo, who followed instructions by the Pioneer Press to wave his left hand before conducting the interview during second quarter. Mayo refused to answer questions about how he smuggled in the banner and climbing equipment, whether he had help from inside the stadium, his climbing expertise or how dangerous the protest was.

As a Native woman and third-generation sexual violence survivor, I had experienced this firsthand, but the numbers were a revelation to me. According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 80 percent of Indigenous women have experienced violence, and of those, more than 50 percent have experienced sexual violence. In 2016, I found my feet on the ground in seemingly nowhere North Dakota fighting the Dakota Access Pipeline alongside thousands of Native and non-Native people from across the world. As anyone who witnessed the occupation of Standing Rock can attest, the immensity of the camps and sheer Indian-ness of its occupants demanded an immediate place in history. Over and over, I tallied aunties, grandmas, mamas, daughters, and big sisters like me, gnawing on the undeniable fact that Native women are 2.5 to 3.5 times more likely to experience sexual assault compared to all other races. It was devastating to stare out at the generations of life-givers knowing what we all carry in our blood memory. This caused the ratio of men to women in said communities to change drastically. On average the ratio is around 10 to one, and in some places it can be as high as 20 to one. When her mother tried to file an affidavit with law enforcement, she claims she was denied, though verbal street harassment is illegal in Iowa. Courtesy of Eryn Wise I have seen the continued desensitization of our collective psyche to sexual assault and harassment. 70 percent of violent victimizations experienced by Indigenous peoples are not committed by persons of the same race, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Our youth are at critical risk for suicide due to the flagrant disregard for Indigenous sovereignty, and desperate need for cultural preservation, and land restoration. In my work with Seeding Sovereignty, a women-led organization honoring Indigenous sovereignty with a goal of building cross-cultural bridges, I aim to inspire young folks to lift their voices for those who are voiceless, and strive to ground them in traditional teachings based on the multigenerational environmental stewardship gifted to us by our ancestors. A catastrophic web has been woven between extractive industries and Native communities, and we are each called upon to observe issues of broader concern. It is evident, now more than ever, that extractive industries are having disproportionate adverse effects on indigenous peoples, particularly on the wellbeing of Native women. The continued desecration of unceded Indigenous territories and sacred resources resulting from extraction projects have contributed to disease, birth defects, reproductive health issues, and delayed early childhood development among community members. More attention needs to be given to Indigenous women living near points of extraction. This is the land we inherited from our ancestors. We are still here, intrepid and Indigenous; and we are moving forward.

They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons.

And there have been bipartisan efforts in both the Senate and House of Representatives to make it easier for American workers and businesses to seek remedy against trade cheating. The New York Times reports: Russia now smelts about 75 million tons of low-cost steel a year, of which 30 million tons are exported. On a recent day at Severstal, all the production lines hummed with activity. Managers say the factory operates at about 97 percent of capacity. In fact, steel imports increased by 38 percent in 2014, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. And aready this year, there has been a 11.45 percent increase in U.S. steel imports from the same period in 2014. Imports from Russia have simply exploded. Source: American Iron and Steel Institute, U.S. Census Bureau The domestic steel industry can compete with anybody and win, provided the playing field is level. U.S. steelmakers must fight for fairness at the International Trade Commission by filing a trade case. Presidents and lawmakers must aggressively defend this vital domestic industry that competes on an international stage."}

Community organizer for harm reduction and DSA. MSU student at Tulane University. Know better, do better. Slithering across the northern plains of America is the Dakota Access Pipeline, now 70 percent complete. The pipeline will transport hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude oil from the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota more than 1,100 miles to an oil tank farm in Illinois. Clean drinking water for 18 million people, sacred native lands stolen by the U.S. government and subsequently privatized, and a centuries-old and still-perpetuated practice of environmental racism and aggression against indigenous people in America. A handful of billionaires. Our land was taken, our language was forbidden. Our stories, our history, were almost forgotten. Sites of cultural and historic significance are important to us because they are a spiritual connection to our ancestors. Even if we do not have access to all such sites, their existence perpetuates the connection. Within the tribes, natives experience the highest rate of poverty of any racial group in the country. The land slated for construction of the pipeline was given to the Sioux in the Treaty of Fort Laramie in the mid-1800s. In the coerced treaty, the tribe conceded much of their land, making it available for the eventual private appropriation for construction of the pipeline. In the 1940s, Lewis A. Pick of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intentionally flooded hundreds of thousands of acres of tribal lands with a series of dams in a public works project along the Missouri River. When 200,000 acres of land in the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Nations were flooded by the Pick-Sloan Plan from the Oahe Dam, socioeconomic and cultural life for the Sioux suffered permanent consequences. Living members of tribes today experienced this intentional act of aggression from the vintage Corps. Archaeological evidence suggests the Missouri River has been sustaining human life for more than 10,000 years. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued permits for more than 200 water crossings for the Dakota Access Pipeline, including two crossings of the Missouri River, one of Little Missouri, and one under Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock reservation. Warren Between 2009 and 2015, the number of pipeline spills and leaks rose by almost 60 percent, a number which the Associated Press reported roughly matched the rise in U.S. crude oil production. The Dakota Access Pipeline is approximately 70 percent complete and is estimated to carry between 470,000 and 570,000 barrels of oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois. The Dallas Morning News reported the daily oil capacity of the DAPL is equal to 6 percent of total current U.S. domestic crude oil production. As capacity increases, so do the risks of deadly spills. Not so here. Domestic oil pipelines, unlike natural-gas pipelines, require no general approval from the federal government. Further investment in pipelines with no federal oversight coupled with the knack of corporations to reduce costs of construction and maintenance in the never-enough quest for profits is setting the poorest communities in America up for future disaster and further dispossession. In addition to his 23,000 square-foot mansion in Preston Hollow, Warren also owns ranches in Austin, Colorado, and east Texas, as well as a private island off the coast of Honduras. Less competition can mean higher prices and result in larger, powerful, and autocratic institutions, but potentially fewer superfluous pipeline paths that result from private ownership conflicts. I do not play for companies who defile nature, or companies who attack demonstrators with trained attack dogs and pepper spray. On Sunday, November 27, Browne and artist Bonnie Raitt played a benefit concert for protesters fighting the pipeline. While investment in infrastructure may alleviate immediate shortages and stopgap job creation, the short-term approaches of oil transfer and refinement leave people at risk for generations to come. After all, it is primarily older pipelines that burst and cause great damage. A pipeline built in such close proximity to the sovereign soil of the Sioux may sound a reasonable sacrifice to someone with quarterly profits in mind, but not to people hoping to raise children and grandchildren on land they can neither sell nor trade. The semantics of sovereign soil complicate the options of natives to evacuate future disasters and permanent destruction of land they consider sacred. Long after Energy Transfer Partners falls and Kelcy Warren and his investors are in the ground, the Standing Rock Sioux will be on the land he considers potential collateral damage. These are our only remaining homelands. We have to protect them. Protesters were attempting to clear a blockade of two burnt military trucks on Highway 1806 blocking access to emergency services. More than 400 protesters have been arrested in Standing Rock, leading to multiple incidents of violence between the protesters, police, and the private security firm hired by Dakota Access. While hundreds of protesters have been arrested and charged with crimes, not one security contractor was charged with acts of assault against natives or activists. As insult to injury, protesters have faced humiliating strip searches for misdemeanor charges. The imbalance in arrests represents only the tip of an iceberg of injustice. Instead of waiting for the verdict from the court, Dakota Access dug up the sites anyway, prompting the Judge to issue a too-little-too-late order of protection to stop construction. In other words, Dakota Access was rewarded for disrespecting the jurisdiction of the court and, as result, the law does not apply to the protection of those lands anymore as there is no longer anything to protect. Across the country, many thousands more have gathered in solidarity. For years, Gallup has shown more than 75 percent of Americans want more investment in renewable energy and fewer than 40 percent want continued investment in fossil fuels. Warren and his company Energy Transfer Partners are not simply ignoring the desires of activists and natives in defense of clean drinking water, but also that of most Americans. Bloomberg reported ETP scrapped plans for a new gas pipeline in Michigan after facing opposition from environmentalists. This time, however, Warren and ETP appear to be doubling down on the pipeline. As a publicly-traded company, one could even argue Dakota Access is living up to the legal mandate to provide profit for shareholders above all other factors. She was asked to leave the building by security and a formal complaint was lodged with Dallas Police Department. Bluehorse has high hopes for a change of heart and has petitioned him on the grounds of humanity. In the case of the Dakota Access pipeline, rivals appear to include not only competitors within Big Oil, but also protesters, journalists, and natives. One female filmmaker is facing a 45-year sentence for covering events at the camp. Many more journalists have been tased, attacked, and arrested. Arrest warrants were also issued for Green Party presidential and VP candidates Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka. A 25-year-old female activist and candidate for Congress was shot with a rubber bullet in the back at point-blank range at Sacred Stone camp while interviewing a protester on camera. When private security officials and Dakota Access construction workers sought extrajudicial crowd-control and vengeance, a pregnant woman and a child were victims to their acts of unlawful aggression. The profound lack of justice for Standing Rock was compounded when North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple declared a state of emergency and brought in the National Guard, armed with industrial pepper spray tanks, noise machines known to cause permanent hearing damage, tasers, and military vehicles. The influx of funding has increased the police presence; however, emergency services have failed to protect those exercising their First Amendment right to peaceably assemble. When a brush fire broke out near the Oceti Sakowin camp, Morton County Fire Department ignored the calls and sent no emergency vehicles. In late November, Governor Dalrymple ordered an emergency order of evacuation of thousands of protesters from the camp. As a result of the order, approximately 2,000 veterans joined protesters to offer protection and support under the banner: Veterans Stand for Standing Rock. The ongoing water crisis in Flint, Michigan, the lead-laced blood of East Chicago children, and the Dakota Access Pipeline have elevated environmental racism to public consciousness within the last year. Now with the rise of centralized, autocratic corporations, that legacy continues under a new guise and with the implied consent of the federal government through deafening silence from the White House and relevant federal agencies. The pipeline has wavered between court-ordered delays and approvals and the destiny of the sacred lands and environmental safety of Standing Rock are unknown. Standing Rock Chair Dave Archambault II has requested President Obama take action to reroute the pipeline before the presidency changes hands. While Obama ordered a temporary halt on construction, later rescinded, he has been accused of remaining altogether too removed from the issue. While the words display interest in fair representation for native nations, the mistreatment of protesters has been enabled to continue with inaction. Kelcy Warren has built Energy Transfer Partners into a 71,000 mile network of pipelines across the country. It is a matter of mere inconvenience for Warren that his dream comes at the expense of thousands of living nightmares. Early in December, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied Dakota Access an easement it needs to complete the pipeline. Almost on cue, the Belle Fourche pipeline ruptured 150 miles from the Sacred Stone camp in early December, dumping more than 130,000 gallons of oil into the Ash Coulee Creek along with more than 46,000 gallons of oil on nearby lands.

However, transporting all that oil is never a good thing. Not only would this pipeline affect this tribe, but it would also contaminate the Missouri River, which supplies water to many cities. The protests stopped construction in August, the tribe saying they never agreed to allow ETP to build a pipeline in their home. The tribe has even called the UN Human Rights council. Barack Obama has done little to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline, as it is continuing its construction on privately owned land only. The protesters now fear with Donald Trump being elected president, the Dakota Access Pipeline will be able to be continued to be built, despite their enormous efforts to save the beautiful lands. The CEO of ETP, Kelcy Warren, has come out recently and said a Donald Trump presidency means there is a one hundred percent guarantee the pipeline will be finished. Although, Trump has not made any comments on his stance with the Dakota Access Pipeline, he shared his stance on the controversial Keystone Pipeline, which Barack Obama rejected in 2015. The Dakota Access Pipeline may bring more jobs to the USA, but the damage it will do is irreversible. It will ruin reservations, homes, and our planet.

Connect to your existing Cracked account if you have one or create a new Cracked username. Over 280 tribes and thousands of non-native volunteers have gathered to protect the Sioux's ancestral water supply, which they believe will be poisoned when the North Dakota Access Pipeline inevitably leaks. Most of the coverage you've seen has probably come in the form of Twitter and Facebook rage-screaming in all-caps gibberish, or it looks like this: The Guardian That vague title leaves a lot open to interpretation. And if the internet has taught us anything, it's that interpretation is not the average person's strong suit ... or even their medium suit, for that matter. Reading that headline makes the story sound identical to every other protest of the last 20 years. Continue Reading Below Advertisement It would be easy for me to make a snide joke here about people crafting bumper-sticker-sized commentaries about a protest as high-profile as this, but Twitter is way more important than you might realize. See, Standing Rock wouldn't still be here if it wasn't for social media. The main camp is a huge, sprawling 5,000 person campout. One that runs off its own renewable power, offers free coffee 24 hours a day, and manages to feed and provide emergency care for its thousands of volunteers. The main camp area has become a makeshift city -- though not one you're likely to hear an annoying, pandering pop song about. Take me down to the Protest City, where there is no grass but counseling tipis. We met carload after carload of those volunteers, and the critical supplies they brought to camp, like firewood and things to wipe your butt with that isn't firewood. Which is both awe-inspiring and cartoonishly surreal. And now, keeping in mind everything I've told you so far, here's where things get crazy. Governments always have weapons -- the people only have each other, and occasionally Molotov cocktails. That's why the Egyptian government tried to fight the protests in 2011 by cutting off the entire nation's internet access, and why Turkey's new sorta-dictator Recep Tayyip Erdogan attempted to block Twitter access in his country. So maybe it's not surprising that someone is trying to kick Standing Rock off the internet. (And yes, we've got evidence to back us up. We first encountered the idea through hearsay, via a man we met at the big camp, in a large tent filled with U.S. military veterans. He'd been a 25 Bravo in the Army -- an information technology specialist. In any other situation, we'd have been prepared to write this off as the world's lamest campfire story. But ... We ran into similar strange rumors across camp for the next couple of days. People from every corner, whether they had been on site for days or for months, would talk about their cellphone signals cutting out just as drones circled above. Mobiles would switch themselves off and on again -- not in pocket but in hand. Camera apps were opened out of nowhere, and batteries would drain by enormous percentages, killing the phones in minutes, rather than the steady decline of any device pinging back and forth searching for a signal. There were even reports of people's Gmail accounts being hacked. We were unable to even Instagram this picture of our morning coffee. We brought all this -- the cell-blocking and reports of weird phone activity -- up to Marc Rogers, a security expert and white-hat hacker who, among other things, advises the show Mr. Robot. This allows the authorities to track people without using their GPS data, and thus without one of those pesky warrants. Other cell site simulators, like a DRT box, or dirtbox, are capable of decrypting data and voice calls from any phone that connects to them. These devices are also capable of booting protesters off the internet. Most of the time, it happens by accident. All they have to do is broadcast a cell tower with a stronger signal than the legitimate towers. But they certainly have the capability. Chicago and Los Angeles police have had dirtboxes for more than a decade. A number of U.S. police departments have purchased Stingrays in the past few years. Since these cell site simulators can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, they're often donated to local PDs by the FBI or the corporations that make them. A Stingray was most recently used by the Baltimore police to disrupt the protests after Freddie Gray's death. So it's not like John Law is averse to blocking people's data via techno-fuckery. And sometimes they do it with planes, because if you're going to do shit like this, you might as well do it in the scariest way possible. Continue Reading Below Advertisement In 2014, The Wall Street Journal broke the story that the U.S. Marshals Service had commissioned a fleet of fixed-wing aircraft with dirtboxes. And no, this information isn't from some website with an Illuminati pyramid worked into the logo; the AP figured this out, and they've provided so much documentation that anyone who reads it will literally shit credibility. Continue Reading Below Advertisement Marc made sure to note that a number of things could have caused all this funky phone behavior. Our stories were all anecdotal, and conspiratorial thinking is going to thrive at any given gathering of thousands of people who regularly contend with armed riot police. And while a handful of other sites have reported on rumors of digital eavesdropping at Standing Rock, and the ACLU has submitted a freedom of information request looking into the matter, solid evidence has been in short supply. They gave each of us a rundown of the camp's rules. Eventually press liaison Michael Penuelas explained that the open WiFi networks were basically a honeypot. Those who connected would discover that their email passwords had been changed and they were temporarily locked out of their accounts. Open WiFi is possible to spoof fairly simply, using legitimate-looking portals to collect any entered data, like email addresses and passwords. Setting up an attack can be as easy as hiding a device in a desired location and waiting for people to connect. Michael referred us to a pair of cybersecurity experts from NYU who'd been gathering data on all this for a while. ARP-spoofing like this can be used to simply stop service, or to conduct a man in the middle attack. No condom. No cab fare home. Just a raw, unapologetic cyber dick-down. Continue Reading Below Advertisement Continue Reading Below Advertisement This is a Wireshark simulation of what he observed in the midst of one such attack, based on the data he gathered at the time. It suggests that something funky is happening and that digital war zone photography probably won't ever win a Pulitzer. Chuck noted that an open hot spot appeared as soon as the attack commenced. A lookup of the plane's registration data shows it belonging to the Nebraska Highway Patrol. He's in the process of filing a Freedom of Information request to see those logs. But Chuck took data on other planes in the sky during his visit. One of them was registered to the North Dakota Highway Patrol, and one was registered to the North Dakota Fish & Game Department. Both of the others are weird. And this Cessna was listed as being owned by the Nebraska State Patrol: Federal Aviation Administration Continue Reading Below Advertisement Now, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota are NOT known to employ Stingray-style technology. Most of these planes may just be for visual surveillance. It's worth noting, though, that all these out-of-state planes are Cessna T206H's, the same model the FBI prefers to load up with Dirtboxes. We've included Chuck Justice's data in this article, because we've really got to get back to writing about Back To The Future. This feels like the kind of problem that could use some Ruffalo.

The expansion, a project of Enbridge Inc., a Calgary-based energy company, would allow hundreds of thousands more barrels of oil a day to flow through this pipeline to the United States from Canadian oilsands. The fine was the second-largest in the history of the Clean Water Act, behind the penalty imposed after the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt Associated Press A spokesman for Williams & Jensen said that the lobbying firm did not intervene with the EPA or Pruitt on the Enbridge pipeline expansion either before or after Pruitt was living in the condo owned in part by Vicki Hart, the wife of J. Steven Hart, the chairman of the firm. Williams & Jensen, for example, was lobbying the EPA early last year, according to its disclosure reports, on behalf of both Oklahoma Gas and Electric, a major coal-burning utility, and Concho Resources, a Texas-based oil and gas drilling company. The work for Oklahoma Gas involved the effort to repeal or revise the landmark Obama-era rule that pushed states to move away from coal in favour of sources of electricity that produce fewer carbon emissions. An EPA calendar in March 2017 shows that Pruitt and his chief of staff were scheduled to meet with company executives at the request of a Williams & Jensen lobbyist. Brian Alford, a spokesman for Oklahoma Gas, said the company had received no favours from Pruitt. Pruitt has considered revisions in both regulatory areas. In the Enbridge case, the EPA was asked to evaluate the potential environmental effect of the pipeline expansion application, as well as the quality of a preliminary review of the project that the State Department had already conducted. When the pipeline opened in 2010, it was permitted to carry only as much as 500,000 barrels of oil a day. The expansion would allow it to move an additional 390,000 barrels through a key three-mile section near the Canadian border. The oil it carries comes from the Canadian oilsands, like the oil for the proposed extension of the Keystone XL pipeline. Extraction from oilsands has drawn opposition from environmentalists, given that the process requires more energy than traditional drilling. Pipelines, like this one, that cross an international border into the United States require a presidential permit, which is issued only after the State Department has conducted a detailed environmental review and has taken input from other federal agencies, including the EPA. Investigators later found that employees allowed the oil to continue to flow after wrongly assuming that the alarms sounding were caused by a harmless vapour bubble. Enbridge has argued it has learned from that accident and taken corrective measures to prevent it from happening again. The conclusion stands in contrast to a similar evaluation by the agency in 2013 of the Keystone XL pipeline project. With the signoff by the EPA and the State Department, Enbridge received the expansion permit it needed in October, five years after it first applied for permission. Additional pumping stations have already been built, meaning the pipeline expansion project is already completed, the company said. Discussions have already started on Capitol Hill about asking the EPA inspector general to expand his inquiry to include the condo deal. Late Monday, three House Democrats who serve on the committee with oversight of the EPA sent a letter to Pruitt asking a series of questions about the condo lease, which was first reported by ABC News.

Protesters at the North Dakota camp, which is near the Missouri River, seemed unfazed by threats of arrest. Faced with the prospect of spring flooding, some protesters are considering a move to higher ground, though not necessarily off the federal land. Some may move to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The leader of the tribe has urged protesters to leave. Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) began work on the last major section of the pipeline this month following Army Corps of Engineers permission to lay pipe under a reservoir near the Missouri River. The protests have been led by Native American tribes, particularly the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux, whose reservations are downstream from the construction site. They say the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites, an accusation ETP disputes. There have been more than 700 arrests. The camp's population has dwindled as the pipeline battle has moved into the courts. The area has become strewn with garbage, and local police fear that the debris and snow may be covering the bodies of protesters who succumbed to the harsh conditions. Over the last several days authorities have searched the camp for human remains. More than 200 truckloads of debris have been hauled out of the campsite since Monday, according to the office of North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. The cleanup will occur after 2 p.m., local time, Wednesday, when the remaining protesters will be moved from the camp. Burgum has said he would rather there would be no arrests.

Early estimates put the spill at around 5,000 barrels, which was later adjusted down to 700. One barrel of oil contains 42 gallons, so nearly 30,000 gallons of crude may have been spilled. Fire officials and hazmat teams are on the scene of Ventura County oil spill. He said he called 911 after smelling and hearing the flowing crude, and then rode his motor scooter up the canyon to find oil gushing from an above-ground box. The leak prompted a swift hazmat response to contain the spill and prevent the oil from entering the Pacific Ocean. The responders included several local and state agencies, including the California Fish and Wildlife Office of Spill Prevention and Response, the Ventura and Oxnard County fire departments and the Coast Guard Marine Safety Detachment Santa Barbara. The pipeline is owned by Crimson Pipeline, a privately-owned midstream pipeline company that owns and operates approximately 1,500 miles of pipelines across California and the Gulf of Mexico. The oil itself is owned by Aera Energy, the largest onshore oil producer in Ventura County, which produces an average of 13,000 barrels per day. The exact cause of the leak is still unknown. He added that he air quality was being monitored as a precaution. Some of the oil entered the Pacific Ocean, forming into tar balls that were found 130 miles away at Manhattan Beach. Oil from the spill fills a natural depression, despoiling the natural beauty of Ventura County's landscape. He told AlterNet: We have to treat pipeline spills and failures for what they are: not accidents but part of the day to day operations of the oil and gas industry. But the real goal needs to be a transition away from the dirty fuels that pave the road to catastrophic climate change with disasters like these. David Braun, co-founder of Rootskeeper, spoke on behalf of Californians Against Fracking in a press statement: Firefighters racing to block thousands of gallons of oil from dumping into our beautiful ocean sounds like a scene from a Hollywood disaster movie, but these devastating images are the reality in California. There is no incentive for oil companies to properly maintain their sites and to stop spilling because federal and state regulations and regulator agencies are so weak and there are no penalties. That is more spillage than the Exxon Valdez. Onshore. In one year. At this point, we cannot even call these spills. Spills happen by accident. This is no accident, this is a permanent state of criminal negligence. The oil and gas industry is so sloppy, so irresponsible, so damaging that their behavior amounts to crimes against nature and against humanity. If terrorists despoiled this much water and land and resources in the U.S., it would be all over the news every day. Since the oil and gas industry owns the government, there's hardly ever even the most paltry fines and penalties. And spills are even worse in places like the Amazon, where devastating leakages happen all the time. EcoWatch, Truthdig, National Memo, Green America, Regeneration International, Revelist, Resilience and BlackBook, among others.

In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community. We are launching this second GoFundMe to create a Standing Rock Fund to address the ongoing needs at Standing Rock and our partners in camp. Please take moment to check out our new campaign and share with your networks. We are formulating organizational structure under a 501c4. This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement.

But, within days of taking office, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum supporting the construction of the pipeline. Recently a U.S. federal judge denied a request by tribes to halt construction on the final link of the project. Meaning of sacred spaces I learned from my grandparents about the sacred areas within Blackfeet tribal territory in Montana and Alberta, which is not far from Lakota tribal territory in the Dakotas. My grandparents said that sacred areas are places set aside from human presence. They identified two overarching types of sacred place: those set aside for the divine, such as a dwelling place, and those set aside for human remembrance, such as a burial or battle site. Military veterans arrive to support activists at Oceti Sakowin Camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation Cannon Ball, North Dakota. The deities could simultaneously exist in both as visible and invisible reality. That is, they could live unseen, but known, within a physical place visible to humans. This mountain is the home of Ksiistsikomm, or Thunder, a primordial deity. My grandparents spoke of how this mountain is a liminal space, a place between two realms. Elders of the Blackfeet tribe believe that human activity, or changing the physical landscape in these places, disrupts the lives of deities. They view this as sacrilegious and a desecration. Some sacred places are meant for constant human interaction. Deloria described how Lakota religious leaders went to these stones in the early morning to read their messages. Deloria shared the experiences of an Episcopal minister from 1919. The Americans renamed it Cannonball. Not just Dakota Historians, anthropologists and religious thinkers continue to learn and write about Native American religious ideas of place. In so doing, they seek to analyze complex religious concepts of transformation and transcendence that these places evoke. However, despite their contributions to the academic interpretation of religion, these understandings do not often translate into protection of Native American places for their religious significance. In the past year we have seen protests over the potential desecration of sacred places at Mauna Kea in Hawaii (over the construction of another telescope on a sacred volcano), Oak Flats in Arizona (over a potential copper mine on sacred land) and now at Standing Rock in North Dakota. The intimate connection between landscape and religion is at the center of Native American societies. It is the reason that thousands of Native Americans from across the United States and indigenous peoples from around the world have traveled to the windswept prairies of North Dakota. But, despite our 200-plus years of contact, the United States has yet to begin to understand the uniqueness of Native American religions and ties to the land. And until this happens, there will continue to be conflicts over religious ideas of land and landscape, and what makes a place sacred. This article was originally published on The Conversation.

Elders of the Blackfeet tribe believe that human activity, or changing the physical landscape in these places, disrupts the lives of deities. described how Lakota religious leaders went to these stones in the early morning to read their messages. despite their contributions to the academic interpretation of religion, these understandings do not often translate into protection of Native American places for their religious significance. intimate connection between landscape and religion is at the center of Native American societies. despite our 200-plus years of contact, the United States has yet to begin to understand the uniqueness of Native American religions and ties to the land."}

We hear about the record-setting amounts of water that Hurricane Harvey dumped on Houston and other Gulf cities and towns, mixing with petrochemicals to pollute and poison on an unfathomable scale. Yet for large parts of North America, Europe, and Africa, this summer has not been about water at all. For millions of people from California to Greenland, Oregon to Portugal, British Columbia to Montana, Siberia to South Africa, the summer of 2017 has been the summer of fire. For years, climate scientists have warned us that a warming world is an extreme world, in which humanity is buffeted by both brutalizing excesses and stifling absences of the core elements that have kept fragile life in equilibrium for millennia. Reachable only by ferry or floatplane, this is the part of the world where my parents live, where my son was born, and where my grandparents died. Though it still feels like home, we now only get here for a few weeks a year. The government of Canada weather site predicted that the next week would be glorious: an uninterrupted block of sun, clear skies, and higher than average temperatures. I pictured hot afternoons paddling in the Pacific and still, starry nights. But when we arrive in early August, a murky blanket of white has engulfed the coast and the temperature is cool enough for a sweater. Forecasts are often wrong, but this is more complicated. Somewhere up there, above the muck, the sky is clear of clouds. The sun is particularly hot. Enough smoke to transform the sun itself into an angry pinpoint of red fire surrounded by a strange halo, unable to burn through the relentless haze. Enough smoke to blot out the stars. Enough smoke to absorb any possible sunsets. At the end of the day, the red ball abruptly disappears, only to be replaced by a strange burnt-orange moon. The smoke has created its own weather system, powerful enough to transform the climate not just where we are, but in a stretch of territory that appears to cover roughly 100,000 square miles. And the smoke, a giant smudge on the satellite images, respects no borders: not only is about a third of British Columbia choked, but so are large parts of the Pacific Northwest, including Seattle, Bellingham, and Portland, Oregon. Up and down the coast, the government has issued air quality warnings, urging people to avoid strenuous activity. Beyond a certain threshold, fine particulate matter in the air is officially unsafe, bad enough to cause health problems. The air in parts of Vancouver is three times above that safe threshold, with some smaller communities on the coast significantly worse off. One local official recommends a trip to the mall. Smoke from wildfires burning in central British Columbia shrouds the north shore of Kamloops on Monday July 10, 2017. Anything over 25 micrograms of fine particulates per cubic meter is considered unsafe. Kamloops, the city currently housing many of the evacuees, averages 684.5 micrograms per cubic meter. That rivals Beijing on some of its very worst days. Airlines cancel flights, and people suffering from breathing problems reportedly pack emergency rooms. Since this disaster began, some 840 separate fires have ignited, forcing, at this point, some 50,000 people to evacuate their homes, according to the Red Cross. In early July, the government declared a rare state of emergency and by the time we arrive, it has already been extended twice. Hundreds of structures have been razed, some whole communities, including indigenous reserves, have been mostly reduced to ash. So far, roughly 1,800 square miles of forest, farm, and grassland have burned. I call a friend in Kamloops. Which puts things into perspective for us on the coast. I wrote a book in a blur, then toured with it. And my husband Avi and I helped start a new political organization. It was the finish line (albeit a temporary one), and we fully planned to collapse on it. It was also the way we kept our 5-year-old son Toma in the game. On cold nights in the east, we mapped out the forested walks we would take, the canoe trips, the swims. We imagined the blackberries we would pick, the crumbles we would bake; we listed the grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and old friends we would visit. By evening, I announce that it will blow over by morning, revealing at least a glimpse of actual sky. For the first week, I greet each day hopefully, convinced that the drab light peeking through the curtains is just morning mist. Every day I am wrong. The placid weather forecast that seemed so promising before we traveled turns out to be a curse. Sunny, windless days mean that the smoke, once it is upon us, parks over our heads like an unmoveable outdoor ceiling. Day after day after day. My allergies are going nuts. I bath my eyes in drops and pop antihistamines well beyond the recommended dosage. Toma breaks out in hives so severe he needs steroids. I keep taking my glasses off and cleaning them, rubbing them first with my shirt, then a microfiber cloth, then proper glass cleaner. Nothing helps. Nothing makes the smudge disappear. Smoke obscures the sun as a helicopter carrying a bucket battles the Gustafsen wildfire near 100 Mile House, British Columbia, on Saturday July 8, 2017. Life beyond the smoke starts to seem like a rumor. I learned to love the steely beauty, the infinite shades of grey chiseled in the mountains. The low sky and the movement of the mist. But this is different. Smoke is a little different. In part because you know that you are not breathing pollution from power plants or exhaust from cars but rather trees that were very recently alive. You are breathing in forest. I decide that the animals are depressed. The seals seem to pop their heads up in a purely utilitarian fashion, just to take a breath and then disappear again beneath the gray surface. They do not play. The eagles, I am convinced, are flying for function, not fun, no soaring or wind surfing. I email a friend in Seattle, a prominent environmentalist, to ask him how he is faring in the smoke. He reports that the birds have stopped singing, and he is mad all the time. Old Forest in Spipyus Provincial Park, Sechelt Peninsula, Sunshine Coast, British Columbia. It begins to strike me how precarious it all is, this business of not being on fire. This part of British Columbia, technically a temperate rainforest, is a tinderbox. So far this summer, less than half an inch of rain has fallen. The forest groundcover, usually moist and squishy, is yellow and desiccated and crunches underfoot. You can smell the flammability. The roads are lined with yellow signs announcing a total ban on open fires. Every time we turn on the radio, we hear warnings, increasingly frantic, about open fires, cigarettes tossed out of cars, and fireworks. Two years ago, a serious blaze threatened part of the coast about 20 minutes from here, taking the life of a local man who was helping to fight the flames. The Sunshine Coast has a year-round population of 30,000 people served by a single highway that ends in a ferry dock. I ask local friends. They look worried and talk about who has which kind of boat. Honesto Silva Ibarra came to the U.S. from Mexico on a temporary H-2A visa to work through the harvest season. He was 28 years old and had been picking blueberries at Sarbanand Farms, owned by California-based Munger Farms, when he started feeling sick. Some workers had fainted on the job, they told reporters. The company also claims it did all it could to save him. Investigations are ongoing. After Silva was hospitalized, workers staged a one-day strike to demand answers and better conditions. Sixty-six of them were immediately fired for insubordination. They found themselves without means to get home to Mexico and without payment for their final days of work. But they did not get their much-needed jobs back. Munger supplies Walmart, Whole Foods, Safeway, and Costco. North of the border, there are similar reports of temporary farmworkers fainting and becoming sick on the job, with smoke apparently playing a role. And advocates point out that, rather than being looked after, their sponsoring employers often send sick workers home like defective goods. A wildfire burns south of Fort McMurray, Alberta, near Highway 63 on Saturday, May 7, 2016. They take pre-existing divides and deepen them further, so the people who were already getting most screwed over before the disaster get extra doses of pain during and after. We know a fair bit about how that looks during storms, such as Katrina, Sandy, Harvey, and Irma. We understand less about fire. They were promptly sent home. We also know, as with floods, that our media gives far more coverage to house pets rescued from wildfires in the U.S. and Canada than it does to the human lives lost because of infernos in, say, Indonesia and Chile. A global 2012 study estimated that more than 300,000 people die annually as a result of smoke and the air pollution from wildfires, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. And in British Columbia this summer, we learned still more about the way inequalities play out against a burning backdrop. Several indigenous leaders raised concerns that during fire emergencies, their communities do not receive the same level of urgent response as non-indigenous communities, whether for fighting the flames or for rebuilding afterward. In at least one case, the police responded by threatening to come in and remove children from their families, words with traumatic reverberations in a country that not so long ago systematically took indigenous children from their homes as a matter of policy. In the end, no First Nations homes were raided and many were saved because of self-organized firefighting. The moon sets at dawn behind clouds of smoke over charred hills after strong winds fed the Harris Fire on October 25, 2007, near the U.S.-Mexico border south of Portrero, California. Around here, people take full moons seriously; there are drug-fueled dance parties in the forest, and late-night kayak excursions, taking advantage of the extra light. We set out to collect them. With so little rain and such a weak sun to warm them, even the ripest berries are sour. Toma quickly loses interest and refuses to try any more. We come home with shin scratches and an empty bucket. In fact, we spend at least an hour or two a day walking through the stands of moss-covered cedars and Douglas firs, breathing in the super-oxygenated air. I love these forests and have never taken their primordial beauty for granted. For not joining their burning brethren. For sticking with us, despite our failings. At least so far. Tourists to Banff National Park in Alberta take photos of Mt. Rundle and the Vermillion lakes as smoke from a forest fire in Kootenay National Park in British Columbia blankets the area, Sunday July 16, 2017. Not these precise airborne particles, of course, but smoke from many of the same wildfires. And the odd thing is, I breathed it in some 570 miles east of here, in another province entirely. I spent mid-July in Alberta, helping teach a course on environmental reporting at the Banff Centre for the Arts. This time, too, the forecast had looked perfect: sunny, clear, warm. This time, too, the forecast was usurped from the first day by a smoke-cast, a haze that obscured the spectacular mountains in Banff National Park and provoked air quality warnings, headaches, and a catch in the throat. Back in July, the winds were blowing east, which is why the Rockies were getting a face-full of smoke. It kept traveling eastward, reaching well into the center of the continent, to Saskatchewan and Manitoba and down to North Dakota and Montana (NASA released a striking picture of the 500-mile long plume). Then, just as my family was heading to coastal British Columbia, the winds abruptly shifted and started blowing the plume westward, with the Rocky Mountains now acting like a giant tennis racket, lobbing the smoke to the Pacific. A wider satellite view of two large forest fires on July 7, 2015, in North Vancouver, British Columbia. Even devastating hurricanes like Harvey tend to concentrate their impacts in a contained geography. And the event (though not the aftermath) is relatively brief. These fires, which rage for months, are of a different order entirely. There are the direct impacts of the fires. The huge swath of land charred. The tens of thousands of lives overturned by evacuation orders. The lost homes and farms and cattle. And then there are the less direct impacts of all that wandering smoke. Over July and August, the smoke from this conflagration covered an area spanning roughly 700,000 square miles. All touched by this one fast-moving disaster. And this is just one snapshot of a much larger season of fire. The fire in Los Angeles was the largest ever recorded within city limits; a fire-related state of emergency was declared for every single county in Washington state. In Montana, a wildfire named the Lodgepole Complex burned some 425 square miles of territory, making it the third-largest blaze in the settled history of the region. This is part of a broader increase in both the numbers of fires and the months during which they burn: Since the 1970s, fire season in the United States has lengthened by 105 days, according to an analysis by Climate Central. Hundreds of homes have burned in Siberia. In June in South Africa, the same storm caused flooding in Cape Town and fanned the flames of unprecedented deadly wildfires in nearby towns. Even Greenland, that icy place, saw large and unusual wildfires this summer. Burned vehicles sit in the glow of the full moon on Highway 138 in Phelan as the Blue Cut fire continues to ravage San Bernardino County, Calif., on Aug. 18, 2016. Another is the perennially hubristic attempt to re-engineer natural forces far more powerful than we are. Many indigenous cultures have long used fire as a key part of land care. But in North America, modern forest management has systematically supressed cyclical fires in order to protect profitable trees that were headed for sawmills, as well as out of fear that small fires could spread to inhabited areas (and there are more and more inhabited areas). Without regular natural burns, forests are chock-full of fuel, provoking fires to burn out of control. There is compelling evidence that the bark beetle epidemic has been exacerbated by climate change-related heat and drought. Indeed, these forces have conspired to turn forests into perfectly laid campfires, with the dry earth acting like balled-up newspaper, the dead trees serving as kindling, and the added heat providing the match. Mike Flannigan, a University of Alberta wildfire expert, is blunt. And according to a 2010 study, fire occurrence in Canada is projected to increase by 75 percent by the end of the century. Ever since we left Alberta, his 5-year-old mind has been struggling to understand the smoke that has marked his summer. Trying to make sense of my chronic cough and his raging skin rash. Struggling, most of all, with the soundtrack of worried chatter among the grown-ups in his life. His response goes through phases: Nightmares wake him up at night. Then his grandfather explained that the sun had turned into that weird, glowing dot because the forest itself was on fire. He was stricken. A coyote walks across U.S. Highway 120, shut down due to the Rim Fire on August 23, 2013 near Groveland, Calif. We have developed techniques for controlling worry. They begin with taking deep breaths, and we do it several times a day. But it occurs to me that breathing extra amounts of this particular air is probably not great, especially for small lungs already prone to infection. What we do talk about is pollution, though on a scale he can understand. Like plastic, and why we have to pick it up and use less of it because it makes the animals sick. Or we look at the exhaust coming out of cars and trucks, and talk about how you can get power from the sun and the wind and store it in batteries. A little kid can grasp concepts like these and know exactly what should happen (better than plenty of adults). This summer marks the end of his protection. He just heard too many adults obsessing over the strange sky, and the real reasons behind the fires, and he finally put it all together. At a playground in the haze, I meet a young mother who offers advice on how to reassure worried kids. I nod, feeling like a failed mom. Many are so hot and intransigent that they are leaving scorched earth behind. And just as my son fears, animals are losing their forested homes. The biggest danger, however, is the carbon being released as the forests burn. This dramatic increase of emissions is part of what climate scientists mean when they warn about feedback loops: burning carbon leads to warmer temperatures and long periods without rain, which leads to more fires, which release more carbon into the atmosphere, which leads to even warmer and drier conditions, and even more fires. Darkened ice absorbs more heat than reflective white ice, which makes the ice melt faster, which leads to sea level rise and the release of huge amounts of methane, which causes more warming and more fires, which in turn create more blackened ice and more melting. We settle for half-truths and fudging to make the nightmare subside. We talk about how we need to plant more trees for the animals to come home to. It helps, a little. Protesters attend a rally protesting against the approval of Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion in Vancouver, British Columbia, Nov. 29, 2016. The late Arthur Manuel, a former Secwepemc chief, was a dear friend and hosted me several times. The expanded network of pipes would pass through dozens of waterways on Secwepemc land, and is forcefully opposed by many traditional landholders. A statement was issued by the Secwepemc Working Group on Indigenous Food Sovereignty opposing the pipeline expansion project and demanding that the existing, smaller pipeline be shut down immediately to reduce the risk of a catastrophic accident should fire and oil meet. Worse, in true shock doctrine form, some extractive industries are actively using the fiery state of emergency to get stuff done that was impossible during normal times. For instance, Taseko Mines has been fighting for years to build a highly contentious, open pit gold and copper mine in one of the parts of British Columbia hit hardest by the fires. In its last week in office after suffering a humiliating election defeat, the government handed Taseko a raft of permits to move ahead with exploration. There is also a new provincial government, created through an unprecedented agreement between the center-left New Democratic Party and the Greens. In a rare piece of good climate news, it is actively challenging the legality of the Kinder Morgan pipeline project on several fronts. Yet anyone holding out hope that the fires might jolt Trudeau into serious climate action has been gravely disappointed. Never mind that Houston has since flooded and a third of his country is on fire. Trudeau is on fossil fuel autopilot and nothing, it seems, will make him swerve. Then there is President Donald Trump, whose climate crimes are too comprehensive and too layered to delineate here. Home foundations and skeletons of possesions are all that remain in parts of a residential neighborhood destroyed by a wildfire on May 7, 2016 in Fort McMurray, Alberta. Wildfires, which are still burning out of control, have forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 residents from the town. Two homes, two fires, same guy. In both cases, only the fireplace and chimney remain. But there is no mention of climate change. This is notable because Schurman works as a site supervisor in the Alberta tar sands. Still, the reporter did not ask Schurman if losing two homes and nearly losing his son raised any questions for him about the industry in which he works (one of the only sectors in Canada or the U.S. still paying salaries that afford middle-class lives). When Vice picked up the irresistible story, the reporter did raise climate change with Schurman, which he acknowledged could be one of the factors contributing to these infernos. People walk near dark brown stains of beached oil in Gulf Shores, Ala., Saturday, June 5, 2010. The soft-focus quality the smoke casts over life here seems to make this collective denial more acute. Smoke, after all, is not fire. You can live with it, if less well. You get used to it. We bring beers and ciders to the beach and remark that, on the upside, you barely need sunscreen at all. Sitting on the beach under that fake, milky sky, I suddenly flash to those images of families sunning themselves on oil-soaked beaches in the midst of the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster. And it hits me: They are us. Refusing to let a wildfire interfere with our family vacation. During disasters, you hear a lot of praise for human resilience. And we are a remarkably resilient species. It seems we can get used to almost anything, even the steady annihilation of our own habitat. A huge plume of smoke from wildfires burning rises over Fort McMurray in this aerial photograph taken in Alberta, Canada, on Friday, May 6, 2016. The piece focuses on a method often referred to as solar radiation management, which would see sulfur dioxide sprayed into the stratosphere to create a barrier between the Earth and the sun, forcibly lowering temperatures. Yeah, that would be a bummer. Now imagine a scenario in which men, like Trump, Narendra Modi, and Kim Jong-un, were empowered to deploy these climate-altering technologies like unconventional weapons, hurtling us into an era of undeclared weather wars in which one country sacrifices the precipitation of another in order to save its crops, and the other retaliates by unleashing mega-floods. Some would-be planet hackers insist these worst-case risks can be managed. All concede to lesser downsides, however. Spraying sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere would almost certainly create a permanent milky-white haze, making clear blue skies a thing of the past for the entire planet. The haze might well prevent astronomers from seeing the stars and planets clearly, and weaker sunlight could reduce the capacity of solar power generators to produce energy. But it is something else entirely to read about the prospect of deliberately dimming the sky under a sky that is already artificially dimmed with omnipresent smoke casting a literal pall over daily life. Losing the sky is no small thing. We just saw ourselves, more detritus of our own broken system. I hear myself suggesting to Avi that we should just drive north until we hit clean air. We stay put. The Wind Changes Almost two full weeks into the smoke-out, something shifts. I hear it first, and then I see branches moving: wind. A sudden temperature drop. And by noon, actual patches of blue, separated by clouds. Crisp. I feel like that. The next day brings rain; not a lot, but enough to hope for some relief for the 2,400 exhausted and overworked firefighters. My allergies clear up, and Toma starts sleeping through the night again. But the news from the interior is disastrous. The same wind that finally pried loose the blanket of smoke on the coast has been fanning the flames at the epicenter of the fires. The stillness that trapped the smoke here for so long turns out to have been the only bright spot for the fire brigades. Over the next week, British Columbia blazes through the record books. By mid-August, the fires break the provincial record for the most land burned in one year: 3,453 square miles. We have clear skies, a near-perfect viewing location, and I know, in theory, that what is about to happen is a natural wonder. We only just got it back. I spend the eclipse sitting outside alone, staring at the horizon, clinging to the dying light. A week after, neo-Nazis marched with torches in Charlottesville, Virginia, and with so much of the world engulfed in actual infernos, this sudden dimming of our world just feels too damn literal. Smoke from wildfires fills the air in this aerial view from a Canadian Forces Chinook helicopter as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau views areas affected by wildfire near Williams Lake, British Columbia, on Monday, July 31, 2017. Extremely hot, dry, and windy weather has conspired to create the conditions for a slew of large, new wildfires to ignite and for old ones to expand exponentially. Authorities announce new evacuations daily; at last count, some 60,000 displaced people had registered as evacuees with Red Cross over the course of the summer. The state of emergency has been extended for the fourth time. Then there are the headline-grabbing blazes in Los Angeles, the state of emergency in Washington state, and new evacuations ordered, from Glacier National Park to northern Manitoba. I do know this: Our collective house is on fire, with every alarm going off simultaneously, clanging desperately for our attention. Those are the questions still hanging in the air at the end of this summer of smoke. Research: Sharon J.

Reachable only by ferry or floatplane, this is the part of the world where my parents live, where my son was born, and where my grandparents died. government of Canada weather site predicted that the next week would be glorious: an uninterrupted block of sun, clear skies, and higher than average temperatures. when we arrive in early August, a murky blanket of white has engulfed the coast and the temperature is cool enough for a sweater. Forecasts are often wrong, but this is more complicated. Enough smoke to transform the sun itself into an angry pinpoint of red fire surrounded by a strange halo, unable to burn through the relentless haze. Enough smoke to blot out the stars. Enough smoke to absorb any possible sunsets. smoke has created its own weather system, powerful enough to transform the climate not just where we are, but in a stretch of territory that appears to cover roughly 100,000 square miles. And the smoke, a giant smudge on the satellite images, respects no borders: not only is about a third of British Columbia choked, but so are large parts of the Pacific Northwest, including Seattle, Bellingham, and Portland, Oregon. Beyond a certain threshold, fine particulate matter in the air is officially unsafe, bad enough to cause health problems. The air in parts of Vancouver is three times above that safe threshold, with some smaller communities on the coast significantly worse off. More than 200 wildfires are burning in the province and an estimated 14,000 people have been evacuated from their homes. Anything over 25 micrograms of fine particulates per cubic meter is considered unsafe. That rivals Beijing on some of its very worst days. this disaster began, some 840 separate fires have ignited, forcing, at this point, some 50,000 people to evacuate their homes, according to the Red Cross. In early July, the government declared a rare state of emergency and by the time we arrive, it has already been extended twice. call a friend in Kamloops. puts things into perspective for us on the coast. It was the finish line (albeit a temporary one), and we fully planned to collapse on it. It was also the way we kept our 5-year-old son Toma in the game. On cold nights in the east, we mapped out the forested walks we would take, the canoe trips, the swims. By evening, I announce that it will blow over by morning, revealing at least a glimpse of actual sky. For the first week, I greet each day hopefully, convinced that the drab light peeking through the curtains is just morning mist. placid weather forecast that seemed so promising before we traveled turns out to be a curse. Sunny, windless days mean that the smoke, once it is upon us, parks over our heads like an unmoveable outdoor ceiling. I bath my eyes in drops and pop antihistamines well beyond the recommended dosage. keep taking my glasses off and cleaning them, rubbing them first with my shirt, then a microfiber cloth, then proper glass cleaner. Nothing helps. More than 180 fires were burning, many considered out of control, as the B.C. government declared a provincewide state of emergency to co-ordinate the crisis response. Officials said buildings have been destroyed, but they did not release numbers. Life beyond the smoke starts to seem like a rumor. I learned to love the steely beauty, the infinite shades of grey chiseled in the mountains. The low sky and the movement of the mist. But this is different. Smoke is a little different. In part because you know that you are not breathing pollution from power plants or exhaust from cars but rather trees that were very recently alive. decide that the animals are depressed.

He reports that the birds have stopped singing, and he is mad all the time. part of British Columbia, technically a temperate rainforest, is a tinderbox. So far this summer, less than half an inch of rain has fallen. The forest groundcover, usually moist and squishy, is yellow and desiccated and crunches underfoot. roads are lined with yellow signs announcing a total ban on open fires. Every time we turn on the radio, we hear warnings, increasingly frantic, about open fires, cigarettes tossed out of cars, and fireworks.

Canadian officials hoped to complete the mass evacuation of work camps north of Alberta's main oil sands city of Fort McMurray on Saturday, fearing the growing wildfire could double in size and reach a major oil sands mine and even the neighboring province of Saskatchewan. We understand less about fire. also know, as with floods, that our media gives far more coverage to house pets rescued from wildfires in the U.S. and Canada than it does to the human lives lost because of infernos in, say, Indonesia and Chile. Southern California has been suffering the worst wildfire event in state history, fed by strong Santa Ana Winds blowing numerous fires across dry native Chaparral habitat that was desiccated by the driest rain season since records began 130 years ago.

In fact, we spend at least an hour or two a day walking through the stands of moss-covered cedars and Douglas firs, breathing in the super-oxygenated air.

This time, too, the forecast was usurped from the first day by a smoke-cast, a haze that obscured the spectacular mountains in Banff National Park and provoked air quality warnings, headaches, and a catch in the throat. The forest fires covesr areas of Western Canada north of Vancouver and areas of British Columbia after a lightning strike sparked in Elaho followed by a secondary fire in Boulder Creek. The thick smoke can be seen snaking it's way between the mountains. Even devastating hurricanes like Harvey tend to concentrate their impacts in a contained geography. fires, which rage for months, are of a different order entirely. There are the direct impacts of the fires. The huge swath of land charred. The tens of thousands of lives overturned by evacuation orders. The lost homes and farms and cattle. then there are the less direct impacts of all that wandering smoke. Over July and August, the smoke from this conflagration covered an area spanning roughly 700,000 square miles. this is just one snapshot of a much larger season of fire. Hundreds of homes have burned in Siberia. deadly wildfires in nearby towns. that icy place, saw large and unusual wildfires this summer. Another is the perennially hubristic attempt to re-engineer natural forces far more powerful than we are. Many indigenous cultures have long used fire as a key part of land care. regular natural burns, forests are chock-full of fuel, provoking fires to burn out of control. Indeed, these forces have conspired to turn forests into perfectly laid campfires, with the dry earth acting like balled-up newspaper, the dead trees serving as kindling, and the added heat providing the match. since we left Alberta, his 5-year-old mind has been struggling to understand the smoke that has marked his summer.

The late Arthur Manuel, a former Secwepemc chief, was a dear friend and hosted me several times. The expanded network of pipes would pass through dozens of waterways on Secwepemc land, and is forcefully opposed by many traditional landholders.

Never mind that Houston has since flooded and a third of his country is on fire. there is President Donald Trump, whose climate crimes are too comprehensive and too layered to delineate here. Wildfires, which are still burning out of control, have forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 residents from the town. Two homes, two fires, same guy. a lot of moving detail in the story about the human wreckage these disasters leave behind: the endless paperwork, traumatic memories, and family stress. But there is no mention of climate change. This is notable because Schurman works as a site supervisor in the Alberta tar sands. Still, the reporter did not ask Schurman if losing two homes and nearly losing his son raised any questions for him about the industry in which he works (one of the only sectors in Canada or the U.S. still paying salaries that afford middle-class lives). picked up the irresistible story, the reporter did raise climate change with Schurman, which he acknowledged could be one of the factors contributing to these infernos. Oil from the Deepwater Horizon disaster has started washing ashore on the Alabama and Florida coast beaches. The soft-focus quality the smoke casts over life here seems to make this collective denial more acute. after all, is not fire. You can live with it, if less well. And it hits me: They are us. disasters, you hear a lot of praise for human resilience. And we are a remarkably resilient species. The wildfires ravaging Canada's oil hub in northern Alberta have rapidly spread to an area bigger than New York city, prompting the air lift of more than 8,000 evacuees as firefighters seek to salvage critical infrastructure. Yeah, that would be a bummer. would-be planet hackers insist these worst-case risks can be managed. All concede to lesser downsides, however. Spraying sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere would almost certainly create a permanent milky-white haze, making clear blue skies a thing of the past for the entire planet. We just saw ourselves, more detritus of our own broken system. hear myself suggesting to Avi that we should just drive north until we hit clean air. I hear it first, and then I see branches moving: wind. A sudden temperature drop. And by noon, actual patches of blue, separated by clouds. Crisp. The same wind that finally pried loose the blanket of smoke on the coast has been fanning the flames at the epicenter of the fires. The stillness that trapped the smoke here for so long turns out to have been the only bright spot for the fire brigades. We have clear skies, a near-perfect viewing location, and I know, in theory, that what is about to happen is a natural wonder. spend the eclipse sitting outside alone, staring at the horizon, clinging to the dying light. wildfires to ignite and for old ones to expand exponentially. Authorities announce new evacuations daily; at last count, some 60,000 displaced people had registered as evacuees with Red Cross over the course of the summer.

(Amy Davis, Baltimore Sun video) The final stages of construction inside of the 855,000-square-foot Amazon Fulfillment Center are underway in the new Sparrows Point facility. (Amy Davis, Baltimore Sun video) TransCanada, the Calgary, Alberta-based natural gas transmission giant behind the Maryland project, has more than a century of experience building pipelines in the area, spokesman Scott Castleman said. In addition to an OK from the Maryland Department of the Environment, the Maryland segment also needs approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the National Parks Service, among more than 40 required permits. The pipeline also would pass under the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, where protesters have been camping out on many weekends this summer. The federal energy regulator is set to make its decision in January. If the project receives the necessary approvals, TransCanada expects to begin construction next April. The firm began public outreach last November and subsequently revised its plans, pledging to bury the pipeline twice as deep, 100 feet, in the section under the riverbed. Instead, she argued, the state should move toward green energy. The Maryland portion of the line may only be a few miles long and cross only briefly under a narrow stretch of the Potomac, but the natural gas would travel through connecting pipelines for 50 miles or more, much of it through karst terrain, Walls said. However, Castleman noted, a dozen TransCanada pipelines already cross under the Potomac River in Maryland. Hancock officials have no qualms with the project, he said. TransCanada representatives will continue to meet with all stakeholders and make adjustments where it needs to, Castleman said."}

A federal judge declared the DAPL permits to be illegal, and ordered the Corps to take a fresh look at the risks of an oil spill and the impacts to the Tribe and its Treaty rights. That is not what the Army Corps did. The Tribe has worked in good faith every step of the way to develop technical and cultural information to help the Corps fully understand the consequences of permitting this pipeline. They took our hard work and threw it in the trash. The Tribe will be reviewing this decision closely, and determine how best to proceed in close consultation with our membership, staff, and advisors. Previous Updates: Dec. 4, 2017 Court Opinion on Conditions Today, Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, citing the recent Keystone oil spill in South Dakota, imposed several interim measures over the ongoing operation of the Dakota Access pipeline. The Court ordered three different measures, all of which were requested by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. First, the Court ordered the Corps and DAPL to work with the Tribes to complete oil spill response plans at Lake Oahe. Up to now, the Tribe has been kept in the dark about spill response planning and was not involved in the process of developing plans to address spills at Lake Oahe. The Tribe has to be involved in the selection of an auditor. Finally, DAPL must file regular reports on any incidents or repairs on the pipeline. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sued the Corps in July 2016, arguing that the pipeline destroyed sacred sites and threatens the water quality of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation that sits downstream of the site where the pipeline crosses the Missouri River in North Dakota. From the very beginning of our lawsuit, what we have wanted is for the threat this pipeline poses to the people of Standing Rock Indian reservation to be acknowledged. In a 28-page opinion, the court weighed two factors to determine whether or not the pipeline should be shut down. The court answered that question in the affirmative. Second, it assessed the disruptive consequences if the pipeline were shut down. However, the court found that the first factor was sufficient to rule against shutting down the pipeline. In its legal briefs, the Tribe had asked that if the pipeline were not shut down, then the court should impose additional measures to reduce the risk of oil spills to protect the Tribe. Because the district court case remains live, and the remand process is underway, this is not an appealable decision at this time. The Tribe intends to focus on the remand process and has a technical team of experts assisting it in providing input. The Corps has invited the Tribe to provide input into the remand, and that process is currently underway. The Corps has stated that process should be complete by April of next year. When Energy Transfer Partners proposed a new 1,200-mile oil pipeline from the Bakken oil fields to the Midwest, it chose a route crossing the Missouri River just yards upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Within days of his inauguration, however, Donald Trump ordered the permits granted. The Tribe filed a lawsuit to challenge this decision, but construction was completed while the case was proceeding. In June, just weeks after pipeline operations had begun, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled for the Tribe that the Army Corps had not complied with environmental review laws before issuing permits for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River. The court ordered separate briefing to assess whether the pipeline should be shut down while the remand process is going on. The decision on Oct. 11 addresses that question. Even Earlier Updates: Tribes Ask Court to Shut Down Pipeline The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, joined by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, filed an extensive legal brief on August 7, 2017, explaining why the pipeline must be shut down during the new environmental review process. The Tribes were supported by several amicus parties, including a group of Tribes and Tribal organizations, including the National Congress of American Indians, and a group of law professors and experts on the National Environmental Policy Act. Proposed amicus briefs were also filed by the North Dakota Petroleum Council and a coalition of industry groups. Additional resources: What the June 14 court ruling means and in-depth background on this litigation. In a 91-page decision, Judge James Boasberg ruled that the federal permits authorizing the pipeline to cross the Missouri River just upstream of the Standing Rock reservation, which were hastily issued by the Trump administration just days after the inauguration, violated the law in certain critical respects. Normally, when a federal agency violates the law by not looking at environmental risks well enough, the appropriate remedy is to invalidate the underlying permit. Without a permit, the pipeline cannot operate. Over the course of the summer, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe will be making our best arguments to the Court that the Judge should shut down the pipeline pending the completion of a lawful environmental review. Oil is expected to start flowing through the Dakota Access Pipeline today. The Judge still has the power to halt the pipeline. On behalf of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Earthjustice filed a motion for summary judgment on Feb. 14 on the major legal claims in the lawsuit filed against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to prevent the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe near tribal lands. All of the briefs in this case have now been filed. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is deeply concerned about the construction of the major crude-oil pipeline that passes through its ancestral lands. Our lawsuit raises three critical claims, and asks the court to throw out the federal approvals. These environmental reviews have been prepared for decisions as mundane as off-leash dog areas and allowing jet skis in parks. No one disputes that the Tribe has important Treaty rights that guarantee the integrity of its reservation. This means that the federal government and its agencies cannot take any federal action that harms the Standing Rock reservation or the water in the Missouri River on which the people of Standing Rock depend. The Obama administration made a carefully considered decision that these Treaty rights needed to be respected in connection with an oil pipeline immediately upstream of the reservation. The Trump administration ignored that advice, and acted as if the Tribe does not exist. And finally, there are limits on the extent to which one administration can reverse the decisions of its predecessor. While federal agencies can change their minds about matters of policy, the courts will set aside reversals that are not fully justified and explained. Additional details on the key merits of this case. Read an account from Earthjustice attorney Jan Hasselman on seeking the preliminary injunction, the Court's ruling on the request, and the remarkable announcement issued by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Justice and Interior. See: Standing With Standing Rock. In the key documents section of this FAQ. From The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Setting The Record Straight. The Tribe participated fully in the NEPA process. The Tribe sought to protect its rights when no one else would. In December 2016, the Corps correctly found that those issues needed further consideration through an EIS process. On his second full day in office, the Trump administration overruled the Corps and ordered the permits to be granted. See full document. Timeline of Events: July 27, 2016 The Tribe files a lawsuit in federal district court in Washington, D.C., where it was assigned to U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg. August 4, 2016 The Tribe asks the Court for a preliminary injunction since the pipeline is already under construction and would be finished before the case could be formally decided. August 24, 2016 Judge Boasberg holds a hearing on the motion in Washington, D.C. Over 500 people participated in an action outside the federal courthouse in support of the Tribe. The Judge indicated that he would rule in roughly two weeks. On Sept. 4, the Tribe files an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order to block the construction until a decision is reached on the injunction motion. Sept. 6, 2016 Judge Boasberg holds a hearing on the emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. The Judge issues a temporary restraining order for the pipeline corridor nearest the Missouri River but declines to halt construction on the portion of the pipeline route that had recently been identified as sacred tribal burial ground. Oct. 5, 2016 Oral arguments on the emergency motion for injunction are held at the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. A ruling was not issued, keeping the temporary halt to construction in place until the Court issues a decision. Both the appeal and the district court litigation will proceed, but the injunction covering work in the pipeline corridor has ceased. In the interim, the Army will not authorize constructing the Dakota Access Pipeline on Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe. Oct. 20, 2016 The Army Corps conducts a site visit to the area bulldozed over Labor Day to determine whether Dakota Access violated federal law by knowingly damaging a tribal sacred site. Under federal law, if Dakota Access is found to have knowingly damaged a historic or cultural resource with the intent of sidestepping the National Historic Preservation Act, the Corps cannot issue the easement. No determination has been finalized.

Since the start, various indigenous tribes and people across the US and further have joined the fight to oppose a multibillion dollar project that aims to see a pipeline carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. It will run under a lake that the Standing Rock Sioux use as a source of drinking water, meaning any potential leaks will contaminate it. At the symbolic center in Standing Rock, protesters aiming to halt construction continue to clash with police. Meanwhile the CEO of Dakota Access, the firm behind the pipeline who believe it will bring jobs and is a safer way to transport oil then rail, has maintained that it will be built and has now gone to a federal court to get a final permit so it can be completed. Bentel wants to give away these signs to as many protesters as possible and also show them how to make them in the face of what appears to be increasing violence against the protesters. There has been raiding and vandalization of personal property from camp, as well as vehicular aggression and brandishing of lethal weapons against unarmed and nonviolent groups on multiple occasions.

Bentel doesn't want to start fires but instead wants to use the mirrored signs as a disruptive technique. The signs, along with having slogans written on them, will focus and aim light. Bentel also believes they could be used to send non-electronic messages, heliograph-style, across the plains. Watch the video below to learn more about the project.

Please do your part today. This is viewer supported news. Please do your part today. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. Trump addressed reporters in the Oval Office on Friday morning. Republicans and the oil industry say the pipeline will create thousands of construction jobs and provide national energy security. However, environmentalists and scientists have long warned about the devastating impact of further fossil fuel extraction on a rapidly warming planet. On Friday, protesters gathered across from the Trump International Hotel in New York City and outside the White House in Washington, D.C. AMY GOODMAN: The pipeline is not yet a done deal. The company TransCanada still needs to secure funding, acquire local permits, stave off potential legal challenges. Bill, talk about this announcement that was made on Friday. It seemed as if, Bill, this was right at the time when Trump was going down over healthcare, was extremely angry and issued this unrelated executive order around the pipeline permit. BILL McKIBBEN: Yes, it was directly in between pretending to drive a big truck and losing on healthcare. And there are lots of people standing in their way. What it really underscores, Amy, is how much the world has changed in the six years since this fight began. The plan for the Keystone pipeline, which was bad then, is preposterous now. And the only good news is that the fight against Keystone has gone on to spur thousands of other battles with other fossil fuel projects all over the world. Look, the tar sands is not only a climate disaster. And the Trudeau government up in Canada is sort of operating in the shadow of the craziness of the Trump administration. He went down to Houston, couple of weeks ago, to speak to a bunch of oil men. I want to turn to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaking earlier this month. PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU: I said, on the very first trip to the oil patch back in 2012, no country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and just leave them there. Go ahead. Trudeau and Trump in collaboration in the tar sands is a really sick picture. The oil industry is in trouble, because demand is beginning to disappear. These things terrify the oil industry because they destroy demand. You remember, because you were there covering it, the big climate march in New York City. This is the D.C. version two years later. AMY GOODMAN: Well, Bill McKibben, we want to thank you for being with us. Bill McKibben is co-founder of 350.org, author of several books, including Eaarth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet.

Native Americans and activists from around the country have been at the camp for several months trying to halt the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The proposed 1,172-mile-long pipeline would transport oil from the North Dakota Bakken region through South Dakota, Iowa and into Illinois. The Dallas-based company levels charges that the groups are in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, which is typically used to prosecute crime syndicates, like the Mafia. Logging company Resolute Forest Products filed a similar suit against Greenpeace last year. They are apparently trying to market themselves as corporate mercenaries willing to abuse the legal system to silence legitimate advocacy work. This complaint repackages spurious allegations and legal claims made against Greenpeace by the Kasowitz firm on behalf of Resolute Forest Products in a lawsuit filed in May 2016. It is yet another classic Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP), not designed to seek justice, but to silence free speech through expensive, time-consuming litigation. ETP seeks compensatory, punitive and exemplary damages, as well as an injunction to prevent the defendants from waging campaigns against their projects. Consequently, they allege that the water protector movement at Cannonball was nothing more than a green group fundraising scheme, and not a sincere, tribal environmental movement. It could also intimidate these big green groups from partnering with grass roots people in environmental campaigns. is published by Race Forward, a national organization that advances racial justice through research, media and practice."}

In a short period of two days, the picture changed dramatically. But with the increased funds, Wood Jr. says, the group will be able to afford more equipment and supplies to aid them in their three-day mission, which will culminate in an attempt to break through the line of guards protecting the Dakota Access construction site. The Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which spans the border of North and South Dakota and is home to members of the Lakota and Dakota nations (known collectively as Sioux), has been the site of an increasingly tense standoff between law enforcement-backed security contractors and activists since July, when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approved a plan to build one of the final segments of the 1,170-mile Dakota Access Pipeline on land adjacent to the reservation, sparking a massive protest that has drawn activists from as far as Israel, Russia, and Japan. According to the Standing Rock Sioux, the planned route, which will cross beneath the Missouri River, will threaten their drinking water supply and destroy sacred sites and burial grounds located on land that the government stripped from the Sioux in the past. Veterans For Standing Rock is headed to the area at a time when the situation on the ground appears to be growing increasingly chaotic. On Nov. 20, a 10-hour standoff between demonstrators and the police resulted in 300 people injured, according to the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council. Previous claims of excessive police force recently prompted the United Nations to launch an investigation of potential human rights abuses. In addition to concussion grenades, security contractors and law enforcement have repelled activists, often numbering in the hundreds, with pepper-spray, fire hoses, batons, dogs, and rubber bullets. I am extremely happy to be stressed out right now, trying to make this as soon as possible. Of course, more boots on the ground means more opportunities for people to get hurt. So far, it appears that the most violent episodes of the standoff have occurred when the demonstrators confronted the guards in overwhelming numbers. Wood Jr. points out that the violent efforts by law enforcement to dislodge the protesters merely prove his point that they have abrogated their responsibility to protect and serve the public, acting instead on behalf of private corporate interests.

Just minutes earlier, she and the rest of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe learned that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers won't grant an easement that would have allowed construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) to cross under Lake Oahe on the Missouri River. Her joy is tangible, her infectious laugh punctuating every sentence. Klein asks her how she feels about the news. Then, she breaks down in tears. It's a short video, just over a minute long. Now, young Native American activists are looking ahead, focused on the very future Iron Eyes mentioned. While Sunday's victory is historic and certainly cause for celebration, Indigenous people have quickly called for continued vigilance, especially from young activists on social media. She says there's been an atmosphere of celebration as well as apprehension over the past few days, especially because they don't know what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Sunday's decision was made by the Obama administration, which will transition power to an administration that supports the completion of the pipeline project. But we must remain cautious, Trump is right next in line. And many activists and water protectors say the good news won't erase the reported human rights abuses that have taken place. While Reuters reported that Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, asked those who are not Sioux to leave the area for the winter on Tuesday, water protectors aren't planning to leave anytime soon. In March, when they heard about plans to reroute the Dakota Access Pipeline away from Bismarck and through sacred land, they took action. As part of the Standing Rock Youth, a group of about 30 young people from the Standing Rock Sioux community, they decided to go online, and make their issue known. By now, it has more than 460,000 signatures, including endorsements from celebrities and influencers like Leonardo DiCaprio, Shailene Woodley, Bill McKibben and Ndaba Mandela. And those are the very people they wanted to galvanize. Native American Kids Standing Up Against Big Oil Company. READ, SIGN & SHARE our petition. On July 15, the group also organized a 2,000-mile relay race to Washington, D.C. to deliver their petition. That same day, the camp received notice that construction on the pipeline would begin. Like the young people before her, Ladonna Brave Bull Allard grabbed her iPhone, made a video and posted it to Facebook. While Native-led news outlets, such as The Last Real Indians and Indian Country Today, have covered the pipeline and its threat of sacred land since the beginning, most mainstream news outlets didn't give the story attention until August. That's when thousands of water protectors and allies assembled to physically block construction, and when the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia heard the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's lawsuit. Since then, the movement's grown exponentially. When the situation at Standing Rock became especially tense in September, as North Dakota law enforcement unleashed dogs and pepper spray on water protectors, those at Standing Rock uploaded videos to Facebook and Twitter to show the rest of the world what was happening. In October, Native American activists and allies started using Facebook Live and other videos on the social network to further broadcast standoffs with police. She witnessed, in real-time, a police officer macing her little sister in the Youth Council with a large canister for an extended period of time. And they seemed pretty shaken by that. The tool, Wise says, has allowed large numbers of people to understand what's actually happening on the ground. Later that month, thousands of allies started checking in to the Standing Rock Reservation on Facebook, in an attempt to confuse police after rumors that they were monitoring the social network to keep track of water protectors. However, local law enforcement denied this, which meant the effort, while well-intentioned, didn't achieve what allies hoped. Dallas Goldtooth (Mdewakanton Dakota and Dine), an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, told Mashable in October that he felt the Facebook check-ins actually helped generate support. Beyond media attention, the impact of these social media campaigns is felt within Indigenous communities, too. Wise says the movement has very much been about the youth reclaiming their own power, especially since many elders may not live to see the true impact of their decisions. But it's also about showing the incredible solidarity across various Indigenous communities that have converged on Standing Rock, and the powerful moments they share. The wide sentiment among activists is that it's a temporary victory, especially as a Trump administration looms. That includes further honing their social media skills. Wise says one thing Indigenous youth and other water protectors have learned is to make hard copies of everything they post online. They've encountered instances in which Facebook has removed posts, or technical issues randomly shorten or delete posts. They're also learning how best to navigate Facebook's algorithm, working to make sure people can see what's happening in real-time and remain educated. The fight is NOT OVER. Let's kill the Black Snake. The Sacred Stone Camp released a series of 10 questions water protectors encourage everyone to ask in the coming days and weeks, including when the Army Corps will conduct an Environmental Impact Statement, and to what extent will there be tribal input. The Int'l Indigenous Youth Council on the banks of the Cannonball River, Sicangu Camp side, fighting for your right to clean agua. For now, water protectors at Standing Rock are standing firm, showing no signs of going anywhere and making sure their allies know the fight isn't over. I don't know. And that uncertainty is terrifying. But she also feels that the water protectors' prayers have gotten stronger. For the foreseeable future, they still will. youth used social media savvy to start the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline.

The electrification project is a way to bring immediate greenhouse gas emission benefits to a corridor that will eventually be served by high-speed rail. Using old diesel engines, Caltrain currently provides more than 60,000 daily trips between San Jose and San Francisco. Electrification would not only reduce emissions immediately but allow Caltrain to add more trains and boost service along this very busy corridor. The funds, in fact, are sought by the Caltrain Joint Powers Board, not by the High-Speed Rail Authority, and are aimed at improving Caltrain, not building high-speed rail. Streetsblog, among others, called him out on his mistake, but his article seems to have had its intended effect. Clearly the Republicans who wrote to Chao read at least that far. The grant agreement is currently under a 30-day review, which ends on February 18. If the DOT declines to approve it, the Caltrain electrification project may be dead for now. Our minimum wage increase has not only helped our poorest workers, it has boosted the economy while unemployment continues to drop. That said, the people of Fresno should be BEGGING for this train to bring 21st Century signs of life to that large he.. hole. And shame on their elected politicians to advocate otherwise. mmlowe Fresno is a very large Metropolitan area in need of some positive Economic growth. Greater Fresno is DISMAL. This defies logic. If they are successful Fresno gets to remain an isolated area flowing backward to NO where. The election is 18 months away. Focus on Denham of Modesto. He is the weakest. Used to be a Democratic seat. Actions have consequences. It amazes me how these 14 republicans can betray your own State. They all need to be voted out. But the whole point of debating policy issues is to at least try to arrive at sensible policies regardless of how we may differ on what that means. To me it makes sense for the Democrats in charge of California to dump a dumb, botched-from-the-beginning high-speed rail project and instead raise the money to electrify Caltrain, which I agree is a good idea. The end result of this will be potentially scrapping Caltrains electrification, which will have devastating impacts on the quality of life of everyone who rides Caltrain or breathes the air anywhere around the Caltrain corridore. The IER and proposals for Caltrain electrification do allow for future HSR, but they do stand on their own even if HSR never happens. Rob Anderson No. California should dump that and pay to electrify Caltrain instead. Marven Norman No, I just go on the website and read the documents. Marven Norman Yes, cap-and-trade is up in the air, but there are now Democratic supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature and even interests like the WSPA now are expressing interest in seeing the program continued, so I would be surprised if it is not ultimately reaffirmed. Ziggy Tomcich The push for electrfication should be focused on solving the health problems with breathing the 40 different carcinogenic gases those dirty old diesel locomotives spew out. All of us can smell that awful Caltrain stench long after a train left the station. Cumulatively those diesel locomotives are dirtier and more toxic than a coal driven power plant running up and down people back yards along the peninsula. The politicians that are opposing Caltrain electrification are only doing so because they want the people of the Bay Area to suffer both economically and physically for no reason other than their hatred towards us. The only argument against Caltrain electrification is ignorance and hatred. Rob Anderson The cap and trade legislation is being litigated and the legislature may not renew it. The project was fatally flawed from the start, since there was no guaranteed source of money to build the system. Flubert For HSR that is probably most true. This is all about CAHSR, which the rural areas hate, under the mistaken belief that they are actually the ones paying for it. Marven Norman So if the Feds withhold the money, it just spites Caltrain. So go ahead, cancel the Caltrain electrification. Marven Norman The initial operating segment is from Bakersfield to San Jose. Flubert Read the article. The two are related, Flubert All I know is that Hilary lost, and some folks are still struggling to understand that, let alone come to terms with it. Richard I wonder how much has been spent to date. The feds money is last in, first out and would need to be repaid. So if the CAHSR is killed, there probably wont be any more money coming from the state for pet projects like Caltrain and Metrolink improvements. Rob Anderson This may be the only issue that Republicans are right about. On the other hand, I think electrifying Caltrain is a good idea. But it should be done without high-speed rail money. Governor Brown should kill the high-speed rail project and instead get money for Caltrain. President Obama and the Democrats made a big mistake on the high-speed rail project, and I say that as a Democrat who voted for him twice. Richard In your fantasy world perhaps. Hillary won Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, Miami, Austin, and San Antonio. She lost the states, but won the cities. Marven Norman Well no, the stated effect is to harm CAHSR, but the actual effect will be to harm Caltrain. If they succeed at this, Caltrain is the only one that will lose out as the CAHSR business plan has an IOS through San Jose, not San Francisco. Dan Allison Caltrain is not a vast transit scheme, it is a successful system used by thousands. I do use Caltrain, and my observation says the end points are the most prominent. Flubert Republicans are typically more sceptical about vast transit schemes, and the risk that HSR is a multi-billion dollar boondoggle is non-zero. It had nothing to do with other states. The main point of the article is that by going after HSR with a blunt instrument, Republicans were harming Caltrain, which though it runs through suburban areas, is serving the urban areas at both ends, San Francisco and San Jose. Almost every major city in the South, Texas and Arizona voted for Trump, as did many mid-sized Mid-Western cities. And anyway, south of the 22nd Street station in SF, CalTrain stops are all in suburban areas. Erik Griswold Remember, the Republicans listed above are all about screwing over their own state. Like petulant toddlers, they will stew in their and others own poop just to make a point. They hate high-tech because of the globalization-realities that it entails. So screwing over the peninsula that houses it has an appeal to these luddites. The current HSR business plan calls for opening first to San Jose, so this has absolutely zero bearing on whether HSR will be able to start running on the IOS. It wouldn't require any transfers and it would save hours off the current trip, making it competitive with driving. Local officials are trying to adjust on the fly to salvage the project. If all goes according to plan, electric services will begin in 2020."}

But the poll also finds that support for the pipeline expansion has actually grown in B.C. since November, while opposition has slightly dropped. The support for the project grew by three per cent since the last Insights West poll on the issue was done in November 2017. Opposition declined by one per cent. But it has been suggested that Stewart himself has been actively encouraging public protests and civil disobedience. Activists and First Nations have warned of civil disobedience on the scale of the Clayoquot Sound War in the Woods of the 1990s, which resulted in 900 arrests, and more recent Standing Rock protests over the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota, which ended with the National Guard being brought in to dismantle a protest camp. He wanted some hard data to impress upon his fellow parliamentarians in Ottawa just how serious the situation could get. While Burnaby is expected to be ground zero in anti-pipeline protests, Stewart believes there could be protests elsewhere in B.C. as well, especially among First Nations who are in the pipeline corridor. According to Kinder Morgan Canada (TSX:KML), about 50 agreements have been signed with First Nations along the pipeline corridor. But even within those communities that have signed benefits agreements, there are likely to be small but ardent factions of First Nations who disagree with their leaders. Stewart said he would support pipeline expansions that went to Eastern Canada, but only if it were to supply Canadian refineries. He would not support pipelines intended to export Alberta oil, like the Energy East pipeline proposal. That proposal has since been scrapped by TransCanada Corporation (TSX:TRP), which is now focused on the resurrected Keystone XL pipeline expansion. Linkedin Created with Sketch.

Passed by the UN in 2007, UNDRIP is the most comprehensive document in the world when it comes to Indigenous cultural rights, nationhood and self-determination. In 46 comprehensive legal articles, the document basically means Indigenous peoples can and should live as Indigenous peoples. You read that right. UNDRIP means Indigenous peoples have legal rights to maintain cultures, identities and communities, and nothing should stand in their way. For Canada, UNDRIP is a game-changer. Adopting it, to begin with, means no more Indian Act. No more draconian financial and legal control of Indigenous communities by a stifling Indigenous and Northern Affairs Department. Indigenous languages legally recognized as founding languages in Canada. Viable Indigenous economies. Healthy Indigenous bodies. Success. UNDRIP covers it all. Canada would be legally responsible to focus on these areas comprehensively. Unsurprisingly, UNDRIP spends a great deal of time talking about land. Approximately one-third of the document describes about how Indigenous communities must have access to traditional territories and suitable land to live healthy and productive lives. I know, UNDRIP is a tall order. Then, it was completely shelved. But this has never dissuaded Saganash. A residential school survivor who helped craft UNDRIP in the early 2000s, Saganash proposed his bill in 2016 and spent more than two years insisting that Canada fully commit to the document. He called it his career goal. The vote was 206-79. It was met with cheers and a standing ovation. That is, except for the 79 Conservative MPs who voted against it. Two of them, one from Alberta and one from Saskatchewan, even high-fived when voting against. Now, I understand politics. They are desires without the weight of delivery. We are a plaything. A toy. Something to entertain. Something Canada uses for things such as an Olympic logo. Then, the game is over. An investment, even. When it comes to selfies or ornaments or crying, governments love Indigenous peoples. Canada needs more people like Romeo Saganash, people who believe in change. Because right now Canada is a game. One that Indigenous peoples are losing. Just look at the high-fives. Reconciliation is here. Niigaan Sinclair Columnist Niigaan Sinclair is Anishinaabe and is a columnist at the Winnipeg Free Press.

The large camp is estimated to contain more than 5,000 protesters living in a variety of shelters. TOM STROMME, TRIBUNE Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has set a deadline of Dec. 5 for those living in the Oceti Sakowin protest camp to vacate the corps-owned land. Anyone remaining after that date will be subject to trespassing charges. In an email sent Friday to Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II, Col. John Henderson, Omaha district commander, said the corps is establishing a free speech zone on the south side of the Cannonball River; but the main overflow camp on the north side must be disbanded. Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, said about 5,000 to 7,000 people are in the camp. That's a substantial increase since Sunday, when a confrontation between protesters and law enforcement led to many being treated for hypothermia after being sprayed with fire hoses. Others sought emergency hospital care, including a woman who suffered a serious arm injury and now is reportedly in satisfactory condition at a Minneapolis hospital. The tribe is in federal court, claiming the corps failed to follow federal law and properly consult the tribe amid concerns the 570,000-barrel capacity pipeline could break and pollute a primary source of drinking water. This is a stupid, foolish act by the corps. People in the camp are living without electricity or running water in an array of teepees, tents, yurts and other structures. Goldtooth said the eviction deadline is the day after more than 2,000 American war veterans are scheduled to arrive at the camp to stand in solidarity with Standing Rock. Henderson said the decision was necessary to protect the general public from confrontations between protesters and law enforcement, and to prevent death or serious injuries to the protesters. He said the Oceti Sakowin camp is also on land leased for grazing. The corps has been under pressure from state officials to move the protesters off its land.

Building great dangerous leaky pipelines to pump poison over water supplies, and to torment and abuse the people most affected by them, is not. The pipeline was ignoring all the environmental laws and the treaties; the state government was violating human rights. Nerd of Redhead, Dances OM Trolls says 4 December 2016 at 6:23 pm Sounds to me like the Army Corps of Engineers finally got off their duffs and looked at what they were supposed to do in the first place. Anything less than double-walled construction where a spill would endanger the water supply for even one person is caving in to the industry with a bad reputation.

Nerd of Redhead, Dances OM Trolls says 4 December 2016 at 7:02 pm Winter is coming. slithey tove (twas brillig (stevem)) says 4 December 2016 at 7:05 pm Roads, bridges, transmission lines, pipelines, wind farms and water lines will be very difficult, if not impossible, to build when criminal behavior is rewarded this way. You got it. Hypocrisy knows no bounds. jrkrideau says 4 December 2016 at 7:38 pm Congratulations to all those people defending the land at Standing Rock. Regulations, like the FDA cGMP, are the equivalent of Federal Laws, and can only be overturned if they follow the protocol in the USC. Which requires, per USC, public hearings, time for responses, etc. Takes months, if not years to greatly change it. What is Science, it works. Silver Fox says 4 December 2016 at 8:05 pm The original planned route for the pipeline was through Bismarck, a mostly white city, but it was deemed too dangerous so they decided to run it through Indian Country instead. They should go back to the original plan and see how those good, upstanding Republican voters think about that. Oh, and lets not forget the dogs, the truncheons, the rubber bullets, the gas. I can already hear the outrage on Fox News. Maybe build some new ones for Flint and countless other cities that need them. A Government, dealing with a huge project such as this, sometimes has to choose between a rock and a hard place (no pun intended) when making decisions. Real life sucks sometimes, deal with it. I am not deliberately being a dick, just pointing out reality. We are still an oil-based country in the US, so horrible choices will need to be made. yes you are. SC (Salty Current) says 4 December 2016 at 8:58 pm Congratulations and thank you to all of the protesters. If so, their participation will make it that much harder or the Army Corps to reverse it. The responses so far are beautiful. Ryan is so forward-looking. In 2012 and 2014, along with 2016. Stop spreading that damn lie. A big ass section of it went into land six miles from my house. unclefrogy says 4 December 2016 at 9:37 pm Real life sucks sometimes, deal with it. I am not deliberately being a dick, just pointing out reality. We are still an oil-based country in the US, so horrible choices will need to be made. absolutely agree with that. The problem is that is not what we they were attempting to do here. What they were doing here was finding the cheapest way to do it like always, cost the least and make the most money. Very few were involved in this for the greater good of society they were in for the sole motive of making the most money they could by delivering a valuable commodity to customers who will pay top dollar for it. They can get off the pedestal now and take the flag off their shoulders. Cheap is not the be all and end all if they can not build and operator a pipe lines that meets proper safety standards and make a profit that is tough. if they can not make money from the oil business without what is increasingly clear are unacceptable pollution levels and compliance is impossible that also is tough. Water Protectors, please. Not protestors. SC (Salty Current) says 4 December 2016 at 9:45 pm Apologies. Caine says 4 December 2016 at 9:48 pm In October, Mark Trahant pointed out that here in nDakota, making the switch to clean energy right now would boost the economy and bring permanent jobs to the state. ck, the Irate Lump says 4 December 2016 at 10:41 pm miles links wrote: Science, it works. What you linked was not science. Some highlights: From 1990 through 2012, 17 605 pipeline incidents were reported to the oil and gas regulator in Alberta at the time. 2012 saw 550 leaks and 17 ruptures, of which, 463 released hydrocarbon liquid or gas. The report brags that pipeline failures are down to a new low of 1.5 incidents per 1000km of pipeline, but the vast majority of the gains were from more reliable water pipelines which pose limited environmental risk when they leak or rupture. Go look it up and educate yourself. As of that date we became a net EXPORTER of petroleum products. At no time has any sane policy ever formally depended on tax base status. The actual taxpaying residents within Yellowstone or Grand Tetons or wherever are NEVER part of the decision process. Stop being a dick. This pipeline is a profit generation device that should never have been considered on merit. ESPECIALLY when it was relocated away from Bismarck. Stop being a dick and start learning stuff. Stop being part of dozens of millions of dicks who think crap that is false. Title sounded good. Title sounded good. Title sounded good. You did bad. Acknowledge your wrong, and learn from it. Nerd of Redhead, Dances OM Trolls says 5 December 2016 at 12:17 am And Miles, try this about pipelines versus other modes of transport. Fortune Magazine, hardly a bastion of green politics, talks about the potential problems. In 2010, a pipeline owned by Enbridge leaked 843,444 gallons of crude oil into wetlands around the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. The environmentalist Polaris Institute found that, according to Enbridge data, that company experienced 804 spills and released 5 million gallons of oil between 1999 and 2010. This spill is meaningful to me, since it occurred upstream from where I grew up in Battle Creek, MI, where it flows through the city from east to west. The Kalamazoo River flows west from Battle Creek, past Kalamazoo, and through south west Michigan, which has a lot of fruit orchards and grape vineyards. A large scale problem not just localized to a small area. The Wall Street Journal shows certain advantages to rail. PROS: Trains tend to spill a smaller amount of oil than other forms of transport. Rail transport can be speedier, too. It takes about five to seven days to move oil by train from North Dakota to the Gulf Coast or Atlantic Coast, the CRS says, versus about 40 days by pipeline. CONS: Rail accidents potentially threaten lives and can cause widespread property damage. As I recall from an oil and gas law symposium I attended, it is standard practice to have double-walled pipes reinforced with concrete. When I tried to leave messages at the North Dakota messaging service, the line was busy nine times out of 10. I hope the community up there will stay the course and not leave the camp quite yet. Avoid cities and head through sparsely populated areas. Sorry if that upsets the ghosts of a few religious lunatics. Ill maintained and supervised pipelines are, lousily designed pipelines add to the potential for disaster on an ill maintained, ill supervised pipeline. We had more pipelines than I can count in the area I grew up in, with leaks few and far between. Bankruptcy, forbidden. We do need to get a major fuel used for everything from lubricating machinery through fueling the literal engines of commerce, we do need to find superior alternatives as well. I prefer peace, but not at all costs, I long ago ran out of cheeks. Which only adds to my respect for you. I managed to not retch, but did get him off of the property and summon both EMS and law enforcement, who sent him to a good mental health care facility. Headed to bed now. the attitude that seems to be applied in these questions is it is about survival to build this pipe line. It is about the oil business it is the one that is fighting for survival they can see the righting on the wall it is going to change and the longer we struggle to keep oil cheap at all costs the longer it will take to the alternative to take over. It does nothing for us the citizens it just puts money in the pockets of the already rich oil business. These decisions are not long term decisions made with the success and prosperity of the country in mind they are short term decisions made at the behest and in favor to the oil business which will reap the profits. When oil finally goes away as our primary energy source because it is absofuckinglutely a finite source we can buy the new stuff from other countries who do not fancy putting all their eggs in one basket and are not controlled by the oil business. Rowan vet-tech says 5 December 2016 at 1:44 am Miles. Please stop showing us your asshole. Tethys says 5 December 2016 at 2:27 am I think a route well away from the river valley (and the water source for many ND people and others downstream) is far preferable to the stupidity of running it under the Missouri. The risk of destroying an entire watershed is unacceptable. Not building it at all is acceptable. Railroads could use some business if they would like to contribute to some domestic job growth. Then we are left with the treaty obligations and the rights and privileges recognized by The United States Constitution to all people. The Fraser Inititue will say whatever they are paid to say. The quality of their analysis often does rise to a Gr. 12 student level though. Any safety assurance by the pipeline company to Standing Rock probably should be considered a pius hope at best and complete lie more likely. My god. Yes, Indians engaged in warfare. They also practiced torture. They fought with each other over territory. On a few occasions, they committed atrocities against European settlers. People do bad things sometimes, and they are people. This cannot be used to justify generic slaughter and criminal maltreatment of any other people. The simple fact of the matter is that the people of Standing Rock are as deserving of lawful and humane treatment as any other people in the world, yet they are victims of historical and ongoing inequities against their group as a whole that deserve correction. Or maybe you do. Then get the fuck out of here. The Fraser Inititue will say whatever they are paid to say. The quality of their analysis often does rise to a Gr. 12 student level though. Indeed. Their report even owns up to the fact that pipelines spill a lot more than trains. But since the pipeline industry commissioned the report, they pushed hard on incident rates (which means nothing) and the fatality rate (lots more people killed directly by trains than by pipe). Regardless, it rather begs the question of whether we should be shipping the oil in the first place. Dunc says 5 December 2016 at 10:30 am Their report even owns up to the fact that pipelines spill a lot more than trains. But since the pipeline industry commissioned the report, they pushed hard on incident rates (which means nothing) and the fatality rate (lots more people killed directly by trains than by pipe). Stripping that one incident out changes the average number of injuries per billion ton-miles per year from 0.2594 to 0.0732, which is almost a factor of 4. It also give you a number which is a little over half that of natural gas pipelines (although still much higher than hazardous liquid pipelines). Title sounded good. Olav says 5 December 2016 at 1:23 pm From where I am sitting, half a world away, this does not look so much like a victory for the NODAPL movement. Sorry to have to say this but it looks more like a stay of execution. The outgoing administration does not want to be seen as the one that violently forced the pipeline to be completed, so it leaves that to the next. It looks like a rather cynical move. slithey tove (twas brillig (stevem)) says 5 December 2016 at 1:53 pm shit, let me butt in. Present Train Transport vs Pipeline transport, that way. numerobis says 5 December 2016 at 2:00 pm Leaks per mile and gallons per incident are shitty measures. Thank you. Lila wopila, Rietpluim. Present Train Transport vs Pipeline transport, that way. Even with the limits of per-incident reporting, 460 incidents of hydrocarbons (with a relatively even split between gas and liquid leaks) being released from a pipeline in one year from a single Canadian province should be concern enough. Maybe pipelines can be operated safely, but not at the cost businesses tend to be willing to operate them at. I agree. Anyone buffoon who says this should be ignored. I have had this accusation before, but sadly no, I am not a person from that place. Confused. chigau (ever-elliptical) says 5 December 2016 at 11:44 pm Liar. Tethys says 6 December 2016 at 12:12 am Confused. This word is true. The rest is simply extra foul bait, so I wrote a poem. Confused. This is a very serious point, made in completely good faith. Your words, as I read them, completely dismiss the arguments of NA Indians. Honestly, confused. John Morales says 6 December 2016 at 5:17 am miles links: A Government, dealing with a huge project such as this, sometimes has to choose between a rock and a hard place (no pun intended) when making decisions. Real life sucks sometimes, deal with it. I am not deliberately being a dick, just pointing out reality. Even were that true, what you describe is a Government which cares more for short-term profit than for the welfare of its constituents and of the environment. No need to argue hypothetically; they most certainly predated the European conquest. The more you post, the pyttier you sound, regardless of your protestations. Confused. The objections are present and pragmatic no less than they relate to breaches of promises (though they also breach a historical treaty). my back is sore must see a chiropractic Please do; you deserve that. Present Train Transport vs Pipeline transport, that way. On this measure, rail transport is significantly better (see, for example, U.S. Rail Transportation of Crude Oil: Background and Issues for Congress). For an example of some discussion of these issues, see Risk Assessment of Oil Spills to US Inland Waterways. Confused. No. Europeans killed Indians with warfare and disease, took over their land, and then promised the survivors that they could live on these scattered tracts of empty reservation land. Our ancestors committed genocide, but they stepped back from the brink of completely exterminating native residents of the land we took. To suggest there is parity between the actions of powerless Indians and powerful white American money interests is ignorant and offensive. not confused though the arguments are confused and not stupid or at least I am having a hard time believing he is stupid but I do not find it very hard to belief he is in fact thinking about this from a prejudicial frame of mind in fact he is showing signs of bigotry. giving the pipeline business and by extension the oil business all the benefit of the doubt and not considering any other out come than would not be a direct benefit for the energy business. He is acting and sounding to me like a shill for the pipeline business. I hope he is getting payed well. Nerd of Redhead, Dances OM Trolls says 13 December 2016 at 3:29 pm Prima facie evidence that the pipeline should not be built and run as designed. Creek in ND polluted due to a pipeline break. Roughly a third of the more than 3,000 barrels of oil that spilled into a North Dakota creek following a pipeline leak last week has been recovered, a local official said on Tuesday. An estimated 4,200 barrels of oil leaked from the Belle Fourche Pipeline on a hill just above the Ash Coulee Creek, and an estimated 3,100 barrels made it into the water, said Bill Seuss, a program manager for the North Dakota Department of Health. The leak was first reported to regulators on Dec. 5, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). The incident may serve as something of a rallying cry for groups opposing the pipeline, which have said a spill could enter important watersheds and contaminate water. The point of release into the Ash Coulee Creek is about 18 miles from where it feeds into the Little Missouri River, which then feeds the Missouri, a major drinking water source, Seuss said.

See Example( s ) EXAMPLES Collected via e-mail and Twitter, August 2016 I keep seeing posts on facebook about Native Americans trying to stop a pipeline in North Dakota. if true, this isn't right, senator. NDN country deserves better. WHAT'S FALSE Neither the state of North Dakota nor the federal Department of Homeland Security cut off the water supply to protesters, and the state provided aid and support to Native American protesters situated on a legal encampment. ORIGIN In mid-2016, protests grew in North Dakota over the planned construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which is planned to transport approximately 470,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Opponents of the pipeline held that it would pose a severe danger of contamination (via leakage) to the the only source of water for the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and would threaten historically significant tribal sites: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers accusing the federal agency of violating the National Historic Preservation Act and other laws after it issued final permits for a crude oil pipeline stretching from North Dakota to Illinois. The protests culminated in social media rumors holding that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) took punitive measures against Native American protesters, including removing tanks supplying drinking water to those demonstrating on tribal land near Cannon Ball. As tribal members from across the nation streamed into the campsite, swelling its population to between 2,000 and 4,000 people depending on estimates, the loss of their main drinking water supply came as a blow and sent local officials scrambling to find an alternative water source. She clarified that in no way, shape, or form was any water supply to the tribe cut off on 22 August 2016, or on any other date. Among mitigating factors described by Fong was the existence of at least two protest sites: one primary and legally sanctioned site established on tribal property, and a secondary protest site illegally situated on land held by the U.S. Army Corps. Fong said that NDDES supplied two water tanks to the protesters as a supportive measure after anticipating a large turnout, but the tanks were removed by NDDES when they were found to have been established at the second site, on which the state had no permission to store assets. Those tanks were not removed as a punitive measure, nor did they constitute the entirety of the water supply available to tribe members and demonstrators. Fong emphasized that the NDDES does not have the authority to carry out sanctions against persons engaged in lawful protest activity on tribal land. However, she told us that the connectivity problems stemmed from an influx of protesters to a remote location and stated that NDDES had worked with mobile carriers to enable media and social media coverage of the protests by establishing a repeater tower. Fong also said related rumors held that access to the site by persons attempting to provide maintenance to portable sanitary facilities had been restricted by the state, but she maintained that NDDES had investigated those rumors to ensure the facilities remained in adequate condition and learned that no maintenance personnel had attempted to pass through a checkpoint during the period of time in question. Moreover, local residents complained about the extralegal demonstrations and requested additional state involvement. With respect to lasers, Fong clarified that aerial surveying of the site by emergency management officials was twice disrupted by protesters using lasers, in one instance dangerously obstructing the sight of a pilot. It is a federal crime to aim a laser pointer at an aircraft under any circumstances. The NNDES summarized all these related issues themselves thusly: The ND Department of Emergency Services is a state agency that coordinates other state agency assets in response to emergencies, natural disasters, other types of incidents The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe began their protest on tribal land on April 1, 2016. The protest is located just south of the Cannonball River in southern North Dakota. This protest is comprised of Standing Rock tribal members, children, and elders. In August, Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman David Archambault put out a call for support and solidarity to the six other Lakota Sioux Tribes. Standing Rock Sioux are Hunkpapa. The six others are: Ogalala, Sicangu or Brule, Miniconjou, Sihasapa or Blackfoot (not to be confused with the separate Blackfoot tribe), Itazipacola, and Oohenupa. Supporters, non-indigenous and indigenous alike, have arrived from many other tribes from all across the country and Canada in support of the protests. They are protesting and camping without a permit which technically makes the protest illegal. They are cutting down trees for fires, they are driving vehicles over the land in an unorganized way and 3,000 people camping in that sort of space most surely is causing damage to government property. There have been several rumors that have circulated among the protestors: Blocking cell service, cutting off water supply, and not allowing porta potties to be emptied. Cell service: This agency has no authority to cut off cell service. In fact, we have worked with Verizon to place a repeater in the area to bolster cell service. I think the most likely reason for cell disruption is that this is a rural area with spotty cell service in the best of times. Three thousand people, all of whom are trying to live stream and post on social media are simply tapping out the resource. What we did do was remove some state health department assets (water truck, command trailers) that were intended to be used in support of Standing Rock Tribal Emergency Management. So basically what this amounted to was state assets being used to support an unlawful protest. It was completely untenable and an inappropriate use of state equipment. By the way, we have left an ambulance in the care and control of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to bolster their ability to deal with medical emergencies in the area. has long been engaged in the battle against misinformation, an effort we could not sustain without the support of our readers.

Please allow me to tell you a little bit about myself. On December 8, 1986 I took my own Oath of Enlistment at the Jacksonville, FL MEPS Center. In 1994 I went onto active reserve status with a unit out of Charleston, AFB where I continued my proud military service until December of 1999, when my then husband was assigned to Japan. At that time I was placed back on inactive reserve status until such time as my reserve enlistment came to an honorable end during our tour of duty in Japan. All total, I have 12 years of combined honorable service in the United States Air Force. Which is why I feel compelled to write to you. As Adjutant General of the North Dakota National Guard, you are essentially its commander. In this capacity, you are ultimately responsible for the actions and behaviors of each and every member of the North Dakota National Guard while he or she is on active duty. This must certainly be a rather tremendous responsibility for you. Similar to how the President of the United States is Commander in Chief of the Army during times of war, the Governor of North Dakota is Commander in Chief of the ND National Guard at such times that he has declared a State of Emergency, and then subsequently called it into active service. Now that Governor Dalrymple has taken such actions, it would seem to me that you are now beholden to answer to him. Yet, there is something that has been bothering me since the National Guard in North Dakota was initially pressed into service along the highways leading to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and the various camps nearby. At first it appeared that the Guardsmen were only performing highway checkpoint operations. While this may seem innocuous enough on the surface, these same Guardsmen were seen in various videos to be working in tandem with local law enforcement personnel. The law enforcement officers were seen questioning drivers and passengers, taking photographs of same, as well as photographs of license plates and the contents of the vehicles. To put it succinctly, they were violating the Fourth Amendment of individuals, meaning that your personnel were violating the Constitution by association. This brings me to recent events. While highway checkpoints one and two months ago are bad enough, just this week we have a contingency of law enforcement officers from Morton County, and at least seven other State jurisdictions, move in to set up a forward operation base very near the new camp. Your National Guard personnel arevwith this law enforcement contingency. I know that you know that hooding is against international law. demonstrates that you are no neophyte in the Army. While I was enlisted, one thing that was impressed upon me and my fellow Airmen was the rather important duty of following orders. However, a very important caveat to this was that all orders must be lawful. As such, it was equally important that we were duty bound to NOT follow unlawful orders. Yes, it can be difficult and potentially career ending to defy an unlawful order. Sir, with all due respect to you, I suggest that you are following unlawful and Unconstitutional orders from Governor Dalrymple. Major General Dohrmann, I beg you to reflect upon your Oath of Office. Please defy the unlawful and Unconstitutional orders from Governor Dalrymple and pull your Guardsmen out of the Standing Rock arena. If not, at the very least place them along the lines of the land under the care, custody and control of the Army Corps of Engineers to assure the Lakota Nation and the United States that Dakota Access LLC will NOT be allowed to drill under Lake Oahe until such time as further review and negotiations with all tribal leaders has been completed.

Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement.

We know that President Elect Trump has a serious conflict of interest by owning large investments in DAPL and other fossil fuel assets; and his energy team includes Harold Hamm, billionaire founder of Continental Resources oil company, and someone Mr. Trump might name as his Secretary of Energy. Mr. Trump and the Koch brothers said they support extractive exploitation of public lands and National Parks. After suffering centuries of persecution and exploitation, Native Americans deserve justice. This land belonged to the Standing Rock Sioux Nation Rez before it was taken back. President Elect Trump has stated he will quickly approve the Dakota Access pipeline and also reverse President Obama's decision to deny approval of Keystone XL pipeline. We have an enormous glut of oil reserves at Cushing, Oklahoma. The clear purpose of Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines is not to make America energy independent but to reap enormous profits for greedy oil interests exporting oil to China. We must protect our environment and our oil resources. This outdated fossil fuel infrastructure is not needed and railroads serving the Bakkan North Dakota oil fields have invested heavily in improved railroad oil tank car safety and have stated that they have more than enough railroad capacity to transport the Bakkan oil. They will also be able to permanently rehire thousands of laid off North Dakota railroad workers. America must finally honor the first Americans and our first environmentalists by stopping Dakota Access. Thank you for standing on the right side of history. read Operations Order.

Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of CREDO activists who stood with our indigenous and climate movement allies in North Dakota, we temporarily blocked construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, but our fight to stop the pipeline once and for all is not yet over. But we have the collective financial power as consumers and account holders to stop the pipeline. We must call on these banks to divest from this massive project immediately before Trump can approve the construction of the pipeline. Tell the 17 DAPL banks: Stop financing the Dakota Access Pipeline. As of Jan. 1, ETP has effectively failed to meet its contractual obligations to deliver oil through the Dakota Access pipeline. Coupled with declining global oil prices, massive public pressure on the banks financing construction of the pipeline could create a public relations nightmare that persuades the banks to end their investments in the pipeline. By staying invested in these projects, these 17 banks are tacitly waging a coordinated campaign to destroy sacred Native lands and silence peaceful protest. This could be our last shot at stopping the Dakota Access pipeline before Donald Trump takes office on January 20. We stood with the water protectors and our allies in the climate justice movement to put a halt to the pipeline once before, and we must stand with them again to shut this project down for good. Tell the 17 DAPL banks: Stop financing the Dakota Access pipeline. Thanks for all you do."}

He also says energy security must be driven by regulations that reduce the ability of any single supplier to exert monopoly control. He insists the EU is right to call for amendments to EU directives to ensure there is a level playing field between gas connectors, a change that would require Germany to allow non-Russian gas to use the pipelines. Although Johnson in his letter does not specifically call for the pipeline to be halted, he says the UK stands firm in its support for Ukraine on the issue. Nord Stream 2 is due to be completed in 2019 and will run through the Baltic Sea to Germany. Germany says the pipeline is necessary to fill an energy gap left by the phasing out of its nuclear plants, and the projected decline in supply from Norway and the Netherlands, as their reserves wane. The issue is starting to dominate major bilateral discussions in Europe, including a summit last Friday in Sochi between the German chancellor and Vladimir Putin. Merkel has been urging the Russian president to guarantee the Ukraine pipeline will still be used, alongside Nord Stream, but he has said that will only happen if it is economically justified. The US pressure stems in part from genuine concern at a Russian stranglehold on EU energy needs, but Germany has viewed the US involvement as a self-interested commercial intervention designed to increase its liquid gas sales to the European market. The UK, preoccupied by Brexit, has until now tried to keep a low profile on Nord Stream even though its closest natural allies in Europe, the Baltic states, Poland, Hungary and the Ukraine, all fiercely oppose the pipeline on current terms. Commentators in Russian newspapers such as Pravda this week confidently claimed that UK energy needs would become the anvil on which British opposition to Russia collapses. There also fears among Euro-sceptics that the Foreign Office has been holding back from condemning Nord Stream because the UK government does not want to alienate Germany at a sensitive moment in the Brexit talks. But the new pipeline is not a done deal, with opposition growing across Europe, including among MEPs. The US injected a fresh element into the discussion when Sandra Oudkirk, its deputy assistant secretary of state for energy diplomacy, said the US feared the pipeline would allow Moscow to place new listening and monitoring technology in the Baltic Sea. She said Congress had given the US president new powers to impose sanctions against a variety of Russian pipeline projects. Germany is looking for a deal that somehow keeps Kiev as a supplier, believing this could normalise relations between Ukraine, Russia and Germany."}

The teams setting up the various agencies and writing their agendas are dominated by top operatives from anti-worker corporations and from the same Wall Streeters whose casino-style speculation crashed our economy in 2007 and crushed the middle class. Now they are on the inside, deciding who will fill more than 4,000 executive positions and run our government. The room was filled with moneyed elites, such as Paul Singer, the hedge-fund billionaire and extremist laissez-faire ideologue. These are not people who are going to finance any sort of working-class populism; they instead intend to use The Donald's victory to impose a plutocracy over America. Pay-to-play is already in full effect, and Trump hasn't even spent his first day in office. His inauguration is just another opportunity for the plutocrats to buy their way into Donnie's favor. Of course, Trump had to bring in one of his longtime pals to help him plan such an elite affair. Few Americans have ever heard of Tom Barrack, but he's going to be a big, behind-the-scenes player in Trump's Washington. Indeed, Barrack's literally in charge of parading The Donald into the White House. He chairs the presidential inaugural committee, overseeing everything from numerous balls to the swearing-in.

Barrack is a speculator who runs a myriad of Wall Street funds, real estate ventures, luxury resorts and casinos.

The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAP), a project of Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, a private enterprise, has an estimated cost of 3.78 billion dollars and an extension of 1,172 miles. It would transport approximately half a million barrels per day of fracked crude oil from the Bakken shale fields in northwest North Dakota, to a refinery near Chicago, Illinois. The affected indigenous communities have fought the pipeline through the courts, so far unsuccessfully, and, for about 8 months, by non-violent protest. During the past few months, the movement has been joined by representatives of more than 100 Native American and Canadian tribes, as well as by people from the country at large. The implementation of the Dakota Access Pipeline Project has already led to police violence. Arbitrary arrests and intimidation of detainees by strip searches and incarceration have become frequent. The indigenous tribes involved see the pipeline itself as a violation of the human rights of original peoples to protect their territories, cemeteries and sacred sites as well as their right to clean water that would possibly be contaminated by pipeline leaks. The DAP project violates international treaties, signed by the United States, which stipulate the rights of indigenous peoples to their territories and to previous informed consent to projects that affect these territories. For the Sioux and other affected tribes, this project represents one more egregious violation of the historical treaties with the U.S. government that have been abrogated in the interest of private ventures. We, the indigenous peoples and campesinos of Mexico are suffering the same menace from government-supported megaprojects in the form of hydroelectric dams, contamination of our native corn varieties, open pit mining projects, and wind farms, which threaten to take over our legally-held lands and natural resources. In the face of these current political realities, we extend a call to create bonds of unity between indigenous peoples, activists, networks and movements of international solidarity among all peoples who resist this economic model and its megaprojects, with a view to guaranteeing respect for the human rights of the defenders of water and earth, and to upholding the rights of original peoples. We manifest our categorical rejection of the violent acts of harassment and repression provoked by the imposition of the Dakota Access Pipeline. We manifest ourselves in favor of the lives and well-being of the Native Peoples of the American continents, as well as of the rights of original peoples to conserve our water, our forests, our mountains and plains, and our spiritual relationship with the land. We stand in solidarity with the Sioux Nation of Standing Rock in its defense of its territory, water, and cultural identity.

The heightened awareness of the Dakota Access Pipeline draws attention to other pipeline projects throughout the United States. Across the country right now, over 20 proposed pipelines would run through indigenous land and endanger water sources, including wetlands and aquifers. Then, when spills happen, energy companies responsible for the pipelines may not take full responsibility for cause or cleanup. Here are six controversial pipeline projects to keep an eye on. Line 3 in Minnesota One of the largest inland oil spills in U.S. history happened along the Line 3 oil pipeline when it spilled 1.7 million gallons of crude oil near Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 1991 . Built between 1962 and 1967, this corroded pipeline is over five decades old and pumps 390,000 barrels of oil per day. Now, Canadian company Enbridge Energy plans to build a new pipeline to replace its old Line 3 oil pipeline, which would transport oil across northern Minnesota to Superior, Wisconsin, including through Ojibwe treaty territory. However, activists are organizing to persuade Minnesota officials to deny the permit for the pipeline and stop the project. The White Earth Nation, Red Lake Nation, Leech Lake Band, and Fond du Lac Ojibwe Band have been joined by activist groups to participate in public meetings about the pipeline. The company decided to reroute the pipeline around a wild rice lake used by tribes after the White Earth Nation voiced their concerns , but activists still say the pipeline poses a high risk for water pollution, as does the company's plan to leave the old, deteriorating pipeline in place even after the new one is constructed. More public hearings in front of an administrative law judge will take place in the fall , and the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission will make a final decision next April. If approved, the pipeline could operate by the end of 2019 and could carry up to 760,000 barrels of oil a day . Keystone XL in Nebraska, South Dakota, and Montana This project was previously blocked in 2015 by the Obama administration, but the Trump administration gave the green light to the Keystone XL by signing an executive order for its construction in January. Keystone XL still has a major obstacle though: Nebraska. The Keystone Pipeline runs from Canada to Texas, but Nebraska has yet to approve the proposed extension route of the Keystone XL, which would go through Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska. Protests, including a campaign to build solar panels in the pipeline's path, called Solar XL , have already emerged. This pipeline route would carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day. The State Department estimated that the project will lead to tens of thousands of temporary positions, but just 50 permanent jobs . Pilgrim Pipeline in New Jersey and New York The Ramapough Lenape Nation have been leading the fight against the Pilgrim Pipelines, a 178-mile pipeline that would run from Albany, New York, to Linden, New Jersey. Activists are concerned that the pipeline would contaminate drinking water, especially since the pipelines will be built along a fault line, which can increase risks for leaks. Last year, tribes started setting up teepees to protest the pipeline. So far, 28 towns have passed resolutions opposing the pipeline, and a Municipal Pipeline Group has formed to fight the pipeline and develop strategies, according to NorthJersey.com. Currently, the pipeline does not have a construction time frame because the company is working on finalizing the route and obtaining permits. This 713-mile pipeline is set to carry gas from West Virginia, western Pennsylvania, and eastern Ohio to Michigan, has already caused seven spills totaling over 50,000 barrels, including in wetlands. Right now, the pipeline is under fire with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. In April, the Ohio EPA found 2,500 square feet of wetlands filled with drilling fluid . Later that month, work crews found that fluid had settled on 500,000 acres of wetland . This fluid contains traces of toxic diesel fuel . A federal energy regulator has launched a public investigation on the pipeline, which may delay its planned completion on November 1. Part of the pipeline was supposed to open this month, but work has been stalled. Much of the construction takes place through farmland, causing residents to protest . On July 10, the Ohio EPA issued an order to Energy Partners to take numerous steps for protecting the environment. About 300 people showed up to their chapel dedication on July 9. Nuns from the Adorers of the Blood of Christ own a strip of land where the pipeline is supposed to run, and they say that the pipeline violates their values about the environment . This 183-mile pipeline would span across 10 counties in Pennsylvania. Forty organizations have urged the governor and the state Department of Environmental Protection to deny two environmental permits needed for the pipeline to be built. This 163-mile pipeline would carry up to 480,000 barrels of oil a day. Permits through the state Department of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are still pending .

My colleague Thomas Feyer, who oversees the letters to the editor, says the influx from readers is one of the largest since Sept. 11. Readers are also taking to the comments section of Times articles to talk about it, says the community editor, Bassey Etim. Others are calling into customer care at multiple times the usual rate. They have a variety of concerns, including the election coverage. Last week, President-elect Donald J. Trump jumped in, tweeting that The Times had lost thousands of subscribers since the election. The paper says quite the opposite is the case: It reports having the largest one-week subscription increase since the first week of the digital pay model, in 2011. I assume that The Times has more accurate data than Trump. Because from my conversations with readers, and from the emails that have come into my office, I can tell you there is a searing level of dissatisfaction out there with many aspects of the coverage. Readers complain heatedly and repeatedly about the forecasting odometer from The Upshot that was anchored on the home page and predicted that Hillary Clinton had an 80 percent chance or better of winning. And they complain about the liberal tint The Times applies to its coverage, without awareness that it does. But the media is at fault too, for turning his remarks into a grim caricature that it applied to those who backed him. What struck me is how many liberal voters I spoke with felt so, too. They were Clinton backers, but, they want a news source that fairly covers people across the spectrum. The national desk of The Times has correspondents around the country, and they filed a steady stream of compelling stories from voters between coastal America. And yet between the horse race and the campaign drama, much of their work was simply drowned out. That left many of the readers I spoke with feeling like The Times was a swirl of like-mindedness. Still, too many of the voices, of both the regular columnists and even guest writers, are from people with similar views. Judy Barlas of Silver Spring, Md., raises a different issue. She supported Bernie Sanders in the primary. But she told me she saw evidence early on that The Times believed Clinton would win the nomination and kept pushing that scenario. It anticipated an outcome, and it stuck with it. I suspect that gesture soothed some readers, but many others were expecting more of an apology. And some were repelled by what they described as a self-congratulatory tone and what several viewed as a lack of sincerity.

We shall not abandon our defense of our Earth Mother and protection of our precious waters. By Chili Yazzie Censored News (Sat. Dec. 3, 2016) Dine' Warriors for Standing Update: our Warriors are on the way, they left late, one of the drivers got lost on the Rez, ydl. After a ceremony to send them on their way with good blessings by the Rez wide NAC members who just happen to be meeting here, we are all feeling strong and proud. They will not get into Denver until 9-10 pm. They will have late supper and a rest break at Hillcrest Christian Church, 3000 S. Race St., Denver. Area relatives come out and greet them. There is room on the bus. So if you have the time and commitment, pack some warm clothes and join our Warriors. It's been good. I'm feeling tired but happy. And oh yeah, a large bald eagle visited us at Shiprock Chapter to see off the Warriors. Dark forces intervened and halted plans for Navajo Veterans to charter a plane to Standing Rock. Navajo Veterans will come by bus, leaving Saturday morning, and invite others to join the caravan for a water protectors caravan. I want to thank Beverly Maxwell, Angie Barney-Nez, Eunice Begay, Redawn George, Anthony Aspaas, Anderson Tullie, Ray Daw and others for recruiting Vets to go and figuring out the logistics. It was not easy and we put our best effort to it in spite of the missed communication, miscommunication, limited networking and governmental restrictions. But we were able to bring together a strong and proud group that will represent us well at Standing Rock. Everyone who is going including the vehicles that will follow the buses will leave Shiprock after briefings and prayers, departure time is 11:00 this morning. The route will be over Wolf Creek Pass and onto Denver where the group will have supper at the Hillcrest Christian Church. The roads all the way should be good and the plan is to get to Cannonball by Sunday afternoon. Even with our hectic efforts to fill the buses, we still have room and the invitation is open to all who want to go, you can get on the bus and we will work out the details in Shiprock. The lead persons for the buses are Beverly Maxwell and Anthony Aspaas, you can call Anthony at 505.860.0742 for questions. Standing Rock Camp at night. Photo by John Heminger. As of noon yesterday we were ready to fly first-class, by 3:00 that came crashing down. My contact from the Veterans Stand for Standing Rock group called and said the plane deal fell through. For some moments my world unraveled then I started giving it some analysis. My thought is that some dark force put the screw to the plane company; perhaps there is a corporate relationship between the plane company and the dark forces pushing the pipeline. That may or may not be case but that is fine, they can have their damn plane. You also have to think, why should we be flying first class when the relatives are living in bitter cold up there. Shortly after the devastating phone call I got another call from Ari with the National Nurses United and after talking with her awhile it became apparent that they were the ones who were paying for the plane. We worked it out to have the funds transferred to a local 501c3 who will channel the funds for us to pay for buses and whatever else we need for the trip. So we are regrouping and we will lease 3 buses instead of 2. Thinking it through, the buses are a better way for us to get there; we travel on our own terms, no unnecessary restrictions and we can pack mutton and blue bird flour. We will take as many Veterans as we can and open up the rest of the seats to non-Vets. This is also a call-out to all Water Protectors to join up with their vehicles and make it a real caravan. I say we are blessed because we are true to our Earth Mother. We will leave Saturday morning, the beauty of the buses is we can have one run to Window Rock, Chinle and Mexican Water and another can run from Albuquerque to Gallup to Shiprock to pick up people. I will post a new update at noon today with the schedule, pickup stops, travel routes, etc. The caravan will get to Denver by supper time, ideally to be received by family in the area to provide food and a place to rest for a couple hours. Denver area relatives, can you pull that together. We will continue into the night up 85 and then east on 94. Anyone who can help accommodate the caravan along the way and advise on road conditions, please inbox Redawn George. We will roll into Cannonball Sunday afternoon to rest up at the Cannonball Community Center. We will be ready for some strong days of prayer, camaraderie and Solidarity with our Standing Rock family. U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, herself a decorated veteran, will be joining with the Veterans Stand for Standing Rock mobilization to support the protectors and help raise public attention to the growing human rights emergency that has emerged at the protest site in the face of increased attacks. The NNU donation will assist a delegation of Navajo veterans from Arizona and New Mexico who will join the veterans gathering this weekend. Concurrently, NNU is dispatching its third delegation of RN volunteers Saturday to stand in solidarity with the water protectors and their supporters. One protester, 21-year-old Sophia Wilansky, has faced the loss of an arm after being hit with a police concussion grenade, according to the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council. NNU volunteers will also be on hand this coming weekend. Why must we continue to put our human waste(poop, urine, etc), into the very element we are wanting to protect.

Take a comfortable bus. I have been funding my own trips to Standing Rock even though I struggle financially. This is a sacrifice we make and I hate when some groups think they can get first class travel and as a veteran, I find this selfish. I am an elder and yet I feel obligated not to milk limited funds. If they could give me some gas money, fine, but I don't expect first class travel. Cripes.

Considering how much money the US government and the private company that is installing the pipeline Have spent trying to take what is not theirs to have, they could've spent it rerouting it to the alternate version which would have taken the pipeline away from the water supply and the burial ground. But no, nobody thought about that. That would be too easy. So it was rerouted to go through where it is now, and ruining drinking water for 18 million ppl down the Missouri river, to the Mississippi, to the Gulf. Wakonda works things for the good and takes care of us, so if the bus is how He wants it done, so be it. The water protectors and veterans are prayed up daily, and taking the bus worked out for the better. Best wishes from australia. Our elders come with their own personal challenges.

Sunoco, which merged with ETP, is included in the report's analysis. The new report finds that ETP's pipelines have a somewhat higher-than-average rate of problems.

If these pipelines are constructed, fracking will increase, and our communities and waterways will be irreparably harmed, and climate-disrupting methane pollution will increase at a time when we urgently need to act to stop the worst impacts of climate change. And if the utilities and pipeline companies have their way, consumers will end up footing the bill despite more fracked gas pipelines being unnecessary and unjustified. State agencies are responding to overwhelming public pressure and starting to get involved to protect waterways from the impacts of pipelines. The attempt to lock us into another generation of relying on fossil fuels is being met with resistance at every turn. In the past few weeks, we've had great news on multiple fights against fracked gas pipelines, including: Sabal Trail Pipeline On Aug. 22, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) attempts to downplay the massive climate impacts of the Southeast Market Pipelines Project, including the 515-mile Sabal Trail pipeline that runs through Alabama and Georgia to feed gas plants in Florida. FERC is charged with evaluating whether or not a gas pipeline is needed and is required to ensure a thorough environmental review is done before they decide whether the pipeline should be built at all. Because FERC's environmental review ignored these climate impacts, the court struck down FERC's approval of the pipeline. We are already seeing the ripple effects of this victory and expect this decision to have long-ranging impacts as other proposed pipelines must be reviewed for their climate impacts. You can read more about the Sabal Trail court decision in this blog. Constitution Pipeline Even though FERC is the lead federal regulator of pipelines, states also have robust regulatory powers. For example, they can protect their waterways during the construction of a pipeline. Under section 401 of the Clean Water Act, pipeline companies need each state to certify that state water quality standards will not be violated before construction can start. In the case of the Constitution pipeline in New York, the company failed to provide the information requested by the NY Department of Environmental Conservation (NY DEC) as it evaluated the water impacts. Constitution then took New York to court. In mid-August, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Constitution Pipeline Company's case against NY DEC, upholding the state's authority to exercise oversight over water quality permits for major projects. The decision describes in detail DEC's repeated requests for site-specific information about stream crossings, and the pipeline company's failure to provide it. The ruling on Constitution reinforced that regardless of how much money corporate polluters may spend on influence and attorneys, they can never speak louder than the people who want to protect their homes, their communities, and their clean water from dirty and dangerous projects. Affirming the State's right to reject pipeline projects will have long-lasting impacts and could bolster efforts by other states to defend their water quality standards against pipeline companies. Valley Lateral In another big decision out of New York, NY DEC recently denied a necessary permit to the Valley Lateral project, a fracked gas pipeline slated to go to a new power plant owned by Competitive Power Ventures in Orange County, NY. DEC cited our recent win in the Sabal Trail case, where the court decided thatFERC did not sufficiently consider the climate impacts of these pipelines before approving them. DEC concluded FERC's environmental review of the Valley Lateral project had similar flaws and was therefore incomplete, prohibiting construction of the project. This denial is particularly important because the Lateral would feed into the Competitive Power Ventures (CPV) power plant that would be fueled by fracked gas from Pennsylvania and emit 7 million tons of carbon-dioxide-equivalent pollution annually. The utility was banking on the approval of the Lateral, and started to construct the plant at its own risk before securing the necessary permits. New York's denial of one of those permits signals to utilities and pipeline companies the problems and risks with following CPV's rushed approach. Mountain Valley Late last week, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WV DEP) announced its intention to reconsider its previously issued water quality certificate for the Mountain Valley Pipeline. DEP's decision was the result of a legal challenge by the Appalachian Mountain Advocates, representing the Sierra Club and our partners in asserting that WV DEP did not adequately review the potential for the pipeline to harm streams, and came before the state had to defend its issuance of the 401 water quality certification in federal court. The Mountain Valley Pipeline would run about 300 miles from Northwestern West Virginia to Southern Virginia and has faced legal battles that include a coalition of landowners challenging the use of eminent domain. This could mean a significant delay for the MVP while the state goes back to the drawing board to evaluate the water quality impacts, and is another exciting development for advocates defending our water and climate from the impacts of fracked gas pipelines. All of these significant, precedent-setting steps toward victory in the past few weeks spell trouble for the pipelines. No longer will these projects be seen as foregone conclusions as soon as they're proposed. Now, the people are being given back the platform they deserve to stand on as we work to protect our communities from the pipeline companies rush to make profits at the expense of our air, water, health and climate. FERC will have its first meeting in months on Sept. 20. Thus far, the agency has served as nothing more than a rubber stamp for gas projects, and we expect that it will try to rush forward approvals for fracked gas pipelines. But we aren't going away. Burning more fracked gas spells game over for our planet, which is why the Sierra Club and communities across the country continue to band together to push back and build a powerful movement to challenge dirty fuel infrastructure. The scorecard shows that 140 House members voted against chemical safeguards every time, while 149 members consistently voted for chemical safety protections. However, the action fund praised the lawmakers that bucked their party to vote for chemical safety, including Reps. voted for funding chemical reviews and against a farm bill that included pesticide safety loopholes. Florida Reps. A Preview of the People, Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule, two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Updated and reissued every five years, these guidelines are the nation's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations. supply. These nominees will be well-known in their fields, and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers, academics and practitioners. part of the process is happening in real time. what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors. Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff, and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally. Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries. And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle. Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance, including the meat industry, dairy industry, and sugar-sweetened beverage associations, as well as formula companies, which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers.

But it probably won't be the last, especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year. Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets. If you believe your pet may have been exposed, be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, diarrhea or vomiting. And as climate change gets worse, the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks, creating a toxic feedback loop. The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish. Communities that struggle with regular, serious toxic algae outbreaks, like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie, can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation. The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth. The women were all non-smokers, had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies. Macrophages, which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body, protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles, such as bacteria and pollution particles. The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants. That's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA's Office of Inspector General (OIG), the agency's internal watchdog. EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement, and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency.

The 232-mile pipeline carries carbon dioxide to oil fields in Wyoming and Montana for use in enhanced oil recovery. File, Star-Tribune Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save An energy company is seeking federal approval to build a pipeline in eastern Montana that would transport the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide for use in oil production along the North Dakota border. Carbon dioxide is considered a prime contributor to climate change, but it also can be used to breathe life into old oil fields. Companies pump the gas deep underground to push out more oil from tapped-out reserves. Cedar Creek Anticline has potential reserves of 260 million to 290 million barrels of oil, Mayer said. Denbury, based in Plano, Texas, specializes in using carbon dioxide for oil recovery with projects completed or pending in Texas, Alabama, Wyoming, Mississippi and Louisiana. A second Denbury pipeline proposal would link the Shute Creek site to an existing pipeline network that extends into Montana. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management is seeking public comment on the Montana proposal through Nov. 3. Denbury has not released a construction timeline or specifics on the volume of carbon dioxide that would be transported. Stop watching this discussion.

In Syria, for example, foreign powers have sunk the nation into a nightmare combination of civil war, foreign invasion and terrorism. Other Syrians fleeing the chaos at home have turned to neighboring Arab Muslim countries. Jordan alone has absorbed over half a million Syrian refugees; Lebanon has accepted nearly 1.5 million; and Iraq and Egypt have taken in several hundred thousand. Turkey has taken in nearly 2 million refugees to date. A paramilitary police officer carries the lifeless body of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi after he drowned when the boat he and his family members were in capsized near the Turkish resort of Bodrum early Wednesday, Sept. 2, 2015. Estimates put the death toll between 140,200 and 330,380, with as many as 6 million Syrians displaced, according to the U.N. While there is no question that the Syrian government is responsible for many of the casualties resulting from its brutal crackdown, this is not just a Syrian problem. Foreign meddling in Syria began several years before the Syrian revolt erupted. It became evident that the United States, United Kingdom, France, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey would be jumping on the opportunity to organize, arm and finance rebels to form the Free Syrian Army as outlined in the State Department plans to destabilize Syria. Their agenda was to divide and conquer in order to wreak havoc across Syria in view of overthrowing Syrian President Bashar Assad. A Free Syrian Army soldier carries his weapon at the northern town of Sarmada, in Idlib province, Syria, Wednesday, Aug. 1, 2012. With a possible extension to Lebanon, it would eventually reach Europe, the target export market. Syria ends up being a key link in this chain, and it leans in favor of Iran and Russia; thus it was decided in the Western capitals that its regime needs to change. Indeed, tensions were building between Russia, the U.S. and the European Union amid concerns that the European gas market would be held hostage to Russian gas giant Gazprom. The entire Turkish energy security structure relies on gas from Russia and Iran. Plus, Turkey was harboring Ottoman-like ambitions of becoming a strategic crossroads for the export of Russian, Caspian-Central Asian, Iraqi and Iranian oil and even gas to Europe, assesses journalist Pepe Escobar writing for Al Jazeera. Now note which country along the purple line is not highlighted in red. This creates a linkage between oil supplies and the long war that is not easily broken or simply characterized. In this context, the report identifies the divide and conquer strategy while exploiting the Sunni-Shiite divide to protect Gulf oil and gas supplies while maintaining a Gulf Arab state dominance over oil markets. This strategy relies heavily on covert action, information operations (IO), unconventional warfare, and support to indigenous security forces. This framework crafted an interesting axis: Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, U.S., Britain and France vs. Syria, Iran and Russia. Rebel groups were being organized left and right, many of which featured foreign fighters and many of which had allied with al-Qaida. (AP Photo) The Syrian government responded with a heavy hand, targeting rebel held areas and killing civilians in the process. At the same time, these same foreign nations supported and even armed the Bahraini government, which claims to be Sunni, in its violent crackdown on the majority Shiite pro-democracy demonstrations that swept the nation. In addition to this, the Assad family is Alawite, an Islamic sect that the media has clumped in with Shiites, though most Shiites would agree that the two are unrelated. Further, the Assad family is described as secular and running a secular nation. Counting Alawites as Shiites was simply another way to push a sectarian framework for the conflict: It allowed for the premise that the Syria-Iran alliance was based on religion, when, in fact, it was an economic relationship. This framework carefully crafted the Syrian conflict as a Sunni revolution to liberate itself from Shiite influence that Iran was supposedly spreading to Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. As early as 2012, additional rebels armed and financed by Arab Gulf nations and Turkey like al-Qaida and the Muslim Brotherhood, declared all-out war against Shiites. Soon after, the majority of the Muslim Brotherhood rebels became part of al-Qaida-affiliated groups. Hezbollah entered the scene in 2012 and allied itself with the Syrian government to fight al-Nusra and ISIS, which were officially being armed and financed by Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. And all the arms were actively being sold to these nations by the United States. Thus, US arms were falling into the hands of the same terror group the US claims to be fighting in its broader War on Terror. Hezbollah fighters carry the coffin of Hezbollah member Mohammad Issa who was killed in an airstrike that killed six members of the Lebanese militant group and an Iranian general in Syria, during his funeral procession, in the southern village of Arab Salim, Lebanon, Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2015. Despite this, the U.S. sanctioned both the Syrian government and Hezbollah in 2012. Also that year, Russia and Iran sent military advisers to assist the Syrian government in quelling the terror groups, but Iranian troops were not on the ground fighting during this time. What was once a secular, diverse and peaceful nation, was looking more like it was on its way to becoming the next Afghanistan; its people living under Taliban-style rule as jihadists took over more land and conquered more cities. But this Orientalist, overly simplistic view of conflict in the Middle East dehumanizes the victims of these wars to justify direct and indirect military action. If the truth was presented to the public from the perspective that these wars are about economic interests, most people would not support any covert funding and arming of rebels or direct intervention. In fact, the majority of the public would protest against war. The political rhetoric has been carefully crafted to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable. But today, the Middle East is being torn to shreds by manipulative plans to gain oil and gas access by pitting people against one another based on religion. In Syria, they are fleeing en masse. A series of airstrikes killed at least 55 civilians and injured over 170 more at a busy fishermen market and hospital. Sign Up For The Best Of MintPress, Delivered To Your Daily Inbox.

In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community.

That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement.

From 1979-1981, Sami and Norwegian protests attempted to stop the construction of the Alta Dam in Norway. North Dakotan authorities want a pipeline because it will supposedly make shipping oil out of the state safer. Since June 2012, more Bakken crude has been moved by rail than by pipeline due to a surge in production and resulting pipeline congestion. If the pipeline is not completed on time, rates will have to be renegotiated and DAPL may no longer be such a lucrative project. And in the North American Arctic and the Lower 48, land is one thing that been guaranteed to many indigenous peoples through land claims agreements and settlements. The boundaries of Standing Rock were delineated in 1889 by the Dawes Act, a policy that had devastating consequences nationwide for Native Americans due to its attempt to break up the tribal system of societal organization. But it did guarantee them their rights to the land. To be fair, these projects often give jobs to native people. But they can also wreak havoc on their environment and precious resources even though they do not directly cut through their land. Pipelines placed anywhere near a water source are risky. Pipelines seem like quiet and sturdy infrastructures, but the protests in North Dakota are attempting to show that if one thing goes wrong, an entire way of life could be jeopardized. 2. The proliferation of fossil fuel infrastructure If built, DAPL will perpetuate the spread of fossil fuel infrastructure across North America. But if there were an issue in the Arctic like DAPL that attracted the interests of both indigenous and environmental activists, it could be a lightning rod for global dissidents to come and support the movement. The events in North Dakota show that not all locals are happy about out-of-state and foreign activists coming to ally themselves with the cause. If a protest were to arise in the Arctic, it would generally be less feasible for allies and supporters of the movement to travel to the site given the sheer costs of getting up north. If DAPL is built, it will help secure and encourage the continued projection of oil from the Bakken formation. Both Bakken and Athabasca are high-latitude oil fields whose emissions can exacerbate Arctic warming. Many of the pollutants they release into the atmosphere come from the wasteful practice of gas flaring, which is done to get rid of excess oil that cannot be economically shipped to market. The bright lights of gas flares can even be seen from space. Deepwater oil in the Gulf of Mexico is also considered unconventional, as is Arctic oil. Since at least 2008, North American Arctic oil, especially in Canada where there is even less infrastructure to get product out to market than in Alaska, has been on the back burner. This is partly due to the glut created by the Bakken boom, which has made Arctic oil impossible to profitably extract. From North Dakota to the Arctic The plains of North Dakota may seem a long way away from the Arctic Ocean. Ultimately, it may be the longer staying power of the movement in North Dakota, which is centrally located within the U.S., reachable by car, and, while cold, not insanely so in winter, which allows the NoDAPL protests to succeed. In the Arctic, similar movements might eventually have to come in from the cold. This post first appeared on Cryopolitics, an Arctic News and Analysis blog.

Photo by Ernest Swanson SHARE TWEET A Haida clan in British Columbia has stripped two hereditary chiefs of their titles because they supported the construction of an Enbridge pipeline that the Nation fought in court. The two chiefs signed a letter in support of the pipeline, and one of the chiefs told VICE News he met with the company and received per diems, but he believes the issue is being blown out of proportion. On Saturday, in front of 500 people, clan members in Old Massett held a ceremony marked with traditional dances in which the hereditary chiefs were stripped of their leadership, and matriarchs appointed new chiefs in their place. A ceremony like this one hasn't happened since smallpox struck Haida Gwaii, an archipelago along the coast of northern BC, in the 1800s. Tensions ran high at the potlatch when a group of five clan members crashed the ceremony in opposition, according to clan spokesperson Ernest Swanson. But three RCMP officers guarded the doors, and a group of matriarchs stood between the potlatch crashers and ceremony organizer Chief Darin Swanson to protect him. The two former chiefs who were stripped of their leadership, Carmen Goertzen of the Yahgu 7laanas Dadens Clan and Francis Ingram of the iits'aaw Yahgu 'laanaas and jaanas Clan, didn't attend the potlatch, saying they weren't invited. As the heads of their clans, hereditary chiefs are appointed by family matriarchs and are expected to demonstrate and uphold the morals of their families, including peacefulness and modesty. But in this case, because they went against the wishes of their families, their actions are being taken as a betrayal, according to Ernest Swanson, Darin Swanson's nephew. Ernest Swanson said their leadership was revoked because they received money from Enbridge and signed a letter in support of the company's Northern Gateway pipeline, which the Haida Nation has long opposed because, among other reasons, the influx of tanker traffic would increase the risk of oil spills. A letter the two hereditary chiefs signed asking for an extension for Enbridge's Northern Gateway pipeline. The Haida Nation celebrated a victory in late June when a court overturned the pipeline's approval, finding the federal government failed to fully consult seven First Nations that would be directly affected if the project went through. The NEB didn't grant the extension, and Enbridge has no permit to build the pipeline. Over the phone on Friday, Ingram denied that he ever asked for an extension for Enbridge, although VICE News pointed out that his signature appears on the letter. Ingram also denied receiving any money from Enbridge. However, Goertzen said Enbridge had paid the chiefs per diems in exchange for meeting with Enbridge. He said he hasn't brought any disrespect to his clan. Ingram, who is 73 and was a crab fisherman for much of his life until he retired, echoed this sentiment. Now, Haida fishermen are only hauling in 1,000 crabs a week when they used to get 2,000 in one day, he explained. According to Ingram, it's a similar story for the logging industry. That's tanking the economic opportunities for Haida members, especially in Old Massett, where Saturday's potlatch happened, he said. The clan conflict is also taking place as the Haida Nation tries to rebuild its traditions that were lost when Canada's residential schools stripped the First Nation and others across the country of their traditions. The stripping of the chiefs' authority is meant to reassert those traditions, Swanson explained. We're still very much trying to create that cultural continuity that we're missing. We're rebuilding right now. Follow Hilary Beaumont on Twitter."}

The letter comes as mounting resistance against the Dakota Access pipeline, which has brought together over 200 Indigenous groups and sparked solidarity protests across the United States and internationally, has turned its sights on putting pressure on the big banks financing the project to cut their support in light of the violations of human rights and Indigenous sovereignty. Citibank, the leader of the credit agreement, has come under particular fire in recent weeks. Another bank on the list, DNB, the largest bank in Norway, recently announced that it sold its assets in the Dakota Access pipeline after mounting public pressure to divest. If it acts on the demands of the new letter, it could pressure other banks to follow suite. The resistance against the Dakota Access pipeline, which cuts through unceded North American treaty lands, was launched in April by the Standing Rock Sioux to protect water and cultural sites. Police, private security forces and the National Guard have used dogs, tasers, mace, rubber bullets, water cannons and other tactics and military equipment to repress the protesters. Authorities have arrested and seriously injured hundreds of people, including a young protester whose arm was maimed by a concussion grenade. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple has called for the occupations blocking the pipeline to be evacuated by Dec. 5, but claimed that there are no plans for forcible removal. Dalrymple said Wednesday that he has requested a meeting with the Standing Rock Sioux to rebuild shattered relations."}

I am part Cherokee Indian on my mothers side I learned about the different tribes in college (late in life) graduating in 2003 with a BA in Comparative Religions. I related more to the Native American spirituality, along with some other more spiritually driven practices in the world than the typical mainstream Christianity. I have gotten so much out of learning about all of the different religions and there is a thread of spirituality in each, while also having a different thread of more religious dogma and restriction, based on convenient judgement to 'separate'. It has been my hope ever since this awareness, that we all come together in solidarity against the oppressors and the elite who really are not part of the American ideal, but more the British and other European perspective we tried to get away from because of religious oppression and abuse. The ideal of democracy (which your Eastern tribes helped create in the fashion of their own constitution... is a far cry from what some leaders want for this country and its people. We all want safety, security and happiness with the freedom to reach our highest potential and for that of our children and grandchildren. And with those natural remedies that are compatible with our bodies, minds and systems of this world. I am foremost a Truth Seeker and am searching always for what is truth and a higher vibration. Because of that, i am open to looking and listening to all the practices throughout history.. and that is a rich source to consider all of it and see what is the spiritual essence in each idea. Its all one Spirit, and that has no nationality or separation from another. This is a positive development for this nation. Good for you folks. JEANNE says: 14:40 THANKS FOR SHARING.

The slew of upcoming trials, beginning on Monday in Washington state, stem from a series of coordinated actions on 11 October 2016 aimed at shutting down oil sands pipelines. Nine criminal cases include several filed against film-makers and live-streamers who recorded protesters closing the emergency valves on pipelines but did not directly participate in the disruptions. One case was later dropped. Lawmakers in multiple states have also recently pursued new laws aimed at restricting protests and making it easier for police to target demonstrators. Those demonstrations have also led to serious criminal charges, including a case against radio host Amy Goodman, which a judge eventually rejected. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Two well-known documentary film-makers, who had faced decades in prison for filming the 11 October actions, have since had charges suspended or dismissed. But several activists who live-streamed and filmed the actions, including Liptay, are now preparing for trials alongside five demonstrators who were directly responsible for shutting down pipeline valves. Charges include mischief, criminal damage, trespassing and conspiracy. Sam Jessup, a Vermont activist who live-streamed an action at the TransCanada Keystone pipeline in North Dakota, is facing three felony charges, including two conspiracy allegations that could result in 20-year sentences.

But the battle to save the environment continues. Kingfisher said: One of the things that we accomplished at Standing Rock was that we became aware of all of the water issues. We learned a lot of things about the environment and the laws that were pertaining to treaty rights and how to do civil disobedience. So it was a learning process. From all that education, we learned about solar energy. We learned a lot of new things that we never learned about, being native. So now, as the movement goes, since we all were forcefully moved out of camp, a lot of the groups, different groups are branching off and going out and making different camps throughout the United States. These camps are resistance camps that are resisting against pipelines, corporations, oil, fossil fuel corporations, all these different industries that are ruining our water and polluting our land.

The Army Corps of Engineers launched that study in the final week of the Obama administration. That environmental review could be lengthy, slowing down an already stalled permit process. The White House says it wants to sit down with all sides in the conflict to negotiate a solution. They have doubled down again and again on putting a pipeline in this place. If the federal government grants the pipeline a permit in the near future, the tribe plans to pursue legal action to force the full environmental study.

They came down from their mountain hideaways to meet us and to spread their message of the need for change. We were surrounded by breathtaking scenes: the emerald Caribbean and palm-fringed beaches, the Sierra Nevada mountains that rise 18,000 feet up from the ocean to glacier-covered peaks, the rain forests, and the sparkling rivers that cascade from the glaciers into the Caribbean. These up-til-now illusive people totally opened the doors to their homes and hearts to us. Their Mamos told us of how their ancestors had fled up the valleys of the glacial rivers into the mountains. Choosing to remain isolated for centuries, they developed a new dream of the Earth, a revelation that balances the brilliant potential of the human mind, heart and spirit with all the forces of nature. They have shared their history with others. What was unique this time was their enthusiasm for embracing this group on very personal levels. We traveled many miles down from their community and stood with them on the bank of a glacial river where it meets the Caribbean while the young man gently offered the river the commitments we had all made and blown into tiny pieces of cotton from a local plant. The Kogi message, although similar to the one I received more than 40 years ago when I was a Peace Corps volunteer living with the Shuar in the Amazon and then again 20 years later from the Achuar, is more urgent now than ever. It is the message that birthed nonprofits, including Dream Change and the Pachamama Alliance. It is the message of the North American indigenous people and all those who join them at Standing Rock. Now, flying back from the Kogi, I feel rejuvenated and recommitted to spreading the message that is the underlying principle behind that economic shapeshift that needs to happen. We know we are facing severe crises. We know the climate is changing and that we humans are devastating the air, water, and land that support all life on this planet. We know that our government is incapable or unwilling to turn things around. It is easy to be discouraged. EXCEPT we also now know what our Elder Siblings understood long ago, that We the People must transform ourselves and our institutions. That is the message of the Kogi. It is the message of the Shuar, the Achuar, the people at Standing Rock and all our brothers and sisters around the globe.

It is a continuation of the populist fervor building up in the United States. It is a continuation of the pursuit of infinite growth. It is a story of physical power, political power and economic power. The pipeline is designed to transport 570,000 barrels per day of U.S. light sweet from the Bakken and Three Forks production region of North Dakota to Patoka, Ill. A power level equal to more than half of the peak electric load in Texas on the hottest summer day, an amount of power that is not trivial. In the early days of the Fossil Fuel Age, a small group of people could restrict the flow of coal and thus significant physical power. Those who can restrict or control physical power can command economic power, and those in control of economic power can command political power. The Dakota Access pipeline is no different. In short, it is all about power. Thus, by challenging the physical flow of power, the Standing Rock tribe challenged the current economic and political power. After months of protest, they saw local law enforcement treat them as the first African-Americans integrated into southern universities were treated: with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons. These Native Americans and those joining them were on a slow path to defeat, with orders to vacate the protest camp. They simply did not represent enough political or economic power. However, the power struggle turned in their favor as soon as a new political power arrived in the form of a group of 2,000 military veterans. Firing tear gas and water cannons at Native Americans is bad for business. Doing the same to military veterans is a public relations nightmare for business and politicians. As President-elect Donald Trump discusses approving the Dakota Access pipeline route, attempting to reverse the decision of his predecessor as quickly as possible, it will test his populist credentials that he sold to the American public. The oil in the ground is no use if it cannot flow to the pump. But alas, there is also less use in gasoline flowing to the pump if fewer and fewer people can afford to use it. More power flowing to fewer pockets is not what Trump claims to promote. The Keystone XL oil pipeline debate centered on carbon and climate concerns and from where our physical power originates. The voters in Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan who helped put Trump in White House were not thinking about climate change. These Americans felt left behind by increased global competition. They lost economic power and control over their lives. Trump told them he would give both back to them. Whether that actually happens remains to be seen. The Dakota Access pipeline concerns the same story. The Native Americans, protesters and veterans in North Dakota showed up as a test of power of the local people against broader business interests. They won this battle, but if history is any indication, they likely will not win the war for stopping or rerouting the pipeline. Obama bought them some time. Only time will tell just exactly what Trump will buy for them, and thus, which citizens of America he is helping to be great again. Trump needs to let us know if he thinks there is equal power for ensuring a right of way versus the right to get in the way.

This old adage is applicable to what is taking place at Standing Rock right now on a number of different levels. It is evident in terms of how Native American civil and human rights are once again being blatantly violated by local, state, and federal government agencies on behalf of big oil and banking interests who have literally hijacked our government. It is also evident in how adept the white man is in employing the time worn divide and conquer tactics used to defeat Native resistance movements against political oppression. Case in point is examining the divisions which now exist at Standing Rock between the tribal government, and Standing Rock Native resistance leaders, such as Chase Iron Eyes. Let me begin by stating I respect Mr. Cook as an important voice in Indian country, his many years of political activism, his credentials sufficiently displayed for everyone to appreciate. A lot of us have been around as well, going back to the 1970s, 1980s, etc. So many of the prominent, nationally known Indian leaders and resistance warriors I was acquainted with from that time period are now gone, most having crossed over into the Spirit world. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I have never met Chase Iron Eyes, nor have I ever had any communications with him. However from viewing online news video interviews with Chase Iron Eyes, there should be no question his motives are honorable and sincere. Questioning his character and motives with judgmental innuendo only plays into the hands of the real enemy at hand. The implication is that Native people, such as Chase Iron Eyes, do not have the right to question their own tribal government, and should act like sheep, instead of leaders. Evicting the Water Protectors who while peacefully demonstrating, have been violently assaulted by militarized police, shot at with rubber bullets, sprayed repeatedly with pepper spray, viciously attacked by guard dogs, beaten over the head with batons, thrown into dog kennel cages. Mr. Archembault may be in for a rude awakening investing all his faith in the U.S. judicial system, as the American courts have historically served to negate and repress the rights of Native peoples. As Chase Iron Eyes has correctly pointed out, the issues here are much more than about a pipeline: this is about colonialism, broken treaties, tribal sovereignty, environmental racism, corporate greed, government corruption, police state brutality, and the list goes on. The significance of what happened at Standing Rock cannot be overstated, as literally hundreds of Native tribes and communities united in solidarity in support of the Standing Rock Sioux. Not to mention the millions of non-Native peoples all over the world who were inspired by what happens when THE PEOPLE stand up to the government and greedy corporations. The next time the Standing Rock tribal government issues a nationwide call for help and support, people are going to think twice about answering that call. Colonialism, terrorism, political oppression, stealing of ancestral lands, abject poverty, etc. are common denominators experienced by every single Native nation in the United States. As the saying goes, a prophet is never welcome in his own community. Chase Iron Eyes is not a prophet, but he is a bona fide Native leader whose integrity and motives cannot be questioned. Again, this only plays into the hands of the wacichu (the white man), perpetuating the divide and conquer tactics that have been used against Indigenous Peoples for over 500 years by Western Europeans. It is a tragic but historical fact both Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse were murdered by their own people, as agents of the U.S. government. The Oceti Sakowin camp has to be relocated because of imminent flooding come spring. We get that. However, it was a major strategic mistake for the Standing Rock tribal government to evict all the Water Protectors and not continue to support the resistance camps. Why, only Tribal Chairman Archembault can answer that question. The Water Protectors are now being shown the door, and in a not so subtle way, being told they are part of the problem, not the solution. It is not a joke, but the solemn responsibility of all human beings. Our ancestors, elders and medicine people foretold this time would come, and now it is here and we must deal with it. By doing exactly what the Water Protectors have been doing: offering prayers and peacefully resisting through non-violence. As of this writing, the Army Corps of Engineers has just issued the permit for DAPL to proceed with the drilling. Restraining order or not, DAPL has now been given the green light under the authority of the Trump administration and will proceed with drilling under the lake. By the time this winds its way through the court system, the pipeline will be fully operational as planned. For all of the young people, especially our young Native people who believed in standing up for what was right; for all the Water Protectors who stood on the front line knowing they might be seriously injured or even killed by the corporate police state, your sacrifices were not for nothing: the entire world was inspired and will continue the battle no matter what.

Let me begin by stating I respect Mr. Cook as an important voice in Indian country, his many years of political activism, his credentials sufficiently displayed for everyone to appreciate. A lot of us have been around as well, going back to the 1970s, 1980s, etc. So many of the prominent, nationally known Indian leaders and resistance warriors I was acquainted with from that time period are now gone, most having crossed over into the Spirit world. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I have never met Chase Iron Eyes, nor have I ever had any communications with him. However from viewing online news video interviews with Chase Iron Eyes, there should be no question his motives are honorable and sincere. Mr. Archembault may be in for a rude awakening investing all his faith in the U.S. judicial system, as the American courts have historically served to negate and repress the rights of Native peoples. As Chase Iron Eyes has correctly pointed out, the issues here are much more than about a pipeline: this is about colonialism, broken treaties, tribal sovereignty, environmental racism, corporate greed, government corruption, police state brutality, and the list goes on. The significance of what happened at Standing Rock cannot be overstated, as literally hundreds of Native tribes and communities united in solidarity in support of the Standing Rock Sioux. next time the Standing Rock tribal government issues a nationwide call for help and support, people are going to think twice about answering that call. As the saying goes, a prophet is never welcome in his own community. Chase Iron Eyes is not a prophet, but he is a bona fide Native leader whose integrity and motives cannot be questioned.

Published OnNov. Protesters have vowed to stay put. Opponents of the 1,170-mile Dakota Access Pipeline have gathered for months at the Oceti Sakowin camp, about 40 miles south of Bismarck. The Standing Rock Sioux and other Native American tribes fear the pipeline could pollute the Missouri River and harm sacred cultural lands and tribal burial grounds.

Federal officials said anyone found on the land after Dec. 5 could be charged with trespassing.

Clark, the retired Army general and onetime supreme allied commander in Europe for NATO. Image Michael A. Wood Jr. is a founder of Veterans Stand for Standing Rock. One veteran, Loreal Black Shawl, said the mission to support the protesters was intensely personal. Ms. Black Shawl, 39, of Rio Rancho, N.M., is a descendant of two Native American tribes, the Oglala Lakota and Northern Arapaho. She served in the Army for nearly eight years, finishing her career as a sergeant. Ms. Black Shawl said, referring to the protesters. The authorities have used rubber bullets, pepper spray and water cannons against demonstrators, hundreds of whom have been injured, according to protest organizers. The clashes have been highly contentious, with the police and demonstrators leveling accusations of violence at each other. The Conflicts Along 1,172 Miles of the Dakota Access Pipeline A detailed map showing the Dakota Access Pipeline, the site of months of clashes near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. Nov. 23, 2016 Some protesters filed a class-action lawsuit on Monday against the Morton County police and others, alleging excessive use of force and seeking a court injunction to prevent the authorities from using rubber bullets, explosive grenades and water cannons, according to The Atlantic. One woman was injured and in danger of losing her arm after an explosion at the protest site this month. By spotlighting issues such as the use of force by the police, national energy policies and the treatment of Native Americans, the protests have garnered national headlines and widespread attention on social media. Ms. Black Shawl acknowledged that the operation could prove problematic because the veterans and the police both have military or tactical training. Organizers encouraged attendees to wear their old uniforms. Mr. Wood said they were discouraging active-duty service members from attending. There are no ranks, and participants will refer to one another by their given names. Mr. Wood said the early stages of the event will be logistical: setting up tents and organizing food supplies. The first arrivals are expected on Wednesday. The premise is for the veterans to be fully self-sufficient, he said. Some officials expressed the hope that the demonstrators would move on. The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Dave Archambault II, said in an email that he had no concerns that tensions could escalate.

She been an active participate and family to the activist groups NYC Shut It Down and Hoods4Justice. Sophia has always been committed to confronting injustice through vigilance and resistance. Sophia was giving out bottles of water to protectors holding down the space when she was shot with a concussion grenade. This was the response of police and DAPL mercenaries as she and other brave protectors attempted to hold the line against the black snake in hservice of protecting our water. Please consider donating to help pay for her treatment. We must to support our comrades when they need us the most. She needs all of us right now. After all she is our family. My name is Michael Basillas, I live in NYC. Sophia Wilansky is a fierce friend of mine. We've known each other for almost a year now from participation in various demonstrations focused in the city. Sophia and I share passion addressing social justice, vigilance, and resistance , and understanding this world is unsuitable and required drastic change. Sophia is family to many affinity activism groups from The Base, NYC Shut It Down, and HOODS4JUSTICE. I'm this money with the help of several other people to provide medical relief funds after what had happen on Nov 21, 2016. HOW THE MONEY WILL BE SPEND: Funds raised in this campaign will go directly to provide financial aid towards 20 surgeries Sophia needs to save her arm. Funds also provide Sophia's father some financial support to take care of his daughter. Their insurance will not cover all of the expenses and can only cover a certain percentage of it especially with this type of surgery. So we are asking to donate gracefully because this will help provide financial support toward Sophia's long recovery. The rest of the money will be delivered to Mr. Wilansky when he gets back one in NYC. They frequently post information about Sophia's well-being. Thank you for the support you have given us. Please try again. She stood in silence. She was sanding to close to a truck and they didn't like that. I suppose an unarmed, unarmored young woman is threatening to them. They ordered for her to retreat, the whole time shooting rubber bullets. When they finally stopped, she attempted to retreat, as they ordered. She took a few steps towards us, and that's when they directly launched the flash grenade at her. It exploded right on her. I want people who are not here to understand, we assemble in PEACE. Sophia said not a word to them. She is the proof that they will use violent tactics no matter what. We are not to blame here. Anyone who would blame the people and not the government in this situation astounds me... Wilansky family, please contact me. I am a witness to what Morton County did to your daughter. I think it's beautiful for everyone to help but that is a lot of money and maybe we can petition for them to donate their fee to her medical bills. It would be an estimate of half a million dollars if she needs a prosthetic arm. Calling the FBI could result in you providing information that could be potentially incriminating to yourself and others. Many of these police do not see your constitutional right to peacefully assemble. They do not see your point of view or what you are fighting for. Clearing a public road resulted in use of deadly force against hundreds of people. They have responded to us with escalating violence, and increased charges. Put pressure on your legislators, federal agencies, and the White House. Put pressure on North Dakota's governor. Call on the Department of Justice. Please keep eachother safe, and learn about your rights. May she recover more beautifully than could be imagined. May she know the love of thousands. May all her old ones enfold her now. May her story wake up the hearts of tens of thousands. May the protectors and the waters they protect be kept safe from harms way. Sorry for my skepticism. I should have researched better. They are just jealous they don't have this kind of support. And the police will be looking at serious charges against them for crimes against humanity. Thank you all water protectors for the fight. Sending troops in to back you up and lots of them. Below is her statement as conveyed by her father, lawyer Wayne Wilansky. A grenade exploded right as it hit Sophia in the left forearm taking most of the undersurface of her left arm with it. Both her radial and ulnar artery were completely destroyed. Her radius was shattered and a large piece of it is missing. Her medial nerve is missing a large section as well. All of the muscle and soft tissue between her elbow and wrist were blown away. The police did not do this by accident - it was an intentional act of throwing it directly at her. Additionally police were shooting people in face and groin intending to do the most possible damage. Sophia will have surgery again tomorrow as bit by bit they try to rebuild a somewhat functioning arm and hand. The first surgery took a vein from her leg which they have implanted in her arm to take the place of the missing arteries. She will need multiple surgeries to try to gain some functional use of the arm and hand. She will be, every day for the foreseeable future, fearful of losing her arm and hand. There are no words to describe the pain of watching my daughter cry and say she was sorry for the pain she caused me and my wife. I died a thousand deaths today and will continue to do so for quite some time. Prayers for her healing. And for a good attorney. This needs to be taken to court. The sacrifices that this young woman made to be there to support an important cause will be with her the rest of her life. She chose to stand up, she chose to help others that were in need that night and ended up getting severely injured. The least we can all do is come together and support her in her recovery. Her physical, emotional and mental state are fragile at this time and in need of lots of support to assist her. I don't know her personally but thank her from the bottom of my heart. I love that so many folks are pulling together and showing so much love and support. Let's keep this momentum going and make sure all her expenses are covered. We are in this together and together everyone achieves more. Please. Water is life. Let's try to do better and be better. Best wishes for Sophia and her family.

Then indigenous people were forced to clear out of the Oceti Sakowin and Sacred Stone protest camps. And its indigenous leaders are scoring big victories. Several major European banks have also dropped investments in the project. The DAPL divestment movement may foreshadow similar protests to come against the Keystone XL Pipeline project, which President Trump also green-lit, and other infrastructure that would increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Fielder was born and raised in Long Beach, California. But she has deep ancestral ties to the land and water Standing Rock protesters are fighting to protect. The answer came to her in early February. Fielder was watching all this unfold in San Francisco, where she had recently graduated from Stanford University. Fielder made inquiries among local indigenous groups. But many of the groups seemed too busy to take it on. With the blessing of older activists, Fielder contacted people across the Bay Area on social media. And in late February, several dozen activists made the case for divestment at a San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting. One way San Francisco might do that is by forming its own municipal bank. In the meantime, other activists are pressuring city councils in Los Angeles, Raleigh, New York, Chicago, Bellingham, Albuquerque, and Portland to take action. Yet none of the activities has had a discernible financial impact on Dakota Access or the banks still funding the project. Yet she sees it as a way for regular people across the U.S. and the world to communicate a wider message of protest.

Despite her checkered past and brushes with the law, she is not reneging her stance, and is prepared to testify in court to what she calls illegal actions of TigerSwan and other security companies involved in protecting the Dakota Access Pipeline. They told everyone to be armed. The terms were indoctrinated into security personnel meetings, disseminated to mainstream media disguised deliberately as news, when at least part of the violence along the pipeline in 2016 and early 2017 was amplified and created by the security companies, most importantly TigerSwan, according to Dockter and leaked and requested documents first published by The Intercept. I am expecting everything. There were five-ton military trucks and barricade that boxed us in. Some of the acts reported by law enforcement were committed by security company infiltrators disguised as activists, Dockter said. The charge is one long discussed at the Standing Rock camps, but one for which there was little proof until Dockter came forward with information. Her family supports her, she said. Her father, especially, is undaunted. She described herself as a diehard liberal, who was against the pipeline to begin with, but after meeting Thompson at a local McDonalds, it was love at first sight. The two met on Facebook, and she believes Thompson originally wanted to meet her for information as she had friends involved in the Standing Rock camps. We told each other everything that first night. A veteran, and recipient of a Purple Heart, Thompson suffers from what she believes is PTSD after two tours in Afghanistan and one tour in Iraq. Thompson slowly pulled her into working for North Dakota-based EH Investigations and Security, LLC. Initially, he wanted to become involved with security work because he wanted to protect everyone involved, Dockter said. I feel like I sold out for a guy that I loved. Attempts were made to contact Thompson, but he refused to comment.In January, Dockter began working for EH Investigations, which was subcontracted by Leighton Security Services as the Texas-based company was not authorized to work in North Dakota. Dockter also described TigerSwan media cells using high-tech software to discover locations and intelligence in private social media pages, Dockter said. TigerSwan documents also show that security personnel relied heavily on social media postings for information. Eventually, Dockter was fired after EH Investigations personnel discovered her past with drugs and forgery. She is unfazed by those who say she is not a credible witness. The activities she saw, the plans she heard while with Thompson or working in security, has been eating at her conscience, she said. Dockter's testimony coincides with a civil action lawsuit filed by the North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board against TigerSwan.
