Tell us how the Trump tariffs are affecting you. FILE - In this Oct. 5, 2016, file photo, heavy equipment is seen at a site where sections of the Dakota Access Pipeline were being buried near the town of St. Anthony in Morton County, N.D. The Army intends to allow the crossing under Lake Oahe as early as Wednesday, Feb. 8. The crossing is the final big chunk of work on the pipeline. Being developed by Energy Transfer Partners, the project will transport North Dakota oil 1,200 miles through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. Construction is nearly complete outside of a stretch under Lake Oahe, a Missouri River reservoir in southern North Dakota, where the work is stalled. ETP disputes that and maintains the pipeline will be safe. Opponents have protested for months in southern North Dakota, with nearly 600 arrests since August. There are two cases. In one, ETP asked U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in November to declare it has legal right to lay pipe under Lake Oahe. ETP subsidiary Dakota Access LLC argues that the Army Corps of Engineers gave permission in July through a permit granted under the federal Rivers and Harbors Act, which safeguards public works projects, such as the dam-created reservoir system. The Corps said in its response filed Friday that provisions of the federal Mineral Leasing Act also must be satisfied for ETP to drill under the lake. Those provisions include approval of an easement to work on federal land and the notification of Congress, neither of which has been done, agency attorneys said. The two tribes also are asking Boasberg to reject ETP's request. In the other case, the tribes are challenging federal permits for the pipeline at more than 200 water crossings. Last month, the tribes said they were willing to put those claims on hold until the battle between ETP and the Corps is resolved, and Boasberg agreed. For ETP, it's money. The company had planned to finish the pipeline by the end of 2016. For the Corps, it's the ability to do a more thorough environmental study of the project in the wake of the tribes' concerns. Assistant Army Secretary Jo-Ellen Darcy in a Dec. 4 statement said study is needed on alternative locations for the river crossing, the potential for a leak and tribal treaty rights. A resolution is at least several weeks away under a scheduling order from Boasberg. Some pipeline opponents worry that pro-energy President-elect Donald Trump will overturn the Army's easement decision. No construction work is being done while the court battles play out. Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault last month called for the camp to disband due to dangerous weather and because it's in an area that could flood in the spring, possibly leading to the river being contaminated with garbage and debris. He told The Associated Press late last week that he's unhappy people are still camped out and asked them to devise a plan for leaving the area and cleaning it up. Recently Viewed Your list is empty.
