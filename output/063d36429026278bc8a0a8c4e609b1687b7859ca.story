It is the day that we associate most with seeing family and friends and with being grateful for all that we have. While most of America will be sitting around the dinner table and carving a turkey tonight, the natives of this land, the people who were here first, are currently putting their lives in danger and having to fight to keep what is rightfully theirs in South Dakota. If you have not heard about the controversy around the Dakota Access pipeline, here is a quick overview of what is happening: a Texas based company, Energy Transfer Partners, wants to build a pipeline through the Dakotas so that they will be able to transport crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois.

On top of that, the land that they want to build this pipeline on is ancient Native American burial ground. It is considered sacred land, and is very important to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe that resides nearby. Thousands of people, both people of the tribe as well as others, have been protesting at Standing Rock; they have been facing terrible weather, bad living conditions and are constantly at risk of being attacked by officials who have been accused of treating the peaceful protestors terribly.

Be thankful for what you have today, but do what you can to try and help others out too.
