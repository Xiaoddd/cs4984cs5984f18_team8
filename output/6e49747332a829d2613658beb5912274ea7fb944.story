On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave the green light to the construction of a new pipeline, dubbed the Trans Mountain Expansion Project. This one would triple the amount of oil going from Alberta to a shipping terminal in Burnaby, a suburb just east of Vancouver, increasing the capacity of the existing system from 300,000 barrels a day to 890,000. The battle to stop the pipeline in British Columbia and protect Salish Sea waters on both sides of the border could bring some of the largest environmental protests ever seen in Cascadia. The shipping would allow the energy industry and Canada to reap big returns from sales to refineries California and Asia. On Tuesday, Trudeau made the final decision to move forward with it, saying that he would impose strong environmental safeguards. And he said the project would provide many jobs as well as spurring larger-scale Canadian economic development. Jewell took part in the North Dakota protests late this summer, and he drew a parallel Wednesday. They have been breaking. The same thing with ships. The Washington-based tribes will continue to work closely with the other Coastal Salish First Nations opponents of the pipeline, she said. The U.S. administration and Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell have done little or nothing to express concerns about tribal fishing rights and environmental protection, Boyles said, but noted that the Washington state Department of Ecology has expressed concerns about the effects of any tanker wreck. expressed optimism about stopping the project. Legal action beat back that proposal, with a court ruling that the First Nations fishing and environmental concerns had not been adequately considered. She said some leading political figures have already promised to join the activists on the protest lines. About the Author - Nick Turner Nick is an editorial intern for Crosscut. All Rights Reserved.
