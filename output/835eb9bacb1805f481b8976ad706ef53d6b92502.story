Description KALW's call-in show: Politics and culture, dialogue and debate. Activist Loretta Ross and scholar Rickie Solinger wrote their new book Reproductive Justice: An Introduction to go beyond the pro-choice vs. anti-abortion debates that dominate headlines. The actions in San Francisco will coincide with the Global Climate Action Summit. From September 6th through the 13th, the San Francisco Green Film Fest is highlighting a number of films focusing on water, fire, air, and earth. Millions of Venezuelans have fled to neighboring countries due to the economic crisis and shortages of food and other essentials.

The actions in San Francisco will coincide with the Global Climate Action Summit. We'll discuss coverage. We'll also talk about the Environmental Protection Agency under Andrew Wheeler, the man who replaced Scott Pruitt. Also, the nationwide prison strike comes to end on Sunday. The show does have a progressive slant and it originates in san Fran but it is not run by liberal fanatics, to the contrary actually. They could use better sound engineer and better producers though. Insightful and diverse by James L K Contrary to popular belief, this is not from NPR. It is produced by the -other- San Francisco public radio station, KALW. You hear about many things from around the world from geo-politics to local issues. I especially recommend the Friday Media Roundtable. You'll get updates from reporters around the world who both praise and criticize the media and tell you many things you won't hear in the mainstream. By the way, Fox News -is- the main stream.
