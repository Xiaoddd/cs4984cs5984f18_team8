The staggering scale of the biggest transfer of cash in the history of the Federal Reserve has been graphically laid bare by a US congressional committee. In the year after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 nearly 281 million notes, weighing 363 tonnes, were sent from New York to Baghdad for disbursement to Iraqi ministries and US contractors. Details of the shipments have emerged in a memorandum prepared for the meeting of the House committee on oversight and government reform which is examining Iraqi reconstruction. Its chairman, Henry Waxman, a fierce critic of the war, said the way the cash had been handled was mind-boggling. The memorandum details the casual manner in which the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority disbursed the money, which came from Iraqi oil sales, surplus funds from the UN oil-for-food programme and seized Iraqi assets. Auditors discovered that the key to a vault was kept in an unsecured backpack. Cash payments were made from the back of a pickup truck, and cash was stored in unguarded sacks in Iraqi ministry offices. To oversee the expenditure the CPA was supposed to appoint an independent certified public accounting firm. However, evidence before the committee suggests that senior American officials were unconcerned about the situation because the billions were not US taxpayers' money. These are not appropriated American funds. They are Iraqi funds. Bremer's financial adviser, retired Admiral David Oliver, is even more direct. The memorandum quotes an interview with the BBC World Service. Billions of dollars of their money, yeah I understand. Our top priority was to get the economy moving again. Millions of civil service families had not received salaries or pensions for months and there was no effective banking system.
