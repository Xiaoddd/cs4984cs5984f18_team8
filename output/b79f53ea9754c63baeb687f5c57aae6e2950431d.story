Blue Mass Group Reality-based commentary on politics. There were police officers and National Guards standing around casually eating pizza and joking with each other. From my window I had a view of the cage where they were holding the men. It felt good to hear that, I felt connected to them even though they were outside of the bus we were on because we are all one heart, one mind and one prayer. As we were looking out the window, someone pointed out that 2 National Guard officers were taking selfies with their personal phones with a view of the men in the cage behind them. It was disgusting to see them take such pleasure in it. We sat on the bus for hours and most of us had to pee so bad but our requests to use the bathroo m were denied. She lau ghed and walked off the bus. I assume they took her to get cleaned up but I never saw her again after that. When they had our bags labeled there was a Jane Doe bag that none of us recognized so it may have been hers. My zip ties were hurting so bad and my hands were swollen. My nose and mouth still had dried mud on it and my friend Tiffany kept offering to let me wipe it on her scarf but I felt bad doing that so I just let it be. Eventually they started taking us off the bus to do mug shots and bag our clothes before we went into the kennels. They told us that they were going to be shipping our brothers and sisters off to several different locations and my heart sank for them. I had no idea in that moment the torture they would endure during their transfer but I already hurt for them. Some things I may never share with anyone aside from those who already know because they lived it with me. Once it is uploaded to Youtube I will share a link here for you all. It is edited footage taken in Standing Rock, with interviews of those seen in the direct actions there. 0 0 Filed Under: User 2 Leave a reply Please Login to comment 2 Comment threads 0 Thread replies 0 Followers Most reacted comment Hottest comment thread 2 Comment authors Recent comment authors This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
