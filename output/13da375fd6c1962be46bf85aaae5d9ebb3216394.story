Yet oil & gas prices have plunged in recent years and a rebound does not appear likely in the near future. Lower prices mean higher demand A simple economics principle states that decreasing prices can raise demand. The renewables market struggles with high production costs. Subsidies and public support for green energy do help, but that does not always translate into more substantial power consumption. Price cuts are set according to regions. Residents from northwestern China are pegged as 1st Grade, because they produce the highest wind and solar power capacity for local use. They would benefit with the steepest rate cuts, while the rest of the nation would be marked as either 2nd, 3rd or 4th Grades. Those cited in lower grades can enjoy rate cuts too, but at reduced levels. Winds sweep down from the Himalayan Mountains and the Siberian Tundra. Numerous wind farms dot the regional landscape, but local wind firms face ongoing technical glitches when converting its energy to the State Grid. On very windy days, giant turbines have to shut down temporarily. Nonetheless, wind capacity in the past 12 months ending in November 2015 had risen over 27 percent, which equates to 113.36 gigawatts, compared to 95.8 GW for the same period last year. But over 15 percent of wind energy was wasted due to low regional demand. Local governments have already enticed them with subsidies. However, China has failed to achieve its national target of generating 23.1 GW of new solar power installed-capacity. New technology upgrades can drive energy consumption. ABB, a leading power and automation group, announced plans to install three smart grid substations that generate 363 kilovolts in northwest China. ABB would integrate its substations to convert wind and solar into stored capacity for the State Grid, which can be used by households at a later date.
