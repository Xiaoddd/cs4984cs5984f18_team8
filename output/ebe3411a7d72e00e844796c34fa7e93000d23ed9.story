I love RB because. You guys are ever so reliable. My order always gets here on time without any fuss. The quality is very good, and the logo the same. Delivery was also excellent and I received the t-shirt very quickly. Period. Hab mir drei t-shirts geholt. Awesome design, super happy with this purchase. Only thing is the shirt does smell a bit strange when you first receive it. Speedy service and good quality product. The colours, print quality, and shirt quality were very satisfactory. I needed to contact REDBUBBLE for help with a shipping issue that was not their responsibility, and they were cooperative, obliging and efficient. I can't say enough good things about their products and dealing with them. Overall good product and experience. it's alright. The one thing is that it seems to be a little big since i ordered a Large and it seems to be larger than all my other L shirts. I even tried shrinking it but it didn't work. Great quality and such awesome artwork. Love this site. And feels great. Was surprised by sticker that advised me the dyes could have a strange odor. Took a bit of time to arrive but it was near Christmas. Really liked the shirt. Fit was true to size. Shipping was faster than expected. never have i found a shirt more fitting to my entire being. The material is super soft, the color is bright and pretty, and the design is sharp and well-made. It wears well and is fine in the washer and dryer. I have 4 of them and I think they are a fun addition to my wardrobe. Very soft and comfortable. Enormous choice of original designs, helpful customer service. Quality is great, Print is perfect. Good quality t-shirt, good quality stamping. Does look great up close. 1st t-shirt was to big but without any problems I received a 2nd one in my size. Great quality and a longish fit which is what he needed. Will be purchasing again no doubt. The colors are pretty and clear...great selection too. The quality of the product was great and the fit was as advertised. It arrived within three days. I prefer a really soft cotton. Apart from that, loved the price, speed and quality. Unfortunately I had made an error in sizing and so I contacted customer help and requested to exchange it for a smaller size. I am satisfied with it. happy, size was fine, quality excellent, design and colouring were everything I could have wanted. I appreciated the sense of humor too. I ordered a couple of shirts for my boyfriend, but accidentally got a size too small. The sizes were all perfect and fit us all as they should. Fit well and is great quality. I ordered a Classic T-Shirt, and it's a Gildan Heavy Cotton (usually the standard for Bandshirts, Men sizes), and the colour green is a shade lighter than in the pictures, but still a beautiful green. fit was spot on for him. And the design is even more amazing in person. It washed well, I assume, as he's worn it multiple times. And shipping was right on time.
