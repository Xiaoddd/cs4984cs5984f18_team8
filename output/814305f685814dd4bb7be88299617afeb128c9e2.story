Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated. On Sunday night, 400 protesters clashed with police, leading to the hospitalization of more than two dozen. One protester, a 21-year-old New York resident named Sophia Wilansky, nearly lost her arm after an explosion. Both sides have blamed each since the weekend clashes. The organizers hope to prevent progress on the construction of the pipeline as well as draw national attention to the cause. The money will go toward food, transportation and supplies for the veterans who attend. If completed, the pipeline would allow crude oil to be transported to oil refineries along the Eastern Seaboard. Wilansky was among the protesters Sunday who rallied in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Knudsen said he saw police unleash water cannons on protesters even though temperatures were below freezing. They also shot rubber bullets and tear gas toward the crowd. Frightening explosion, fears of amputation As the protest stretched into Monday morning, police started to fire concussion grenades at protesters, Knudsen said. Wilansky had been handing out bottles of water to protesters when a grenade landed near her forearm. Suddenly, it detonated, according to witnesses. Initially, protesters feared the worst: Doctors would have to amputate her arm due to the explosion. Wilansky noted his daughter, who might need as many as 20 surgeries to repair her forearm, still remained focused on the pipeline fight. The North Dakota Joint Information Center also released photos of improvised weapons that law enforcement said protesters used against them during the confrontation at Backwater Bridge. Authorities said they recovered a punctured propane cylinder, rocks and glass jars, which they said are commonly used to make Molotov cocktails. According to KFYR, police say protesters were seen running to the area where the explosion had happened. The group pulled a female from under a burned vehicle on the bridge, then fled, authorities said. Despite the gruesome injury to Sophia Wilansky, protesters vowed to move ahead with further protests. As for the pipeline, construction has stalled as the Corps of Engineers engages in talks with Native American leaders.
