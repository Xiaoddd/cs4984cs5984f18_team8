Greenpeace estimates there's an average of about 20,000 oil spills each year, mostly from corroded pipelines, totalling five million tons of crude oil and petroleum products released into the environment annually. Some Russian government estimates put the amount even higher. Greenpeace has called on Gazprom to abandon its drilling plans over safety concerns.

Komi is one of Russia's largest and oldest oil provinces but ruptures in aging pipelines and leaks from decommissioned oil wells make oil spills in the region routine. Environmentalists estimate at least 1 percent of Russia's annual oil production, or 5 million tons is spilled every year. For decades, Russia has been the pioneer in Arctic development, and it continues to forge ahead. Scientists say sea ice in the Arctic shrank to an all-time low on Sept. 16, at least since satellite records began in 1979.

(Courtesy Elena Wilson Rowe) The government wanted a populated north, and so that was an economic goal. When the Soviet Union began to collapse in 1989, there were nearly 10 million people in the Russian north. The economic chaos and liberalization that followed led to a major migration south. By 2006, one-sixth of the population had left the region. In the hardest-hit regions of Chukotka, nearly 74 per cent of people left, and in Magadan, out-migration was over 57 per cent. Census takers arrived to find ghost towns. This drilling rig at the Val Gamburtseva oil fields in Russia's Arctic region is owned by state oil company Rosneft. On April 4, 2006 a brand-new pipeline threads off over the icy horizon behind the rig. Russia's policy goal is for the Arctic to become its primary resource base by 2020. An elderly Nenets reindeer herder sits on his sled among the buildings of the Val Gamburtseva oil fields in Russia's Arctic region, April 4, 2006. He's from the Komi indigenous group, born in Komi Republic, which is south of the Barents Sea. He grew up in Pechora, a town on the Pechora River, which is the third largest in Europe, measured by discharge. It drains into the Arctic. In the area of Komi where he's from, people rely on hunting and fishing, along with some reindeer herding. Some areas along the Pechora are among the regions of the Russian north that have the highest levels of heavy metal contamination. This oil spill is near Usinsk, Komi Republic, in 2011. One of the worst on record was in the Usinsk in 1994, resulting in a spill of 100,000 to 350,000 tons of oil-containing fluids that badly affected three rivers, including the Pechora, and resulted in a dramatic decrease in fish stock. He said that Komi is famous for its environmental movement, especially attempts to save the Pechora. Four years later he was on staff and since 2000 he has headed their energy program. Greenpeace's Vladimir Chuprov, at a drained thermokarst lake on Yamal peninsula in northern Russia in 2009. A thermokarst lake, also called a thaw lake or cave-in lake, is a body of freshwater, usually shallow, that is formed in a depression by meltwater from thawing permafrost. In August, a conference of Arctic indigenous peoples hosted in Komi called for a moratorium on onshore oil drilling in the Arctic and a ban on all offshore oil drilling on the Arctic shelf. Russia is easily the worst oil polluter in the world. Some Russian government estimates put the amount even higher. In northern Russia, no real rehabilitation takes place in areas with oil spills, the Greenpeace report states. A 2010 report commissioned by the Russian government estimates that 500,000 tons of that spilled oil makes its way into rivers in northern Russia and then ends up in the Arctic Ocean. Next: offshore drilling Russia's plans to drill for oil in the Arctic seas worry Chuprov. Greenpeace activists board Gazprom's Arctic oil platform Prirazlomnaya in the Pechora Sea on Aug. 24. The activists, including Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo, said they were protesting oil drilling in the Arctic. Greenpeace has called on Gazprom to abandon its drilling plans over safety concerns. With production expected to begin later this year at Gazprom's sole Arctic rig, in the Pechora Sea, Greenpeace activists boarded the platform in August. The protest lasted about 15 hours. On Sept. 21, Reuters reported that Gazprom will delay the start of production. Gazprom declined to make an official comment. Production is expected to begin about a year from now. Russian energy companies have signed partnership agreements with Shell, ExxonMobil, Total and Statoil for their Arctic offshore plans. Another method is to burn the spilled oil, but it's difficult to get crude oil to burn in temperatures under zero degrees Centigrade. Pollution from outside Russia a big problem Lars-Otto Reiersen of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program says science and industry have not found an effective method to deal with an oil spill that could result from offshore drilling in the Arctic. Despite all that, Reiersen stresses that Russia itself is not the main source of pollution in the Russian north. It's the wind-borne transport of mercury persistent organic pollutants and industrial chemicals from all over the world, especially Asia. Reiersen explained that these pollutants then accumulate in the food chain and especially the food sources for indigenous people.
