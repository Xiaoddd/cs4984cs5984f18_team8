Find my writing here. Feb 19 I started studying Russian in high school. I thought it was cool it was even offered, and everybody else was studying Spanish or French. And it was a fantastic, challenging language, taught by a fun teacher. It was years after the Cold War. I remember frequently being made fun of as a communist for studying Russian, and I just rolled with it. Never mind that the Cold War was over, and that Russia was already reeling from the collapse and US-influenced rapid deregulation and privatization. I think even back then I was puzzled that other high school kids had formed such intense opinions of a country none of us knew anything about. Communist was a bad word. This was never expanded on, but any conversation was quick to turn to anecdotes about bread lines, selling American blue jeans. I suppose studying Russian was really my first introduction to the influence and pervasiveness of propaganda. And it really was everywhere. Movie villains of the time were holdover communists, stereotypes were ingrained in our understanding of Russians, and in video game characters. I continued studying Russian a decade later, and got to practice frequently with Russian friends I made through teaching ESL. They were nothing like the stereotypes we grew up with, of course. People were friendly and interested; there were no jokes about being a commie. I guess Russia was friends and the post-9-11 propaganda had shifted. Look around you now and all of that has changed again. Russians agitated us to protest it. Aside: Narratives are at once the most incredible human tool for cataloguing the world, and the most terrible tool used against us. Find out where your ideas come from. If you respond harshly to somebody challenging your narratives, question why that happened as well. These narratives are used to protect the establishment, to protect white supremacy, to justify imperialism and the way we externalize the destruction of human lives and environments across the world.
