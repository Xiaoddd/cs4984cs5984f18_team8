They continue fighting the project in the courts, a legal battle most British Columbians remain oblivious to. If built, Site C would also destroy more than 6,000 hectares of farmland. Passionate critics of the project and third-generation Peace River valley farmers, the couple face imminent loss of their home and land. If built, the Site C dam would take a deadly toll on local fish, animal and unique plant species. Certainly, the Tsay Keh Dene people living in the remote communities of Fort Ware and Ingenika will not. More than 50 years ago, their rivers and lands disappeared when the W.A.C. Bennett dam created the seventh-largest artificial body of water on earth. A water body now so poisoned with mercury that Indigenous people and anglers are still warned not to eat its fish. But if dollars and cents are what move you, Site C means more dollars and makes no sense. Economists have said so. A former head of BC Hydro has said so. With major work on the dam not even started, our Hydro bills are already climbing well beyond inflation, in part because of costs coming due on repairs and upgrades at existing dams, and questionable investment decisions by BC Hydro. By 2018, we will pay nearly 30 per cent more for our power than we did in 2013. And you can count on those costs escalating. They have everywhere else. In 2014, research published in the journal Energy Research and Social Science showed that of 61 hydroelectric projects analyzed worldwide, the average cost escalation was 70.6 per cent. The governing party vows to push Site C past the point of no return. Meanwhile, the Opposition says it will refer the matter to the B.C. Utilities Commission for independent review, but has yet to say unequivocally whether it will allow it to proceed or kill it. Surely, it is time that this unprecedented project became a defining election issue.
