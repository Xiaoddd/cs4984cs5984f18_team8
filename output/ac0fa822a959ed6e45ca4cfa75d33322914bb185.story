The blue line is the boundary of Corps property, the red area is the area currently being protected by ND law enforcement at the request of the Corps: It appears from the letter that the Seven Council Fires Camp is the one the Corps wants cleared, with everyone moving down to the Rosebud Camp (still on Corps property) or to the Standing Rock Reservation land south of that. So far the feds have largely withheld law enforcement support. but there was an error posting your comment.
