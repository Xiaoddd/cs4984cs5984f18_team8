Using peace, prayer, and non-violent direct action, hundreds were arrested and physically abused at the hands of militarized police. A movement had begun, and the sides were drawn. There were the violent oil companies and police who stood for continued exploitation of the world and prolonged human rights abuses on one side. On the other side stood a growing number who believed that peace, green energy, and community were the solution to this era of violence, pollution, and greed. Defund DAPL began near the end of 2016 to bring attention to an enemy yet unnoticed: the banks. Urging individuals to divest from banks funding DAPL, a new movement had begun. The banks, many now recognized, were the ones financing pipelines, dirty fuel, and the desecration of the Earth. The companies were just the pawns meant to rake in money for the billionaire bankers. But pipelines are only the beginning. Banks also finance the private prison industry. Private prisons are operated by corporations who have contracts with the government. They run the prisons and get paid. Thus, putting people behind bars becomes a money-making scheme. The two leaders in the private prison industry are Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and GEO Group. While many banks contribute to their operations, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, U.S. Bancorp and JPMorgan Chase are the primary lenders. These six banks also helped fund the construction of DAPL. We do not have to live in a world where we struggle to stop one crisis at a time. At the center of Climate Change, Social Inequality, War, and For-Profit-Prisons, lies a system making these inhumane industries possible. Give DeFundDAPL a round of applause.
