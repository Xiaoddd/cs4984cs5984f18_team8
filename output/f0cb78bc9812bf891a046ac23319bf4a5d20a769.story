'script', 'twitter-wjs'); Today, for the umpteenth time in the history of Plains Indians-U.S. relations, the United States government is using its military might to evict indigenous people from their land so that settlers can extract a profitable resource from the earth. To some non-indigenous people looking into this moment from the outside, this may seem an abstract exaggeration. No one has died, they might say. There are legal dimensions to the issue. But this is no exaggeration. Today, on February 22, 2017, the United States is repeating history, and unless we get ourselves, our cities, our states, our pension funds, and our universities to divest from banks financing the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) and Keystone XL Pipeline (KXL), we all have oil on our hands. In 1851, the U.S. government subjected Lakota and Dakota bands to the Fort Laramie Treaty. When settlers discovered gold within the bounds of the Great Sioux Nation, the United States government used its military might to break its own treaty. Over time, the U.S. Army forced people out of that treaty land and onto increasingly smaller reservations. Today, on February 22, 2017, North Dakota Law Enforcement, the National Guard, DAPL mercenaries, and even our own relatives in the BIA Indian Police are evicting from this same land, indigenous people who dare to stand up to corporate interests for the next Seven Generations and Mother Earth. They have asserted this whole time that they are home by reminding everyone that the camps are completely within the boundaries of the Great Sioux Nation. Water Protectors did not endure German Shepherds, violations of their dignity, tear gas, rubber bullet wounds, and water cannons in freezing temperatures for the past seven months, just for the rest of us to shrug our shoulders and wait for the courts to bring justice. It would be foolish to put all of our eggs into the courts. This is larger than Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, than Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, than any of the Water Protectors being evicted on the ground. Law enforcement may be evicting the Oceti Oyate and Oceti Sakowin camps today, but they cannot evict the Spirit of Standing Source: Indian Country Today Rock. Decades of colonialist policies have estranged us from our land, from our people, and from our ways of living. But because of those policies of displacement, we are everywhere, and we can use that to our advantage in this moment. Millions of us entrust our money, investments, pensions, and taxpayer money to banks financing DAPL. Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and more, all have complete control of our money. It may be inconvenient and arduous for individuals and administrators to make the switch, but drinking oil is also inconvenient. If you have access to the internet, a phone, and some time, you can carry the movement from Standing Rock. Take San Francisco as an example. A group of individuals from various Native Nations, labor organizations, and climate justice organizations have been inspired to see indigenous activists pressure Seattle, Davis, and other cities and institutions to divest from banks financing DAPL. So, they came together to create the indigenous-led San Francisco Defund DAPL Coalition. The Coalition has conducted hours upon hours of research to learn lessons from the indigenous leaders of the Seattle Defund DAPL Coalition, gather data from Food & Water Watch, find alternative commercial banks, and even draft an ordinance for divesting City funds. However, the Coalition has faced one significant challenge: a lack of empathy and urgency from people in power. It is likely that other divestment campaigns will meet the same challenge. When people in power do not make time in their busy schedules to work with indigenous activists, they are signaling to the President and the world that Indians are, indeed, unworthy of our political energies. But the apathy and lack of urgency is not exclusive to non-indigenous elected officials. When we, as administrators or as individuals, postpone switching our banks because it is inconvenient, or because we are too busy, we are signaling to the Powers that Be, that we are okay with them using our hard earned money to build a pipeline through the second largest source of drinking water in this country. To put it simply, we need to divest from banks financing the Dakota Access Pipeline because the value of our money, endowments, pensions, and investments should not rise with increasing repression of indigenous and human rights. We owe it to all of them to carry on the torch of this movement to cities across the country. Find a credit union near you at culookup.com. If you are starting a campaign, you do not have to start from scratch. By signing up through this website, you will have access to a network of indigenous rights activists, including those in Seattle and San Francisco, who do their homework, organize strategic demonstrations, and have massive social media platforms. They are actively sharing tips, questions, and research to make local campaigns stronger and more unified. To the banks funding DAPL, Keystone XL, and other pipelines: When you profit from the repression of our relatives and the exploitation of our Mother, your bottom line will suffer. To the elected and appointed officials across the country who ignore or aid and abet in the violation of indigenous rights: We are still here, and we will continue to be here to remind you: Mni Wiconi (Water is Life) and we pray for you.
