Tom Berry, of Dandelion Spring Farm in Newcastle, and Annie Bayer, of Buckwheat Blossom Farm in Wiscasset, had a 2,000-mile road trip they needed to get started on. By late afternoon, they had received word that the roads were beginning to clear and they started their trek south in a 10-foot insulated box truck filled with winter provisions that were destined for the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota. While the Army Corps of Engineers said Dec. 4 that it would not permit the advancement of the pipeline, some protesters remain in camps on the reservation. Having recently retired the 10-foot insulated truck from their fleet, Schiller said the decision to donate it to the Standing Rock community was easy. However, Schiller said she was truly surprised by the outpouring of support from fellow community members, farmers and otherwise, in their willingness to help them collect items to donate. Money was also raised to fund gas costs for the trip, with any extra money being donated to the Standing Rock community. However, Schiller said the ethics behind the donation and solidarity with a community 2,000 miles away extended beyond the issue of the pipeline. Beyond the ethical motivation to continue with the donation, contact that those involved in organizing the donation had with people at Standing Rock indicated that a need was still there. One of the people Schiller had been in contact with was Lauren Pignatello, an herbalist from Whitefield who recently returned to Maine after spending three weeks at Standing Rock treating the injured with homeopathic healing techniques.
