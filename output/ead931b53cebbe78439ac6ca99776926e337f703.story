This approval comes as the Dakota Access Pipeline, which the Trump administration also recently pushed through, nears completion. The Morton County Sheriff would later announce that no weapons were found at the camps. Resistance against DAPL was much like resistance against the Keystone XL Pipeline, which has a storied history of protests and resistance pledges. Indigenous-led resistance also occurred against the Keystone XL. In 2014, a series of spirit camps, much like Sacred Stone Camp, were also erected in the path of the Keystone XL pipeline. The state of South Dakota is already preparing for renewed Keystone XL protests and passed laws against protests which may mimic previously seen anti-pipeline tactics.
