A helicopter and tracked vehicles were involved in the pursuit. Behind the images of the large number of police and security dotting the snow-covered terrain played, background radios from the Standing Rock medics could be heard. On the other side of the concertina wire and the heavy concrete dividers, spread over the entire bridge, more now than ever before, were the police with their mounted sound cannon, a variety of tracked, militarized vehicles, generators and bright lights. There is friendly chatter in the background. In the distance another woman can be heard singing also. Praying or their families. DAPL is not going to buy you water. When they are done with you they will throw you away like used toilet paper. But if you notice, see all the dots and lights. They are still drilling. Probably under the water. You are trespassing. We ask you to go back to the bridge. Comply with the agreement. What we are doing is not illegal. Everyone is singing prayer songs now. Please come pray with us. It seems now to be a symbol for the lies and ruthlessness of those working in behalf of the now officially illegal effort of DAPL to being working on the pipeline. The reason still being given for keeping the bridge closed is that it may be structurally unsafe for traffic because two trucks on the bridge had been set on fire. al, a fire event with sufficient magnitude to damage a concrete bridge structure is rare. Most fire events will not exceed the threshold for bridge damage. Foremost is the fact that most fires involving bridges do not result in structural damage. Fire will have no effect on the stress concentration effects since the weldment geometry will not change. There may actually be a beneficial effect in that fire heating may act like a stress relief treatment that reduces the residual stresses. Even if the trucks had been loaded with jet fuel and had not been put out by water cannons (after they were used on the Water Protectors), the trucks were not even actually on the bridge, let alone in the center of it. The lies that continue being spread must be challenged by authorities, perhaps the same ones who should be stopping the continuing work on the pipeline. Indeed, the heavy concrete barriers themselves likely weigh more than a moving truck. DAPL and the Local SO need to go home and chill out.
