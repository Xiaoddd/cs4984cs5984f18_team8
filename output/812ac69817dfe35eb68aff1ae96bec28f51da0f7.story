Kenrya Rankin Aug 23, 2017 6:04PM EDT An activist fights the wind as while walking along Flag Road in Oceti Sakowin Camp as blizzard conditions grip the area around the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on December 6, 2016, outside Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Native Americans and activists from around the country have been at the camp for several months trying to halt the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The proposed 1,172-mile-long pipeline would transport oil from the North Dakota Bakken region through South Dakota, Iowa and into Illinois. The Dallas-based company levels charges that the groups are in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, which is typically used to prosecute crime syndicates, like the Mafia. Logging company Resolute Forest Products filed a similar suit against Greenpeace last year. They are apparently trying to market themselves as corporate mercenaries willing to abuse the legal system to silence legitimate advocacy work. This complaint repackages spurious allegations and legal claims made against Greenpeace by the Kasowitz firm on behalf of Resolute Forest Products in a lawsuit filed in May 2016. It is yet another classic Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP), not designed to seek justice, but to silence free speech through expensive, time-consuming litigation. ETP seeks compensatory, punitive and exemplary damages, as well as an injunction to prevent the defendants from waging campaigns against their projects. Consequently, they allege that the water protector movement at Cannonball was nothing more than a green group fundraising scheme, and not a sincere, tribal environmental movement. It could also intimidate these big green groups from partnering with grass roots people in environmental campaigns. is published by Race Forward, a national organization that advances racial justice through research, media and practice.
