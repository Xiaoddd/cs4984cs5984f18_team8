There is a natural gas pipeline being built from Arizona to Sonora, Mexico that runs through 90 kilometers of protected Yaqui tribal land. Construction started even though a court had suspended its building. The Mexican authorities claimed one community could not stop something that will benefit many future generations to come. This pipeline runs through protected lands and needs to be stopped as it threatens the ecosystem as well as the people of the Yaqui tribe. Already, two people have been kidnapped and one has been killed in the fight to stop this pipeline. Anabela Carlon Flores, a Yaqui activist that taught community members to make films about indigenous rights, was abducted along with her husband. She has since been set free, but her husband remains missing. One person has been killed, along with eight others injured in a clash between supporters and non-supporters of the pipeline. The pipeline itself has impacts outside of the Yaqui community. The gas that flows through the pipeline is mostly methane, a known greenhouse gas that causes climate change. A leak could be devastating to the ecosystem around the pipeline. Sign this petition to stop the pipeline and protect the Yaqui tribe. PETITION LETTER: Dear President Nieto, A pipeline is being built trough northern Mexico that threatens over 50 miles of protected land. The backlash to this pipeline has already caused two people to be abducted, many injured, and one killed. The Yaqui tribe have demonstrated against the pipeline and succeeded in suspending the construction, but that was overlooked by your government. This pipeline not only threatens the Yaqui tribe, but also countless plant and animals species that exist around it. A natural gas leak would be devastating to the ecosystem, and the risk is not worth taking. The well-being of the Yaqui tribe as well as the survival of their protected land should not be put in jeopardy by this pipeline. Please use your power as president to stop this pipeline from being built and protect our environment for generations to come.
