688 institutions and nearly 60,000 individuals in 76 countries have divested themselves of shares in at least some kinds of oil, gas and coal companies, according to a new report.

It has also spread around the world, with 688 institutions and nearly 60,000 individuals in 76 countries divesting themselves of shares in at least some kinds of oil, gas and coal companies, according to the report. Ms. Dorsey argued that since its beginnings as a moral statement against profiting from companies whose products were exacerbating climate change, more institutions have come to detect vulnerabilities in fossil fuel companies as the world shifts toward renewable sources of energy. Divesting from coal, an industry in the midst of a long-term decline, has proved to be relatively straightforward, and recent drops in the prices of oil and gas have hurt the fortunes of those industries as well. Christopher D. Tucker, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said that the pro-divestment argument had been strengthened by industry troubles. While the overall value of the funds announcing divestment is measured in the trillions of dollars, the actual amount of investment that was tied to fossil fuels within those funds is much smaller, because no single industry sector predominates in most broad investment funds. Ryan Strode, the director of Arabella Advisors, the group that produced the report, said the precise value of dropped investments was impossible to know. Many institutions remain unconvinced.
