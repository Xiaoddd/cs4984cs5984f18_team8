Ayana Byrd Jun 8, 2018 12:59PM EDT The 600-mile Atlantic Coast pipeline will carry gas underground from West Virginia to North Carolina. If completed, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline will run for 600 miles underground, carrying gas from West Virginia to North Carolina. Many people living in the area disagree. According to Ryan Emanuel, an associate professor at North Carolina State University and a member of the Lumbee Indian tribe, approximately 30,000 Native Americans live near the proposed pipeline route. It is federal policy that FERC must review all major federal projects that could affect the environment. On May 15th, a coalition of environmental groups based in North Carolina filed a civil rights complaint with the Environmental Protection Agency against the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, accusing it of discrimination based on race and color when it issued permits for the pipeline. A decision is pending on the complaint.
