And now, thanks to a presidential memorandum, the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines have been brought back from the dead. Resurrection of Keystone and DAPL cements America's climate antagonism Read more Trump has sided with TransCanada, the company behind the Keystone XL pipeline, since as early as 2011. TransCanada, in turn, flirted back. The fights against those projects symbolized everything Trump and his cabinet appear to stand against: indigenous communities, working people, scientists, college students and more, all coming together to take on corporate interests and the governments that support them. Most unnervingly for Trump, we won. Republican leaders and the corporate interests who fund them rarely work within the kinds of issue silos that progressives tend to, segmenting concerns about the climate off from those about mass incarceration and labor rights. As resources become scarcer, more people will be criminalized and imprisoned, making way for the wealthy to keep consuming as much as they do now. And the types of Wall Street executives Trump has appointed to his cabinet could stand to make a fortune off the climate crisis, like they did after the Great Recession. The right is the most organized and unified force in America right now. The people opposing them might take a page from the people who killed the Dakota Access and Keystone pipelines the first time around and catch up, leaving the silos and single-issue fights behind.
