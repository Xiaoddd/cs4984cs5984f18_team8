I believe we all have an obligation to nurture our living earth in all the ways we can. These European immigrants referred to themselves as Saints, Puritans or Separatists. These native people were already familiar with Europeans and had been acquainted with Captain Thomas Hunt several years prior to the arrival of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. During Capt. In fact, the land that was settled by our Pilgrims at Plymouth was essentially a grave site, originally a Patuxet village which was wiped out by enslavement and the plague from the previous European visitors. Historical documents also show that these immigrants were not fleeing Europe in search of religious freedom as we were taught to believe. Once at Plymouth Plantation, the settlers met one remaining Patuxet tribesman named Squanto. He had survived slavery in England and had been transported back to his homeland with a good grasp of the English language. It was he who helped develop a peace treaty between the Wampanoag Nation and the Colonists. He also taught the white settlers to grow corn and to fish and hunt in these wild new lands.

During the feasting, the disembodied heads of Natives were kicked through the streets like balls. An estimated 90,000 people lived in southern New England before contact with Europeans. Our modern day Thanksgiving, although it has evolved into a noble celebration, is based upon myths. These myths, however, do provide an important glimpse of our cultural heritage. Learning, and teaching, the true history of this holiday can make the celebration more meaningful as we, as a people, continue to cultivate our tolerance of others. Most all primitive cultures, including Indigenous Americans, gathered in periodic feasts of thanksgiving to honor the Creator for their harvests and well being. These were tradition well before recorded history. Simple remembrance and respect are the least we can do. We can also extend this season of thanks beyond one meal, a parade and a football game. 7 Things You Can Do to Help Fight the Dakota Access Pipeline Despite protesters' months-long efforts, the Dakota Access Pipeline is almost complete in North Dakota.
