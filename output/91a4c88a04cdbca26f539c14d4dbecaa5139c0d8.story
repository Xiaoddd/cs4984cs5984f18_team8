Robinson Meyer Feb 10, 2017 A woman looks out over the Oceti Sakowin camp near the site of the Dakota Access pipeline in January. In his first three weeks in office, President Donald Trump bucked norms about executive propriety and canceled an environmental-impact review ordered by the Obama administration. Normally, any easement issued by the federal government would require a two-week waiting period, but this time the Army Corps specifically waived that pause. So in what will likely be their final attempt to block the mega-infrastructure project, the local Sioux tribes have reached for a new, emergency legal argument: They allege that the pipeline will harm their First Amendment rights. The tribes argue that their religion depends on the purity and sanctity of the water of Lake Oahe, and that the pipeline could permanently harm this water. As the Army Corps has previously considered moving the pipeline, the Sioux say that it is not an onerous request for them to move it now, out of religious concerns. But RFRA originally emerged out of concern for the sovereignty of Native American tribes and nations. In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that Oregon was within its rights to fire two Native American employees after they failed a drug test for mescaline. This ruling, combined with other cases where Native groups alleged that federal infrastructure projects violated sacred land, prompted the initial passage of RFRA. The problem he identifies comes back to an old, familiar one for the tribe: While the pipeline crosses land that was granted to the Sioux under the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie, the land was later stolen from the tribe, and the tribe can make no modern-day property claim. The tribe threads this needle by saying that the waters of Lake Oahe are held by the federal government in trust to the tribe. Were the pipeline to leak, the United States would abrogate this duty. The brief makes one more important argument. Under Hobby Lobby, the courts have to be careful not to inquire too much into the sincerity of any religious claim. But Laycock said it is unlikely to matter. In its quest to block the Dakota Access pipeline, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has reached for one federal statute after another. Over the summer, it argued the pipeline violated its rights to a historic review under the National Historic Preservation Act. Throughout the fall, it sought an environmental-review statement required under the National Environmental Policy Act. The Obama administration granted it just such a review in early December. But that decision was vacated in the first days of the Trump administration. On Thursday, a former Cabinet secretary to President Obama condemned this decision. And therein lies the final problem for the Standing Rock Sioux. We want to hear what you think about this article.
