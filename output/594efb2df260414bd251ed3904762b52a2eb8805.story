It could bring legal headaches for Gov. Roy Cooper. This detail was disclosed Friday, Jan. 26, when a key state environmental permit was issued by the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality. Now both opponents and supporters of the pipeline are questioning the fund. More recently, a legal challenge to an environmental fund created by a corporation was filed last year in Wake County by the conservative Civitas Institute and the New Hanover County Board of Education. It is pending in the N.C. Court of Appeals. None of the funds in these cases, however, were under the direct control of the governor. The immediate objections to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline fund are of an ethical and political nature. SHARE COPY LINK VIDEO: A group of about 30 people opposed to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline vow to stay in NC Gov. Cooper's office until they are removed or arrested Friday, Feb. 2, 2018. By Therese Vick, a social justice organizer for the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League, expressed dismay that the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality issued the controversial permit as Cooper worked out a financial deal on the side. She said the organization she works for would not bid for grants from a fund that she deems tainted money. N&O file photo Cooper issued his own statement Friday to announce the mitigation fund, and the N.C. Porter rejected the notion that the fund is a pay-to-play scheme or a quid pro quo. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline reached a similar agreement last month in Virginia. But that deal is between the pipeline consortium and the state government, not with a named elected official. Because the pipeline will cross three states, the pipeline group is also negotiating a funding agreement with West Virginia authorities, said Aaron Ruby, spokesman for Richmond-based Dominion Energy, one of the two lead pipeline partners along with Charlotte-based Duke Energy. Ruby said the North Carolina agreement satisfies a federal requirement to remedy harmful impacts on migratory birds and loss of forest habitat. These funds pay for home repair, new appliances and other upgrades for low-income households. That money was designated for a specific group: the nonprofit N.C. Community Action Association, to be spent according to need determined by that organization. Public Staff, the state agency that represents customers in utility matters before the Utilities Commission. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline mitigation fund will be paid for by Duke Energy and other utilities that will buy the gas from the project, McGee said. Utilities Commission. Apex lawyer Paul Stam, a former N.C. House member, is reviewing the legality of the pipeline fund for clients who are interested in a legal challenge. Stam is representing the Civitas Institute in its pending lawsuit that alleges that Cooper, in his previous job as state attorney general, improperly diverted money from a pollution fund to finance environmental projects, rather than for funding public education. The state constitution requires that money collected from fines and penalties be used to fund public schools. Last October, a Wake County judge dismissed the case, and Stam filed an appeal on Jan. 19. Stam acknowledged that the Atlantic Coast Pipeline fund is different from the Smithfield fund or other funds that were disallowed by the Supreme Court. In all those cases, he said, the funds could be tied to violations, enforcements and penalties. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline fund was created before the project began construction, so there is no possibility of violations or fines.
