Archambault was not immediately available for comment. In October, he called on the justice department to investigate police tactics against overwhelmingly peaceful protesters. The ACLU North Dakota and Amnesty International have also called for a formal investigation. The camp lies just north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, on public land managed by the corps, close to the site where the disputed pipeline is slated to cross under the Missouri river. The tribe fears that the pipeline will jeopardize its water source and destroy sacred sites. Despite the looming deadline, protesters continue to arrive at the snow-covered camp, where tipis, yurts, RVs, and wooden shelters have replaced the sea of camping tents that have housed thousands for months. Jumping Buffalo was helping to coordinate the delivery of two trucks of firewood to feed the wood stoves that are keeping people warm. Elsewhere in camp, 1,500lb of propane was delivered by truck, giant snowmen were decorated with anti-pipeline slogans, and men in pickup trucks and on bicycles towed children around on sleds.
