The people at Standing Rock think of themselves as protectors and not protestors. The proposed routes for the Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast pipelines. Yost is a high school math teacher who went on leave to fight against the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP). Along with the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP), these two shale gas pipelines would stretch approximately 850 miles. The ACP alone would stretch approximately 500 miles, beginning in West Virginia and running through Virginia and North Carolina. Investors began heavily pushing for the pipeline build-out in what is known as the Marcellus and Utica shale region in 2014, with survey and route planning beginning in May of that year. The pre-filing request with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission took place later in October of 2014. The ACP was proposed by Dominion Pipeline, Duke Energy, Piedmont Natural Gas, and AGL Resources and the MVP was proposed by EQT Midstream Partner, NextEra US Gas Assets, WGL Midstream, and Vega Midstream MVP.

The IEFFA suggests the following after reviewing their report on the pipelines: That the applications for the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipelines be suspended until a regional planning process can be developed for pipeline infrastructure; That FERC lower the returns on equity granted to pipeline developers; and That an investigation be conducted into the relatively high failure rate of new pipelines Greg Yost, who volunteers for Alliance To Protect Our People And The Places We Live (APPPL) is strongly against gas pipelines due to the dangers of leaked methane emissions, which occur throughout the process of fracking and transporting shale gas. The FERC allowing such high returns creates a situation where investors flock to build pipelines in areas where there is no justification for such a project. Such overbuilding will create a scenario where ratepayers will see increases in their utilities as companies attempt to recoup lost capital. How This Project Could Harm Communities The ACP is currently scheduled to route through Robeson, North Carolina, which is home to the Native Lumbee Tribe. The tribe is currently pushing for federal legislation granting full recognition to the North Carolina Lumbee Tribe. The tribe has a rich history, with over 55,000 members living in North Carolina, making the tribe the largest in the nation east of the Mississippi River and the ninth largest in the United States. The tribe could face the same challenges that caught international attention at Standing Rock, North Dakota. Olivia Neeley, a journalist for the Wilson (North Carolina) Times, recently spoke to several members of her community after members began speaking out against the construction of the ACP. Members of the Wilson community also believe there could be major environmental, safety, and water quality risks. Many residents along the proposed pipeline route depend on well water, which comes from groundwater. Local Resistant To The Pipelines APPPL Logo The APPPL organized The Walk To Protect Our People And The Places We Live, which took place in the middle of March of this year. The APPPL is planning to resist the construction of the pipeline throughout the entire process until it is defeated. Along with the environmental concerns, Greg is also worried about the economic future of North Carolina if the ACP is constructed.
