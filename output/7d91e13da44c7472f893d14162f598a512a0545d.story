(AllHipHop Features) Indigenous Hip-Hop artists have been around for many years, but now they are taking their voice to new volumes as. These days, the Native people this land have been abused, persecuted and treated like third class citizens, but the media has largely ignored these matters. Standing Rock has been the cornerstone the most recent infraction against Indigenous People. However, the situation in the Dakotas is very much in line with the legacy legalized genocide that has happened on this land since the pilgrims descended in The Americas. The Indigenous people in America are still here and shts pretty fcked up. So for us as Indigenous artists, we wanted to express what was going on in our communities so we started to do our own shows.

Indigenous Hip-Hop heads are not unlike everybody else that has experienced major struggle and they align themselves with other that have also faced oppression.

However, the conversation was purely Hip-Hop and Nataanii Means and Quese talked about their Top 5 Dead or Alive (seen in the video), how they make it through the tough times and their indomitable will that helps them continue to fight injustice. Every single day. I saw a woman get dragged down by her breasts by the private security firm. To fight hard. Now we got legal battles because Standing Rock. All Rights Reserved.
