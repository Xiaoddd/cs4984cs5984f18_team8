The plaintiff, Ciara Newton, worked at Shell as a refinery process operator beginning in January 2016. In the complaint, she alleges that she was discriminated against and harassed by supervisors and co-workers because of her gender. The lawsuit describes a male-dominated work setting in which coworkers made disparaging comments about women and in which supervisors undermined Newton and complained about women in the workplace. Sonya Smallets, the attorney representing Newton in the case, said that in her years of experience handling workplace harassment or discrimination, complaints about harassment often go unresolved by human resources departments. Newton is also suing for wrongful termination, alleging that Shell retaliated when she complained of the sexual harassment and discrimination she experienced, as well as when she attempted to properly document and contain a sulfuric acid spill at the refinery. She has written for Bay Area newspapers and magazines on topics including business, politics, economics, education, crime and public safety.
