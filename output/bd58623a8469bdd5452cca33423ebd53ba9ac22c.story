Hundreds of tribes came together in a display of tribal unity not seen in hundreds of years. Thousands of people, both those within Native American communities and their non-Native allies, felt called to go to Standing Rock. As a Native American scholar of environmental history and religion, I believe that for most individuals who gathered at the site, it was a modern-day pilgrimage. Their answer was twofold. Individuals on a pilgrimage usually have these experiences both while traveling to certain places of transcendence and while at those sacred places. Joe Brusky, CC BY-NC Lakota scholar Philip Deloria, has also described how the transformative experience of Native American sacred places provides meaning and personal growth for individuals who journey to be in their presence. My cousin Renee LaPier and her daughter Modesta LaPier, for example, journeyed 2,600 miles to and from Standing Rock. And once at the site, they encountered a transformative experience. Going on a pilgrimage. Joe Brusky, CC BY-NC Modern-day pilgrimage It is not just Native Americans who have gone to Standing Rock. On Dec. 5 an estimated 2,000 U.S. veterans, both Native American and their non-Native allies, made their pilgrimage to Standing Rock in a freezing blizzard. They came from across the U.S. and other parts of the world; they represented American veterans from many conflicts and wars, including older Korean and Vietnam vets and younger Iraqi vets. She explains how they are blending their individual religious ideas and political activism into a new form of religious expression. Many Native Americans and non-Native allies viewed going to Standing Rock as a pilgrimage. I have read hundreds of social media posts of people who were drawn to go there as a spiritual quest, reflecting on how the experience changed their sense of identity, gave meaning to their lives, provided a sense of community and transformed them forever. I believe a modern kind of pilgrimage for Native Americans is emerging in which people travel to sites of collective action as a form of religious practice. It is true that some come for personal goals of spiritual awakening and some to journey to a sacred place. And, there are others who undertake a spiritual journey to find community, and purpose.
