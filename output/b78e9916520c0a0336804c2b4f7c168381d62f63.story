The two-year degrees proposed by the government will cost the same as a three-year course, meaning annual fees for them will be higher. Before the official announcement on Friday, concerns were raised about how education standards would be maintained and the workload fast-track degrees would impose on staff. The University and College Union (UCU) said the proposals would do little to open up the university experience to more students but appeared to be aimed at helping for-profit companies thrive in the higher education sector. The UCU general secretary, Sally Hunt, said the only saving grace of fast-track degrees would be if they were available at cut price, which was not the case under the plans. The Russell Group, which represents 24 leading universities, also expressed fears about the impact on learning. The proposals will apply to institutions in England. The fee hike would be limited to the accelerated courses and universities would have to prove they were investing the same resources in the fast-track students as in those studying for a conventional degree. Education ministers think the reduced timeframe will appeal to those who are in a hurry to get into, or return to, the workplace. Those who take up the new qualifications would forgo the traditional long summer and winter breaks in exchange for the faster pace of the degree. Although the fees for each year could increase, it is thought the system would appeal to students keen to cut down on living and accommodation costs. The promotion of two-year degrees was a manifesto pledge from the Conservatives. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Universities minister Jo Johnson is to deliver a speech on the plans on Friday. Although two-year degrees were pushed by previous Labour and coalition administrations, universities have been slow to adopt the format due to the current tuition fee cap. Up until now the qualifications have been cheaper than traditional degrees because of the tuition fee cap, which means some have seen them as inferior to conventional courses.

Johnson is also expected to try to introduce measures making it easier for students to transfer between universities.
