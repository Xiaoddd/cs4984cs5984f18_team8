The statement was statement released by STR, with input from members of the International Leonard Peltier Defense Committee. The Following is an excerpt: With our rally at Coleman and our actions to stop the Sabal Trail pipeline this week, we aim to honor Leonard Peltier, and remind the world that though he remains locked up, his spirit and his determination continues to inspire us and give us courage. And when we are victorious over the oil and gas companies polluting the water, disrespecting treaties and tearing apart communities with drugs and violence, that victory will also belong to him. While our desire and demand is to have Leonard Peltier free, we also know that we must also take actions to improve the conditions of his daily life inside prison. To this end, we join others in his global community of support in making this urgent request of the U.S. Government and its Bureau of Prisons. We ask that Leonard: (1) be placed in a lower security facility in the federal prison system; (2) that he be moved to a prison closer to his family and community, and (3) he is given immediate access to appropriate medical treatment in facility that can address his needs as a matter of urgency until he is granted release. These request can be sent in through this link.
