Donate The announcement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that it would deny a permit to Energy Party Transfers to drill under the Missouri River came as thousands of Native and non-Native military veterans descended on Standing Rock, vowing to form a human shield around the water protectors, who have faced an increasingly violent police crackdown.

This is Navy veteran Rob McHaney. AMY GOODMAN: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had originally said it would close access to the main resistance camps today, December 5th, setting up the possibility of a major showdown between the Department of the Army and thousands of veterans of the Army and other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. But instead, on Sunday, the Army announced it was denying the pipeline permit. This is Native American veteran Adan Bearcub reacting to the news. ADAN BEARCUB: This lifted my heart. You know, we came down here from Washington state to support these brave water protectors. And we came in yesterday expecting the worst, but this is the best news that I have heard forever, the best news for Native people, Native country, the whole United States, all the people, because water is so precious. I think everyone at camp is also cautious, as well. And until the project has actually ended, we will continue to move forward in the same fashion that we have been all along. It was the Army that made this decision to deny the permit. Phyllis had put out a call to Wesley, and he answered. And with him came over 2,000 veterans to Standing Rock. REMY: Oh, yes, Wesley Clark Jr. So, right now, you have about almost 10,000 people here at camp in support of our movement to stop this pipeline. So, in our culture, I call him chichei. Chichei Mike Kiyaani was a Navajo code talker. He was instrumental in winning the World War II, the code that was never broken. He was a holy person. He came out, reached out about a couple weeks ago. And he wanted some on-the-ground organizing that was happening, so he reached out to me. He wanted somebody who was trusted and also a veteran. So, having been here so long, we made a connection. Today was really ground zero, but now all that changes with the denial of the permit. REMY: Well, until the project has ended, we are not planning to go anywhere. This is similar to some of the struggles we encounter in Arizona. And so, again, we have natural resources and indigenous cultures, and the corporations that profit from it. It is because of our coal on our reservation that we made progress possible. We provide electricity in not only Arizona, but Nevada, but also somewhat of Southern California, as well. And so, I saw this as the natural transition to come here and offer what I could in service of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. REMY: Yes, she did. She answered the call, as well. It was great to have her come on board and get involved. She was well received, and she does a lot of great work herself. So, we welcome her with open arms and fully support her and her bringing the message not only to, you know, Hawaii, but the rest of the world and her followers. Prior to Wesley Clark Jr.'s call, we had many veterans that had stood up against police and have held off police, using this knowledge that they had got from the state. And these are tactics and these are techniques that we've been given, that we went in service for. And, really, you have seen a resurgence of the pride that comes with serving our country, because, again, this is our land originally. We do whatever it takes to protect it, because it protects us. It gives us life. And water is a part of that. And we respect it, and we protect it. AMY GOODMAN: Remy, I want to thank you for being with us, Navy veteran, member of the Navajo Nation, movement artist, organizer who helped organize Veterans Stand for Standing Rock. Thousands came to North Dakota this weekend. She was 22 years old. The War and Peace Report.
