Energy Transfer Partners had planned to route the 1,172-mile pipeline under the Missouri River just north of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. Investigation It's unclear what prompted the confrontation, though Bidziil and police reports indicate the masked men were following him around town. The Bismarck Police Department acknowledged in a news release issued Wednesday officers were called to the Ramada Inn for the altercation, adding it is investigating the report as a case of reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct. Police said suspects have been identified and are being investigated, though no charges have been filed, Bismarck Police Officer Pat Renz told the Herald. He said the department knows who they are but declined to name the victims in the case. Attempts by the Herald to reach Bidziil were unsuccessful. Bidziil has been critical of the pipeline on social media and in online news stories. Posts on his Facebook page insinuate North Dakota law enforcement may have been involved in the confrontation. The incident garnered a response from international hacking group Anonymous, which also has been critical of how law enforcement has handled the protests.
