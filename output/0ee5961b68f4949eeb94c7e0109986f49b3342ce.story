The Dakota Access Pipeline project would extend 1,168 miles across North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois, crossing through communities, farms, tribal land, sensitive natural areas and wildlife habitat. This massive crude oil pipeline that would carry 450,000 barrels of fracked oil per day from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to Illinois where it will link with another pipeline that will transport the oil to terminals and refineries along the Gulf of Mexico. Over the past several weeks, the mounting opposition to the pipeline has grown exponentially, captivating both activists around the country and the media, while uniting and mobilizing Native American tribes across the country in an unprecedented manner. The pipeline poses significant threats to the environment, public health, and tribal and human rights. Given that, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has filed a lawsuit and a request for a preliminary injunction to block construction of the pipeline. DAPL is a major project that should have required more thorough review and analysis under the Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Historic Preservation Act and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, as well as federal trust responsibilities guaranteed in the 1851 and 1868 United States treaties with the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota tribes. It was not intended for massive interstate pipelines that transport hazardous fossil fuels for hundreds of miles through communities and waterways and pose grave risks of leaks, spills, and explosions. The National Environmental Policy Act requires that a full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) be completed for major actions that impact the environment. Given the size, scale, environmental risks and controversy of this project, Nationwide Permit 12 should not have been applied. Pipelines must be evaluated fully and in a transparent manner with opportunity for public input in order to be held to the same national interest and climate standards as the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, which we applaud you for rejecting last year. We, the organizations signed below, support the tribes and landowners along the pipeline route in their fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline project. Until that occurs, construction on this project should not be allowed to continue. We further call on your administration to revoke Nationwide Permit 12 or modify it to prevent the segmentation of pipelines in the future and resume its prior practice of evaluating the environmental impacts of individual fossil fuel pipelines.
