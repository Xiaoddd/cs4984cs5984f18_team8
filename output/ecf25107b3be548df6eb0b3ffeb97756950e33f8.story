The pipeline is planned to cross the Missouri within a half mile of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. So far, those fighting the Dakota Access pipeline have shrugged off the heavy snow, icy winds and frigid temperatures that have swirled around their large encampment on the North Dakota grasslands. Hundreds were arrested and injured during recent protests and skirmishes. Sunday's decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to further study the impact of building the nearly completed pipeline under Lake Oahe by the Missouri River offers at least a temporary victory to the activists that could be undone once President-elect Donald Trump takes office. From Illinois, the pipeline connects to existing networks to bring the oil as far south as Nederland, Texas. Groups such as Environment Texas opposing some pipeline projects in Texas, such as Energy Transfer's Trans-Pecos pipeline from West Texas to Mexico, see progress even if the Dakota Access Pipeline is built but rerouted. The tribe uses Lake Oahe for its water supply. Trump effect Some industry analysts, though, are confident Trump will quickly push the project through without any rerouting or changes. Raymond James energy analyst Darren Horowitz said the project could come online in the third quarter of 2017, while Ethan Bellamy, an energy analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., more bullishly anticipates the pipeline will be operational by the end of June. The Army Corps had largely completed its work in July before President Barack Obama intervened, Bellamy said, and Trump can speed up the granting of the easement with a phone call once he takes office. The Corps works for the commander in chief. The opposition and delays have continued to frustrate Energy Transfer co-founder and chief executive Kelcy Warren, a billionaire GOP political donor who blames Obama for the delays. Still committed Energy Transfer defiantly stated it's committed to the project without any rerouting. Dallas Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environmental Network said in a prepared statement that he realizes Sunday's victory could only prove temporary in the face of the Trump presidency. Most of 2016 has proven a difficult year for Warren and Energy Transfer, even apart from the Dakota Access controversy. Energy Transfer entities own 75 percent of Dakota Access, and Houston-based Phillips 66 has a 25 percent stake. When and if the sale is done, Energy Transfer would still own the largest share at 38.25 percent. Canada-based Enbridge would pick up a 27.6 percent piece, and Ohio-based Marathon Petroleum Corp. would own 9.2 percent. The Phillips 66 share will remain unchanged.
