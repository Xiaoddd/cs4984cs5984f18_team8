Ernst went over to ask them what they were doing in his alfalfa field and was told they were here for the Dakota Access protest. Two younger men ambled up, meanwhile, swinging lariats as they came. Ernst turned slightly to make sure everyone could see the revolver at his hip. Ernst said plates on the vehicles identified them as from a reservation in South Dakota. The encounter is just one of the many, Ernst says, which has set the farming and ranching community on edge and has some wearing protective gear and carrying weapons. Another who had agreed to an interview subsequently withdrew, saying he received a number of threats after coverage on a relative. Ernst said he, too, has received Facebook threats, from all over the country for talking to the media. But he wants others to know what farmers are facing, in hopes it will encourage protesters to respect the landowners who live here. Their reports include masked men approaching people, out-of-state vehicles playing chicken with them on gravel roads, 65 mph highways being blocked by protesters who refuse to let residents through, hay bales being stolen, access to fields they are trying to harvest being blocked, increased expenses and difficulties getting hay sold or corn to elevators. That prompted one of his neighbors to begin wearing a bulletproof vest. After the first encounter in his field, Ernst took to carrying his revolver with him every where he went, and he now puts his cell phone in a front vest pocket with the camera facing out, so he can videotape what transpires if he needs to. Not long after the encounter in his alfalfa field, about 100 protesters moved across his land while he was working with a temporary corral, trying to separate calves from cows. Fences in the way of protesters are simply cut and cast aside, allowing cattle to roam willy nilly. We are lucky to live in the greatest country in the world, where you can share ideas and work within a legal process, but that has not been adhered to here in many instances. Cutting the fuel lines of the Dakota Access construction equipment on her property is just one example, she said. That spewed oil and other fluids on her ranch land.
