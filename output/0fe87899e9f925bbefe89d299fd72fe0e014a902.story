By Charles P. Pierce Jan 30, 2017 Getty Images Pool The fresh hell for this week begins with a flamethrower taken to all federal regulations on everything. CNBC brings us the details. The measure will expand regulatory review with the goal of revoking two regulations for every new one put forward, according to a senior administration official. Under the order, federal agencies will propose rules they want to drop and the White House will review them. With the order, Trump followed through on repeated campaign promises to cut rules that he said hold back the economy. In meetings with business leaders since his election, Trump has touted his efforts to reduce regulations and cut corporate taxes. It sets a budget each year for what new regulations would cost the economy, companies and employers. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below This is not a serious policy proposal. It's something you say on the radio in order to sell some hair-replacement products or male enhancement potions. But I think we can safely say that absolutely no Republican will throw his body into the gears of the machine on this one. The tar sands in Alberta, Canada. Getty Images Over the weekend, on Joy Reid's electric teevee program, the indefatigable Jane Fleming Kleeb checked in on the Skype machine to remind us that the pipes for the Keystone project are already here, that they were manufactured in India and China, and that they've been sitting out in the open in North Dakota subject to incredible extremes in temperature for going on four years now. This would seem to demand a certain amount of stringent inspection and regulation before we stick those pipes in the ground and start running tar-sands oil through the most precious farmland on the continent. Which reminds me. The report stated quite clearly that cleaning up a tar sands spill is vastly more complicated, and vastly more difficult, than cleaning up conventional oil spills.

Given these greater levels of concern for weathered diluted bitumen, spills of diluted bitumen should elicit unique, immediate actions in response. Broadly, regulations and agency practices do not take the unique properties of diluted bitumen into account, nor do they encourage effective planning for spills of diluted bitumen. There are real-world examples already. In 2010, 800,000 gallons of tar-sands oil spilled into the Kalamazoo River. Three years later, another tar-sands deluge swept through Mayflower, Arkansas, ruining several residential neighborhoods. As is the case in Michigan, the bitumen will persist in the water table for the foreseeable future. The man who advised the administration's transition team on these issues, and on all things regarding energy and climate policy, was Myron Ebell, the extremist head of the extremist Competitive Enterprise Institute and one of the king climate denialists in Christendom. Not all the poison travels through pipelines. Respond to this post on the Esquire Politics Facebook page. All Rights Reserved. Communications, Inc.
