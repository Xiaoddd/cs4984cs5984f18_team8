The number of Chinese immigrants arrested while illegally crossing the border into Arizona through the busiest smuggling corridor in the United States increased tenfold in the last fiscal year, according to the United States Border Patrol in Tucson. The reason is simple: dollars and cents. As record quantities of illegal drugs are being intercepted in Arizona, those involved in taking people and drugs across the border are increasingly concentrating on the more rewarding smuggling of Chinese immigrants, said David Jimarez, a spokesman for the Border Patrol. If the immigrants make it to America, Mr. Chan said, they begin paying the smugglers the remainder of the cost. He said some immigrants had said they had been promised a refund if they were sent back to China. Border officials said they suspected that the smuggling of non-Mexicans into the United States was a transcontinental operation because it is so intricate. Chinese smugglers have traditionally used shipping containers to take immigrants through American ports, but that has subsided as container inspections have increased, Mr. Picard said. He said that several new tactics had emerged. In the most common one, immigrants fly from Beijing to Rome, board a plane to Caracas, Venezuela, fly to Mexico City and work their way up to the northern border and into the United States.

Typically, Mr. Jimarez said, immigrants from other countries account for 2 percent to 5 percent of the total. Only when the sector noticed the influx did it tally the number of Chinese entering in recent years. Like others who entered the country illegally, most of the Chinese were fleeing dire situations in their homeland, said Mr. Chan, the federal court interpreter. He said most of those immigrants he spoke with were from Fujian Province, in southeast China, and had traveled across the globe to enter the United States because of a lack of education and employment opportunities back home. While the circumstances have changed, she said, the motivation for the new wave of Chinese entering the country illegally is rooted in the same ideal.
