Ragip Grajcevci, a 51-year old former guerrilla fighter for the Kosovo Liberation Army, KLA, lost an eye and a finger during the war in 1999. Grajcevci lives in Hade, a village outside the capital Prishtina. Only a fragment of it remains, perched on the lip of the state-owned Sibovc mine. Coal often spontaneously combusts in the mine below, sending dust and smoke billowing through gardens and homes. The noise of the constant digging grates on the nerves, according to families still living there. As a representative on his local council Grajcevci is determined not to join the ranks of a thousand or so villagers who have been unjustly resettled when the Kosovo government goes ahead with a World Bank-funded project to construct a new power plant called Kosova e Re (New Kosovo), despite the fact that it has become increasingly controversial for the World Bank to support any new coal-fired power plants. Kosova e Re is the only coal plant on earth the World Bank is considering backing. Kosova e Re is the only coal plant on earth the bank is considering backing. World Bank guidelines mandate that people who are resettled by their clients, whether they be governments or private companies, provide adequate homes and livelihoods to those who will be resettled. Grajcevci says in the case of Kosova e Re, none of this has happened. More than a decade after the appropriations began, the fragmented community continues to be insecure and frustrated, the report said. Their report has been passed to the World Bank board, which will meet to discuss it in December. Ragip Grajcevci talking to his fellow villagers. Grajcevci does not want to wait any longer. Lignite is the dirtiest form of coal and, according to The Health and Environment Alliance and Association of Pulmonologists of Kosovo, existing coal plants in Kosovo cause a total health cost between 70 and 169 million euros per year to the region. Plants in Kosovo generally operate with low environmental standards, generating high levels of polluting emissions and high impacts on health, causing diseases like lung cancer, skin conditions and respiratory problems such as asthmatic bronchitis. Today, parts of Shala look like a bare field with only the main road has been finished. During one of the protests against such a treatment Grajcevci met with Dajana Berisha from the Forum for Civic Initiative, a grassroots organization that does community development work. Berisha picked up the cause of the villagers and got their trust to write and submit the complaint to the World Bank Inspection Panel. Dajana Berisha from FIQ meets the inhabitants of Hade. Diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks reveal the callous way the displaced villagers were viewed by those in charge in Kosovo during the transition to independence. Unmik did not respond to a request to comment. The US state department said it would not comment on the leaked diplomatic cables. On average, Kosovars have a life expectancy ten years shorter than people in Western Europe. There is a game going on, a vicious horrible game with people's lives. Ted Downing Ted Downing, a leading expert on the field of displacement, runs the International Network on Displacement and Resettlement. He has studied the case of Hade and claims that the World Bank and Kosovo government are playing people against profit, asking them to absorb the cost of development in their own lives, livelihoods, budgets, and the social-psychological stress. Jashari highlights that KEK and the government have only themselves to blame because they delayed the process of land appropriation and displacement of the villages, thus paving the way for a lot of building to be illegally built. Jashari said his office is investigating if this, too, constitutes an abuse of office. The other observation of the IP report highlights the shortcomings of the infrastructure of Shala, a village outside the mining zone where the displaced villagers were supposed to move. Ragip Grajcevci during a town meeting. The government has dismissed these concerns. Requests to the government to comment on the report were ignored. Rob Doherty, a spokesman for the panel, said that until then he could not comment on the contents of the leaked report. The unlawful displacements have divided the community in Obiliq. Grajcevci is determined that the era in which authorities and the World Bank can take over their land is over. He said the quality of life has diminished, schools have emptied of children, and basic foodstuffs like bread are no longer available. He called on his neighbors to resist the displacement.
