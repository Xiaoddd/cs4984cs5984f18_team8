Residents near the Fukushima coast are being urged to flee to high ground after a 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck the area early on Tuesday. A one-meter tsunami hit the coast at the Fukushima nuclear plant, its operator reported in the hours following the quake. The epicenter of the earthquake was approximately 67 kilometers northeast of Iwaki, according to the US Geological Survey. There have been several aftershocks reported across Japan, felt as far away as Tokyo. The precaution has been taken so engineers can check tracks and make sure that they have not been damaged by the earthquake, Julian Ryall reports. Small local tsunamis can be generated by Seaquakes with a magnitude 6.8 or larger. It was originally reported that a potential tsunami may be up to three meters, but the emergency channel broadcasted shortly after that it could be even higher. At around 6:10 AM local time, a 60 centimeter tsunami reached the Onahama Port in Fukushima. The area was expected to be struck repeatedly. Shortly after the first tsunami struck, NKH reported that the water cooling system seemed to have stopped at TEPCO's Daini nuclear power plant. Tepco issued a statement however, saying that there have been no abnormalities at their power stations. Tsunami waves are expected to hit repeatedly. Monday's earthquake was significantly larger than the 6.6 offshore earthquake that lead to the nuclear disaster in March 2011, when a tsunami struck the Fukushima-1 plant and caused the leakage of radioactive material into the surrounding area. It is widely considered to have been the largest nuclear accident since the Chernobyl catastrophe in 1986. Tohoku Electric has also stated that they have not found any abnormalities at their Onagawa nuclear power plant. Shortly after the earthquake, a fire broke out at a chemical factory in Fukushima prefecture, NHK reported. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe issued a statement saying that he knows about the earthquake and tsunami warning, and ordered the necessary information to be provided to the public.
