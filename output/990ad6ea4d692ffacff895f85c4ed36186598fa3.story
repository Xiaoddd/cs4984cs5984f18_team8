The event celebrated 50 resolutions opposing Pilgrim pipelines, already passed in New York and New Jersey. However, those resolutions are not binding, and are seen as the opening salvo of a long struggle to stop Pilgrim pipelines. Speakers listed harms to the region which they said would occur if Pilgrim pipelines are not stopped. Pilgrim pipelines would be drilled under the Rondout, Wallkill, Esopus, Ramapo and other New York and New Jersey rivers and streams, putting waterways directly in the path of a major spill. Drinking water aquifers would also be at risk. Air would be impacted by toxic emissions of benzene and other carcinogens from pump stations along the pipeline. Pipeline incidents such as leaks, spills, and ruptures happen about 1.7 times a day, according to federal data from PHMSA, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

My constituents are concerned that Esopus has barges along the Hudson River filled with Bakken Crude oil as well as miles of trains carrying Bakken crude through our town already. Many communities in our area have determined that the risks incurred by such a pipeline running through its boundaries outweigh any benefits they might receive. ENJAN sees the root cause as greed and exploitation to benefit a few corporate executives. We should be building wind farms and solar arrays rather than pipelines to transport dangerous carbon-based fuels that should stay in the ground. The Kingston event was the tenth in a series of ten events in New Jersey and New Yorkopposing extreme energy and pushing for sustainable, safe clean energy.
