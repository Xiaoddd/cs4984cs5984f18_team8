Damn your protests. This is disappointing news, but it is not surprising, for Donald Trump is no friend to American Indians, and it looks like his presidency is going to stand in stark contrast to that of his predecessor, in this as in so many other ways. Some have expressed the fear that he will bring back the Termination era. He worked with Congress to secure significant increases in funding for the Indian Health Service. And when President Obama signed legislation reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, it included a new provision allowing tribes to arrest and prosecute non-Indians who committed acts of domestic violence against Native American women, a major problem when courts had held in the past that tribal governments lacked the power to prosecute non-Indians on reservations. And that I am not optimistic really bums me out, because there are a hell of a lot of problems out there that sane political leaders from our two major parties might be able to solve. Our Creon has said nothing about Indian affairs. He could fulfill a campaign promise and aid Native nations by pushing through Congress a program to repair and replace roads, bridges, and dams on Indian reservations. Senators and representatives from states with large Native American populations have urged caution in repealing the Affordable Care Act, noting that the progress made in reducing the still gaping health disparities between Native Americans and non-natives were indeed significant and much work remains to be done. But the initiative certainly will not come from the Executive Branch. Poverty and a lack of opportunity in Indian Country remain vexing challenges to policy makers and tribal leaders alike. The Obama presidency had some significant accomplishments in Indian affairs. Be glad you were given land to live on instead of wiping your kind out entirely as so many other empires have done to conquered people in years past. Your continued existence is entirely by our good will. Do not test out patience. But the larger point is that comments like yours, so angry, violent and racist, are what native peoples have faced for hundreds of years. And it is why I write. All of us must stand up forcefully to racist dingbats like yourself. I am more than happy to test your patience, Chuck. I hope you respond to this. I would encourage you to read my book before you do, and, perhaps, to read the United States Constitution and some of the 370 treaties native peoples have negotiated with the United States.
