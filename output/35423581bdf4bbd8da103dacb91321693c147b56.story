Updated Dec. 5, 2016 12:05 a.m. ET The Obama administration said Sunday that it had denied a permit needed to complete the last leg of an oil pipeline across the Midwest, prompting cheers from opponents but warnings that the move could be short-lived since President-elect Donald Trump supports the project. The nearly 1,200-mile Dakota Access pipeline, extending from North Dakota across parts of South Dakota and Iowa and ending in Illinois, is nearly complete, except for a 1,100-foot crossing of a Missouri River reservoir. Standing Rock Indian Reservation tribal chairman David Archambault II discusses the Obama administration's decision to deny a permit needed to complete the last leg of the Dakota Access oil pipeline in North Dakota on Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero. Energy Transfer has argued in federal court that the Army Corps had granted approval for the reservoir crossing in July. Pipeline experts said it was extremely rare for an administration to intervene in a permitting process typically handled by career civil servants. DETAIL DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE PROJECT S.D. WIS. IOWA NEB. ILL. Patoka MO. Mr. McCown said Mr. Trump would have several options once he got in office, including directing the Secretary of the Army to reinstate a previously approved permit, or issuing an executive order stating that prior environmental assessments were adequate and approving the pipeline. Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, thanked the Obama administration for what he called a historic decision. At the same time, he asked the chief executive of Energy Transfer, the governor of North Dakota and the incoming Trump administration, all of whom have supported the project, to respect it. Near Cannon Ball, about 40 miles south of Bismarck, the decision was a major victory for the demonstrators, whose numbers swelled to more than 5,000 over the weekend with the arrival of hundreds of U.S. military veterans. People have gathered for months to protest the pipeline. While most of the protests have been peaceful, there have been violent clashes in which police used tear gas and water cannons during freezing temperatures. More than 500 protesters have been arrested, mostly for trespassing. Last week, the stakes for the protesters rose when the Army Corps of Engineers issued a Dec. 5 deadline for protesters to leave. But authorities have said they would not forcibly remove protesters, despite the deadline. Most of the protesters are camped on Army Corps land. As other tribe leaders got up to speak, demonstrators hugged, shed tears and raised their arms in the air. Teri Gary, 53, an Army veteran and member of the Colorado River Indian Tribes in Parker, Ariz., said she thought the Obama administration decision was a vindication for people who had been protesting for months.
