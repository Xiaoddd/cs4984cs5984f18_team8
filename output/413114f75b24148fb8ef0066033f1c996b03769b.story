ODANAH, WI -- A Wisconsin tribe has moved to eject from their reservation part of the Enbridge oil pipeline that runs underneath the Straits of Mackinac. On Wednesday, Jan. 4, the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa passed a formal resolution to not renew Enbridge right-of-way easements for Line 5, which runs from Superior, Wis. to Sarnia, Ontario by way of Michigan.

The move against Line 5 comes amid a shifting landscape for oil pipelines marked by the successful Standing Rock protest efforts to stall the controversial Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota and Enbridge's cancellation of the Sandpiper line to move Bakken oil through Minnesota. Fears about how an oil spill might impact the Great Lakes have stoked a movement against Line 5 in Michigan, where the state is weighing what action, if any, it might take pending the results of an independent risk assessment. Key pieces still absent from Mackinac straits oil spill cleanup readiness Nonetheless, tribal leaders told the Associated Press the move against Line 5 has nothing to do with the other pipeline protests. It plans to reach out to federal, state and local officials for guidance on how to proceed with ejecting the pipeline. The tribe has directed staff to prepare for recycling, disposal and surface restoration work that would accompany removal. The tribe says 15 right-of-way easements for Line 5 expired in 2013 and Enbridge has been in negotiations with them since then to renew those agreements. The tribe owns interest in 11 of 15 parcels that the pipeline crosses. The easements date back 64 years ago to 1953. The Canadian pipeline giant operates a huge cross-border crude oil pipeline network called the Lakehead System across Canada and the U.S. Midwest that moves about 2.8 million barrels of Canadian oil per day into the United States, which is about 60 percent of all Canadian crude moving across the border. Line 5, part of the Lakehead system, moves up to 540,000 barrels of light crude and natural gas liquids per day across the Upper Peninsula, under the Straits of Mackinac and back into Canada at Marysville. On its 645-mile path, Line 5 crosses through more than 23 counties and 360 Michigan waterways. Enbridge said there's never been a Line 5 spill on the Bad River reservation, although Line 5 did rupture and spill five barrels of oil in the U.P.'s Hiawatha National Forest in Delta County around 1980. Other Enbridge Lakehead pipelines have spilled oil in the past decade. In 2012, Enbridge Line 14 spilled 54,000 gallons in New Chester, Wis. Six years after historic oil spill, feds close the book on Enbridge catastrophe In the Straits of Mackinac, Enbridge just completed a fall project to install more screw anchor supports on Line 5 after a June inspection found several areas where the pipeline crossed gaps in the lakebed greater than 75 feet, the maximum unsupported span length allowable under its 1953 easement. In August, Michigan contracted with two companies to conduct independent studies on the pipeline that are expected to be finished in June 2017.
