TransCanada, the company that operates the pipeline, said in a statement that about 5,000 barrels of oil had leaked in Marshall County, South Dakota. One barrel holds 42 gallons, meaning the spill involved roughly 210,000 gallons of oil. According to TransCanada, the pipeline was shut down at 6 a.m. following a recorded drop in pressure. Thursday. The leak happened in a rural area about 3 miles southeast of the town of Amherst. Images from the scene showed a group of trucks congregated along a rural road. He said the oil was unlikely to reach the aquifer in the area, which is located between 800 and 900 feet underground. It is unclear how long it will take to clean up the spill. TransCanada did not respond to multiple BuzzFeed News requests for comment. The pipeline where the spill took place is part of the Keystone Pipeline System, which according to TransCanada stretches across 2,687 miles. An extension of the system, called the Keystone XL, was the source of controversy and protests for years before the Obama administration finally rejected it in 2015. Earlier this year, however, the Trump administration approved the project. A number of environmental groups condemned TransCanada and the pipeline in the wake of Thursday's spill, including Friends of the Earth, NextGen America, and the Center for Biological Diversity. The spill also comes just four days before regulators in Nebraska are set to decide if they will allow the Keystone XL pipeline to pass through their state. Walsh said the section where Thursday's leak occurred began operations sometime around 2010, and Flute said it was greeted with less controversy than the XL project. The pipeline has leaked before. In April 2016, TransCanada told regulators 187 gallons of oil had spilled, but later revised that number up to nearly 17,000 gallons. Submit it here.
