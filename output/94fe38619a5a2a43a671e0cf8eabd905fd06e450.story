DAPL went online June 1. More than 760 arrests were made between August 2016 and February 2017. Anti-pipeline protesters left behind a huge mess for North Dakota residents to clean up, including hundreds of abandoned vehicles, as first reported in Western Wire back in February. Those out-of-state activists include members of Mississippi Stand, Jessica Reznicek and Ruby Montoya, cited by name in the ETP lawsuit. In March we began to apply this self-gathered information. The DAPL attacks do not appear to be isolated or rare. This week, six protesters were arrested in Wisconsin for alleged trespassing and disorderly conduct at a separate pipeline construction site.
