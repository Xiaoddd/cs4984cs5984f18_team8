The massacre was the result of the U.S. government's desire to seize land and move indigenous people from their homelands. On Dec. 29 the U.S. Army's 7 th Cavalry surrounded a band of ghost dancers near Wounded Knee Creek and Col. James W. Forsyth demanded they surrender their weapons and told them they'd be relocated to another camp. The soldiers were aided by cannon rounds from Hotchkiss guns. Prior to the attack, women and men had been separated. Despite this, the soldiers took no effort to spare their lives. As women began running, the soldiers hunted them down. The account continues on, stating that small boys who had emerged from hiding thinking it was safe were also butchered by soldiers. A woman who survived lost her daughter and baby boy. According to her account, one shot passed through the baby's body and hit her elbow, causing him to drop to the ground. She was also hit twice in the back. Several days later, government authorities dug a mass grave for 146 bodies of children, women and men. They stripped the bodies naked and piled them on top of each other in the frozen ground. More soldiers received the Medal of Honor in Wounded Knee than the 64,000 South Dakotans who fought for four years of World War II. In the years after 1890, the U.S. Army made Wounded Knee a central event in American public memory, awarding 20 Medals of Honor to the Seventh Cavalry and erecting a monument to the soldiers killed in the engagement. Native American activists have long called for the medals to be withdrawn and in 2001 the National Congress of American Indians passed two resolutions condemning the awards. Despite years of petitions, Congress has failed to rescind the medals. b.
