Starting in 1981, the newly created Oil and Gas Division started regulating reclamation and, within two years, those pits were condemned. They were covered over, but they didn't go away. Today, about 1 million barrels of it are pumped to the surface daily, though protocol now requires it to be trucked or piped to deep injection wells. When it's spilled, the salts kill plant life, foul water and sterilize soil. You have to find a place for the contaminated soil to go and find replacement soil that's similar. For years, the saltwater percolated into the soil unimpeded. Recent studies show the salt continues to expand, deeper and wider, now as far down as 15 feet from pits originally only five feet deep. They are barren scars of toxicity in those northern counties, but they are also an opportunity to study reclamation and remediation for salt-impacted soils. The research is two-pronged. Half is looking into the best way to engineer a solution with underlying drain tiles and water to leach the salts and properly dispose of the fluid. The other half is studying the use of salt-tolerant grasses and soil amendments to grow plants that potentially draw some salt from the soil and help prevent erosion. Cody VanderBusch, the department's reclamation specialist, said the engineering-based research by the Energy and Environmental Research Center in Grand Forks and plant studies by North Dakota State University's School of Natural Resource Sciences could be valuable tools in dealing with the hundreds of saltwater spills that occur annually. Salt in the earth Reported saltwater spills range from a few barrels to the largest recorded in North Dakota, a 3 million gallon spill out of a flow line owned by Summit Midstream in 2015 that entered Blackwater Creek and the Missouri River near Williston. The Summit spill is still in remediation. In fact, brine spills account for roughly one-third of all spills from oil and gas activity, according to health department records. Last year, there were 494 brine spills, equaling 30,000 barrels. Over the past decade, there were 4,831 spills equaling 390,000 barrels of brine spilled, all of these with toxic potential for soil, plants and water. The research involves using soil amendments and additives and establishing salt-tolerant grasses. One additive is gypsum; the calcium in gypsum coheres soil while the salt chlorides and sodium force it apart. DeSutter said the Leland Olds Station at Stanton brought the product online last year, relatively cheaply. Initial results find promise with inland saltgrass and alkali sacaton grass in combination with soil amendments, though a more definitive interim report is due out in June. This one, in the Mountrail County area, will involve a salt spill in which the oil company's remediation has had limited success so far, she said. Meehan said 24 small experimental plots on the spill site will be amended with additives including gypsum, lime, organic leonardite, compost and a crystal inhibitor and planted with barley, cover crops, perennial grasses and a perennial barley mix. She said the goal is to gain information that will be of real help to companies, agencies and landowners who are dealing with salt-impacted soils, or soils naturally high in salt. Bring it on Suess's work at the state Health Department charges him with overseeing all spills that are not contained within the drill pad location, which is most of them. Another is the use of electro kinetics, subjecting the soil to a low current of electricity to heat the soil and cause a reaction between negative and positive ions to drain away saltwater. More information on plant remediation, soil amendments and engineering methods will be helpful, he said. It's a slow process but, in the long run, it does work. The Charbonneau Creek spill in western McKenzie County is a case in point of the complexity and time involved in repairing damage from saltwater spills. A saltwater flow line owned by Zenergy Inc. ruptured and spilled more than 1 million gallons of brine into the creek, causing a massive die off of aquatic species and grass downstream. That spill occurred in 2006 and, after hauling away tons of salty soil and pumping out millions of gallons of contaminated creek water, the company may only now be nearing the end of its obligation a full decade later. At the Charbonneau, the lingering effect of all that salt still shows up in the groundwater, meaning salt is still leaching from the soil into the water. Initially, tests found concentrations as high as 94,000 parts per million. After all that pumping and soil remediation, the concentration in the groundwater is still in the range of 740 to 2,000 parts per million salt. The acceptable threshold is 250 parts per million.
