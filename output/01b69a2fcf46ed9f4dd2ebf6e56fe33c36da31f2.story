Some rights reserved. Things went from bad to worse on October 21, when the pipeline's supporters attacked a group of protesters, killing one, wounding eight, and causing substantial property damage. The Yaqui tribe, which has endured a long history of repression, has also a history of resistance. Like other indigenous communities in Mexico, several members of the Yaqui tribe have lost their lives fighting against invasive private companies and non-indigenous authorities. Just two years ago, before the conflict over the Agua Prieta pipeline, the Yaquis protested against a large-scale aqueduct that would have diverted what was left of their sacred river to the city of Hermosillo. According to its design, the Agua Prieta pipeline project stretches from Arizona, in the United States, to Sonora, Mexico. One portion of the pipeline is to cross 90 kilometers into Yaqui territory, which is protected by Mexican law. Building the pipeline without fair, transparent, and inclusive consultations with all the Yaqui communities would be a violation of the sovereignty of the Yaqui land, community leaders say. They are those who do not care if an indigenous government falls. They are those who do not care if the Yaqui culture is exterminated. They have received threats because they opposed the signing of the collective permit for the construction of the pipeline. Last month, Gema Villela Valenzuela reported that members of the Yaqui community are still receiving threats for opposing the pipeline. This article was published previously by Global Voices.
