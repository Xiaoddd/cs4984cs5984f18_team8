Photograph: Dave Archambault by Sam Levin Dave Archambault II pulled his car over and grabbed a piece of paper. Parked in a quiet lot near his home in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, the Standing Rock Sioux chairman drew a line graph representing the history of his tribe. Hundreds of years of despair leading to a peak moment of harmony and euphoria last year, when indigenous people from across the country converged on the area to fight the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. But the movement, he said, now seemed to be imploding.

Days after pipeline workers resumed drilling across the Missouri river, which provides drinking water to the tribe and flows a short distance from his house, Archambault explained why he has urged demonstrators to go home. Miles away, activists were doing the very opposite: organizing supplies, building new camps and vowing to stay in place until the pipeline is defeated. The past is present, Archambault explained, and the government stole more than just land. His grandmother was beaten for speaking her native language, so she did not pass it on to her children, he said, and youth were threatened with jail if they were caught practicing their religion. The chairman also recounted how his uncles were involved in the grassroots American Indian Movement and were attacked by the FBI. After decades of oppressive policies, Standing Rock has some of the poorest counties in the country today: a lack of housing and economic development, excessive substance abuse and physical abuse, high rates of dropouts and suicides, poor education and poor healthcare.

An early proposal called for the project to cross the Missouri river just north of Bismarck, but was rejected partly due to concerns about the water supply in the mostly white city. The final route, which the pipeline company says could be complete in three months, is just upstream of Standing Rock. The unity was short-lived. At that point, Archambault said there were about 10,000 people at the camps amid a major snowstorm and sub-zero temperatures. More broadly, he struggles to understand the ongoing value of the camps.

Anthony Gazotti, a 47-year-old Apache and recent arrival from Colorado, said the tribal council seemed no different than federal officials promoting the project.

He let a lot of tribes down. Regardless of what happens to the Dakota Access pipeline, Archambault said he hoped people would find ways to fight back against Trump. At one point, he slowed down the car and peered out the window at piles of trash strewn across the melting snow.
