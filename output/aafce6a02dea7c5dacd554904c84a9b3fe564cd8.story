Government officials are working with the campaigns to tighten security as the race for the White House intensifies. The activity follows a pattern set in the last two presidential elections. Hacking was rampant in 2008, according to US intelligence officials, and both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney were targets of Chinese cyber-attacks four years later. He said the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security were helping educate the campaigns. The document was part of a slideshow used to warn incoming Obama administration officials that their new jobs could make them prey for foreign spies. Jonathan Lampe with InfoSec Institute, a private information security company in Chicago, said security had not improved significantly since then. Using the reconnaissance skills of a casual hacker, Lampe pulled full lists of site usernames and technologies used on most sites. In some cases, he discovered which directories were accessible from the internet and which were not. Some threats are publicly known. Several weeks ago, the international group of activists and hackers known as Anonymous declared cyberwar on Trump, urging supporters to take down his website and expose private information. Dickson and other experts said they were not privy to any incidents of foreign hacking of the campaigns. But as the political conventions and general election near, they worry about a well-timed, sophisticated attack by a nation state that could help a candidate. Think of the Iranians. Indeed, the US spies on both allies and adversaries for policy, political and commerce information. The Clinton and Trump campaigns did not respond to questions about cybersecurity. Sanders apologized for his campaign improperly gaining access to Clinton campaign data and fired a data director. V Newton Miller, chief executive officer of the Milwaukee-based PKWare, which provides encryption software and advises federal agencies on data security, said foreign spying on campaign sites was inevitable. Foreign hackers are more interested in sensitive, revealing campaign emails and reports, especially with the unprecedented mudslinging of this campaign, rather than acts of cyber vandalism, Miller and other experts said. In the 2008 race, Obama and the Republican candidate, John McCain, were targeted. One letter obtained by hackers showed McCain expressing his support for Taiwan. Meanwhile, an Obama campaign staffer clicked on a corrupted attachment that allowed a virus to enter the system. Clinton and Trump both have taken jabs at China on the campaign trail and might seem ripe for similar attacks. Trump wants to punish Beijing for hacking and unfair trade practices.
