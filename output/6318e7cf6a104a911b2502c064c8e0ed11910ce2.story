To reach and support those activists who locked themselves to pipeline equipment, water protectors walk a path carved out by the pipeline on Standing Rock Sioux sacred ancestral grounds. The call for an international day of action came just hours before the Standing Rock Sioux Nation, who have adamantly opposed the project which crosses their treaty territory, announced their own response to the easement announcement, saying they will seek an injunction to immediately halt construction until an environmental impact study is done. The environmental impact statement was wrongfully terminated. This pipeline was unfairly rerouted across our treaty lands. Once the easement is officially granted, which is expected in the next 24 hours, drilling is expected to begin immediately and last until either the Standing Rock Sioux can win a restraining order, or the pipeline is completed. Two weeks ago U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order to advance construction of the controversial pipeline, overturning a decision by the previous Obama administration to halt construction until an environmental impact study could be completed. Late last week several courts issued temporary injunctions on another Trump executive order banning Muslims from seven countries from entering the U.S. THE NEW STREAMLINED RSN LOGIN PROCESS: Register once, then login and you are ready to comment.
