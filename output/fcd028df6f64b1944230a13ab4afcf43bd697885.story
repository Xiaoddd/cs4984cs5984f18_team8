The Republican governor signed the order Monday for protesters who are camping on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land. Emergency Services spokeswoman Cecily Fong told The Associated Press that authorities will not be using law enforcement or the National Guard to enforce the governor's order. Earlier, the Corps ordered the protesters to leave federal land by Dec. 5 but said it has no plans to forcibly remove anyone. A North Dakota sheriff says the deadline is meaningless and serves only to reduce the government's legal responsibility for demonstrators.
