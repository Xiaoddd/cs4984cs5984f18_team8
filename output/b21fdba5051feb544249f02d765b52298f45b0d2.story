Advice from a Caterpillar Facebook Twitter Letters to Juniper New Yale study links fracking to cancer-causing chemicals October 26, 2016 brown cloud, fracking, oil and gas drilling, public health New research from the Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) confirms that the majority of chemicals used in fracking are linked to known carcinogens. The researchers assessed the carcinogenicity of 1,177 water pollutants and 143 air pollutants released by the fracking process and from fracking wastewater. Of the 119 compounds with sufficient data, 44 percent of the water pollutants and 60 percent of air pollutants were either confirmed or possible carcinogens. Fracking is now a fact of life in 30 states across the U.S., posing major risks to public health due to air and water contamination. In 2013, The Wall Street Journal analyzed well location and census data for more than 700 counties in 11 major energy-producing states and found that at least 15.3 million Americans lived within a mile of a well that has been drilled since 2000, more people than live in Michigan or New York City. Children are especially vulnerable to air pollution and water contamination caused by fracking. Often, these facilities are located close to more than one well and are also near compressor stations, pipelines and other fossil fuel infrastructure with impacts on public health. More than 650,000 kindergarten through twelfth grade children attend school within one mile of a fracked well. The highest percentage of children attending school close to fracked wells is in West Virginia, where 8 percent of children spend their school days within one mile of a fracked well.
