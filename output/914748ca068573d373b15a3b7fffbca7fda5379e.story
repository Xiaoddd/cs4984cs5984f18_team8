Story highlights Actress' petition calls on people to withdraw money until banks divest The petition asks people to film themselves withdrawing money and tweet it (CNN)You've shared the protest videos and checked in at Standing Rock Indian Reservation on Facebook. Actress Susan Sarandon hopes so. She has launched an online petition that calls on people to tell big banks to stop investing in the company behind the pipeline. Supporters say it will be an economic boon that will decrease dependency on foreign oil. Opponents say it will destroy sacred Native American sites and wreak environmental havoc. Read More The petition singles out Bank of America, HSBC, UBS, Wells Fargo, Chase and Citibank, which are named in various SEC filings as lenders or partners in groups that support the pipeline. The pipeline complies with so-called Equator Principles that determine and manage risks and the impact of a project, the bank said. Bank of America is not a lender in the project-level financing and has contributed to Native American communities through various initiatives, spokeswoman Kelly Sapp said. SEC records indicate the bank is in a partnership with Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of Dakota Access LLC. Similarly, UBS spokesman Peter Stack said the bank does not provide project funding, but SEC documents show an investment partnership with Sunoco in Bakken Holdings Company LLC, which has an interest in Dakota Access LLC and other companies contributing to pipeline construction. HSBC declined to comment, and the other banks did return requests for comment. The petition asks signatories to withdraw money from their accounts and place money into credit unions until banks agree to divest and pressure the White House for an environmental impact statement. The petition tells people to film themselves withdrawing money and explaining why they're doing it, and to tweet it. They have put their bodies on the line to stop the construction and defend their water and their way of life. Less than 24 hours after Sarandon launched the petition on Wednesday night, it had nearly 29,000 supporters. It's not clear. So far, there are no photos or videos on Twitter of people in the act.
