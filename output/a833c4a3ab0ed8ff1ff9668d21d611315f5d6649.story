Darien Cavanaugh Throughout the primaries and the general election, the leaders of the Democratic Party told us time and time again that they were the party of the underdog, the party of those in need of protection. They were, supposedly, the party of progressive values. Unfortunately, that argument is muddied by numerous policies Democratic administrations and Congresses have pushed through over the years that have proved detrimental to the most vulnerable members of our society. Bill Clinton championing and signing off on the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act comes to mind, as does his signing NAFTA into law in 1993. The Democratic Party as a whole also shunned the Black Lives Matter movement for the most part. This is not to say that the Democratic Party has never done any good. It has. The party needs to learn that before the next election. Amidst this ongoing history of giving only to take away, this endless cycle of hope and disappointment, we now have to witness the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline unfold at Standing Rock. For nearly nine months we have watched militarized police officers decked out in riot gear gear and flanked by armored vehicles attack unarmed and nonviolent Native Americans and their allies with tear gas, paper spray, sonic weapons, rubber bullets, bean-bag guns, and tasers. We have seen them beat men and women with batons and billy clubs before dragging them off to jail, temporarily locking them in dog kennels, according to reports from Salon and others. Sunday night, the police escalated the brutality of their violence by intentionally spraying protestors with water cannons as the temperatures dropped into the 20s, The Intercept reported. They simultaneously fired tear gas and pepper spray at them. Neither side wants to take responsibility. The activists of the Civil Rights Movement were fighting for basic human rights. Water is a basic human right. The Dakota Access Pipeline threatens the supplies of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux and millions of other people in the region. This has been acknowledged by several agencies, including the Army Corps of Engineers, which fast-tracked construction of the pipeline, according to a report from the Seattle Times. In fact, the Army Corps of Engineers rerouted the original path of the pipeline due to concerns that it might contaminate the water supplies of cities it passed by. They chose to endanger the water of the Sioux and others instead. They have a right to protest and to protect themselves. Native Americans are among the most marginalized people in America. The Democrats want us to believe that they are there for those who need them, that they will protect the most vulnerable among us. Obama has spoken on the matter. Everyday construction continues is another day closer to their permanently losing this battle. This is one of the progressive issues of the moment. Obama and the Democratic Party must take action on the Dakota Access Pipeline right now if they want to start to win back progressive voters. The Democrats should know that by now.
