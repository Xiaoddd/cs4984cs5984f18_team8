The controversial Mariner East pipeline under construction Wednesday along Boot Road, near the border of East and West Goshen Townships. Sunoco's construction of the second of three adjacent Mariner East pipes has aroused opposition from residents. The project has been hampered by a series of spills and contamination of private water wells. Energy Transfer Partners LP, Sunoco's parent company, on Wednesday announced that completion of the Mariner East 2 pipeline will be pushed back from year's end to the second quarter of 2018 because of regulatory delays. Sunoco plans to build an additional 16-inch-diameter pipeline next year. Much of the material will be exported to petrochemical plants in Europe. In Uwchlan, the casualties included Joseph E. Toner III, the incumbent chairman of the supervisors and long-standing member of the Chester County Republican Committee. The Mariner East project was approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission in 2014, and Sunoco Pipeline has argued that PUC approval overrides the authority of local officials to block the route. In Uwchlan, the newcomers will be two of three members of the Board of Supervisors come January. In West Goshen, the new supervisors will hold two of five seats. On Energy Transfer Partners' quarterly earnings call Wednesday, company officials told investment analysts its engineers are working to relocate the West Goshen valve station to settle the matter.
