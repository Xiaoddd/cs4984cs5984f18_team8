Native Americans and environmentalists are ready for a fight By Drew Kann, CNN Updated 10:28 PM ET, Tue July 17, 2018 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Demonstrators gather at a rally on June 29 at the Wisconsin-Minnesota border. (CNN)Environmental and Native American groups in Minnesota are gearing up to thwart the replacement of an aging pipeline that crosses the state. The Minnesota pipeline at the center of this latest battle is a replacement for an existing pipeline called Line 3. Built in the 1960s, Line 3 transports crude oil 1,097 miles from Edmonton, Alberta, across northern Minnesota to Superior, Wisconsin. Tribal and environmental groups opposed to the proposed Enbridge Line 3 project rally in September 2017 at the State Capitol in St. Paul, Minnesota. The company that operates the pipeline, Enbridge Energy, says the old pipeline needs to be replaced for safety reasons. In late June, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) unanimously approved the pipeline proposal. Enbridge said it has reduced the amount of oil flowing through the pipeline because of corrosion and other defects in the decades-old pipe. The replacement will allow them to transport more oil and address the safety concerns, the company said. A fight to protect resources Native American and environmental groups are concerned about the new pipeline's potential impact. Looking back on the stand at Standing Rock Paulson, who traveled to fight the DAPL and support the Standing Rock Sioux, says the proposed new pipeline crosses wild rice beds that are part of the creation story of his people. Not a done deal Enbridge spokesman Michael Barnes said the Line 3 replacement proposal has prioritized Native American concerns from the start. Despite the MPUC's ruling that the pipeline is necessary, the Line 3 replacement is far from a done deal. Joseph Plumer, attorney for White Earth and the Red Lake bands of the Ojibwe tribe, talks about possible legal measures available to stop Line 3 on June 28 in St. Paul, Minnesota. Enbridge still must apply for 29 required federal, state, and local permits before they can begin construction, which could take months, a point that Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton pointed out in a recent statement. CNN's Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved. .d8888b.
