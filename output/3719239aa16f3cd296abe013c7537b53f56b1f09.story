Taxpayer-Funded Horror at Standing Rock Police brutality against protesters is reminiscent of civil-rights battles like Selma. And the state has borrowed millions to fund it. Sandy Tolan 02.22.17 1:03 AM ET Reuters UPDATE: Ten people were arrested, and one protester was injured during confrontation with North Dakota police during evictions Wednesday. Forty-six more were arrested Thursday in a police sweep of the main protest camp. It was a bitter cold night on the Backwater Bridge when Efrain Montalvo got the desperate call from the front line. He looked up through white mists of tear gas, cut by screams and shouts on the bridge. Native elders stood motionless in front of barricades of razor wire, clutching feathers, burning prayer bundles of sage, holding their ground. They were unarmed, eyes shut tight against the clouds of pepper spray. Others held up plywood shields or the tops of plastic bins against the spray. shouted police, who then unleashed a fire hose, soaking protesters in the sub-freezing temperatures. Icicles formed on their hair. Their winter jackets crunched. Montalvo moved swiftly toward the front line, carrying bottles of water and Milk of Magnesia (to relieve the tear gas sting) toward the medics. Riot-clad police, ensconced behind concrete barriers and the looping wire, began firing rubber bullets. Montalvo watched an elder fall at his feet, his staff clattering to the pavement of the shut-down state highway. Then police launched a barrage of smoking tear-gas canisters from grenade launchers. A tear-gas canister hit Montalvo squarely in the chest. He inhaled its smoke deeply, then wandered aimlessly, hands over his eyes. Two minutes later, he could see again. Another canister exploded at his feet. He saw a brilliant white light. Then everything went black and silent. Montalvo began shaking uncontrollably. Medics whisked him off the bridge. Days later, he could still taste the tear gas in his mouth. The clashes had begun after protesters attempted to clear the bridge of two burned-out pickup trucks blocking highway passage since a day of mass arrests three weeks earlier. Throughout the fall and early winter, the 10-month showdown over the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) has been bitter and violent. On Nov. 20 at the Backwater Bridge, 21-year-old Sophia Wilansky nearly had her arm blown off. Vanessa Dundon, a 32-year-old Navajo, was shot in the eye with a tear-gas canister. In all, some 750 people have been arrested in dozens of confrontations with police. Many have been held in dog kennel-like metal cages, numbers scrawled on their arms. Mathern said the state has borrowed tens of millions of dollars from the Bank of North Dakota to fuel the police presence. On Feb. 7, the Army Corps of Engineers, on the orders of President Trump, announced its final approval of the project. Construction crews resumed work almost immediately, despite vows by the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes to stop the pipeline in court. Native opponents and their supporters have pledged to block the pipeline to prevent contamination of the Missouri River, a source of water for the Sioux people and at least 10 million others downstream. But in recent weeks the camp population has fallen well below 1,000, not nearly enough to disrupt construction crews and the police lines protecting them. As many as 200 water protectors, including a contingent of military veterans, have been pouring back into Standing Rock, but mostly to help with a massive cleanup of the main protest camp. Authorities set a Feb. 22 deadline to evacuate the camp. Police, military and private security vehicles are poised on the ridges nearby. The Trump administration appears eager to crack down. On Wednesday police descended toward the camp, making ten arrests, including of one man who suffered a hip injury, according to Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier. Earlier, before police arrived, a 17-year-old girl suffered severe burns during a ceremonial burning of one of the remaining structures in the main protest camp, or what is left of it. Those from outside North Dakota are being offered one way tickets out of the state. This leaves a core of perhaps 25-50 resisters in camp. However this was contradicted by independent journalists, including Jenni Monet of Indian Country Today and the Center for Investigative reporting, who said officers targeted and chased them. Hours later, Bureau of Indian Affairs police tazed an unidentified Native man in the lobby of the Prairie Knights Casino as Standing Rock. The man had been slow to cooperate with officers, but unaggressive. He was standing still with his hands in the air when the officer fired his taser. He fell to the floor, moaning. Flanked by snowmobiles, bulldozers and a line of advancing police in fatigues, automatic rifles and riot gear, they surrounded tents and teepees, as shown in a livefeed by the Unicorn Riot media collective. Some of the structures were empty; in others, some of the last resisters were believed to be hiding. In at least one case officers livestream video shoed officers pointing assault rifles directly at resisters, on their knees and praying. More than 100 people, in sworn statements in the civil-rights lawsuit, in testimony before the United Nations working group recently invited to Standing Rock, and in dozens more interviews with me, have corroborated the accounts of Montalvo and others. Six decades after tear gas, dogs, police batons, and hoses were turned on nonviolent civil-rights marchers in the Deep South, those same tactics are deployed on overwhelmingly peaceful protesters in the Northern Plains. By all appearances, North Dakota has become the Selma of the North. In some cases, protesters have thrown logs or sticks at officers, or tear-gas canisters back across police lines. Police accused one woman of discharging a weapon at a demonstration; her case is pending. The driver was a DAPL security employee who was spotted driving toward the main camp with a loaded AR-15. Previous police claims, that protesters wielded pipe bombs or bows and arrows, were later shown to be false, as a North Dakota sheriff admitted during a confrontation I recorded in late October. Judge Hovland is described as fair-minded by lawyers who have worked extensively in his court. The case will continue in federal court, likely for at least another year. North Dakota law-enforcement tactics, meanwhile, have begun to draw criticism across the normally unbreachable blue line. The brute force of the impact of the water jet is a force option that would not be considered appropriate by most modern police chiefs or sheriffs, or tolerated by their citizenry. For the water protectors, the toll has not only been physical. I keep hearing people screaming and the sound of shots being fired when I try to sleep. For protesters, Standing Rock feels like a war zone. Roadblocks prevent travel on state highways. Helicopters and light planes circle over the camps. Police on nearby hilltops scan with binoculars or shoot videos from across concrete barriers. At dozens of confrontations over the last six months, water protectors stand against forces of heavily armed police and National Guardsman, sometimes in the hundreds. Now, documents show that the state has gone into tens of millions of dollars in debt to finance the police aggression. Mathern, a rare North Dakota Democrat, was the lone dissenter in a recent vote to authorize the bank line of credit. Mathern wanted to know more about what exactly the state was paying for, so he decided to travel to Standing Rock, and the police line just north of there. So Mathern drove across gravel roads, arriving at the main Oceti Sakowin (Seven Council Fires) camp, where he met randomly with Natives and other activists. Then the senator drove back to Bismarck. With its recent announcement to approve the final stages of the pipeline, the Army Corps of Engineers reversed itself, suddenly declaring it would not conduct an environmental review after all, and abandoning thousands of public comments. This pushes the issue to the courts, and to divestment battles. Police have given no indication that they intend to stand down. The elders are getting traumatized.
