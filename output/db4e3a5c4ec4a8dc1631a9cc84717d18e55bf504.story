According to a Freedom of Information request by Friends of the Earth, INEOS has been negotiating since last summer with the Forestry Commission for access to land for seismic surveying and a possible wellsite. Maps released under the request show surveys would be carried out across the Sherwood Forest national nature reserve, on Forestry Commission land and the Welbeck estate. They suggest that if the surveys went ahead, the edge of one block would be within 500m of the legendary Major Oak, an 800-year-old tree slept in by Robin Hood and his merry men and women. Friends of the Earth has begun a petition calling on the environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, to prevent fracking on publicly-owned forests. It has also organised a public meeting at the visitor centre in Sherwood Forest for Saturday (7 January) Details. Another IGas application, for Tinker Lane, near Blyth, is due to be decided this month by Nottinghamshire County Council. It was granted 21 licences and has exclusive rights to explore for oil and gas across one million acres in the UK. The two sides signed an agreement, which began on 2 November 2016, for seismic testing. It is limited for a total period of up to six months at any one time. The company is also required to indemnify Forestry Commission against any damage costs or losses caused by any protest against the proposal. Wellsite negotiations INEOS has also been negotiating over a potential shale gas site at Thieves Wood, close to Ravenshead on land rented to the Forestry Commission by the Wellbeck Estate. The correspondence also suggested the Forestry Commission was aware that Fisher German, a company connected to FGP, was working for local landowners. DrillOrDrop has reported that Fisher German has been acting in negotiation over seismic survey access, on the opposite side of the table to FGP, with whom it shares a director. The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors is investigating a complaint of conflict of interest against the companies. This is the second recent criticism of the Forestry Commission for leasing sites to the onshore oil and gas industry. Europa Oil and Gas is preparing to drill an oil exploration well on forestry land at Bury Hill Wood (Holmwood) in the Surrey Hills. Before Christmas two district councillors wrote to Mrs Leadsom urging her to revoke the lease with the Forestry Commission Details. The legend of Robin Hood is too precious a memory of past oppression and freedom for the British to let this pass unopposed. It just goes to prove that, strategy or not, fracking must be opposed everywhere regardless. Still, it does indicate a possible reason why the most treasured sites are being targeted first, something which has puzzled me before.

Reply Phil C says: January 2, 2017 at 8:38 pm This is about English culture and heritage pennywise, not the US travesty of Bedford Falls now Potters Town for dummies, soon to be Donald Huck Trumpton for scary clowns and climate change deniers. I would say go and live in your own tree, but of course you cut them all down except for the ones that served the KKK agenda. As climate change becomes more complex and challenging we face losing some of our native species. Our pioneering research and on-the-ground experience has proved we can successfully, and economically, transform brownfield sites such as old collieries and factories into usable greenspace. Reply john Powney says: January 3, 2017 at 7:52 pm Thank you hball for being a representative of the shale gas industry on this article. You have made some really constructive comments. It lived to tell the tale. You can buy the book on Amazon The Secret of Sherwood Forest: Oil Production in England During World War II PS. In 2014 and 2015 we exported more than we imported in LNG from Qatar. I presume Mark has no understanding of the UK indigenous gas market and how much we export. You may not get a reply as we trade around 1.3 billion a year with Qatar. Not sure the Government will want to loose such a lucrative market but as you seem so concerned you really should make the effort. In 2015 (you prefer a full year I recall) we produced 460Twh and imported 492Twh (from Europe and LNG). We exported 162Twh. In 2015 LNG imports increased 23 per cent on 2014, making up 31 per cent of all gas imported. By the way why are you on this board when your only agenda seems to be to publicise the benefits of the North Sea gas industry. Last time was during the 2nd WW, and I am sure that the British people through war bonds and the government with money borrowed from US paid a pretty price for it and then had to pay it back to the US at outrageous rates right up until recently I understand. These have been manufactured to manipulate this country into this fraud. Invasion of our country by O&G exploiters is what is offensive.

Just want to restage the Jackson Nicholson scene. Try again, I cant hear you up in this tree. Reply hballpeenyahoocom says: January 2, 2017 at 11:11 pm I hope you enjoy the tree, Phil. TW says: January 3, 2017 at 10:04 am Sorry Hbpeeny but it is a terribly bad idea. They might cut down this incredibly beautiful tree for fire wood in their camps as they want to stay away from fossil fuel to heat and cook during their stay. Did they have a permit or impact assessment for flaring gas on their camp site. Reply hballpeenyahoocom says: January 3, 2017 at 3:32 pm LOL. What they practice and what they preach are separate and distinct matters, TW. hballpeenyahoocom says: January 3, 2017 at 11:57 pm Mark, I think Phil is probably right next to Ian, lapping that up. He knows that everyone is out to get him. No conspiracy theory pennywise, FACT. hballpeenyahoocom says: January 4, 2017 at 12:42 am Nope, Phil. Even anti-fracking die hards can spot it from a mile away. And so you continue, so and so on, just diversion tactics from the truth. Some of us know better than to fall for that worn out old tactic, How typical. Still waiting pennywise, just look for the really really big tree. Looks like they have, belatedly, been forced to accept the fact that the scientific method should apply to anti-frack claims. ASA certainly saw the scientific method as important. As did Cuadrilla. Just lonely old Phil out there denying away, clutching at straws and rambling on incoherently about Truman. I leave you to decipher that. hballpeenyahoocom says: January 4, 2017 at 4:07 pm As long as you can redirect from the embarrassment over your rejection of the scientific method, Phil. I love the stuff about Truman. Really germane. TW says: January 4, 2017 at 3:41 am Mark. I think they geton just fine. Group hug every night. Ian and the group are working on a new movie script foe the next reboot of the X-file series. It woll most likely to be moderated by the ASA just like the FoE anti fracking leaflet but surely it will be full of imagination. I think its important to know who you are dealing with and these posts, though amusing, really do show the same contempt for everyone that was seen during and after WW2. some bed time reading for you. In my opinion it would make a wonderful mini-TV series. account. Notify me of new posts via email. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.
