correspondents at Standing Rock: In a further escalation of the outrageous eviction of water protectors from Oceti Sakowin camp, the main camp here at Standing Rock, North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple just gave an executive order, effective immediately, to evacuate the camp, under threat of arrest. Dalrymple cites the reason behind this order to be 'public safety concerns'. Just let that sink in for a minute... This order is so THICK with gross hypocrisy, it is hard to even know where to start. First of all, if Dalrymple had ANY concern for the safety of the public, he would not be letting the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) go through, as it an actual danger to the health and safety of the Native people, and to millions more who depend on the Missouri River as their main water source. He would not be unleashing his pigs to brutalize people, set their dogs on people, shoot rubber bullets at people, spray freezing cold water at people in freezing temperatures, seriously injure people with concussion grenades, spray people in the face point blank with mace and pepper spray. This could very well lead to tribal leaders coming under attack for not actively leading people to comply with this order. Hundreds of water protectors have been injured at the hands of the Sheriff's deputies and state police. Hey Dalrymple... If you are reading this, it seems to me like YOU are the threat to public safety in this case. YOU are the one calling for this escalation, not the water protectors. You have no idea how determined the people are, and how capable we are of getting through this brutal winter. Because the Native Americans and everyone who has come to stand up here are the ones who are actually concerned with the health and safety of the public, not just here at Standing Rock, but throughout the country, and the planet as a whole. We are protecting the water from people like you, who viciously resort to brutal and deadly force to enforce a system that can do no other than destroy the environment and continue to commit genocide against Native and other oppressed peoples. You don't give a damn about humanity or the environment. FUCK YOU Dalrymple. We aren't going anywhere. and Revolution Send us your comments.
