The Battle Over Standing Rock Protesters face off with police near site where pipeline is slated to cross the Missouri River next to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. It poses a battle against a ruling class which established its sway through enslavement of African Americans and genocide against the Native American peoples, and has persecuted them ever since. The 1,172-mile pipeline would cross the Missouri River just north of the current boundaries of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, potentially polluting the water supply to the population in case of a spill. With county sheriffs and state police acting as guard dogs for the oil companies, the standoff quickly became a conflict over Indian rights facing powerful corporations and the racist repressive forces of the capitalist state that does their bidding. In this battle, class-conscious workers and revolutionaries must stand squarely on the side of the Standing Rock Sioux. Now, with winter storms and the election of DAPL investor Donald Trump as U.S. president, the battle continues. The announcement by the U.S. Department of the Army on December 4 that it would not grant the pipeline builders a necessary easement (permit) to drill under Lake Oahe, a dammed section of the Missouri River, was met with elation in the three camps of several thousand Native American and other protesters who had gathered near the site at the mouth of the Cannonball River. They also urged protesters to return home as soon as possible. Other tribe members objected that they did not trust the government and would not leave until the pipeline was definitively stopped. Liberals were jubilant. Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics, the two main owners of the Dakota Access Pipeline. North Dakota governor Jack Dalrymple, who threatened mass arrests of pipeline protesters, was a Trump campaign energy advisor. An administration of Big Oil and unbridled police power ensures that the battle over Standing Rock will reignite after January 20. It was the vicious repression of protesters that made Standing Rock national news in the first place. A boiling point came in late August when Republican governor Dalrymple declared a state of emergency. On September 3, security guards hired by ETP brutally attacked Indian and other demonstrators at a construction site near the Sacred Stone Camp near Cannon Ball. Vicious dogs were set on the protestors and pepper spray used against demonstrators, including children. TV footage on Democracy Now viewed by more than 13 million people recalled scenes of 1963 police attacks on civil rights marchers in Birmingham, Alabama. The response of the state of North Dakota was to issue a warrant for the arrest of Democracy Now producer Amy Goodman in a blatant attempt to intimidate media coverage. At least seven journalists have been arrested during the protests, deliberately targeted by the county sheriff.

The company refused. A week later, a federal court ordered a brief halt on construction. But on October 9 a federal appeals court denied the request for an injunction. Two weeks later a militarized force of state and local police beefed up with riot cops from Wisconsin, Indiana, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wyoming and Nebraska launched an assault on the 1851 Treaty Camp, trying to drive out protesters. The multi-state police force was assembled under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), which was signed into law by Democratic president Bill Clinton in 1996. EMAC has been used only twice against protests: first in Baltimore, Maryland following the police murder of Freddie Gray, and now in Standing Rock. The scene was surreal: hundreds of police strung out in a line in the prairie, writing numbers on the arms of arrested protesters and holding them in pens resembling dog kennels; sophisticated police communications vehicles trucked in from hundreds of miles away, and sound cannons blasting away in the middle of vast open spaces.

Protesters were severely injured, including a women who lost the use of her arm after it was nearly blown off, and another who is now blind in one eye after being hit in the face by a tear gas canister. The stage was set for a showdown. Several thousand Native American and other veterans mobilized to converge on Standing Rock to protect the water protectors. But the Corps is viscerally hostile to the Indian population (whose lands they submerged in damming the river and creating Lake Oahe in 1958), and the political echelon of the Pentagon will soon be replaced by a Trump administration that is beholden to the oil companies and an eager proponent of police power. While African Americans, brought here in chains, have had to endure four centuries of oppression, from chattel slavery to Jim Crow segregation and now mass incarceration and wanton police murder, Native Americans subjected to genocide are still under siege over five centuries later. Paramilitary police action against Native American protesters at Standing Rock, North Dakota (November 2016) and to suppress African American upheaval in Baltimore, Maryland (May 2015). A federal judge threw out the racist law. The whole battle over the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock is a blatant case of environmental racism. The original route plotted in May 2014 would have crossed the Missouri ten miles north of the state capital, Bismarck. In fact, objections from Standing Rock about a river crossing a half mile north of the reservation were not even mentioned in the 983 pages of the November 2015 Army Corps Draft Environmental Assessment (written entirely by Dakota Access). So to shorten the route and avoid the need for new easements, the pipeline was routed in the same corridor as the existing Northern Border natural gas pipeline.

As the December 5 showdown in Standing Rock loomed, a carload of veterans made the 17-hour drive from Flint to show their solidarity. Serious ecological and environmental issues under capitalism have an often dominant content of class and racial oppression. So to fight off the attacks by a rapacious ruling class, you need a revolutionary program of class struggle. We are not for or against the pipeline, but we support the right of the Dakota Sioux to keep it out. If they objected to a project to grow petunias (or more likely, sunflowers), we would also support the right of a dispossessed Native American people to defend their lands. The call for an immediate end to the production of oil, on the other hand, is a petty-bourgeois anti-working class demand that would shut down industry. Those who raise it should hand over their iPhones, iPads, MacBook Air laptops, air conditioners, and their electric-powered Toyota Priuses (or gas-guzzling SUVs).

(Internationalist photo) In focusing on pipelines, eco-radicals and Democratic Party liberals are in effect promoting a potentially far more dangerous method of transporting petroleum products: the oil trains that today carry the majority of the Bakken oilfields production. Pipelines are safer, but where they go and what safety measures are required is a class question.
