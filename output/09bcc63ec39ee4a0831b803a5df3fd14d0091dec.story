Also, send me the Politics Red Newsletter. Patheos has the views of the prevalent religions and spiritualities of the world. So many people cave in and bend over backwards to accommodate the most ridiculous requests of federal and state governments, but this story is a reminder of how we all should respond when bureaucrats come knocking at our doors. Recently, Oregon ranchers Larry and Amanda Anderson received a letter by the Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife asking for permission to survey their land in order to track a nearly endangered species. The Andersons constructed one of the best come-back letters of all time. The only way to truly appreciate it is to read it in its entirety: Dear Mr. Niemela: Thank you for your inquiry regarding accessing our property to survey for the yellow-legged frog. We may be able to help you out with this matter. We have divided our 2.26 acres into 75 equal survey units with a draw tag for each unit. Non-Resident). Non-Resident). Survey units open between 8am and 3pm but you cannot commence survey until 9am and must cease all survey activity by 1pm. Handles can only be made of BPA-free plastics or wooden handles. Any frogs captured that are released will need to be released with an approved release device back into the environment unharmed. However, all fees can be waived if you can verify Native Indian Tribal rights and status. Please let us know if we can be of assistance to you. Otherwise, we decline your access to our property but appreciate your inquiry. Here are photos of both letters, provided by PowerLine: Join the only movement that can stop government overreach.

Probably got something to do with firearms training for all that military weaponary the US postal service has purchased between 2006 & 2014. Handles can only be made of BPA-free plastics or wooden handles. Any frogs captured that are released will need to be released with an approved release device back into the environment unharmed. realetybytes I just LOVE this. Who knows what that survey would have been really for. skelnav88 And you care more about animals than people and their right. That is ok. you can crawl back under your rock. The mean ole rational people will not get you. So you like species being driven to extinction. Smokin steve Yes, I consider property rights and an industry nessesary to the US more important the an owl that was used as an excuse by the anti logging lobby to kill the industry. Now there is a power transformer, a freeway,and a housing development, I guess those were better for the land then cows and a farm. Janet Cox Tuhey All they had to do was say no. 2.26 a. is not a ranch. Depending on the slope, if the frogs were found and counted by the time the data was recorded they probably would have already swam off the property. He is far from a patriot. Check out Gary Johnson and the Libertarian Party. Gary is a good man but has no chance in hell. Course, I have ran across many others who no longer care if our Nation turns into a 3rd world sewer, like yourself. At least Trump has accomplishments, love for our Nation, and backs Law & Order and providing jobs for Americans, unlike any of the others. I have NEVER voted for ANY democrat nor ANY republican, the duopoly has practically destroyed the individual freedom the Founders attempted to create in America, why ANYONE would vote for either wing of that bird of prey is beyond my ability to understand. Obama is just the most recent abomination to hold the executive office, but there has not be a single president or congress in my 70 some years of life that has abided by the Constitution. billwhit1357 Oh, Gary Johnson also supports Open Borders and supports the UN in forcing the USA to follow International Law instead of American Law. Just another SOB who is willing to sell out our Nation. Witchwindy You are, sadly, completely misinformed about Gary Johnson. billwhit1357 Simple minds always come up with excuses, but yes, a vote for Gary is still a vote for Hillary, but keep telling yourself that, maybe you can convince yourself, hon. Sad. Krisanne Hall did a constitutional study on him and found he is quite far from being a constitutional and liberty minded candidate. And many here cheer him on. Idiot. Jeremy Parks Found the liberal johnlo It really was an A-hole move. guy is just doing EXACTLY what the gubment does Jordan Scheremeta I camp on government land (USFS) all the time. There are no fees unless you use a developed campground, in which case the fees pay for operation and maintenance of the campground. oldhippie eI-G1 you are a true liberal retard that should have been aborted . The guy has every right to not like an intrusive government and no he was not an ass hole like you are. He was trying to charge the same types of fees that they would have charged him . You are a fukin idiot. Ohh noo big bag government. But, I guess having some guys walk around is really that much of an imposition. Sheila Orr You are obviously living in oblivion. Wake up. Witchwindy The federal government was forbidden by the Constitution to own any lands beyond the 10 mile square of DC and forts and ports. So the Bundys were doing nothing wrong, Constitutionally, it is the government that is doing wrong. gorgegirl You are a perfect example of idiots not knowing what is in the US Constitution. ARTICLE IV, SECTION 3, CLAUSE 2 The federal government owns or controls about thirty percent of the land in the United States. These holdings include national parks, national forests, recreation areas, wildlife refuges, vast tracts of range and wasteland managed by the Bureau of Land Management, reservations held in trust for Native American tribes, military bases, and ordinary federal buildings and installations. Although federal property can be found in every state, the largest concentrations are in the west, where, for example, the federal government owns over eighty percent of the land within Nevada. The primary constitutional authority for the management and control of this vast real-estate empire is the Property Clause. The Property Clause simply allows Congress to act as an ordinary owner of land. It can set policy regarding whether such lands will be sold or retained and, if they are retained, who may enter these lands and for what purposes. Go read the U.S. Constitution. Territory is not even land that the government owns; it is land that the government holds in trust for the states. Once a state petitions to become a state and a member of the Union, that is no longer a territory, and the federal government has no authority over it. That state then becomes an independent, free and sovereign government. You cannot be a state and still be a territory. The federal government has no lawful control over any land in the states outside forts and ports and 10 square miles for Washington, D.C. I challenge anyone, because you cannot. There is no authority for the federal government to dictate to the states or the people how they operate their land. Article 6, Section 2, Clause 2, says that no law made contrary to the Constitution is valid. The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the land, and any statute, to be valid, must be in agreement. It is impossible for both the Constitution and a law violating it to be valid; one must prevail. This is succinctly stated as follows: The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void, and ineffective for any purpose; since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment, and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it. An unconstitutional law, in legal contemplation, is as inoperative as if it had never been passed. Such a statute leaves the question that it purports to settle just as it would be had the statute not been enacted. Since an unconstitutional law is void, the general principals follow that it imposes no duties, confers no rights, creates no office, bestows no power or authority on anyone, affords no protection, and justifies no acts performed under it . . . A void act cannot be legally consistent with a valid one. An unconstitutional law cannot operate to supersede any existing valid law. Indeed, insofar as a statute runs counter to the fundamental law of the land, it is superseded thereby. No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no courts are bound to enforce it. (late 2nd Ed. If that law is arbitrary to the constitution, if it renders you subject to illegal or unconstitutional laws and acts it is in fact, null and void. Keep this in mind when the courts rule in favor of corporate interests knowingly violating the rights and protections afforded the people as described in the Constitution. Almost without exception, every law that has been passed by one administration and congress after another in the last twenty years has substantially violated and reduced the rights of Americans. You have guaranteed rights only so long as you defend them from encroachment by the government. Barry McLawhorn Congratulations you just exposed yourself as a troll. No more food for you. We have natural resources on our land that we understand that needs to be protected. The waste incurred by the government to conduct these ridiculous studies if profane, especially in the face of the utter failure of government to ameliorate the suffering and decline that is present in American human society from sea to shining sea. Finding a frog in the creek on your property is not going to cause any restrictions on the use of the property for the owners. I know of property that has the Western turtle around these ponds. Excalibur We do. That is also the reason we did not get what the land was really worth. The US Government always pays the appraised value from an independent appraiser. Like I said, I am a real estate broker in two states which are in a national scenic area. I also know that the government only takes by eminent domain the amount of land they need. If they only need 10 acres, they will try to get only the 10 acres and nothing more. You reek of hate and a bunch of bull. The republicans on the US Supreme court did make a big mistake when they allowed a private party to claim eminent domain for water front condos in Connecticut. It is time for the US Supreme court to correct that mistake. My, my what a sorry state of mind you have. You will get what they offer, nothing more if you ask or even try to work with them. That is also the reason we did not get what the land was really worth. In the process, we were threatened with that answer. gorgegirl No matter what someone with knowledge has, people like you will never believe it anyway because you choose to have your head up your butt. The death or one of the owners, the ownership passes to the survivor. Or maybe OUR status changed at some point that we were not aware of at some time and this is why this couple can absolutely do what they are doing because they know they are not slaves. John Farrell If they decide they like your land they can find a reason they have to have it. scott young Sorry, but you are just plain wrong. If they did find the frog you would be promptly be made a steward of said frog. If the frog died off you would be held legally responsible. They told him what they would pay and if he did not take it he would receive way less. Probaly the same where these people live only thing may not be the forest service could be a city county state blm etc. gorgegirl Your father probably had an inflated value attached to his property. And, he could contest the appraisal if he was aware of other sales that were comparable that sold for more. But, it is required that the US Forest Service, the BPA or any other government agency pay the fair market value for property they acquire. I wonder if you have ever been envolved with land and imminent domain. I witnessed this myself first hand and know how it was done. And no the land was not over valued by my dad it was what he had been offered for the land prior to the forest service taking it. Some in the area hired attorneys and postponed it for a short time but then a federal judge ordered them off the property or go to jail. Some of the people had lived there all. Their lives not only them but parents and grandparents before them Excalibur That is exactly what happened to us. Steven Davis No, I think all of your comments actually highlight this situation and others like it. This conversation is highlighting the ability of manipulating media in order to push for a specific outcome verses private people trying to protect what is rightfully theirs. For this gorgegirl, who is commenting on the government can do no wrong is an identification of how they, the government or parts of it who are relegated to an agenda use media comments, editorials, social web pages etc, and especially news, to direct people to how they are working to accomplish their agenda. (Mainly property, home, real-estate etc). The frustration for many of us individuals is that when laws are used against us and our hard work, it seems they are manipulating laws and rules of governing for the favor of the few who will benefit. Because we are not going to get it back argueing about it over social media, however, it is here where will can find others who are interested in learning more. Kudos. Michael Jones The U.S. was established as a result of intrusive government. You seem to have a libtard view of government. Michael Jones If you love government so much, feel free to move to Cuba where there is plenty of government. scott young Wrong. We believe in freedom FROM government. Greg81 This was awesome. If you are going to be victimized by an abusive govt in the first place, and will still end up victimized in the end, not taking a stand for your private property rights is not only cowardly, but just stupid. I would rather go down fighting than to be a coward and not even fight for myself. If the Founding Fathers thought like you, there would never be an America. Thank God they did not think like you. David P. Bresett Reagan was a huge criminal. That caused massive illegal immigration into the US from many nations through the Southern Border. Said he was going to abolish the fed education dept and small businesses admin. He abolished neither. While Governor of California he signed gun control legislation into law. 62 Americans murdered by the shooting down KAL 007. Hostages were allowed by Carter and were released when Reagan was elected. There was no such deal. And the growth in the federal employment was mainly in the military. The rest of your screed sounds like it came from Hillary. The Democrats in congress refused to cut spending. Unlike Obama he actually FIXED the problem and the economy recovered. Lie. Currently there are many expecting the globalist bankers to crash the tottering economy so they can blame it on Trump. Knowing in advance that your response will be as rude your comment to David P. Bresett, be assured that you will receive nada from me. Al Wilson If you have to ask then you are too stupid to begin with. Guess what. So you chose a stupidity mark of ten. Just as I thought. Your Yuck response gave you away. So, lets take this a little farther. Does your vocabulary include words more than four letters long. You can use your fingers and toes to help you count. Thank you so much. EboTebo Is Al short for Alvin or Alfred, or were your parents too lazy to use more than two letters because they came to the conclusion that through minimizing your name there would be less chance of them forgetting you existed. Al Wilson Your lack of gray matter is only exceeded by your stupidity ebotebo. gbp91 your kidding or just insanely quacked out Icorps1970 Citations please. Then we will cite Hillary and Obama. Just for a comparison scott young Wrong. Woody That was awesome, but i woulda just told them to fuck off. John Story That man is a fucking asshole. because he is. This is a guy with a job to count frogs. Jim Jimjim Hopefully they will take it. SteveforAmerica Wait till these people start screwing around with your life and property in an arbitrary and dictatorial fashion. Jim Jimjim Hopefully he gets charged with a misdemeanor for this cute little stunt. Derek Hopefully you choke on your tongue in your sleep. Evelyn Swart This is pretty clever. However I am tired of this idea that the government is the enemy. The people who work for the government are generally good people who care about doing a good job. The recipients of this letter probably got a kick out of it, because they are people with a sense of humor. Johnny Thorne The current government IS the enemy. These people are evil, only too happy to enforce the fascist regulations of this oppressive and ever-growing government. Makes you look brilliant. And mannerless. Putz. Ever so much nicer. Robert Hoover Yeh. Now go shovel some more shit in the barn and relax. So , good night , sweety. The Deer was roaming free , not an enclosed pet. I speak from real experience, not NYC vacant opinions. Get lost. Because I use a word you assume I live in NY. Actually Colorado. And by the way I have had to deal with BLM and their idiocy on my own property in the past. Immediately, because she made an innocuous comment about a sense of humor. You need to go find the rock you crawled out from under. It had nothing remotely to do with the gender of such. If you are raising a lot of livestock, go grab a pitchfork and muck out a few stalls to relieve your tensions. hahahaha Brenda Sore loser. Wulver Put the vitriol at the end of the comment. Yes, that seems logical. Of course there could have been a chemical spill upstream and they want to quietly check the levels of poison in the water. Good people work there and a lot of bad people work there. Some who want to throw their weight around. I think your smart and you laid it on ole Robert pretty good though, so I like you. They all want to save the planet, one blade of grass, one frog or one useless fish at a time. Science no longer matters to these agencies in their rule making process. Everything is agenda driven. Reforming the liberal courts will help, but unfortunately, Trump cannot fix this in two terms so hopefully conservatives stay in power for decades to come. I do appreciate living in a nation of laws and I am grateful for the services the government provides. I see myself as a part of a cooperative otherwise known as the government of the people, for the people and by the people. Of course if you are a Zionist you will never admit that. If an endangered frog is found on that small property parcel, it will instantly be rendered useless, uninhabitable (except for the frog) and no longer marketable. They are indifferent and no government has ever had the benefit of a collective as a goal. Lydia Long Brilliant. normanramsey I am truly puzzled. Jack.Foobar The same way 40 year old ISIS members are considered refugee children. The definition of a ranch is a farm where cattle or other animals are bred and raised. JohnL1313 The same way a man with a penis can call himself a woman. mrhdiver I am cracking up. jag11 Well done. Handling bureaucrats with bureaucracy. Brilliant and fighting fire with fire. Cream Of Weber Sounds like a real POS. Derek You sound like a real moron. So thats scary. Being responsible for them wouldnt be good. No thanks. Lophatt Beautiful. Insult grade: D xlaurenstephens because he is really a she and has a vagina. Chuck Breuninger- Rick Charles Sounds like you must have had a bad experience in one of our privatized prisons somewhere. My belief in the Bible is in no way in conflict with the Earth being 4.5 Billion years old. Chuck Breuninger- Rick Charles Oh, and by the way, Capt. Just remember, God still loves you. However, humans 1st evolved in Africa..starting approximately 7-8 million years ago. They do though. So rant and rave about the Clinton family praying and going to church etc. Hey, take the Carter family to task too. So come on. Please, let us hear you scream about how horrible every one of those Democrats is. Scream how Reverends Jesse Jackson, Martin Luther King, Jr., Andrew Young, Mason Durell Bertha (aka Mase), Smokie Norful, Anthony Campolo (spiritual advisor to President Bill Clinton by the way), Gerardo, Marvin Sapp, Creflo Dollar, Bayard Rustin, etc. have all been crazy as prominent Democrats that are or were ministers too. I guess your real complaint is that folks are not Democrats so this list is all wonderful although they are members of the clergy. As for your God, the Blessed Obutthole, he has been a disaster for this country, among other things, he is giving 130 tons of uranium to Iran, a terrorist nation. Look how well that has worked out in Europe. I guess they accidently aborted your brain. I do see the public education lessons stayed with you well though. Bob643 Everybody just stop feeding the troll. That is what he wants. Flag him for hate speech, inappropriate language, and ad hominem attacks. hardh8 I agree, Cry, whine and be a snitch bitch. Just like the libRETARDS a do do. expected WELFARE). A bunch of DUMB WHITE MORONS didnt have enough sense to convict them in Oregon (yet masses of White people still are upset over O.J.). Suck that scock and suck this cock. If you want another mans cock. No jobs are coming back to America, lol. No wall is going to be built, lol. Masses of illegals ARE NOT going to be deported. You Conservative Jesus Freaks are too stupid to realize that no wall needs to be built to stem the tide of illegal immigration. it a felony, punishable by at least one year in jail (mandatory) for any employer to hire an illegal (business owner AND management). You wouldnt need to employ a mass deportation force NOR build a wall. No one would hire illegals because they would fear going to jail. Anthony N Kimmie Nichols It seems that you have politics figured out. I hope that you are feeling better now that you have had a chance to vent. It is very unfortunate that Mrs. Clinton cannot be your president, I understand that you are upset. When my children were so upset because they did not get their way, they would violently scream and cry. That was short lived, because they are no longer two and understand that others may not want to play the same game that they like. I am sorry that you are sad. There may still be enough time to get the government to chip in and buy you a bear to cuddle while you go through this tragic time. Best wishes and as always, warm regards. Trump will have his 4 years as President to show what a fucked up President he is. Sometimes, The Masses have to reach a point of being sick and tired of being sick and tired. We do not need any of you Jesus Freaks coming here to RUIN Everything. our own people. hardh8 I notice all the homosexual references in your comments. We have a system of government that has allowed for eventual change. a White guy wasnt good enough, lol. Glenn Griffith BEST RESPONSE EVER. Glenn Griffith Actually, I do think this idiot is actually stupid enough to believe that. Pass the pipe before you smoke yourself into an asylum Paul Lentz Uh look Sling Blade. led to our ancestors (who were small, fury little rodent-like creatures who scavenged for food) evolving into a variety of mammal-like animals. By the way, I am a GEOLOGIST, and understand the passage of time on this planet wayyyy better than you ever will, and I can tell you that what you are spewing makes ZERO sense. WE(Mankind) honestly has NO IDEA where or WHEN we came from, and the only credible story we can find is looking at HISTORY books like the BIBLE among other books, that tell the story of our creation. try having an open mind, and looking at things from an intelligent perspective, instead of just being a ranting TROLL. But I WILL pray for you. you really are one screwed up puppy. Sick puppies are cute, but still sick. This property has this frog. destravlr . This is not a lesson on how to handle government. Tea Party folk are deluded into wanting power for whatever favorite issue they dream up. Doing so opens them to being sucked into findings of FYLF habitat that will take all control of the land from them. The Center for Biological Diversity has been known to plant yellow legged frogs in previously areas previously uninhabited by YLF in order to get legal control for pushing to have USF&W designated endangered habitat. If you read his disqus profile that has his past postings on various subjects, he actually has some that are coherent. But then this, that we read here. I feel sorry for him. There are THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS of churches in America. You MOFOS still have freedom to worship. Cowboss I see. So this ranting you are doing has nothing to do with the actual article, you just hate religious people and religion and assume that all of us commenting here are religious. I certainly understand where you are coming from now. MMMMKAY. . . Paul Lentz I assume that all right wingers are wacko jesus freaks. Tea baggers are known for being gun totting jesus freaks who hate gays. While, for example, it is estimated that approximately one to three million people were tragically killed in the Crusades, and perhaps 3,000 in the Inquisition, nearly 35 million soldiers and civilians died in the senseless, and secular, slaughter of World War 1 alone. History simply does not support the hypothesis that religion is the major cause of conflict. The wars of the ancient world were rarely, if ever, based on religion. These wars were for territorial conquest, to control borders, secure trade routes, or respond to an internal challenge to political authority. In fact, the ancient conquerors, whether Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, or Roman, openly welcomed the religious beliefs of those they conquered, and often added the new gods to their own pantheon. Medieval and Renaissance wars were also typically about control and wealth as city-states vied for power, often with the support, but rarely instigation, of the Church. And the Mongol Asian rampage, which is thought to have killed nearly 30 million people, had no religious component whatsoever. Victor Vandiver Slavery enters human history with civilization. Hunter-gatherers and primitive farmers have no use for a slave. They collect or grow just enough food for themselves. One more pair of hands is one more mouth. There is no economic advantage in owning another human being. Once people gather in towns and cities, a surplus of food created in the countryside (often now on large estates) makes possible a wide range of crafts in the town. On a large farm or in a workshop there is real benefit in a reliable source of cheap labour, costing no more than the minimum of food and lodging. These are the conditions for slavery. Every ancient civilization uses slaves. And it proves easy to acquire them. War is the main source of supply, and wars are frequent and brutal in early civilizations. When a town falls to a hostile army, it is normal to take into slavery those inhabitants who will make useful workers and to kill the rest. There are several other ways in which slaves are acquired. Pirates offer their captives for sale. A criminal may be sentenced to slavery. An unpayable debt can bring the end of liberty. The impoverished sell their own children. Victor Vandiver Causes of Child Labor Child labor persists even though laws and standards to eliminate it exist. Poverty and unemployment levels are high. Poor children and their families may rely upon child labor in order to improve their chances of attaining basic necessities. The intensified poverty in parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America causes many children there to become child laborers. Glenn Griffith Ignorant pussy it appears, although multiple personality is a possibility. Oh, sorry, that word intelligent threw you for a loop. Srry. Mama needs to wash your pottymouth out with soap and kick you out of the basement. If there was truly environmental justice, the government would use its power of eminent domain and buy that chunk of the land off the people instead. Allowing the government onto their land to do a survey would almost certainly result in areas of their land being declared off limits for any sort of development or use if it was found to be a habitat (or potential habitat). David If I wrote the letter, my fees would have been way, way higher. Katie Sterling LOL Drew Brenneman I love the response given to the state. And all permits are one day use only. And the next day the prices double to allow the state to get access to the property. And just keep on going with fees and deny access to private property. Daniel A. Erskine They wrote their response in jest. 4. Try putting food in that incredibly ignorant mouth without rural citizen farmers. Herbie Barquist What an idiotic response Leon Shisler It may be that you have no Cities where you live but where I live there are more people in one city than all the rest of the County. There fore those people build most of the roads. The other part is that it seems that citizens like to comply with the rules and laws that help them but all others are for the other people to obey -not them. Wow are you delusional. Leon Shisler that was supposed to be County Darren Wilkens You lack basic English comprehension. Like Hank said, a country boy can survive. Lela Madera Many country roads are not much more than a cow trail that only a Jeep or horse can traverse. Bob Loblaw I shot a skunk once that was displaying the symptoms of rabies. A bullet was a more humane death than what nature had in store for it. Who the hell cares what happens in 100 years. Jeezus. And they asked pretty politely. Leon Shisler A little like Trump and his wall. William Piss off. LOL William You can piss off, too. a person Hot air, like whatever the chimp used to spew. Steven Davis Look up the first michigan assembly, The New Republic, review the writings of Judge Anna von Reitz, as you will see the current government is not what we expect it should be or was designed to be. CrustyB Also, do not make direct eye contact with the yellow-legged frog as it makes them speak like Jerry Lewis. Darren Wilkens This story has been floating around for awhile. Emmanuel Truthseeker When some state policy enforcement Israeli trained order taker creates an issue for you in order to generate business for the fraudulent jewish JUST US system and you are inconvenienced; invoice the court for your time and expenses. File it with the court clerk. Also, ask the judge to see his or her license and oath of office. Do that and see what happens. It is all such a pile of jewish malfeasance. That and the taxation systems. Good for you, hold on to that hate and completely unsubstantiated bias until you die. That way, it hopefully dies along with you. Nicholas Landholdt You want self-governance, then restore your State Militia. lol. Steven Davis Not only that, but all the individual items which had to be reviewed and paid for to proceed. Edit: Digging the responses. Some of them are going into my example folder for psychological projection and cognitive dissonance. Get back on your anti-psychotics. whoops123 Yeah, those damn invasive frogs. Some Americans still care about things other than themselves. Unfortunately these people are not in power at the moment. Sorry, world. a person Sorry, but Americans are in charge again, Thank GOD for the GOP kay Be honest. I can tell you to go to DE and check out how well they took care of their water. whoops123 If the feds wanted to cease the water rights, they would just do it. They would just use eminent domain to take it if necessary. Of course the waterways are getting polluted. kay Not hardly, under Obama yes, Under President Trump no. If they would have had more Money, which is controlled by politics and bankers, then they would try to imporve their quality of life. We are again on the verge of that right now, and your comments about this planet is only capable of sustaining 2, is really unacceptable. The fact is that we keep producing people while billions are starving and our planet is dying under the weight of the existing population and their insatiable greed. (Just look at how much money is put into ever election here in the USA). whoops123 Yes, it is a BS health care system. The unbridled greed of the corporations, Millionaires and Billionaires that have bought our government are the problem, not the people. It is not a liberal vs. conservative thing. It is a selfish greed thing. Jeff Hart Just a shocking post. a person Liberals kill and destroy everything they come across. ConcernedinNEFL Apparently what you do not understand DJEB is that had the owner granted the access to his property, as of the commencement of that survey he would have lost all control of it as well. If the frog was shown to live on his property he would have been prohibited from making any improvements, construction, and in some cases to even be outside in the area where the frogs lived because the government would have declared his property an endangered species habitat and virtually any action he would take on his own property would place him in violation as a threat to the species. He would lose all rights to the streams and waterways where those frogs live. ludwigtr Like they said, passive aggressive response to polite and reasonable request, also hating natural environment. Steven Davis It is a simple identification that those who are in support of world depopulation, and moving people into megacities to further control them are using sustainable living, endangered species, and requests such as these to eventually remove people from their homes. However most people respect the land and their property well enough to sustain it in the long run. This BS letter from the Gov was just the 1st step in seizing their land. The native americans were torn off of their property due to not having ownership of their land legally in terms of Admiralty law, in the name of preserving the natural environment. Only to almost wipe out the American Bison, Buffalo, after they kicked the indians off their land. Under Gods law, or the law of the land, they would have been entitled to keep their property. The same thing is going on with agencies trying to preserve the natural environment. It will be returned to its natural state when private property owners are kicked off their property in the name of preservation. How about you take my response and add it to your edit, identifying you are pushing your own psychological projection upon us stating we as Americans have this thing for hate. How about you surrender your property, and leave the country for your insults. You need to apologize to Americans who have the right to say no to uncalled for surveys and unwanted searches of private property. Suzy Selvidge Bravo I must say very well done. Hats off to you for being so creative in sending your reply. I wish I could have done that to various government inquiries that I received. Jeff Hart Soon, I am sure. Steven Davis The move for further surveys has been identified by a lot of private land and home-owners as a means of taking over their private property through an agenda associated with Agenda 21. Moving mass amounts of people out of the country and into Mega cities. This would allos them to better control the masses of people. The problem is, according the the Deagle documents, when these moves begin to happen, they are going to have to cull a lot of people. The world population they have listed with the Georgia guidestones and then supported by the Deagle future trends. (No I am not a conspiracy theorist, as the Deagle documents is a CIA supported organization, thus calling them fake, or made up is a widespread falsity. Someone is paying for the research to have the Deagle information match other information, and it is being done on purpose). (look up the true meaning of CITIZEN in the new constitution written after the civil war. But I will leave that for other discussions. JL Straight If you cannot see the humor of the LANDOWNERS request, then you are part of the problem of how the government has become way to big and intrusive on top of corrupt. Steven Davis Seems there quite a few insult people on here. As a nurse who has been in combat, seeing so many young people die for a position taken by government leaders who are pushing an agenda, rather than standing up for humanity, insults really upset people and I look at those who throw the insults, as political lobbyists who have an agenda rather than those who are interested in the betterment of humanity. Jeff Hart I would be fearful that they might stop my personal uses of my land or even steal my land from me which is happened in the past. So, I would decline also.
