In his inaugural address on Friday, Donald Trump said that ordinary people would be heard under his administration. But his actions already contradict his words. The line was reportedly deactivated during the transition, but has not been turned back on by the Trump team. We the people have a right to be heard, and government officials have an obligation to hear our views. It is unprecedented and deeply disturbing. Now, citizens are instead urged to go to the White House web form or Facebook messenger to send a message to the president. Update: The White House told the Los Angeles Times on Monday that it plans to eventually reopen the phone comment line, but has no current timetable for doing so. This post has been updated to include comments from Kica Matos and to note that the line was reportedly turned off during the transition period.
