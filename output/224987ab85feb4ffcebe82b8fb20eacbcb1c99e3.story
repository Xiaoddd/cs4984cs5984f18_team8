Click here. I'm calling to ask President Obama to step in and stop the attacks on the protesters at Standing Rock -- and to act quickly to stop this pipeline. We have less than 60 days until the president leaves office. There's no time to lose, and people are being hurt and hospitalized right now. Tell President Obama I expect him to side with peaceful protesters and Native American rights -- he must step in to stop police violence, and stop the pipeline. Last week, police attacked the protest camp near Standing Rock with tear gas, rubber bullets, concussion grenades, and even water cannons. Using water cannons in below-freezing temperatures puts people at risk of hypothermia. Hundreds of protesters were hospitalized, with several in serious condition. President Obama has less than 60 days left in office -- that means time is running out to get him to stop these police attacks, and stop the pipeline. Call President Obama and tell him to step in to stop the attacks on protestors and stop the pipeline. Then use the form at the right to report the results of your call.
