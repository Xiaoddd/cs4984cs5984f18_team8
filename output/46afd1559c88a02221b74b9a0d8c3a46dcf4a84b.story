And Trump is so blatant he awakes the snoozing American conscience. And the awareness and the anger stirred into being become a movement, and the movement isn't mere protest over Trump's behavior but a deep and profound cry for atonement for the colonial conquest, the genocide and slavery, out of which this nation created itself, and a demand that we begin acknowledging it rather than feigning ignorance of it -- because the face of ignorance is the face of Trump -- and in this acknowledgement we begin to undo the armed insanity of its contemporary manifestation. This blatant cash grab would simultaneously strip spending from crucial social and environmental programs and further bloat the Pentagon's budget, which already consumes two-thirds of US discretionary spending in pursuit of perpetual war. Let us imagine, just for a moment, this and other movements blossoming across the country and across the planet, pulling in the young and the wounded and the aware, who begin committing their lives to the evolution of nations beyond militarism and violent confrontation. Let us imagine a presidential candidate -- one running in the 2020 election -- emerging from these movements, who articulates a vision of this country beyond militarism so compellingly, and garners so much backing, that she or he cannot be ignored by the media or mockingly dismissed by establishment insiders. Let us imagine the collapse of the military-industrial status quo, which, at least in its current form, began entrenching itself in the US political and social structure both economically and psychologically since World War II. Of course, it's the money part that will be hardest to undo, but the Trump phenomenon certainly begins waking the nation up psychologically. Consider, for instance, the media shockwaves he generated recently when he fawned so lovingly over Egypt's dictatorial president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, as though, good God, this repressive tyrant is a friend and ally. Yeah, that's Trump, beloved violator of protocol and military-industrial discretion, even as he plays the same game that's always been played. He's our self-proclaimed Caesar, attempting to bring back the days when military glory spoke for itself, when the enemy was the enemy and killing him didn't have to be cloaked in the language of political correctness.
