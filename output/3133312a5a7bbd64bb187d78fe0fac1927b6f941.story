Police deny using grenades and say she might have been injured by an exploding propane tank set off by protesters. Eyewitnesses dispute the police account. It was seeing a woman severely injured. He said he and Butte friend Isaiah Other Bull were close to protester Sophia Wilansky when she was injured in a confrontation with police. After the water-spraying, the crowd had thinned out to fewer than a dozen people. Law enforcement at the scene denied using grenades and said Wilansky may have been hurt by a propane tank being used as a weapon by the protesters. But Wilansky, Willis, Other Bull and other eyewitnesses dispute that account. He said the police were firing tear gas canisters while she was down. Other Bull was also nearby, and his account matches Willis'. She was trying to get up and run back and that's when they threw that grenade at her. Big old wound. All open. The Morton County Sheriff's Office has said authorities did not use concussion grenades or any devices that produce a flash or bang during a clash late Sunday and early Monday near the camp along the pipeline route in southern North Dakota where protesters have gathered for months. The sheriff's office suggested in a statement Monday that an explosion heard during the skirmish might have been caused by small propane tanks that authorities said protesters had rigged to explode. Willis said he saw men get out of a giant armored vehicle labeled Stutsman County (N.D.). They didn't act like professionals at all. They acted like were in a different country and they were in a war. Afterward, both Willis and Other Bull said the event had changed them. Other Bull, 23, lives in both Butte and on the Cheyenne reservation in Lame Deer. His mother, Michaelynn Hawk of Butte, belongs to the Crow nation and is executive director of the Indian People's Action. ... we were all there to save Mother Earth.
