Monkeywrenching Security Zines Read. Distribute. Fallen Warriors Obituaries to fallen warriors. Journal. Newswire Three water protectors and an independent journalist were arrested Saturday on private land and the controversial Bayou Bridge Pipeline now faces more legal trouble for beginning construction on a section of its pipeline route across the Atchafalaya Basin without permission. Theda Wright and her sisters are outraged. They own a 38-acre parcel of cypress forest near Bayou Chene, on the west side of the Atchafalaya Basin and have not given Energy Transfer Partners permission to be there or to destroy their land. Despite pressure from the company, Wright and her sisters have refused to sign a contract granting the pipeline company permission to the roughly 1500-foot easement it has planned for her land. That is a rate of about one penny per foot of pipeline the company hopes to operate across the Wright family land. With permission from the landowners to occupy their property, opponents of the pipeline acted to stop any further destruction of the Wright family land by engineering a skypod, a type of blockade across the property line preventing Bayou Bridge equipment from further destroying the land. The skypod consists of high tension rope that is acting as a life line for a tree-sit platform. If any of the ropes are cut, the platform could fall, endangering the life of the person in the tree and anyone below. Video footage shows ETP workers are continuing to operate heavy machinery within close-proximity of the life line. After the arrests on Saturday, ETP workers began to verbally threaten and pull on the support line, causing the platform to violently shake, further endangering the life of the water protector perched atop. Recently, Water Protectors were snatched from their kayaks in the Intercoastal Waterway by off-duty Department of Corrections officers, who refused to identify themselves, moonlighting as security for ETP. On that day, water protectors were dragged out of their kayaks and dragged onto a fan boat where they were bound by Department of Corrections officers. They are the first to be charged under the Act 692 (formally HB 727) which makes it a felony to be on a pipeline easement while engaging in non-violent direct action against the construction of the Bayou Bridge pipeline.
