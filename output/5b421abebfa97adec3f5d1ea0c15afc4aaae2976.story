This week a federal court had its own interpretation of the rule of law. Photo by Matthew Hamon. That was the phrase used over and over by law enforcement from the state of North Dakota and Morton County. It was supposed to serve as a box to limit First Amendment and civil disobedience actions by water protectors opposing the Dakota Access oil pipeline crossing under the Missouri River. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier told The Bismarck Tribune that was beyond his job parameters. This statement was and still is nonsense. The Constitution of the United States declares treaties to be the supreme law of the land. And weightier than the claim of a property right on federal property. And significantly more potent than the urgency to construct an oil pipeline before the price of oil drops. To enforce the so-called rule of law, virtual armies were sent in to arrest hundreds of people for speaking out. The Petrostate of North Dakota lost the rule of law argument a long time ago. All the company, the county, and the state, had to do was to be patient. Accommodate the camps. Learn from the community. Take heart from any lessons that might surface. Perhaps, even then, there would be disagreements, but at least there would also be respect. And there would have been an honorable place for the rule of law. Instead the company, state, and county, opted for might makes right. This week a federal court had its own interpretation of the rule of law. The lake is also the primary source of water for the Cheyenne River Reservation. In other words: Water is life. And that notion is backed up by a treaty relationship between the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River nations. There will be a continued legal back and forth. Some rulings will favor the tribes, others the pipeline company. And perhaps there will be a new Environmental Impact Statement. This is a moment for the Dakota Access pipeline partners, the state of North Dakota and Morton County, to change tactics, too. The company and state can start over, too, building on this court decision to start a new chapter. So many lessons came from what happened at Standing Rock. Let respect for the rule of law be one lesson learned. No Paywall. No Ads. Just Readers Like You. You can help fund powerful stories to light the way forward.
