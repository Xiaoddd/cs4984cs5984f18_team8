The Red Lake Nation and Enbridge recently agreed to terms on a financial settlement and land swap. The previous deadline to terminate the sale was Dec. 31. Phillips 66 owns the remaining 25 percent. Since, protesters have celebrated a major though possibly short-lived victory as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers this month denied an easement necessary for the pipeline to cross a dammed section of the Missouri River called Lake Oahe. The 1,172-mile pipeline, capable of carrying 400,000 barrels of crude oil between North Dakota and Illinois per day, is complete but for that crossing. None of the companies involved cite a reason to push back the termination date in SEC filings, though uncertainty over the project's future could play a part. Enbridge, a Canadian pipeline company, has a major terminal in Superior and employs hundreds of people in the Twin Ports.
