Yates on the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation to show opposition to the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, also known as the Bakken pipeline. Standing Rock Sioux Tribe resolution opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline Riders on horseback set out from the tribal administration building traveling dozens of miles to the mouth of the Cannonball River where the projected pipeline will go through.

Its proposed route would cross the Cannonball River and across the Missouri River, twice. The proposed pipeline would also threaten significant sites of historical and cultural significance to many Northern Plains tribes, including the Lakota, Dakota, Mandan, Arikara and Cheyenne. Later this is where Wisespirit and Tatanka Ohitika held sundances. There are numerous old Mandan, Cheyenne, and Arikara villages located in this area and burial sites.

Its permit for construction now sits with the Army Corp of Engineers. According to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal government, the proposed pipeline is also in violation of the Ft. Riders set out for Cannonball. Photo by Waniya Locke Of paramount concern is the threat the pipeline poses to drinking water. All pipelines break at some point in their lifetime. Pipelines spill their contents. Photo by Ladonna Bravebull Allard After reaching Cannonball, a Spiritual Camp was set up at the point the pipeline crosses the river. Warriors have committed to staying in the spiritual camp until the pipeline is stopped. When this proposed pipeline breaks, as the vast majority of pipelines do, over half of the drinking water in South Dakota will be affected. It must be stopped. Earth is our mother.
