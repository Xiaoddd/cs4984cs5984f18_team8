I knew once I came out, there were people on water protector side that hate me, and I get it. Thompson, 30, took his first step on July 12 during a live feed with Myron Dewey, owner of Digital Smoke Signals, promising information pertaining to security work along the Dakota Access Pipeline. Thompson was on his way to photograph burning trucks, he said, property he was charged to protect, when he was run off the road by another vehicle. He fled, AR-15 in hand, toward a nearby pond where Nastacio and two others approached him. The decision to speak out was not taken lightly, he said. Tensions were high. There are two sides to it: Pro-DAPL and No-DAPL. A friend introduced Thompson to the security company in August 2016, and when he began working, TigerSwan was already firmly in command of all security companies involved. TigerSwan operatives led the daily briefings, which were attended by law enforcement, and coordinated intelligence reports. As a former veteran, serving three tours in the Middle East, Thompson received an honorable discharge in 2013 as a sergeant. Native Americans call Thompson War Eagle, for being a veteran and a warrior. Thompson and Dockter broke up shortly after he was arrested on domestic abuse and drug paraphernalia charges last April. He also quit his job with Leighton Security Services the same month. For approximately three more months, Thompson and Dockter remained apart, but recently patched their relationship, admitting drugs had no more room in their relationship. I was more worried about our guys getting surrounded, or overtaken by protesters. Thompson had at least two-dozen employees he oversaw, he said. Never once did he train with TigerSwan or the North Dakota National Guard. His daily routine included driving between construction sites, relaying information, scheduling, and ensuring construction workers were brought to safety, he said. Soon after the October 27 incident with Nastacio, Thompson was involved in an argument with a TigerSwan operative, he said. Leighton Security Services is an active private security company based out of Texas. Kevin Mayberry, the owner and president, feels confident his company left as good an impression as possible on locals and Standing Rock leadership and activists. Leighton Security Services was subcontracted to EH Investigations and two other companies along the Dakota Access Pipeline. He once received an anonymous email from someone claiming to be a TigerSwan employee who leaked that the international security company was actively trying to sabotage other security companies in the area and shift blame, Mayberry said. TigerSwan, its founder James Reese, and EH Investigations currently face civil lawsuits filed by the North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board, a governor-appointed committee that licenses and regulates private security industries in North Dakota. When called to a site that included activists, Mayberry said that Standing Rock leaders and activists showed him and his company respect. When asked about illegal tactics used by TigerSwan or other security companies, Thompson said he needed to wait to testify in court. Intelligence reports were an integral component of daily security briefings he attended. He has only one regret, he said. He is quietly confident, answering questions briefly but succinctly. The idea that women are not funny never entered my mind. Editorial Wisdom from a forgotten flagpole by Sabrina Hornung Photo by Sabrina HornungI had a little bit of gravel-road therapy this weekend, found myself cruising rural Burleigh County and made a pit stop at Lake Mitchell. Participants were judged on creativity, flavor, and presentation; and this year we added a new category. I suffer from acute scoliosis in my lower back, and pain radiates from this area on a daily basis.
