They formed a circle and made speeches. A Lakota Sioux man sang prayers, cutting through the winter air in a mournful, high-pitched chant. The mood was solemn. Earlier that day, the US Army Corps of Engineers granted the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline an easement to pass beneath Lake Oahe and the Missouri River, north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Since the middle of 2016, thousands of Native Americans have been fighting to prevent the pipeline's completion. In the final days of Barack Obama's presidency the White House put construction on hold pending further assessments, and for a moment the protesters believed they had won. Crowds celebrated with fireworks on the snow-swamped prairie of North Dakota. Within days of taking office, he issued an executive memorandum on 24 January calling for the pipeline to proceed. Two weeks later, the president's order was obliged, and the Corps granted the easement. For the Sioux people who opposed this venture and the coalition of 200 tribal nations that joined them, this development is a crushing blow. For those who have been campaigning for the pipeline, including workers unions, oil and gas advocates and some Republican politicians like Sarah Palin, this was a pivotal victory. The last 1.5 mile (2.4 km) stretch of the pipeline is expected to be completed in less than 90 days. Activist groups have mobilised in an attempt to reverse the decision, planning direct actions in New York, Chicago and hundreds of other locations across the US. Campaigners have already enjoyed some success. A legal challenge against the pipeline has also been mounted. A lawsuit has been ongoing between the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River tribes and the federal government since September 2016. The plaintiffs filed a request for a temporary halt to pipeline construction in federal court in Washington DC on 9 February.

The tribes may also request a summary judgement on their lawsuit, which would fast-track their case and compel the judge to make a ruling ahead of schedule - either in favour of the tribes or in favour of the government. By what means remains unclear. Although as many as 10,000 people were camped out in North Dakota in solidarity with Standing Rock in December, the Native American camps have shrunk considerably since. Between 300 and 500 people are currently living near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball Rivers in three camps: Oceti Sakowin, Sacred Stone and Rosebud Sicangu.

In a slow, bitterly cold process, they are currently relocating their tents, trucks, yurts and teepees to higher ground leased by the Cheyanne River Sioux. The original camps could be vacated within a matter of weeks. Theda New Brest, a member of the Blackfoot Confederacy, also believes the Standing Rock tribal alliance faces difficult days ahead. Neither the Standing Rock Tribe, nor its allies, intend to stand down in the wake of their latest setback. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.
