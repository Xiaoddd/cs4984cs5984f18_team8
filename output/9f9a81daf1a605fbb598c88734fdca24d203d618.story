These Native Americans want to stop an oil terminal. In October, Shell halted its plans for an oil-by-rail project at its refinery in nearby Anacortes following broad opposition. The Cherry Point coal export terminal planned in Whatcom County was rejected by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in May because it would impact the treaty rights of the Lummi Nation. Fossil fuel projects have been opposed in the Pacific Northwest because of the local impact as well as their overall contribution to climate change. Advertisement Climate change has already impacted the Quinault. Sharp said efforts to protect residents from the rising seas weren't working anymore. Advertisement As their village is being moved to higher ground, Houston-based Contanda has asked the city of Hoquiam for permits to expand its methanol facility to handle crude oil as well. Hoquiam is south of the Quinault reservation on Grays Harbor. Grays Harbor falls within the Quinault tribe's federally reserved treaty fishing and gathering area. The city received over 100,000 public comments on the proposal. Local opposition can be effective in stopping these proposals because they require approval from local governments, Ramel said. What communities around Grays Harbor want is to protect the natural resources they depend on from some of the most hazardous oil in the world. Advertisement Potential spills in Grays Harbor or the ocean would threaten treaty-protected fishing resources. Just last month an oil tanker ran aground north of Washington state in Bella Bella, British Columbia. Advertisement Booms were largely ineffective at containing the oil and cleanup efforts were thwarted by bad weather, including strong winds. The Quinault as well as non-native fishermen who depend on Grays Harbor and the surrounding waters for their livelihoods fear the same could happen in their waters if Contanda receives the permits it needs. It has also united residents from cities all over the state. Advertisement Washington residents along the rail corridor from cities as far as Spokane, in the northeast of the state, have protested against increasing oil-by-rail. Activists shut down Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) tracks in the city in September. No one was killed. Advertisement Bakken crude oil has been connected to a string of disasters, including a derailment in in Lac Megantic, Quebec, which killed 47 people and destroyed the city center. Each project that increases oil train traffic adds to the threat posed to communities that gain nothing from these projects, Ramel said. While the EIS found that if any spill or explosion occurred it could cause unavoidable environmental impacts, as well as impacts to tribal resources, it also proposed mitigation measures to reduce those impacts. Advertisement Contanda, for its part, said the EIS shows how to build the expansion in a way that protects the community and the environment. Whatcom County in August also enacted a 60-day ban on new permit applications to ship fossil fuels out of Cherry Point. Rock stopped a pipeline. Rock stopped a pipeline.
