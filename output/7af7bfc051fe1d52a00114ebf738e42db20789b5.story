The Keystone pipeline was opposed by environmental activists and rejected by the Obama administration in 2015. The Dakota Access pipeline was fought by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe because it cuts through their ancestral lands and endangers their water supply. The Obama administration halted work on the Dakota pipeline only recently. Trump approved both pipelines to create jobs and please the fossil fuel industry.

And then there are his documents links to the New York crime families all the way back to when he was in his 20s. But HC sinned by having her own server. Reply Joe says: January 24, 2017 at 3:30 pm Thank you Lloyd and Susan, my sentiments also. Norwegian Filmmaker says: January 25, 2017 at 7:07 am Goes without saying the the USA would be far better off with HC. The difference, in my limited perspective, is that politicians in the past have been in the pockets of Wall Street fat cats. Now the Wall Street fat cats have filled the government positions that were once held by politicians . . . this being the case far more than in the past. It is a horrible mess. Lloyd Lofthouse says: January 25, 2017 at 1:22 pm We will have to wait and see. In 2018, we have midterm elections. The 2016 election is the perfect example of what happens when there are no laws stopping voter suppression. In addition. all the GOP needs is one more state they control and then they can hold a Constructional convention and amend the Constitution anyway they want. The only election the Democratic have an easier chance of winning will be the presidency in 2020, and no telling what the GOP majorette will do in the next four years to insure they keep the White House. Dienne says: January 24, 2017 at 2:23 pm Hillary was in favor of both the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines until the political winds blew the wrong way for her, so she at least had to say she was opposed to them, if tepidly. GregB says: January 24, 2017 at 4:19 pm Dienne, I believe you fail to understand a fundamental trait which has sustained our system of politics and governing; pragmatism has generally won out over ideology. Trumpism is a raw, simplistic ideology built on prejudices and falsehoods. Hillary Clinton, whatever you may have thought of her, is solidly within the American pragmatic tradition. She, like most Americans, was capable of changing her mind when presented with arguments. Donald is not. Those native Americans had better show up with automatic riles that wont work . You think Aleppo looks bad just wait till you see Standing Rock . You keep talking about Hillary and Barrack . You are as bad as NYCPSP on the other end.. Am I being paranoid . When the president of the US puts a gag order on EPA and FDA . Next probably BLS and NASA . You are watching Democracy slip away. You keep talking about Hillary . Like NYCPSP if you are not part of the solution you are the problem . There is no comparison. No equivalence . Pence is out for partaking in the coup. Lloyd Lofthouse says: January 24, 2017 at 8:52 pm Really, here we go with blaming Hillary Clinton again. From his favorite alternative Alt-Right news source, obviously. And unfortunately from my perspective, one that interferes with our ability to move forward with all the other issues. As such, I know there is a very careful evaluation continuing and that the final decision is pending to be made by Secretary Kerry and President Obama. Other than that one comment, Clinton did not indicate her position on Keystone until she announced that she opposed it in September 2015.

Reply dianeravitch says: January 24, 2017 at 2:44 pm Rick, I criticized the Obama administration daily for its awful education policies. I will criticize Trump when he lies, appoints people like DeVos to destroy public education, acts in the interest of Russia not the US, harms the environment, and appoints bigots to carry out bigoted policies. Reply Rick Lapworth says: January 24, 2017 at 2:49 pm Pumping hydrocarbons from point A to B has been going on for decades and does have its problems, but we all drive cars so its kind of hypocritical to be too scrutinizing about one pipeline. To claim this pipeline will harm their water source goes beyond the facts, because it may not, and the company is willing to reroute it if needed (I believe). Linda says: January 24, 2017 at 3:25 pm Rick Lapworth Explain why the Dakota Pipeline was moved from its original route. The Sioux, and other water protectors deserve the full support of all Americans. Your comments are egregious. Rick Lapworth says: January 25, 2017 at 6:12 am Good points and well received. Yes, Indians and others have their rights and I respect that. eminent domain) then those decisions need prayerful wisdom. I joined this blog to discuss pedagogy and schools, not environmental problems, I thought that what it was about. Linda says: January 24, 2017 at 3:40 pm If Rick is relying on the water safety pronouncements of the Army Corps of Engineers, he should read the court documents in the recent case involving the EPA, polluted sediment and Lake Erie. If e-mails, from ACE managers. provided in court documents, are confirmed, the lengths to which ACE management went to coerce community acceptance, of a potentially dangerous water situation, are, according to veteran experts, shocking and unprecedented. The real culprit is our materialism and hedonism that makes us believe and act as if consuming more and having more brings happiness. Until Americans can quit lusting for more stuff (which uses energy to make) we will have our environmental problems and dilemmas. I agree with everything you mentioned about the man. I have big reactions to him over any other republican candidate. But this man make my skin crawl he speaks and the way he speaks. I have asked some of my republican friends who feel the say way. He thinks he is Putin Jr. Reply SomeDAM Poet says: January 24, 2017 at 2:34 pm Executive orders are a very poor way of addressing climate change precisely because it is very long-term problem and most executive orders can be easily reversed by a new President. Obama certainly knew this. Good grief. One is sneaky and polished and refined about damaging public education and the other is gross, crude, loud, and vulgar about damaging public education. In the end, the guy in the Armani suit who detonated political bombs in public education and the guy who wear storn blue jeans and is sweaty while operating the wrecking ball show no differences between each other because in the end, public education ends up obliterated. No, there is NO substantial difference between Trump and Obama when it comes to education. Good grief Reply Joe says: January 24, 2017 at 4:09 pm I see. Then you really do think Trump and Obama are equivalent. Thank you for clearing that up. YOU REMEMBER, YOU ALWAYS SAY KEEP THE OIL. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, WHEN WE WERE IN, WE GOT OUT WRONG. BUT, OKAY. End quote. Trump, in essence, declared war on Iraq so we can grab their oil. There is no equivalency between HRC and DT, not even close.
