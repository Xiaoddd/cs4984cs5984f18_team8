Officials will instead conduct environmental impact reviews to determine alternate paths. The decision was a huge victory for the local Indigenous people, as well as the thousands of supporters who had traveled to a sprawling camp on the reservation to protest against the pipeline's construction. Fireworks exploded over the Oceti Sakowin camp late Sunday in celebration. But Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the project, said in a statement late Sunday that they were committed to ensuring there would be no re-routing. The company did not specify how they expect to continue building under the river in spite of the Army Corps' announcement, but their backers have indicated they hope President-elect Donald Trump will reverse the decision when he takes office next month. Trump was financially invested in the company, but his spokeswoman Hope Hicks told BuzzFeed News that he sold off all of his shares in Energy Transfer Partners in June. But Dallas Goldtooth, the lead organizer for the Indigenous Environmental Network, told BuzzFeed News in a statement that the future of the pipeline was not certain.
