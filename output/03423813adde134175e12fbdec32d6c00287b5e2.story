Tell us how the Trump tariffs are affecting you. BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- The Latest on the Dakota Access pipeline (all times local): 2:30 p.m. Six police officers suffered minor injuries and one protester was taken to a hospital after a clash between law enforcement and opponents of the Dakota Access pipeline in southern North Dakota. Opponents worry the pipeline will harm the environment. Authorities say the officers used less-than-lethal ammunition against protesters, including bean bag rounds and tear gas. The officers suffered ankle, shoulder, wrist and hand injuries. The protester who was taken to a hospital suffered a face injury. Protesters reported other injuries on social media. Twenty-one protesters were arrested, bringing total arrests since Aug. 10 to 624. A group of about two dozen North Dakota landowners is suing the developer of the disputed Dakota Access oil pipeline for alleged deceit and fraud in acquiring land easements. The landowners maintain Dakota Access engaged in unfair tactics and fraud while negotiating to lay pipeline on private land, resulting in compensation that was as much as nine times lower than what other landowners got. ETP spokeswoman Vicki Granado says the company believes the allegations are without merit. The company has until about the end of the month to file its response in court.
