The National Basketball Association partners with and is sponsored by BBVA Compass. The NBA is complicit in the funding and construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the atrocities committed against the Standing Rock Sioux through its partnership with BBVA Compass. Less than two months ago, the United States Army Corps of Engineers halted the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in order to conduct an environmental impact study. This study would have likely shown that which we already know, but has been halted and seemingly forgotten under the current presidential administration. In fact, The US Army Corps of Engineers changed the original route of the pipeline in order to protect the city of Bismarck's water supply in the event of a spill. Furthermore, the Standing Rock Sioux believe this land to be sacred, containing burial sites of their ancestors, and protected by the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, Not only is this a matter of environmental justice, but it is clearly a matter of human rights and racial justice as well. The NBA stood up against HB2 in North Carolina by moving the NBA All-Star game from Charlotte to New Orleans. Now we ask that the NBA stand for Standing Rock and for the Standing Rock Sioux by ending its partnership with BBVA Compass. We, the undersigned, call on the National Basketball Association to immediately terminate its partnership with BBVA Compass and all of its subsidiaries until BBVA Securities has completely divested from funding the Dakota Access Pipeline. Until that time, the undersigned will boycott all NBA related and NBA sponsored events and products.
