Pence and Netanyahu were asked by a reporter about an embassy move. Upon his arrival at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, the US vice president reviewed an Israeli honor guard and even broke protocol by speaking to some of the soldiers. The visits by the president and the vice president are a testament to the strength of these ties. President Mahmoud Abbas left for an overseas visit before the vice president's arrival. Nor is Pence, an evangelical Christian who has been vocal on the subject of protecting Christians in the Middle East, scheduled to make any private trips to Palestinian areas such as Bethlehem, a city whose Christian significance usually draws Western dignitaries. Mrs. Pence meets with Mrs. Netanyahu While Pence and Netanyahu were meeting at the Prime Minister's Office, their wives Karen and Sara met with representatives of The Israeli Association of Creative and Expressive Therapies (Yahat), a cause close to Mrs. Pence's heart. It's such a spectacular profession that I've decided to become an advocate for you. I want to raise awareness and elevate your profession. A shower at the Knesset Later in the day, Vice President Pence will address Israel's parliament, the Knesset, at 2pm, following which he will meet with Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein. The American vice president will finish his day with a dinner at the Prime Minister's Residence with the Netanyahu couple, and the two leaders are also expected to deliver remarks to the media. In his Knesset speech, the American vice president is expected to reiterate Trump's recognition of Jerusalem, and possibly present a timetable for the Israeli embassy's move to the capital. US officials have said an embassy move from Tel Aviv could take up to three years. But there has been speculation that Pence could announce a stop-gap arrangement, such as the conversion of one of the US consulate buildings in Jerusalem to a de facto embassy. Netanyahu has said he expected at least an interim arrangement to go into effect very soon, perhaps within a year. Only members of the Joint List Party are expected to miss the speech after announcing they will boycott it in solidarity with the Palestinians. Pence has made a list of requests ahead of his visit to the Knesset, including a teleprompter, two additional cameras to document his speech in addition to the Knesset Channel cameras, warm lighting, and a room with a shower to get ready in. Several streets in Jerusalem will be closed for traffic throughout the day due to Pence's visit, including Plumer, Jabotinsky, HaNasi, HaAri, Gaza, Nayot, HaRav Herzog, Zalman Shneur, Yehuda Burla, HaMuze'onim Boulevard, Haminhala, Shmuel Stephan Weiz, Balfour, and the Knesset area. David HaMelech Street will remain closed throughout the entire visit, until Tuesday. The US vice president will then visit the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum, where he will lay a wreath. In the afternoon, Pence is expected to make a private visit to the Western Wall. In the evening, he will bid Israel farewell on board Air Force Two. In protest of Pence's visit, the Palestinian Authority announced a general strike on Tuesday including both the private and public security. Only medical facilities will operate, while schools will finish early, at 12pm. The private sector in the Gaza Strip also announced a general strike in protest of the continued blockade by both Israel and Egypt and the worsening economic situation in the enclave.
