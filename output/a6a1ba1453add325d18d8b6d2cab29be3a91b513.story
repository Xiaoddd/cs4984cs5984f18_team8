The demonstrators were attempting to break through a barricade put up by the state of North Dakota at the end of October, on a bridge on Highway 1806. Police used tear gas, concussion grenades, and rubber bullets, as well as a water cannon on the demonstrators. Indigenous Rising Media reported that 167 people were injured, including three elders. They wrote in an evening update that the police were targeting the heads and legs of the protesters. They are being trapped and attacked. One officer was reportedly hit in the head with a rock. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe is protesting the oil pipeline, pointing out that it is destructive to both sacred lands and to the environment. They have been actively protesting at the encampments since April, and have been joined by thousands of people from across the nation. The 1,160-mile pipeline will transport some 450,000 barrels of oil per day across the Missouri River and other sensitive habitats. Opponents observe that a leak would be catastrophic for the water supply of millions of people. In addition to the protest, the tribe is also suing the US federal government to stop construction.
