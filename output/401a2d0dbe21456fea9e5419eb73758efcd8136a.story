We're with you, friends. My favorite performers were: Nabiyah Be and Mike de Leon. This online festival supports the Water Protectors as they continue to lead the cultural revolution in America, standing strong in the resistance of the DALP. Throughout our online Music Festival, the water protectors will be hosting a Treaty Convention, which is Oceti Sakowin Independent traditional meeting adopted at the Vienna Convention. We can send our love and support through music throughout this convention (April 27-June 2). Funds will aid in supporting legal fees as well as the Standing Rock Film Festival in South Dakota June 2-4th.
