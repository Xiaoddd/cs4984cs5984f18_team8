The Line 2A pipeline was damaged by a third-party line strike involving Ledcor and TransCanada, who were doing construction in the area on Friday afternoon, Enbridge said in a media release. Enbridge immediately shut down five other pipelines in the area as a precaution. Crews are now working to clean up the spill, which is contained in an excavation pit. Air quality is being monitored, Enbridge says. The National Energy Board was notified of the spill Friday at around 3 p.m. NEB staff have been called to the site east of Edmonton to oversee cleanup and remediation of any environment effects caused by the spill. No one was injured, there was no fire and no evacuations were ordered as a result of the spill, the NEB said. 'There is no product that has travelled off-lease' There is no risk to public safety, NEB spokesman Darin Barter said. It is usually used for fuel at refiners or for other industrial purposes, he added. Barter could not say how long cleanup would take, but said NEB staff will remain on-site for as long as they're required. It's not in a sensitive area, it's within a pipeline right of way.
