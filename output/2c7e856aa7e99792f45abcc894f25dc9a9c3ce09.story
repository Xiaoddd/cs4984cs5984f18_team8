The group wants the injunction in place while the court decides whether to issue a temporary restraining order against police, arguing the police actions and munitions used fall outside legal parameters. The complaint lists nine individuals who were injured Nov. 20 when protesters and police clashed at the barricaded Backwater Bridge near the protest encampment. According to the filing, protesters sustained loss of consciousness, facial burns, broken bones, genital injury and other wounds. It is only a matter of luck that no one has been killed. Kirchmeier said he had not been served notice of the lawsuit, but the impact munitions described in the lawsuit are used for the protection of the officers.
