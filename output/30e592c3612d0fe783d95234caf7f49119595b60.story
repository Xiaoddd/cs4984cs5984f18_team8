I became acquainted with her through her gorgeous photography of mothers, and fell only further into adoration as I saw all of the beauty that Jade captures, and that she herself possess. The beautiful humans defending their collective desire to save their sacred land call themselves 'protectors' rather than what media tends to call them, protesters. The humans are protecting their land completely and entirely non-violently. Every day that the protectors march to the front line, with the goal of blocking access to the building of the pipeline which they refer to as The Black Snake, there is a ceremony and prayer to send them off the peaceful warriors and the same intentional ceremony of love and respect when they return. Just last weekend (October 22nd and 23rd) hundreds of protectors were maced, beaten with batons (the police armed with assault rifles), and hundreds taken to jail as they peacefully stood in the way of construction of the pipe line. The police are also shooting down with rubber bullets the drones that the water protectors which are filming the police brutal interactions with the peaceful protectors. The pipeline was originally routed to go through Bismark, the capital of North Dakota and the largest city in the state. After consideration, the pipeline was re-routed to go through Sioux land and under their sacred Missouri river and sacred burial sites. Dakota Access Pipeline assures the tribe that the pipe is completely safe and will not damage their water. We make a love-filled team.
