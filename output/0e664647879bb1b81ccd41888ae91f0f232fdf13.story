An aerial view of the main protest camp Monday, Feb. 13, 2017, on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land at the confluence of the Missouri River and Cannonball River in southern Morton County N.D. This view shows the camp's main entrance road at left with cluster of tents in lower center being the camp headquarters. They're wrong, of course. Their concerns are overblown. Their notions about tribal land, while born of a tragic and regrettable history, are simply unworkable in 2017. You can't say that about the left wing organizers or the celebrity activists like Shailene Woodley and Mark Ruffalo. They came to south central North Dakota and mouthed words about protecting water, and protecting land, while credulous and star struck reporters scrambled to document their inane utterances. They went back to Hollywood and used their platforms at awards shows and movie premiers to advertise their participation in the protests. The land they said they wanted to protect has been scarred. Holes have been dug and filled with human waste. Hundreds of cars have been abandoned in the mud. Literally tons and trash have to be hauled away, much of it brand new clothing and equipment donated and delivered to the camp at the heights of the protest movement's notoriety. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, along with state and federal officials, have been left scrambling but they're running out of time. Record setting snows have combined with early spring weather to turn the camps into a veritable soup bowl of muck and debris which will be washed into the Lake Oahe reservoir if not addressed. Even if it all gets cleaned up in time, the ruts and holes left behind by the activity of thousands and thousands of people will take years to heal. Tribal chairman David Archambault has been calling on the protesters to clean up their camps and leave the area since December, warning that spring flooding was likely. For his efforts he's been derided as a traitor to the cause. These people expect us to take them seriously. What a joke. If Shailene Woodley, Mark Ruffalo, Dave Matthews, Jane Fonda, and the rest of the activist celebrities (as if there were another kind these days) mean what they say about the environment then let them come back to North Dakota, put on some work gloves, and clean up the mess. They promoted this cause. They told us they were standing with Standing Rock. So prove it. You stood with Standing Rock back when fighting the pipeline was a good way to get your name in the headlines. Rob Port is a Forum News Service columnist and blogger at SayAnythingBlog.com.
