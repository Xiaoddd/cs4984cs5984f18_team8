The short version: Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison is campaigning to chair the Democratic National Committee. If he wins, that opens up a congressional seat in a special election. And, state Rep. Peggy Flanagan is thinking about running. Now, the details. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minnesota. This is a victory for all people who fight for social justice. We use environmental impact statements to understand how key projects will impact our environment and communities. I hope that Energy Transfer Partners, and most importantly, the next Administration, recognize the concerns raised by the Standing Rock Tribe. I also want to acknowledge that the responsibility for this project falls on the Energy Transfer board room, not the workers who are simply trying to do their jobs. Working Americans need our support as well. We have a responsibility to respect the sovereignty of the Standing Rock Tribe, and to ensure their voices are heard. And we must ensure that the millions of people who depend on the Missouri and Cannonball rivers have access to clean water. This is not exactly the message we have been hearing from the Democratic National Committee. Instead, since the summer, when the presidential campaign was at its height, we heard statements about protecting peaceful protest and workers (without a definition of what was meant). That no longer works. If it ever did. In this age of social media and transparency, the people are demanding more accountability and a clear sense of direction about social justice. We can do that by meeting folks where they are, looking them in the eye, treating them with respect, and working to solve their problems. So that means Ellison (unlike former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Shultz) would give up his congressinal seat. Whoever wins the DNC chair race faces a lot of work, travel, planning and resource raising. Ellison was a strong candidate before his announcement last week. But since then he is earning more endorsements from elected Democrats. According to Politico, supporters now include: Reps. There are other potential candidates as well, including Labor Secretary Thomas Perez. Montana and Arizona could, should, have broken that barrier in 2016 by electing Denise Juneau and Victoria Steele. Sometimes elections require a bit more, well, luck. This is a place where voters would appreciate, even celebrate, the historical significance of this first. After all this is a state that just elected four Native women to its Legislature. Another record. Flanagan also has the ideal background for this job. More than that: She teaches other people how to win campaigns and elections for Wellstone Action and The Management Center (an organization working for social change). In politics timing is everything. Sometimes the stars do align. Email check failed, please try again Sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email. but there was an error posting your comment.
