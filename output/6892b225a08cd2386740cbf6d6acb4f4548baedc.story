Protesters were also reportedly planning to speak out against GOP plans to repeal and replace ObamaCare, push for the repeal of North Carolina's bathroom bill and voice opposition to gerrymandering.

Trump has signed more than a dozen executive actions since taking office last month, including one on immigration enforcement and another that imposed a 90-day travel ban on nationals from seven majority-Muslim countries. The order has since been halted by a federal judge in Seattle, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Thursday refused to reinstate the ban after hearing oral arguments.
