Hours after volunteers managed to refloat hundreds of stranded whales, another pod of 240 whales swam aground. This has brought the total of stranded pilot whales up to 640 over two days. 335 of the whales beached on Farewell Spit at the tip of the South Island are dead, 220 remain stranded, and 100 are back at sea. Volunteers were devastated that a new group had become stranded after coming from across the country to help the first pod, many of whom were already dead. It is clear the second pod is a fresh set of whales, according to Andrew Lamason, the Department of Conservation Golden Bay Operations Manager. Helpers plan to return on Sunday, to help as many healthy whales as they can, braving the threat of sharks and stingrays. According to Mr Lamason, around 20 of the new whales have already had to be euthanised because they were in too poor condition to save. Rescuers were hopeful earlier on Saturday as they had managed to refloat 100 whales. The conditions helped; they had crystal clear waters on their side, and dozens of volunteers formed a human chain to keep the whales afloat. Mr Lamason indicated current plans were to tether the carcasses to stakes or a boat in the shallow tidal waters and let them decompose. Officials are now going to have to undertake the grim task of disposing of the whales. Hours after volunteers managed to refloat hundreds of stranded whales, another pod of 240 whales swam aground.
