This week, new realities about the nearly yearlong demonstration started to be realized.

According to French, citations would be issued to anyone who remains on the historic treaty lands after Feb. 22. Meanwhile, corps officials confirmed that deployed rangers from the National Park Service were headed in on Sunday to assist in issuing those citations.

In talks with the corps, he slammed the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe for failing to enforce its sovereignty under the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, by evicting the Dakota Access Pipeline.
