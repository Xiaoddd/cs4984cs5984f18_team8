EYEWITNESS 2: It looked like there was like a plane crash. NERMEEN SHAIKH: This comes after the same pipeline leaked nearly 340,000 gallons of gasoline in Central Alabama in September, forcing the line to shut down for 12 days and leading six governors to declare states of emergency as gas prices rose throughout the region. AMY GOODMAN: Now Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee are seeking an investigation of the Georgia-based company. He has traveled to the site of the Colonial Pipeline Company disaster, is monitoring its environmental impacts. We only have a few minutes. DAVID BUTLER: Yeah, absolutely. First, you know, we want to express our condolences to the worker that passed away and also the workers that are injured. And what happened was, they were doing some routine work on the pipeline in preparation for the repair that they need to do on the previous leak site, and there was a contact with the pipe, and caused an explosion. NERMEEN SHAIKH: But tell us a little bit about the ecosystem of this river. There are reportedly more species of fish in the Cahaba River than there are in the whole state of California. DAVID BUTLER: Absolutely. And the area that the pipeline is in is tremendously sensitive. DAVID BUTLER: Yeah. That does it for our show. or your station runs us. Tune in there.
