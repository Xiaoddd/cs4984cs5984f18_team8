MIKE MCCLEARY, TRIBUNE Facebook Twitter Email Print Save One year to the day of his indictment, attorneys and defendant Michael Giron signed off on a plea agreement related to a protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Under the agreement, Giron will plead guilty to civil disorder at his change of plea hearing Thursday in federal court in Bismarck. Federal prosecutors will move to dismiss the more serious charge of use of fire to commit a federal felony offense. His indictment stemmed from alleged crimes committed Oct. 27, 2016, as law enforcement met pipeline protesters on State Highway 1806 in southern Morton County. He is the third federal protest defendant to reach a plea agreement in as many weeks, after Michael Markus and Red Fawn Fallis, who were also indicted from activities on the same date. In a statement via the Water Protector Legal Collective, Giron's wife, Leoyla Cowboy, said her husband is her hero. Giron's sentencing is set for late May in Bismarck before Hovland. A joint trial for federal co-defendants Brandon Miller-Castillo, Brennon Nastacio, Dion Ortiz and James White has apparently not yet been set. Your notification has been saved.
