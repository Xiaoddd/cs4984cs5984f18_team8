We overcome so many mountains in life, every single day we are overcoming our own fears, challenges and emotions. Mountains are symbolic of strength. Mountains are also a place where people go for solace and rejuvenation. There is a place within you that is immovable. This is where your strength lies, and where you can always go when you need to overcome obstacles and emotions. This is a beautiful card of going within and finding the mountain of strength and resilience that lies within you. A message of finding the beautiful place within you where you can escape it all, where you can be happy and whole. This card is just reminding you of that inner strength, and your ability to be able to go within to find the place where you can not be disturbed. Finding the place within in you that is solid. A place where you can trust in life and find healing. A place where you feel strong and nothing can change that. Go within today, as many times as you may need, and find that inner strength. Keeping positive is guaranteed to bring good karma and abundance back to you. Yet, it can also pose challenges. It makes no sense to deny the strength you have at the cost of allowing yourself to be reactive and subject to external influences far beyond what is healthy for you. Imagine yourself as a mountain of strength, solidly grounded in the earth, your head held high as if you were touching the sky. Do so without straining, just as the mountain itself does not strain. The current situation calls for you to be vigilant, but not to the point of fear or paranoia. Be that rock of strength that you are capable of becoming. The solidness of your resolve will be clearly communicated when you model yourself after the towering immensity of a mountain, impenetrable and inscrutable. Standing steady like a rock is what is called for at this time. I pray for the President to step in and do the right thing, and put a stop to the pipelines once and for all. It is time, and we can no longer risk the health of our planet. We need to move toward a future where we are not dependant on oil and chemicals. We need a future free from the clutches and control of corporations. Stand steady and strong Standing Rock. My prayers are with all of you, and our dear Mother Earth.
