Block Kavanaugh's nomination. A group of 10 legal organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and lawyers from both states filed an official petition to the the court on Wednesday. The belligerent actions of DAPL protesters are done intentionally, and for political communication through social media. The judge has so far approved every motion granted by the States attorney and has denied every one of our motions. Right now, the states attorney, same guy who tried to charge Amy Goodman with terrorism for covering the story of Standing Rock, is asking the court to disallow all of our video and evidence that would prove our innocence and uphold our constitutional right to express under our first amendment, while simultaneously submitted false lies against us. We would love to have an interview with Amy Goodman so that the public can know what's going on. What happens in our cases will affect the rest of the cases behind us. We need a really good legal advice and media to support us.
