In the most recent clash between police and protesters, which was near the path of the pipeline and happened last week, officers used tear gas, rubber bullets and large water hoses in freezing weather. Organizers said at least 17 protesters were taken to the hospital, some for hypothermia and one for a serious arm injury, and one officer was injured. Archambault called the confrontation an act of terror against unarmed protesters that was sanctioned by Kirchmeier. He and other authorities said officers were assaulted with rocks, bottles and burning logs. He retired from the North Dakota Highway Patrol as a captain after 29 years, and had served in the National Guard for four years. The 34 deputies in his department are pulling similar shifts, he said, even with help from more than 1,200 officers from North Dakota and nine other states. Some officers have been targeted online by protesters, Kirchmeier included. President Barack Obama raised the possibility of rerouting the pipeline earlier this month, and construction on the last remaining large chunk, which is on federal land near the reservation, was halted by the Corps for the time being. With winter looming, the Corps has decided to close the land north of the Cannonball River where the Oceti Sakowin protest encampment has flourished on Dec. 5, also citing the confrontations between protesters and authorities, according to a letter Archambault said he received. The agency says anyone on the property north of the Cannonball River after Dec. 5 will be trespassing and subject to prosecution.
