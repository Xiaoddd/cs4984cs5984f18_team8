The months-long ordeal has taken a big toll on the state of North Dakota and on the officers monitoring it. Iverson is one of more than a thousand officers who have responded to the situation at Standing Rock. Protesters have camped out in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline, which was recently re-started by President Trump. They say the pipeline will harm water resources and sacred Native American lands. But according to Iverson, the protesters have caused major problems for police. Officers have made more than 600 arrests since August. They say protesters have threatened and even shot at them. Many who gathered at Standing Rock late last year have moved on. But several hundred remain. Iverson said those camps have no law and order and have created a chaotic situation. Protesters told 2News Thursday they feel the police have been too aggressive and military-like. Iverson was firm in his response. That's why police have closed one of the roads and bridges leading to the camp, Iverson said. Officers sit there watching, making sure protesters don't advance toward the pipeline. Meanwhile, the Standing Rock Sioux have asked protesters to clear out. Those protesters told 2News they won't. They said they're in it for the long haul. Police hope otherwise.
