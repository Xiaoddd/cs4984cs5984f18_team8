The organizers hope to prevent progress on the construction of the pipeline as well as draw national attention to the cause. Proponents say the pipeline would significantly decrease U.S. reliance on foreign oil. Opponents say it would destroy culturally significant Native American land and have environmental impacts, including potential water contamination and greenhouse gas emissions. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and its supporters have been protesting the project for months. The protests have been largely peaceful but turned violent on Sunday. The money will go toward food, transportation and supplies for the veterans who attend. Leading the troops Wesley Clark Jr., a veteran, screenwriter and activist, created the event along with Michael Wood Jr., a retired Baltimore police officer and Marine Corps veteran who advocates for police reform. Clark decided to take action after an elder from Standing Rock called him about the protests. Jade Emilio Snell, a veteran of the Marine Corps, will be attending on behalf of the Rocky Mountain Tribal Leadership Council, which is dedicated to improving health, economic development, and education for tribes in the Rocky Mountains. Snell said he is not against the pipeline project, but opposes how it is being executed. The page also emphasizes the importance of working together, and says the event will not tolerate hate, violence or divisive behavior.
