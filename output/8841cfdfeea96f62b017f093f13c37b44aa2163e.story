This hasty process is an affront to the tribal community and to the principles of science-based policy, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). Below is a statement by Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. This decision puts corporate interests ahead of the rights of sovereign tribes and the safety of their land and water. It denies the Standing Rock community any opportunity to look for options that might address their concerns. The Union of Concerned Scientists puts rigorous, independent science to work to solve our planet's most pressing problems. Joining with people across the country, we combine technical analysis and effective advocacy to create innovative, practical solutions for a healthy, safe, and sustainable future.
