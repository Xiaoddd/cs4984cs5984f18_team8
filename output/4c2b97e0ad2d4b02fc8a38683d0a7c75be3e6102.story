David Pecker: Trump confidant and National Enquirer boss was given immunity in Cohen case Read more Trump reprised a litany of complaints about the justice department and the FBI, attacking both without providing evidence they had treated him and his supporters unfairly. Trump also renewed his criticism of Sessions, blaming him for what he called corruption at the justice department. Sessions, in a rare rebuttal to the president, issued a statement defending the integrity of his department. It gathered responses from 1,688 American adults, including 704 Democrats and 587 Republicans. At the US Capitol, the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, who is both close to Trump and a defender of Sessions, said he believed Trump would appoint a new attorney general but should wait until after the 6 November midterm elections. Trump told Fox that Sessions should not have recused himself from Russia-related matters. Sessions was at the White House briefly on Thursday for a discussion on prison reform. The Kremlin has denied the allegations, and Trump has denied any collusion.
