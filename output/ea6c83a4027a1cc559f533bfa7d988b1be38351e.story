As Germany begins powering down its coal plants and nuclear reactors one by one, solar stations and windmills are appearing around the country by the tens of thousands. Bill McKibben of 350.org has called Germany the greenest industrial nation on earth. There is good reason for painting Germany as the poster child of the possible. In 1945, just two generations ago, Germany was more or less a country of rubble, its population decimated by a genocidal war and its territory controlled by four increasingly discordant occupying forces. As recently as 1990, it remained bifurcated by the Iron Curtain, a quarter of its population residing in a Soviet police state with a dismal environmental record. Mainstream U.S. commentators regularly chalk up German environmental efficiency to some innate orderliness in the eternal German spirit. Postwar environmentalism, however, has proved a tool of liberation. The legions of students, grandmothers, social reformers and full-time activists that formed the emerging movement in the 1950s and 1960s aligned their collective agenda with values like decentralization, anti-fascism, social equality and multiculturalism. Crafted in bold anti-establishment terms, it stood as a forceful challenge to the bureaucratic impersonality and unrestricted capitalism of Western technocratic modernity. Where their fellow citizens saw chain-smoking factories and drunken waterways, they imagined hilltop wind farms and rooftop solar panels. With the formation of the national Green Party in 1980, environmentalists made their first foray into federal politics, becoming powerful enough to enter a ruling coalition as early as 1998. Even in the ecological wreck of Soviet East Germany, environmentalism became a surprisingly active sphere of political participation, with over 100 such groups operating in the German Democratic Republic by the time of its reunification with the West in 1990. Given a choice between driving to work and taking the bus, Germans will usually ride their bikes. Multi-partisan support has yielded hefty legislation. Strict eco-taxes keep fossil fuel prices high, while sustainability subsidies generate innovative and affordable renewables. Already by 2005, national greenhouse gas emissions declined 18 percent against 1990 levels. And Germans are projected to overshoot their goals for 2020. Certainly, federal laws provide the incentive and enforcement mechanisms so vital to the cause. When the 2011 radioactive meltdown in Fukushima, Japan, drew global attention to the risks of atomic energy, German politicians announced an unprecedented about-face on their previously robust nuclear program. Within two months of the Fukushima disaster, Germany had deactivated eight of its 17 nuclear plants and vowed to phase out the remaining nine by 2022. While most analysts interpreted the decision as a short-term ploy to curry domestic votes, in fact it signaled the successful culmination of a multi-decade grassroots struggle. Anti-nuclear protests, a staple of German environmentalism since the 1970s, had been heating up in the years preceding Fukushima. In early 2010, a full year before the tragedy, 120,000 Germans had formed a 75-mile human chain between two active nuclear plants. The day after the tsunami hit, tens of thousands formed a similar chain across parts of southern Germany. Within three days of the meltdown, some 110,000 demonstrators had staged nearly 500 events in as many towns across the country. By the end of the month, massive rallies had engulfed Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne and Munich. National uproar continued as March led to April, and it was only in late May, after 25,000 protesters had converged on their party headquarters, that Chancellor Merkel and her government agreed to a ban. Germans disagree over the operational details of their green transition. Rising energy prices have prompted questions about governmental controls, coalition talks have splintered on how to prevent further price hikes, and the absorption of the environmentalist platform into the political mainstream appears to have mortally wounded the Green Party. As Germany has demonstrated, even the most modern of nations can adopt the kind of sweeping, no-holds-barred legislation our world needs if we are to escape climate calamity. Germany may not have all the answers, but as it blazes a path away from fossil fuels and nuclear power, there will certainly be much for the United States to listen to. Become one today.

Germany currently boasts some of the highest CO2 emissions per capita in the European Union and because they are shutting down their nuclear power plants that number is going up. This crossover occurred at 16 cents per kilowatt hour, they said. Identifying the real costs of competing energy technologies is complicated by the wide range of subsidies and tax breaks involved. Margaret pestorius November 15, 2013 at 1:55 pm From what I understand there were not just many environment groups in the last decade of the GDR but many of these groups created the basis for the civil rights resistance that led to democratic change. In history accounts in Berlin museums, it is GDR feminist environmental activists who were leading the pro democracy movement in the 5 years prior to reunification. So it would be great to know about the history of this period further. Chris November 27, 2013 at 9:58 am As a native German, now an American, i find this article mostly accurate. Having toured parts of former East Germany in 1991, 1995, and 2013, i found the western propaganda characterizing the air as unbreathable and the landscape in ruins to be ridiculous. It is not the political system that causes environmental destruction, it is industrialism, and all governments indulge in it as much as possible. Consider mountaintop removal in WV and KY, an abomination still occurring, visible from space as are several other destroyed parts of the US. It is unfortunate to see western propaganda repeated without justification. Many East Germans loved and protected their countryside and their forests with no interference. The German roots of environmentalism go back at least to the 600s AD, when Germanic tribes began enacting forest protections.
