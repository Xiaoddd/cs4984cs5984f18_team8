Let's take back our country and restore democracy. Jan 25, 2017 How We Stop DAPL, Keystone XL & Sabal Trail Pipeline Construction of the Sabal Trail Pipeline. Yesterday, the Trump Administration gave the green light to re-start construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) which infringes on sacred tribal lands at Standing Rock and threatens the drinking water for millions of people. President Trump also moved to renegotiate the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline, saying it would create thousands of new jobs, and rewarding big oil and gas companies and the big Wall Street banks that finance them. The Trump administration boasts about creating 10,000 jobs, when in reality those jobs would be part-time, low-paying positions with no benefits. It has been estimated that Keystone would perhaps create 50 full-time jobs, while moving us in the wrong direction in addressing climate change and protecting our environment. Yes, we need good-paying jobs with security, but we also need to preserve our environment for future generations. Your donation can make the difference in sending a clear message to Congress that we must value our health and safety over corporate profits. But we cannot wait for politicians who are often beholden to the fossil fuel industry and pipeline companies for campaign contributions. In the 1980s, a huge divestment movement helped bring an end to Apartheid in South Africa. Likewise, we must now divest in fossil fuels and pipeline companies. As a law professor, I have long advocated for community and public banking as a strategy to resist the predatory practices of big Wall Street banks. We must shift our personal checking and savings accounts from the big Wall Street banks that support these polluters to smaller community banks and credit unions that invest locally. We are already organizing students to advocate for these kinds of socially responsible investment and banking policies for their university endowments.

These recent executive orders on DAPL and Keystone XL pipelines are discouraging. But now is not the time to give up. Give Tim Canova a round of applause.
