Contact Posted on November 13, 2015November 16, 2015 by Jacob Devaney Faith Spotted Eagle, Native Elder Reflects on Keystone XL There has been much celebration in the wake of Obamas decision to reject the Keystone XL Pipeline, but there are a few things that should not be overlooked going forward. The roots to this movement are well beneath the surface of what most people recognize and they stretch back for centuries. They are spiritual, even mystical, and they belong to the families whose ancestors have lived here since long before this land was called North America. Long before there was a need for environmental movements, indigenous people lived with a deep reverence and respect for the natural systems that sustain all of life. These people are still with us today. Faith Spotted Eagle is a 65 year old grandmother who lives on Ihanktonwan Dakota Territory (Yankton Sioux) in Southeastern South Dakota. She has two children. Kip Spotted Eagle is a Dakota Language Instructor and Brook Spotted Eagle is a Ph.D candidate at the University of Washington in Cultural Anthropology. Her new grandson is Tokana Ikpanajin Spotted Eagle. While numerous groups were counting coup on stopping KXL and telling their understandings of how the victory was achieved, my thoughts were immediately directed to other things that now could receive attention. That is the story of the life of a Native. Every single day of our life is devoted to fighting fights like KXL. So it is familiar territory. I am not needing to say that I was the one who stopped KXL but I am feeling the need to give thanks to the SPIRITUAL MOVEMENT that was launched in treaty territory, original territory and the Oceti Sakowin and the First Nations up north. The Spirit was moving strong due to the thousands of prayers that were heard by the universe and beyond for Mother Earth, entwined with the healing prayers of other populations. He said it would take a couple hundred of years as they heal from their historical trauma also. When they heal, we heal. Together. Too much of our history contains narratives of us by other people, as I already see articles stating that someone else organized us natives for the KXL battle. We are given consent based on our respect, our actions towards our relatives and our people. Whether that was elected leadership based on colonial tenets or grassroots organizing, old conflicts and divisions were laid aside to commonly defend against a major threat to sacred water. The message had to be (and is) unified. Nation to Nation dialogues and joining occurred in sovereign ways. This includes the signing of the International Treaty to Protect the Sacred at Ihanktonwan Territory by the Ihanktonwan Treaty Committee and the Tsu La Letuth Nation as well as the Mother Earth Accord. Ten Native Nations have signed the International Treaty and many others with the Mother Earth Accord. The heads of the Pawnee Nation and the Nez Perce showed up to stand strong with us when we walked out of an attempted Department of State consultation that was out of order. It was an assertion of our right to be respected as Nation to Nation parties and that we would not allow ourself to be manipulated. Three Spiritual Camps were created at Rosebud, Lower Brule and Cheyenne River, preparing to defend on the ground. Grassroots entities such as Brave Heart Society, Oglala Tokalas, Owe Aku Moccasins on the Ground, Pte Oyate Ospaye, Wiconi Un Tipi and many others hosted direct actions in cooperation with Honor the Earth, Ruckus, Chorus Foundation, Brave Heart Society and many others. The first Spiritual Camp was held on the Ponca Trial of Tears at the Art Tanderup farm. These spiritual camps were a door for youth to become involved and speak of their concerns. These camps were attended by other Turtle Island defenders such as the Black Mesa Coalition, the southern defenders against Tar Sands, the activists fighting the Bakken Oil presence and of course, the Indigenous Environmental Network was invited in by the Oceti Sakowin. Spiritual leaders, both men and women were always present to maintain the balance, including the Keeper of our Sacred Bundle, Arvol Looking Horse. Urban Natives joined with their reservation counterparts in hosting demonstrations, banner drops and forums against KXL. Tribes of the Oceti Sakowin joined with Dakota Rural Action to form NOKXL Dakota to combat Transcanada in direct actions, horse rides, summits and to battle Transcanada in the SD Public Utility Commission hearings. There are so many more and I apologize for leaving anyone out. From the beginning, the goal was to utilize the new weapon of social media, widespread public outcry and strong defense of treaty and unceded lands (original territories). The opposition was always about jobs, jobs, jobs which is second nature to systemic capitalism. Our culture actively draws on the power of our sacred sites and their power physically and spiritually. It is Native metaphysics which is why we do ceremony. The solution to climate change is how we live in relation to all living things and redefine our technological niche in nature with respect. Some funders are now learning this and we appreciated their support. As this is being written, a SD Public Utility Commission hearing is being held on another threat, the Dakota Access Pipeline which once again is trespassing in Treaty and Aboriginal lands in northern and eastern SD and North Dakota. A dream team of tribal attorneys representing Cheyenne River, Rosebud, Cheyenne River and Yankton are battling in the PUC process against the two pipelines, KXL and Dakota Access. This is why of course, that tobacco is always offered to the spirit world. The Allies and Pipeline fighters did this of course, at the invite of the Sicangu Oyate (the Burnt Thigh people) of Rosebud at Wicokahiyiya (middle of the day) this past Saturday, November 14, 2015 at Mission, SD. Now we return to the list of the 100 things to defend against, including the recent bill introduced in Congress to assume plenary power of tribal recognition led by congressional people (one from Utah) who have no inkling of who we are. As former Chairman Brewer said, our horses are always ready and we must defend on this one. Yet there is still much work to be done. If adopted, the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), will allow corporations to sue governments for enacting environmental protections. If TPP were law right now, corporations could overturn the Presidents decision to reject Keystone XL.
