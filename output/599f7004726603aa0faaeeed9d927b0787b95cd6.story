What happened at Malheur was nonsense. Whatever bedtime stories the Malheur militia members may tell themselves... But the last of the occupiers were represented in negotiations by a Nevada state representative. Native Americans with drums and prayer sticks on their own land were not so indulged. When the leaders of the rancher militia, the Bundy family, call on American nationalism to justify their stand, they are in fact calling on a very real history of racial injustice. But as important as the racial issues are, they may mask other aspects of the two movements. The Standing Rock protest is concrete; it seeks to stop a real pipeline and a real environmental threat. Even casual observers can tell that the Bundy family is well-practiced at political theater. Despite the Thursday acquittals, the Bundys and their followers surely did conspire to prevent federal employees from doing their jobs, and they obviously and flagrantly brought firearms onto federal property, as charged. But the refuge was essentially empty when they occupied it; nothing was in play there except bird watching and conservation. Wildlife sanctuaries aren't much eyed by Homeland Security and oil companies. Nowhere is the essential fraud of the Bundy protest more visible than in its attempts to adopt and co-opt native histories of dispossession. Water, however, is substantial, and it is a good part of what is at issue in the Dakotas. Though it will be the Sioux who suffer in the short term from the pipeline and what it carries, we all live downstream eventually. The Bundy family and their followers are playing dress-up and putting on historical re-enactments. Aaron Bady is an editor at the New Inquiry. He lives in Oakland.
