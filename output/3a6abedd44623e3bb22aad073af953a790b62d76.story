The pipeline expansion is on the ropes. They emphasise the importance of protecting and maintaining language, culture, heritage and traditional pursuits and practices. The various First Nations communities who live within the Kinder Morgan project region may have overlapping interests when it comes to access and use of these lands, with very different strengths and community connections. However, while environmental groups have created a perception that many (if not all) First Nations are anti-pipeline, there is overwhelming evidence that many First Nation communities favour responsible development of fossil fuels on their territories. First Nations people across Canada have always asserted that under our legal system, resource companies must consult and make accommodations specifically with affected First Nation communities. Failing to develop our resources would deprive us of much-needed jobs, training, education and skills enhancement In British Columbia, they have been fully represented. They support the Trans Mountain pipeline, and have signed comprehensive mutual benefit agreements (MBAs). Those First Nations communities that are physically closest to the project are on board. The MBAs aim to address those concerns: the social and economic issues that come with high unemployment, large youth populations, inadequate housing and overcrowding, and worse-than-average health outcomes. These require internal solutions and, crucially, alternative financial sources. Failing to develop our resources would deprive our communities of much-needed jobs, training, education, skills enhancement and better community services and infrastructure.

Similarly, opportunities such as Trans Mountain will allow many First Nations to participate in resource development projects in a more open, transparent and accountable manner. The MBAs also include procurement deals with affected First Nations, so they can participate in the economic benefits from the development. While we continue our efforts as a global community toward creating more environmentally sensitive alternatives to fossil fuels and minimizing our carbon footprint, in the meantime the world will continue to use oil.
