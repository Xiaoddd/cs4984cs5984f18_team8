Environmental activists broadly opposed the Keystone XL pipeline and campaigned against it for more than seven years. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in January said it would begin an environmental assessment that could delay the Dakota project further. Advertisement In November 2015, Trump said he would approve the Keystone XL pipeline on the condition that the United States government would receive 25 percent of the profits. He reiterated this proposal in May. Tuesday's executive order, which invites Keystone developer TransCanada to resubmit its application for a construction permit from the State Department, includes no such stipulations. The Keystone XL project, which will take 800,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada to the Gulf Coast, was the subject of a largely symbolic battle waged by climate activists opposed to the continued development of fossil fuel infrastructure. It was torpedoed by President Obama in 2015, a month before the Paris Climate Summit. Construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which will carry 470,000 barrels per day across the Dakotas into Iowa and Illinois was halted after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline, permission to tunnel under a portion of land north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation without further environmental impact assessments. Construction of the pipeline was close to completion before protests against it halted progress. Despite Trump's framing of the pipelines as job creators, the economic benefits of both are minimal. In signing the order approving Keystone XL, Trump said the pipeline would create 28,000 jobs. As Jonathan Thompson wrote in November, the economic impact of the Dakota Access Pipeline will be similar: Construction on the pipeline is about 85 percent complete and it has, indeed, put people to work. Yet it is not clear how many new jobs have been created since the jobs are spread out over 1,000 miles. That, in turn, generates sales and lodging tax revenues for the local governments. In a few months, when (and if) construction is complete, the workers and their spending money will depart. The finished pipeline will require just 40 permanent maintenance and operational jobs along its entire stretch. Thompson also writes that the Dakota pipeline will not spur domestic production enough to measurably offset the 5.2 million barrels of oil the United States imports each day and will thus fail to bring America substantially closer to energy independence. Keystone XL's completion would similarly do little to insulate the United States from the volatility of global oil prices. And, of course, both projects reinforce American dependence on carbon-emitting fossil fuels. On Tuesday, Trump said yes. Read more in Slate about the Dakota Access Pipeline.
