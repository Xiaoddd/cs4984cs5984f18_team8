What I Saw at Standing Rock. Posted on November 25, 2016November 26, 2016 by PeaceAdmin This week, I and many other peaceful water protectors were attacked at the Oceti Sakowin Camp in Standing Rock, ND. I am calling on you to sign our urgent petition to President Barack Obama, Chief of Staff to the President Denis McDonough, and Assistant Secretary of Army Corps of Engineers Jo-Ellen Darcy to stop the pipeline and to end the historic violence against Native Peoples. I can tell you first hand that on the week of Thanksgiving 2016 the US Government is still brutalizing Native Americans on their own land. On Sunday evening, I quickly went from preparing dinner to defending the front line from a militarized police assault. The prayers were meant for both sides. A camp-mate of mine was shot by one of the bullets and had his arm broken. The police hosed us with liquids for hours in the freezing cold. Our warm clothes froze stiff. You could see icicles forming on the razor wires as they aimed their guns at us. That night, our camp was converted into an fully functioning emergency response center with every necessary health and support service you could imagine being provided by hundreds, if not thousands of volunteers. Nobody rested. The police were not there to arrest us that night- I believe only one person was arrested- they were there to hurt us and to wear down the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and their growing support, in an attempt to protect DAPL. I am still hearing individual stories from that late night and still having difficulty coming to terms with what we experienced. I will never forget what I saw there. Through that experience, the purpose of the camp and the struggle there became clearer to me, and for many of us, it has strengthened our resolve. We are not simply camped out to make a point. We are in it to shut down the Dakota Access Pipeline. We are in it to protect our planet and our brothers and sisters who inhabit it. We are in it to defend Native American treaties. We are in it to oppose racist militarism at home and abroad. And we are in it to win. Thanks to your support, we have been able to turn our calls of solidarity into meaningful action. Now, please sign our petition to Obama, McDonough, and Darcy to stop the pipeline and to end the historic violence against Native Peoples. Please, as you enjoy the holidays and the company of your loved ones, do not forget Standing Rock, which in my assessment, is the epicenter of our ongoing battle for peace and justice today.

Since 2003, we've been the leading national coalition standing up to militarism at home and abroad, promoting peace and social justice.
