Emergency crews can also choose not to send ambulances to the area. The governor cited the winter weather and threat to safety as justification. But the Justice Department stepped in, saying that the permits need more review, and construction has stopped temporarily. The Army Corps of Engineers, which needs to grant an easement to the company constructing the pipeline, is reviewing the case now. On December 4, 2,000 veterans plan to join them to act as human shields, protecting activists from police. There are roughly 5,000 activists at the site now. advertisement The months of protest have succeeded in impacting the companies building the pipeline. Energy Transfer Partners, which oversees the pipeline project, promised oil companies that the pipeline would be completed by January 1. An expert who reviewed the environmental assessment prepared by the Army Corps says that one of the biggest risks may come from the fact that landslides can happen in parts of the path of the pipeline. There are many other ways that pipelines can spill oil, including corrosion or damage to pipes that can happen if construction is rushed. And spills happen all the time; more than 200 spills have happened in 2016 alone. In September, a ruptured pipeline in Alabama leaked more than 300,000 gallons of oil. In October, a storm damaged a pipeline in Pennsylvania, spilling 55,000 gallons. Tar sands oil, which sunk to the bottom of the river, is even harder to remediate than a typical oil spill. It owned the pipeline that ruptured in Pennsylvania in October, and has had more than 200 leaks since 2010. In North Dakota, the original route of the pipeline was planned to pass Bismarck, but that was rejected in part because it threatened drinking water supplies there. The pipeline is also about the bigger issues of tribal sovereignty, and centuries of land grabs from the Sioux. And, like the Keystone XL Pipeline, which Trump plans to revive, it raises questions about whether pipelines should be built in an era of climate change. But Obama could still help reroute or stop it now: Bernie Sanders has suggested that the president should designate Standing Rock a national monument. advertisement advertisement advertisement About the author Adele Peters is a staff writer at Fast Company who focuses on solutions to some of the world's largest problems, from climate change to homelessness.
