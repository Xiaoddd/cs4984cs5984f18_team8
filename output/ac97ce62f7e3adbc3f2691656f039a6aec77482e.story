The pipeline would allow transport of oil and gas from North Dakota to refineries in Louisiana and along the Gulf Coast, while also providing access to a major hub in Texas. She said the region is losing land at the rate of a football field an hour to development. Construction will require three approvals from the Army Corps of Engineers, as well as two state approvals. The fate of the EIS will be largely dictated by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, which lays out guidelines for analyzing impacts on wetlands. The Corps also needs to perform a Rivers and Harbors Act analysis in determining whether the project will impact the flow or navigation of a federal waterway. In this case, the Corps will determine whether pipeline construction would affect the operation of Louisiana levies. In addition to wetland degradation, Bold Louisiana is concerned about the impact on the crawfish industry and the bayou, which provides drinking water to some 300,000 people. Foytlin said the existing pipelines run east to west, blocking the natural flow of water, reducing oxygen in the water and killing crawfish. According to indigenous groups, more than 300 people were treated for injuries after a confrontation with police on Nov. 20, when protesters were blasted with fire hoses and pelted with rubber bullets and concussion grenades. According to Foytlin, more than 500 people have signed the pledge to protest. The company plans to restore the project area to preconstruction contours and elevations and to restore work areas in the basin back to the natural grade, Daniel said, as compared to the adjacent undisturbed land or wetlands. Crews are also exploring techniques for improving basin water quality and flow. Popular Resistance provides a daily stream of resistance news from across the United States and around the world.
