CLEVELAND, Ohio -- On a gray, drizzly Sunday afternoon, four people, each holding an ear of colorful corn, walk through the muddy grounds of the Native American Cultural Garden in Rockefeller Park. With quiet ceremony, they place an ear of corn to mark each of the four directions of the sacred space they are creating. They return to the center of the field, rejoining the rest of the group. It is an ancient practice thought to purify and dispel the negative. Kafer then leads the group in single file, clockwise, to form a sacred circle. Concha-Saastamoinen takes a deep breath and continues her prayer. I'm scared for them. Her voice trails off and she begins to weep. Kafer beats the drum and sings a prayer in his Titanwan prairie Sioux language. The drum represents the heartbeat of Mother Earth, he says. After the prayer, each person takes one step backward to step out of the circle. Each peels off, one by one, clockwise, shaking the hands of those still in line. They gather round a table for some hot coffee and pastries, and continue to talk about the plight of the people on the Sandy Rock Reservation. John Paul Rodriguez came to the prayer meeting with his father, Alberto. He says he learned about the Dakota Access Pipeline by doing internet research. He decided to make a trip to check out the situation first hand. He went out there at the end of August last year. He smiles at his dad. Leatrice Tolls of Cleveland Heights made her own trip to Standing Rock. It is not the first time the 51 year-old has made a big effort to stand up for what she believes in. She began her life as an activist at the age of nine. With a fishing rod in her hand and her bike by her side, Tolls sat down in front of a bulldozer to save the Mill River in her town of Fairfield, Connecticut. She says that action stopped the bulldozers and won her the Presidential Award for Environmental Activisim and Protection, given to her by Gerald Ford. The area is now a protected wetland. I've done this before, for Hurricane Sandy, Hurricane Katrina. She says she found this group of like-minded people at the Native American Garden in September. Those gathered at Standing Rock are against the Dakota Access Pipeline that will take oil from North Dakota, through South Dakota and Iowa to be shipped from Illinois. Part of the construction, which is nearly complete, will go under Lake Oahe, which is a reservoir of the Missouri River. Native nations are opposed because it crosses sacred cultural land. They, and others, are also concerned for the safety of their drinking water. Supporters of the pipeline cite economic benefits, including taxes and construction jobs. They say it will provide less dependence on foreign oil. They also say it is a better way to move crude oil than using railroads or trucks. All rights reserved (About Us).
