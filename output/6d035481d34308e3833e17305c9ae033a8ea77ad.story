There were the third-party voters too. In response, members of the blamed groups would recoil and defend their consciences by shifting the blame to another group. Blaming someone else does not mean you are blameless. It may seem like a childish question, but my concerns are deeper. Blame is an important moral concept. It references the obligations we have to each other. In terms of the election and democracy generally, questions about blame are linked to the meaning of a vote. We can look to the blame game and extract genuine moral insight. And when we have it, we can improve with respect to our future votes. I want to look forward, not back. But first we all need to recognize where we have failed in our thinking and acting. It is time for honest introspection. I have a straightforward theory to guide our thinking. Blame appears to have two necessary components: causal responsibility and moral fault. In other words, if I blame you for something, it means 1) you had a hand in causing it, and 2) what you caused or how you caused it is morally objectionable. The opposite of blame is praise: you caused something that is good. So praise and blame are both causal and moral concepts. As we saw with blame, causal responsibility and moral condemnation can be shared in varying proportions. If I stole your car, I caused you to be deprived of your property, and I did it contrary to your wishes and in a way that caused you harm. Hence, you (or anyone else) can rightly blame me. If I had an accomplice, you would blame us both. My accomplice and I would share the blame of the single act. In terms of voting, there is not much mystery. Here, yes, the most responsibility belongs to the Trump voters. But we would be mistaken to think that they are the only ones responsible. So we see that race, gender, or age should not be the first divisions to make in the blame game. This is not controversial. But keep in mind that I have yet to make any moral claims. The election was between Clinton and Trump. Trump would not have won had no one voted for him. So if you voted for him, you actively contributed to his win. If you did not vote for his opponent, you passively contributed to his win. (I do not include in my argument people who are victims of voter suppression or voter intimidation. Anti-Clinton progressives are typically far to the left and see Clinton as nowhere near progressive enough to deserve their support. Many social justice activists qualify. This group is quick and content to condemn Trump voters. But if the anti-Clinton progressive voters are right that the Trump voter deserves blame, then, unless they are hypocrites, the moral claim does not depend on the causal component of blame. If culpability were dependent on causality, then both groups would be to blame. So it looks like we have a problem. But I glossed over a distinction. Perhaps the distinction is morally relevant. That is to say, maybe the moral claim does rest on causal responsibility, but the responsibility must be active. This allows the blame to rest wholly on the Trump voter. As a general principle, however, we are left with plenty of room for objections. There are numerous instances (often caught on tape) of people laying injured on the street while strangers pass by without helping. Had the stranger done something at little or no cost to themselves, they would have prevented or improved a bad state of affairs. The strangers simply should have called for help. We all agree. Hence, blame does not always require active causal contribution. I am not claiming that the injured person example is the same as the election. Passive causal responsibility does not always save you from blame. There is no doubt that active contribution to harm is bad. There is also no doubt that active contribution is worse than passive contribution (the person who caused the injuries is more blameworthy than the stranger who simply walks past the injured person). It is difficult to see how. Given my theory of blame, it is a perfectly coherent position. But no, they are not morally at fault. We need both. Therefore, they are not blameworthy. Perhaps a progressive could judge Trump voters for their positions and ideas instead. No doubt, there are plenty of reprehensible views out there. By hypothesis, we need to. It is perfectly plausible, therefore, that there are two distinct moments of blame: the blameworthy ideology and the blameworthy action taken on the basis of that ideology. The hateful people who stay at home all day are not as bad as the hateful people who enact hateful political change. Seems obvious. Hence, even if you can blame Trump voters for something divorced from their causal responsibility in the election, you are free to blame them (and probably do) for their causal responsibility too. So it looks like causal responsibility is back on the moral table. The prospect is rightfully terrifying for millions and millions and millions of people. He has suggested that his candidates must be pro-life, which signals his desire to overturn Roe v. Wade. After all, the man who is on tape bragging about sexual assault is now President of the United States. If Clinton had won, this would not be a concern. Trump said on numerous occasions that he would deport large numbers of illegal immigrants. He knows with certainty that Mexico sends rapists, but he can only assume that some Mexicans are good people. If Clinton had won, mass deportation would not be part of the conversation. The question now becomes whether there is moral fault in passively contributing to his victory. The injured person on the street is an example. Other oppressive regimes in history are examples. When we contemplate how dark and destructive Donald Trump plans to be, perhaps the burden is on the anti-Clinton progressive to justify a non-Clinton vote. Whatever the argument turns out to be, it must explain why voting for the sake of the tens of millions of people who need Obamacare or the tens of millions of immigrants is not the responsibility of everyone (even if your life might not improve). The arguments need to show how a vote for Clinton fundamentally undermines the project of fighting for progressive causes. But that is not the route anti-Clinton progressives usually take. Instead, the response is to claim that a similar list of harms can be constructed for Clinton. The list would include the risk of conflict with Russia and other foreign interventions. Regardless, I want to set that issue aside for a moment. The more pressing issue is why we are comparing lists at all. It illustrates the assumption that it is blameworthy to be partially responsible for putting someone into office who will cause serious harm. If the anti-Clinton progressives were not at fault, then the list of harms would not matter. But they do matter to our moral judgments. Invoking a Clinton list is meant to suggest that either the two candidates are equally bad or Clinton is worse. The attempt to justify the idea that Clinton is just as bad is either a breathtaking display of sanctimony and moral self-conceit or an intellectual failure to consider more than a small number of issues or people. It is also a risky rhetorical move because, if it turns out that Trump represents the greater risk (which, as I humbly aver, was abundantly and unequivocally obvious all along), then the people responsible for putting him into office are deserving of blame. And as we have known all along, that includes anti-Clinton progressives. It therefore assumes that if the two were not equally bad, we should opt for the better option. It also entails that the anti-Clinton progressive links blame to causal responsibility. Third party advocates consistently questioned it, but never with anything remotely compelling. A superficially intimidating sense of moral righteousness has replaced reasoning. The strongest support for the argument is the list of harms. There are obviously some instances in which the argument gives solid guidance. Some situations are so horrendous that we should avoid them, even if that means accepting a less than ideal alternative. We all use that reasoning all the time in our personal lives. That seemed to be the only objection on offer. With the list of harms Trump threatens to unleash, it is worth considering a different perspective. The answer: it is the lesser of two evils. And it is still evil. We are talking about our own actions. There are plenty of complications to my argument, mainly concerning the Electoral College. Consider, however, how frequently the popular vote total is used as a source of hope. It is constantly cited as a way of motivating and inspiring people. Everyone, regardless of state, could have contributed to that hope. But my argument is about morality. I have reminded us that blame can be shared. Some states are more important and some votes more significant. But your vote still mattered, not only as a contribution to the outcome of the election, but also as an expression of your moral judgment. Maybe we should, at times, be willing to sacrifice the appearance of sanctimony. Perhaps that is true altruism and heroism. We need to direct our thinking to future votes. We can no longer allow confident moral posturing to take the place of quality argument. It is time for us to start thinking better and voting better. There is no getting around the fact that a Trump vote was a moral failure. There is no getting around the fact that a Trump vote was a moral failure. People have been seriously victimized by the results of the election. You have an opportunity to fight for them in your own life. account. but there was an error posting your comment.
