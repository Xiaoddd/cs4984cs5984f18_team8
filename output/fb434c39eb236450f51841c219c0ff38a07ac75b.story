Manufacturing & agriculture growth strategist. Follow for news at the intersection of tech, biology, business, and squishy people stuff. Among them: Virginia and North Carolina received seven-figure payoffs from the pipeline company, Dominion, immediately before final state permitting approval. The legality of these payments is dubious at best. In fact, cheap, 24-hour renewable energy installations to replace coal as a baseload power source are already in the bid and build process. ACP has been marketed to local stakeholders as a jobs project that will bring manufacturing. There is little support for these claims. ACP has presented no evidence that energy costs are in fact a limiting factor for industrial development in Virginia and the Carolinas, or that the pipeline will truly address any industry needs. ACP partner Duke Energy has a history of manipulating natural gas supplies to drive up prices, when market structure has allowed them to do so. It has also abused this monopoly status to avoid accountability for coal ash spills, up to threatening to withhold power from federal military installations if fined. As a business strategist, I began looking into the ACP in mid-2017 so I could advise clients on what it would mean for their businesses. What I found was unconvincing. Findings and conclusions are summarized in the following report. These calculations do not include subsidies, tax credits, or externalities (e.g. damage from accidents, pollution-related costs such as increased healthcare, damage from accidents, etc). These figures are simply the bare cost of generating electricity by different methods. Wind and solar have been the true, unsubsidized, lowest-cost source of power in North Carolina for nearly two years. This is despite natural gas prices being at historical lows during those last two years. However, solar and wind are still competitive with natural gas even after accounting for firming. This is shown in detail in Figure 4. The remainder of the brief will focus on solar energy; with the understanding that many of the cost computations and local economic benefits of solar apply to wind as well. Storage technology has lagged behind generation technology. As a result, firming remains the main obstacle to adopting local energy. However, recent advances are making 24-hour renewable coverage competitive with conventional energy. Vanadium batteries have existed since the 1980s (2), but recent manufacturing advances have made them competitive at grid scale. Unlike lithium ion technology that uses intricate and damage-prone parts, vanadium batteries are extremely simple: two tanks of electrolyte and a membrane. This simplicity makes them safer (3), more robust (3), and much more affordable (2, 4) on a utility grid scale than lithium ion. Grid-scale vanadium battery use began with a 4 MWh installation in Japan in 2005 (5). A wind generation site in Dalian uses an 800 MWh vanadium battery for firming (2, 4, 6). China is also adding massive battery manufacturing capacity in anticipation of future demand. II. New technologies have lowered the breakeven cost. Figure 2 shows a history of US natural gas prices (generally set by the price at Henry Hub distribution point in Louisiana). Figure 3. Energy cost comparison, table, 2025 projection Important note: the variation in solar prices (shown by light blue caps and multiple bars for solar) are caused by different installation systems and types of financing. In other words, once a solar system is built and a payment system established, its price is set. All-weather reliability and stable prices allow businesses and homeowners to plan ahead with confidence. In contrast, electricity based on natural gas means unpredictable prices during good weather and outages during bad, hindering business operations, planning, and expansion. The result is drastic price spikes (12). A natural gas-based energy future for North Carolina is a hostile environment for business growth. These price shocks bring extreme unpredictability into business operations that can be devastating. Businesses cannot plan for expansion, hiring, investing in new equipment, or opening new locations without a stable cost outlook. IV. Figure 6. ACP outlook: natural gas cash outflows from North Carolina at different price points. A natural gas strategy takes advantage of this ingrained habit. Again, this strategy is a losing one for North Carolina as it has no sources of natural gas. These opportunities are especially strong in less urbanized areas with affordable land and simple permitting processes, which have historically struggled the most to find opportunities for growth. A brief example of statewide and local economic gains from a local energy is shown below. Figure 7 shows economic gains from solar for Cumberland County from generating its own solar energy; from exporting solar electricity for the Triangle market; and total revenues retained within the North Carolina economy from a statewide local energy strategy. VI. This is in line with the NC Clean Path projections (8), and is substantially higher than job growth possible with a gas-and-pipeline strategy. Figure 8. Construction and permanent full-time jobs in North Carolina, solar vs gas base power strategy. Actual solar job figures are likely to be higher due these factors. PV, wind, and batteries have both one-time installation and ongoing maintenance costs, just like pipelines and power plants. However, gas plants must also be fed fuel to operate. In contrast, once installed, local energy needs no inputs other than maintenance by workers (18). For this reason, a higher percentage of renewable installation costs go to salaries compared to gas. Operations and maintenance jobs for renewables are tasks like cleaning, preventive maintenance, repairs, grounds-keeping to prevent brush overgrowth, etc. These are abundant, accessible, permanent blue-collar jobs. Natural gas is a poor generator of employment in all regions, but especially for North Carolina. With no natural gas resources within its borders, this state has no base of natural gas construction workers. Welders, fitters, inspectors, manufacturers of pipeline parts, etc., must be brought in as contractors from natural gas-heavy areas like Texas and North Dakota. A solar strategy will engage skills and resources native to North Carolina, and build wealth that will stay in and continue to drive economic growth. VII. However, this was not always the case. The deregulation process was poorly designed, and by 2000 power shortages led to rolling blackouts and extreme hikes in power costs (15). Investigations found that generating companies, including Enron, had deliberately gamed markets to create artificial shortages and maximize profits through the resulting price spikes (13, 22, 23). Cheap natural gas needs an infrastructure of a few large, arterial pipelines. This raised gas prices in California, on top of the US-wide price increase. Gas power plants can shut down and restart fairly quickly compared to coal and nuclear. This is typically an advantage, as it allows gas plants to respond quickly to changes in demand. Recorded phone calls demonstrated an OPEC-like collaboration between energy suppliers to drive up prices (13, 22, 23). After agreeing to take the plant down, the Nevada official questioned the reason. Rich asks. These efforts succeeded in exaggerating natural price shocks. Deliberate price inflation through temporary plant shutdowns is not possible with coal, nuclear, wind, or solar. This type of market interference requires a power source that can be brought on- and offline at will. 1. An energy strategy that depends on imports is a poor strategy. Meanwhile, North Carolina has no gas fields. In other words, Duke Energy threatened national defense readiness to get out of cleaning up its own mess. However, it appears history is about to repeat itself. The rate payers, workers, and businesses of North Carolina will not benefit. VIII. IX. Industry requires intense heat and has traditionally used fossil fuels such as coal, coke, and natural gas. The state is positioned for success in several industries, including glass, semiconductors, ceramics, secondary metal processing, forestry, agriculture and food, high-tech textiles, composite manufacturing, and biorefining. These include raw metal production due to lack of ore resources, and the petroleum and chemical industries, due to lack of petroleum fields or refineries to provide raw materials (40). Imported natural gas can be used for process heat in petroleum and chemical refining, but it cannot be used as a feedstock (41). This brings high labor costs, which is more prohibitive than energy costs for most industries. These are costly to remediate. Glass, ceramics, and semiconductors: Require high-intensity heat to melt raw materials and control cooling. These methods all use electricity rather than combustion. Improved equipment now available means new pulp mills can generate steam entirely from their own waste (61, 62). Melting metal for casting is now done by electric arc furnace (invented 1879) or electric induction (invented 1903) (63). Melting steel and aluminum by electric induction takes about 600 kWh per ton (68). To be competitive when made US, metal manufacturing must be highly automated and make products for high-value end uses that need quality and precision. Combustion heating is incompatible with these end uses. However, biotechnology is opening up new opportunities in high-tech textiles where highly-skilled workers will be needed. North Carolina is poised to excel in this industry. Examples include biosynthetic production of spider silk for fashion and ballistic purposes (72), smart uniforms that camouflage their wearers from night-vision goggles (73), and more. Lab-grown biosynthetic fibers only require heat to warm incubators. Other high-tech fibers derived from glass, plastics, carbon nanotubes, etc require precise, clean conditions that are not compatible with combustion heating. Electric methods like induction, arc, microwave, vapor deposition, etc are required in this industry (74). Advanced resin curing methods currently in use for this industry include a variety of electromagnetic technologies including UV (45, 75), microwave (76), infrared (75), etc depending on type of composite. Energy needs for many facilities may be limited to warming incubators, and can be provided by burning waste biomass (77). Since energy use is drastically lower than traditional refining competitors, energy costs are not an important factor in this industry. Key to success in this industry are a high-tech worker population and low-cost agricultural feedstocks like cellulose, starch, oils, and protein. Industries that are competitive in North Carolina have process heat needs that are better met by biomass and electric sources such as induction, electric arc, laser stamping, electromagnetic curing, etc. These industry needs are better served by local wind and solar generation than by imported frack gas. One issue cited by solar and wind opponents is fear of obstructing training operations and pushing defense installations to relocate out of state. DoD has approved the vast majority of renewable energy projects that have applied, clearly demonstrating that local energy and military operations are compatible (78). Furthermore, fears of interfering with military operations ignore the fact that much of the world is adopting local energy. Farms that add solar power typically do so on only part of their land. Most farms have some acreage that has always yielded poorly. Works Cited 1. Dyer, James; Beach, Fred; King, C. The Full Cost of Electricity (FCe-). (2015). IEEE Spectrum (2017).

It has also abused this monopoly status to avoid accountability for coal ash spills, up to threatening to withhold power from federal military installations if fined. What I found was unconvincing.

The result is drastic price spikes (12). These price shocks bring extreme unpredictability into business operations that can be devastating. 6. ACP outlook: natural gas cash outflows from North Carolina at different price points. A natural gas strategy takes advantage of this ingrained habit. brief example of statewide and local economic gains from a local energy is shown below.

Cheap natural gas needs an infrastructure of a few large, arterial pipelines. Gas power plants can shut down and restart fairly quickly compared to coal and nuclear. This is typically an advantage, as it allows gas plants to respond quickly to changes in demand. This is in contrast to coal and nuclear plants, which once online must stay running.

This type of market interference requires a power source that can be brought on- and offline at will. An energy strategy that depends on imports is a poor strategy. Meanwhile, North Carolina has no gas fields. A natural gas strategy locks the entire state into dependence on one or two pipeline arteries carrying imported gas. A single incident can spark months of supply shortages and elevated prices. In other words, Duke Energy threatened national defense readiness to get out of cleaning up its own mess. North Carolina would be wise to think twice before entrusting its energy future to an entity with this track record. However, it appears history is about to repeat itself. Industry requires intense heat and has traditionally used fossil fuels such as coal, coke, and natural gas.

Imported natural gas can be used for process heat in petroleum and chemical refining, but it cannot be used as a feedstock (41). Therefore metal refining, petroleum, and the conventional chemicals industry will not be considered in this review as they are not competitive in North Carolina for fundamental market reasons. Natural gas introduces defects and contaminants into the product (42, 46). This adds costs to metal processing, and makes silicon manufacturing (computer chips, solar cells, etc) impossible. Natural gas requires long heating times. ceramics, and semiconductors: Require high-intensity heat to melt raw materials and control cooling. These methods all use electricity rather than combustion. Improved equipment now available means new pulp mills can generate steam entirely from their own waste (61, 62).

Since energy use is drastically lower than traditional refining competitors, energy costs are not an important factor in this industry. Key to success in this industry are a high-tech worker population and low-cost agricultural feedstocks like cellulose, starch, oils, and protein. North Carolina is already well-positioned to succeed in biorefining using an all-renewable power grid. Industries that are competitive in North Carolina have process heat needs that are better met by biomass and electric sources such as induction, electric arc, laser stamping, electromagnetic curing, etc. fears of interfering with military operations ignore the fact that much of the world is adopting local energy. No use of rural land is needed. Farms that add solar power typically do so on only part of their land. Most farms have some acreage that has always yielded poorly. Supply interruptions, price spikes, outages, and even deliberate price manipulation are all established consequences of reliance on natural gas. Renewable local energy creates more jobs per megawatt-hour than imported natural gas, bringing better economic growth than natural gas without additional costs. Dyer, James; Beach, Fred; King, C.
