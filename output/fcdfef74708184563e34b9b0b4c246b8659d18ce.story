Most of the electricity will be sold to utility companies that serve the Los Angeles area. The planning for the project began in 2012. Tribal chairman Darren Daboda said in a statement that the first-of-its-kind project shows that even small tribes can benefit from commercial renewable energy projects. The Moapa River tribe has about 350 members. Solar power in the American southwest is a burgeoning business but it has been almost too successful. California now has more renewable energy available during the day than it can use. That amount of electricity could have powered about 45,000 California homes for a year. This was almost double the amount of clean power lost in 2015. Once utilities can store the power created by solar and wind facilities, there will be no need to keep fossil fueled generating stations in operation.
