All rights reserved. SIGNE DEAN 24 AUG 2017 Controversy around the Dakota Access Pipeline continues with the latest news that the company behind the oil pipeline is now suing Greenpeace and other environmental groups who were involved in extensive protests against the project. According to Reuters, ETP alleges that environmentalists used the Standing Rock Sioux tribe - the most public of the indigenous groups in opposition to the project - to wage a battle against the pipeline. Amongst grave concerns over Native American rights and the destruction of sacred ground, opponents of the project also expressed fears that the oil transport line - which is routed under the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation - would affect local drinking water. Even before officially starting operations, earlier this year it turned out that the pipeline had already sprung at least three relatively minor leaks, spilling more than 100 gallons (378 litres) of oil. Several indigenous groups in North and South Dakota, including the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, are still battling the pipeline in court. 5 days ago Politics & Society Semi-Automatic Rifles Really Are More Deadly, New Study Clearly Shows Numbers don't lie. 6 days ago Politics & Society To Save Ourselves It's Time to Rethink Our Economic System, Warn Scientists The market is killing the planet. 4 hours ago PHYSICS Single Hydrogen Atoms Could Form Eerie 'Ghost Bonds' With Nothing, New Study Shows It shouldn't be possible. 16 hours ago SPACE SpaceX Has Announced The First Tourist to Go to The Moon - And Take Other People With Him Such a wild project. 16 hours ago NATURE Potentially Deadly Threats Are Now Lurking in Post-Hurricane Flood Waters Hurricane Florence isn't over yet.
