The event, the culmination of a four-day protest in the capital, was led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which has been involved in a longstanding dispute with authorities over the construction of an oil pipeline in North Dakota, culminating in a two-mile march through Washington and rally in front of the White House. Judge rejects Standing Rock request to block Dakota Access pipeline drilling Read more With snow falling, the Native Nations Rise march took off from the headquarters of the army corps of engineers, the federal agency that authorized construction of the 1,172-mile Dakota Access oil pipeline. The march wound through the capital and along the way demonstrators paused in front of the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue to erect a tipi. At the White House, protesters demonstrated, danced and prayed in what organizers say is a show of solidarity against the federal government that has a long history of discounting tribal concerns on a range of environmental, economic and social issues. The protesters, some dressed in traditional Native American clothing, snaked through the crowd carrying a black inflatable tube representing an oil pipeline. The Standing Rock protest against the Dakota Access pipeline became an international rallying cry for indigenous rights and climate change activism, drawing thousands of Native Americans to the rural area of Cannon Ball, North Dakota.

During the days leading up to the rally, Native American leaders and activists met with members of Congress to press them to protect tribal rights. Leaders also set up an encampment of tipis near the Washington monument and held cultural workshops. Work on the pipeline, which is owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, was halted in December by the Obama administration. The army corps of engineers announced that it would look at alternate routes for the pipeline and that it would undertake an environmental impact statement. But in January, Trump signed an executive order giving the pipeline project the go-ahead. The army corps granted an easement for the oil company to drill under a reservoir on the Missouri river that is adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation and construction resumed in early February. The company has said it would be just a matter of weeks before up to 550,000 barrels of oil a day can begin flowing through the pipeline. The Standing Rock Sioux and the Cheyenne River Sioux tribes have filed a joint lawsuit against the pipeline project in federal court.
