A 21-page brief argues that the disturbance, which occurred in October, was not intentional. Julie Fedorchak, the chair of the commission, had accused Dakota Access of violating two provisions of its construction order. The firm adjusted the pipeline route, but did not file any certifications with the state, and it resumed construction on the adjusted route without securing approval, she said. But the deals are on hold now that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has denied an easement for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River at Lake Oahe. The agency now plans to prepare an environmental impact statement and identify potential new routes, a process that could take several months. According to Fedorchak, the artifacts that were disturbed in October were cairns. Those are stone formations or stone features that tribes use to mark important places, including burial grounds and sacred sites. In early September, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe notified a federal judge of similar stone features at another construction site . But a request for an injunction to protect the area was denied and the land was bulldozed by Dakota Access over the Labor Day holiday weekend.
