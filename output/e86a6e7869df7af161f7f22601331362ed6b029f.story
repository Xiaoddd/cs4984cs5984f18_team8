In this new field, scientists and mathematicians analyze history in the hopes they can find trends and patterns in order to predict the future. I wonder if they are analyzing history to see if there ever was a leader with less character than Donald Trump. This inquiring mind wants to know. Evidently he views most women as Rottweilers, French poodles, black Labradors, cocker spaniels, and promiscuous bitches. But I think the best demonstration of his total lack of character is his public treatment of Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona who is dying of brain cancer. He often ridicules McCain for casting a thumbs-down deciding vote on repealing the Affordable Care Act. Petty. Pathetic. I have always thought it would take ten years to recover from the George Bush Recession of 2007 and his 2003 invasion of Iraq. That recovery is way behind schedule. We have reached the point where straight, white, cisgender men will most likely not remain the privileged group they have been for hundreds of years. Today only 31 percent of Americans are white men, and perhaps 10 percent of them are members of the LBGTQ community. How this majority is going to govern in the future is open to question. This organization publishes its findings in a publication called Cliodynamics: The Journal of Theoretical and Mathematical History. We now have 65 percent of Americans reporting they are living paycheck to paycheck. No wonder democratic socialism as the governing philosophy of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark is attractive to 61 percent of American millennial Democrats between 18 and 34, an absolutely shocking shift from capitalism in just a few years. These countries always top off happiness and equality polls of over 190 countries. In just one year membership in the Democratic Socialists of America has gone from 6,000 to 43,000. American Capitalists Are Doing A Great Job Creating American Socialists The Gallup Poll has not measured interest in socialism vs. capitalism in the U.S. for a decade, but in 2010 Democrats aged 18 to 34 had a 53 percent approval rating for both socialism and capitalism. Young Republicans in 2010 had a 72 percent approval rating for capitalism and only a 17 percent approval rating for socialism. By 2018 there has been a significant shift in ratings. Among Republicans aged 60 to 64, 60 percent approve of capitalism and 30 percent have a positive view of socialism. Even Republicans are beginning to recognize that capitalism does not work well for every American. In fact, capitalism has delivered world-record wealth to the top 20 percent while making 600,000 Americans homeless and essentially destroying the middle class, Many millions cannot afford even basic necessities. outlines several reasons why American capitalists are now the ones creating American socialists by the millions. Although about four million Americans lost homes and ended up sleeping in cars, not a single banker has heard the clang of a jail cell door. The Best and Worst of America Los Angeles represents the best and worst of America. Often called the wealthiest country in the world, we will lose 72,000 people by drug overdoses this year, kill 97 people a day with firearms, shoot eight children a day, and walk around 600,000 homeless Americans sleeping in shelters, under bridges, and in tiny tents in parks and on sidewalks. making a good profit. Our capitalists have not figured out how to stop creating socialists yet. Most of the Scandinavian and European countries solved that problem decades ago. Years ago our capitalists invested in infrastructure, education, scientific research, and regional development. Now capitalists invest huge tax cuts in stock buybacks to increase CEO and stockholder dividends. Bankruptcy for the Old in an Economy Making the Rich Richer Trump says the economy is going great. Because older Americans are facing retirement with insufficient funds and are going bankrupt at an ever-increasing rate. They are waiting longer for full Social Security benefits, solid old-time pensions have been replaced by shaky 401(k) plans, and health care costs are increasing exponentially. One in three older people who receive SS benefits depend upon them for 90 percent of their income. Because middle-class income has not increased for at least 30 years, the rate of people over 65 filing for bankruptcy has tripled since 1991. Something had to give. The Consumer Bankruptcy Project reports that from February 2013 to November 2016 there were 3.6 bankruptcy filers per 1,000 people aged 65 to 74; in 1991 there were only 1.2. In 2017 12.2 percent of all filers were 65 or older, up from 2.1 percent in 1991. Roughly 40 percent of people over 65 still have a home mortgage, twice as much as 65 and over homeowners in 1989. The lowest-income families led by someone 55 or older now carry the heaviest debt loads relative to their incomes. More than 13 percent have debt payments that equal more than 40 percent of their income, double what it was in 1991. The idea that women are not funny never entered my mind. Editorial Wisdom from a forgotten flagpole by Sabrina Hornung Photo by Sabrina HornungI had a little bit of gravel-road therapy this weekend, found myself cruising rural Burleigh County and made a pit stop at Lake Mitchell. Participants were judged on creativity, flavor, and presentation; and this year we added a new category. I suffer from acute scoliosis in my lower back, and pain radiates from this area on a daily basis.
