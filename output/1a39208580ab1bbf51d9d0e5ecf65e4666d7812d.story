But this is not the only fight about water, and Standing Rock is only one chapter somewhere in the middle of a long story. Veterans, water protectors and the independent media facing riot police. Photo by Rob Wilson. Mark Trahant posted Feb 24, 2017 Every day I write rhymes on Twitter. I get a kick out of reducing complicated ideas and events down to 140 characters. But think about that story: A few dozen people were arrested at camps where more than 10,000 people once said no to the Dakota Access pipeline. That people power did not evaporate. Even today more people, tens of thousands, perhaps millions, are still a part of that effort via social media and through direct action. This is a narrative that the state of North Dakota, the pipeline company, and the oil industry could not counter, despite spending millions of dollars and advancing into Great Sioux treaty lands with a law enforcement army. The company was in a rush to build and North Dakota made the story more compelling by acting against its own interest. In August, Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier arrested Standing Rock Chairman David Archambault II and the plot raced ahead to a military occupation, a company line to defend, and a global audience via social media. Lots of drama. Now the pipeline is set and oil will flow. Perhaps in a few days. They won. But this is not the only fight about water. There are now hundreds of scenes spread across North America. The protection of water, the rebalancing of the world, now has a symbol and a memory to carry that story forward. This is not the only fight about water. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe hopes supporters on March 10 will march and pray in Washington, D.C. I think people will go. And by the thousands. Standing Rock is the call to action. The White House tried to rewrite the story Thursday. The idea here, which has been brewing for a while, is to cast the tribe as a partner of the state. The tribe immediately called out that statement as false. I was on a plane to Washington, D.C., when the easement was issued. It was an insult to me and to the Tribe. I cancelled the meeting upon hearing this news. This lie from the White House is revealing: The Trump administration (and its allies in the oil industry and North Dakota) understands that this story is not over. They want their narrative back.
