Protesters include various Native American tribes as well as environmentalists and even actors including Shailene Woodley. State officials issued an order on Monday for activists to vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp, located on US Army Corps of Engineers land near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, citing harsh weather conditions. Human wall The 1,885 km pipeline project, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP, is mostly complete, except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. Organisers could not immediately be reached for comment. Dull Knife, a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe from the Pine Ridge Reservation of South Dakota, said he had been camping at the protest site for months. Former US marine Michael A Wood Jr is leading the effort along with Wesley Clark Jr, a writer whose father is retired US Army General Wesley Clark. US Hoouse representative Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat from Hawaii and a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, has said on Twitter she will join the protesters on Sunday. The Army Corps, citing safety concerns, has ordered the evacuation of the primary protest camp by December 5th, but said it would not forcibly remove people from the land. Local law enforcement said on Tuesday they planned a blockade of the camp, but local and state officials later retreated, saying they would check vehicles only for certain prohibited supplies such as propane, and possibly issue fines. Mr Dalrymple said on Wednesday that state officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters and there had been no plans to block food or other supplies from the camp. He also warned protesters that while emergency responders would try to reach anyone in need, that would be contingent on weather conditions. That decision has been delayed twice by the Army Corps.
