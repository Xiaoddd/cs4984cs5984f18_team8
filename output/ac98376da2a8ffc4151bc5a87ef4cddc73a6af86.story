As MLive reported, the activists plan to take on the city's ongoing water crisis. Clark was one of the nearly 2,000-strong group, Veterans Stand for Standing Rock, that formed a first line of protection at the Oceti Sakowin Camp in North Dakota over the weekend. That, protesters argued, would have contaminated the Missouri River as a water source, while also disturbing the sacred tribal lands of the Standing Rock Sioux. The demonstration against the pipeline's construction has been going on for months, with clashes between peaceful protesters and the police frequently turning violent. The Flint water crisis, meanwhile, stretches back over two years. The city was supposed to start sourcing water from Lake Huron in 2013, rather than purchasing it from Detroit, but doing so required the construction of a pipeline. Detroit cut off Flint's water supply ahead of schedule, forcing the city to look to the Flint River, the waters of which corroded the lead pipes that brought it to residents. As a result, the water that people were drinking was not only poisoned, but also rife with disease-causing bacteria. President Barack Obama followed suit in January as well. Veterans and activists do not know exactly when they'll head to Flint and many have vowed to stay until the Standing Rock Sioux ask them to leave. But they're hoping that their presence in Flint can call media attention to the crisis and force meaningful action in the same way their presence did in North Dakota. All rights reserved.
