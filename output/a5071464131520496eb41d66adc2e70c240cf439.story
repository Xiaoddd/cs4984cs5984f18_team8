SB Organizers with 350 Seattle are reporting that 12 activists, including City Council candidate Jon Grant, have been arrested at demonstrations at Chase bank branches across the city today. The Seattle Police Department reported that arrests have taken place, but have yet to confirm the number. Officers have made arrests at multiple bank branch locations following a series of demonstrations today. More info as it becomes available. Activists say JP Morgan Chase is one of the lead banks providing credit to TransCanada, the corporation behind the Keystone XL pipeline project. Despite decisions from the Obama administration that rejected and stalled the controversial pipeline, President Trump has resuscitated the tar sands transportation project by signing an executive order directing his administration to approve pipeline permitting. Seattle City Council member Mike O'Brien and 350 Seattle organizer Alec Connon also published an op-ed in The Stranger explaining their decision to protest. In Capitol Hill, one of the protested Chase branch locations shut down preemptively, and activists say they've managed to shut down five more. I haven't yet been able to confirm those other five branch shutdowns with Chase, but did see protests unfold at three different Chase locations downtown and in the International District this morning and afternoon. Shortly before noon, City Council member Kshama Sawant stopped by a small gathering of activists at Westlake Center and City Council member (and kayaktivist) Mike O'Brien showed up at a demonstration at the Chase branch on 5th Avenue and Union Street. Police eventually issued a dispersal order, and the protesters left. A Chase branch in Capitol Hill closed down in anticipation of these menacing environmental protesters. SH A few blocks away, at the 2nd and Union Ave Chase branch, indigenous leaders led a demonstration that included drumming and a round dance inside the building. Seattle mayoral candidate Nikkita Oliver was also present, and participated in the chants and dancing. Mood in here is triumphant, celebratory. By mid-afternoon, 350 Seattle reported that 12 activists had been arrested, including Seattle City Council candidate Jon Grant. 3:13 p.m.: This post has been updated with confirmation from the Seattle Police Department that protestors have been arrested while demonstrating at Chase Bank branches.
