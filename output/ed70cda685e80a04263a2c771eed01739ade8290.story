Officers dressed in riot gear began entering the main Dakota Access Pipeline resistance camp and appear to be checking on structures. Authorities were using plastic handcuffs and placing those arrested into transport vans. Some of the protesters refused to walk, and had to be carried. Lt. Tom Iverson of the North Dakota Highway Patrol said there had been no reports of injuries to protesters or officers, and there had been no known use of less-than-lethal munitions. Law enforcement staged heavy equipment and Humvees on the hill above the camp, while officers dressed in the protective gear could be seen working in the area about 10:30 a.m. A helicopter and airplane also flew above the camp. About 18 National Guard members, along with equipment, joined officers moving into the camp. Iverson said there were about 200 law enforcement officers total who entered the camp. Law enforcement estimated 30 people remained in the evacuation area in the morning, but one observer put the number higher. About a dozen people have crossed the frozen Cannonball River and re-entered the camp as of 9 a.m. Thursday. Cleanup was scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. A total of 11 people were arrested Wednesday, according to a list of names provided by the Morton County Sheriff's Department. Burgum said Wednesday evening that people could still leave voluntarily Thursday. Those arrested Wednesday included one member of the media, Jack Smith IV of Mic, an online news outlet. Most of those who were arrested were taken to the Lake Region Correctional Facility in Devils Lake. None of those who were arrested Wednesday were from North Dakota. Four are from California, while the others are from Canada, Illinois, New York, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wisconsin. Jessica Holdman of the Bismarck Tribune contributed to this report.
