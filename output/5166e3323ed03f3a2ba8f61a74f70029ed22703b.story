Those opposed to the pipeline couldn't rely on traditional media to tell the story, so they turned to Twitter, Facebook Live and other platforms to share. Messaging that uses similar hashtags or imagery allows anyone to unify under one banner or brand, and it can help deepen the message's authenticity. As if on cue, she begins to cry. The clip is of Iron Eyes celebrating a since-overturned decision by the Army Corps of Engineers not to grant an easement to allow construction of the 1,172-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline, designed to carry crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois. The video captures the youth of the anti-pipeline movement, a group that helped propel its messaging across the U.S. and beyond using some of the simplest (and cheapest) of marketing tools: social media. Not only did it tell its story in real time, but it opened that voice up to anyone who would listen. Introducing a movement and reintroducing a people The general consensus was that the movement against the Dakota Access Pipeline began with young indigenous people. Specifically, many point to the Oceti Sakowin Youth, or the Standing Rock Youth, and a number of relays they ran to garner awareness and support for their stance against the pipeline. Bobbi Jean Three Legs, a young Lakota woman from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, organized the runs, which grew in size and distance from March 2016. The second run was a 500-mile relay from the Sacred Stone Camp, ground zero for the movement, to Omaha to deliver a letter to the Army Corps of Engineers. petition for their efforts. The run then expanded to include Washington, D.C., and New York. update tools were huge contributors to gaining more than 500,000 supporting signatures. The real-time documentation that so many young people do naturally throughout the day only deepened the story for those following. Schwartz recalls an instance on the relay to Washington, D.C, when the runners learned one of the final permits for the pipeline had been granted by the Army Corps. The group turned to Facebook Live to record their reaction. They amplified their message through authenticity. Some of those who took note included celebrities. Actress Shailene Woodley was among those who picked up on the story, particularly via the relays, and boosted the messages through her own social media channels. While Woodley and other celebrities, including actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo, showed their support on social media and in interviews, the indigenous people being directly affected saw their own voices rise to the top. Simon Moya-Smith, a journalist and activist, emphasizes that Native Americans want to tell their own story, and social media provided the platform to do so. According to Moya-Smith, a large part of getting the narrative out is reminding people that Native Americans do, in fact, still exist. A holy woman of the Kalpulli Yaocenoxtli Nation offers prayers for the water protectors at the Oceti Sakowin camp in October 2016. When it comes to the Dakota Access Pipeline in particular, he says, social media pushed Native American voices to the front. Both young Native Americans and the elders have embraced social media for responding in real time to the national conversation, which can often include correcting misunderstood or mis-told stories that have circulated for centuries. But not with social media. Messaging and unification Messaging has remained relatively consistent among the various stakeholders, be they individuals or organizations. Joining the conversation became as simple as searching for and using the hashtag over any social media platform. Amplifying the message was as easy as a retweet. Take the free practice exam and prove your expertise. The NRDC and other organizations made sure to tag and check in to Standing Rock as part of their social media messaging as well. Johnston says this only strengthened the unification against the pipeline, suggesting the protest was far larger than just those on the ground and included a massive online community. She credits the Indigenous Environmental Network for helping to unify the messaging used by so many opposed to the pipeline. IEN acts as an umbrella organization that builds alliances among indigenous communities, environmental organizations and other groups in an effort to organize campaigns, direct actions and create public awareness. IEN figured out who was involved, who was protesting and unified the audience, she says. They pushed out different pieces of information, and other organizations put IEN at the forefront, letting them push out messaging and direct the dialog. The way this unification works on social media is relatively simple. Donations piled next to the common eating area and main prayer circle at the Oceti Sakowin camp. In early October, night temperatures were as low as 30 degrees. Begay says one example of its success was in bringing U.S. military veterans to defend Standing Rock water protectors. If IEN is holding its own action, it will bring its delegates together from across the nation and huddle on the messaging. To indigenous people, we know what that means. We know what our goal is. Another key point of phrasing, she says, relates to how those opposed to the pipeline are referenced. With the messaging defined and the audience growing, the calls to action came rolling in. The dedicated website for defunding explains how to do so, with individual, organizational and governmental steps. The site describes how to remove money from banks involved in a key loan for the pipeline, but also urges those who took specific action to post about it on their social media accounts. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Native Organizers Alliance and Indigenous Environmental Network also called for the organization of a camp and march on Washington, D.C. The number of RSVPs on Facebook came to about 2,000. Ancient culture, modern technology The impact and necessity of social media was clear from the start of the movement. While the land at Standing Rock is considered sacred, some modern updates were needed. Specifically, the movement required an internet connection to broadcast the stories in an area where cell service was notoriously spotty. There was even a ridge nearby that was nicknamed Facebook Hill, where people would try to get cell service. Live video from some of the final days of the camp in February was fairly poor, but vital, still, in telling the story. Marketers speak constantly about the use of live video and social media to tell stories, and young people in particular have taken to these formats for their everyday lives. It can, however, feel like a clash of cultures to digitally document such an old, indigenous population. Moya-Smith says there are some situations and ceremonies where people are not allowed to use a cell phone or take photos. But where Native American elders request sacred ceremonies remain undocumented, they also understand the importance of social media to connect the community. The Kalpulli Yaocenoxtli Aztec Nation arrived at the Oceti Sakowin camp in early October 2016. More than 200 indigenous tribes offered their support and solidarity with the water protectors. There have been some instances where modern, digital light has illuminated certain Native American practices for the rest of the world. For example, a member of Standing Rock Rising posted a photo on Facebook of a Sacred Fire, by request of the water protectors, prior to the final prayer walk and exit from the campgrounds on Feb. 22. A Facebook Live video of this final prayer and fire also exists. Another strong tech presence has been from drone footage. Myron Dewey, a producer at Digital Smoke Signals, used a drone to document Standing Rock and surrounding camps, posting the video regularly to Facebook. Some of the footage went up raw, while some went into edited video used on other Facebook pages or websites. Goodson recalls the Facebook check-in phenomenon from early November 2016. It was about a show of support. Think of it this way: Facebook likes on a brand page or video are not as valuable as actual purchases. But they absolutely add some form of brand value. The department is seeking information from the Facebook page of a Bellingham, Washington, group fighting the Dakota Access Pipeline. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a motion to throw this warrant out. Measuring success To determine how successful this movement has been depends on what you choose to measure. It could be ruled a failure because the pipeline has not been halted, and the water protectors have left Standing Rock. Those leading the movement, however, have done their best to correct what goes out when they can. We have always been transparent in our messages and actions; it is unfortunate when certain media take messages out of context. We must remain focused on our goals. The movement is bigger than just the tribe. It is bigger than the Chairman, or any individual. With so many different organizations and individuals now involved, there has been some confusion over who exactly to listen to or follow. Those trying to donate money to the effort may also face some chaotic responses online. Despite all of the noise, many contend that the movement has become much larger than protesting the pipeline: It has brought the Native American voice toward the front of the national conversation, at least online. Arguably one of the most successful strategies of the movement was incorporating an environmental discourse. Many Americans may not know or understand treaties or sacred burial grounds, but most have heard about climate change and pollution. As Begay explains, using the term water protector, versus protester, also tapped into a more environmental message. Goodson says this environmental angle may have been what helped give the movement momentum. The scarf was worn by the Indigenous Women Rise group that attended the march, and they urged other Native American women to wear the scarf as a sign of solidarity. The scarf was created by Los Angeles-based designer Bethany Yellowtail, a member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. At the end of February, Yellowtail partnered with Sarah Eagle Heart, CEO of Native Americans in Philanthropy (NAP), to launch a social impact clothing brand called SACREDx. Ten percent of the proceeds will be donated to NAP. These scarves or the T-shirts or the imagery that is coming from SACREDx is helping to keep the momentum of the movement going beyond just the gatherings.
