AA HARRISBURG -- The Department of Environmental Protection recently filed two violation notices involving inadvertent returns of diluted drilling fluid into Blair County wetlands and the Frankstown Branch Juniata River. In January, the DEP halted all Mariner East II Pipeline construction, citing 32 violations in both Blair and Huntingdon counties. According to the Altoona Water Authority and the Blair Township Sewer and Water Authority, the drinking water in the area is safe, despite the spills. Blair Township Sewer and Water Authority manager Tim McGaw said. The water, mixed with earth, escaped our containment structures and entered the Frankstown Branch Juniata River. There was no indication of drilling mud in the water.
