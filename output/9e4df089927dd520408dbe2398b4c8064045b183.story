Another bank on the list, DNB, the largest bank in Norway, recently announced that it sold its assets in the Dakota Access pipeline after mounting public pressure to divest. If it acts on the demands of the new letter, it could pressure other banks to follow suite. The resistance against the Dakota Access pipeline, which cuts through unceded North American treaty lands, was launched in April by the Standing Rock Sioux to protect water and cultural sites. Police, private security forces and the National Guard have used dogs, tasers, mace, rubber bullets, water cannons and other tactics and military equipment to repress the protesters. Authorities have arrested and seriously injured hundreds of people, including a young protester whose arm was maimed by a concussion grenade. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple has called for the occupations blocking the pipeline to be evacuated by Dec. 5, but claimed that there are no plans for forcible removal. Dalrymple said Wednesday that he has requested a meeting with the Standing Rock Sioux to rebuild shattered relations.
