Michael A. Wood Jr., and the 2,000 veterans he's bringing to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, are willing to take the risk. Wood, a former marine, put out a call to Veterans asking them to volunteer at Standing Rock on December 4-7. He only expected about 500 veterans to respond to his call, but instead he got 2,000. The veterans' non-violent defense of protestors will help aid in the ongoing clash between police and protestors. The logistics behind the effort include setting up tents, passing out food and defending protestors against militarized police forces. The group is operating on its own in this effort. For some veterans, this mission is personal. Loreal Black Shawl is a retired sergeant in the Army and descendant of two Native American tribes, the Oglala Lakota and Northern Arapaho. Shawl said to the New York Times. The willingness of our veterans to join in on a battle after serving is admirable and hopefully impactful. We will continue to monitor DAPL and see exactly how the presence of our veterans plays out. We partner with diverse content creators and influencers to help them reach a wider audience, amplify their message, and fund their hustles. We believe that the world shifts according to the way people see it. If you change the way people view the world, you can transform it.
