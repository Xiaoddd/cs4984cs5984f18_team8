The tribe's opposition to the project led to months of protests that were marked by clashes with police. Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, said construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) over sacred tribal sites and through Lake Oahe, the Standing Rock Sioux's water source, was conducted with a lack of respect to the tribe's land rights. She said she is also concerned about how protests of the pipeline were met with aggressive police force. She was invited to the US by Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault, AP reported. She said she will eventually recommend a full study of the DAPL's environmental impact. Her visit to the US included concerns over the Keystone XL pipeline, as well. In November, acting on a request from the tribe, Edward John, a member of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, visited the Oceti Sakowin protest camp and other areas near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball Rivers in North Dakota. He also met with local law enforcement, he said. Tauli-Corpuz previously called on the US to halt construction of the DAPL. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum defended his state's actions against DAPL protesters. Energy Transfer Partners, the company responsible for the highly-contentious DAPL, says that the pipeline will transport 470,000 barrels of crude oil per day from North Dakota's Bakken shale fields to Illinois. Beginning last year, the DAPL incurred months-long protests originally led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and set up along the pipeline's route, near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers. The protests camps eventually attracted more than just Standing Rock Sioux Tribe members and those of other Native American tribes. In addition to tribal water supply concerns, the Missouri River is a source of drinking water to millions in the US. The DAPL also represents a continued dependance on fossil fuels, opponents say, which contributes significantly to global climate change. Thousands of people flocked to the area to support the DAPL opposition, leading to hundreds of arrests by at times aggressive, heavily-armed law enforcement.

The Standing Rock Sioux has sued the Army Corps of Engineers and Energy Transfer Partners in federal court. The tribe claims it was not properly consulted on the project, which represented a threat to its health, based on the pipeline's route through its water source off the Missouri River. The tribe also says the project violates treaty rights agreed to in 1868 with the US government. The tribe has argued that the DAPL also threatens its sacred cultural and religious sites in the area. The defendants in the lawsuit dispute these claims. After months of indigenous-led opposition, creating an increasingly tense scene at the protest camps, the Barack Obama administration temporarily halted the project's construction through the area. Upon taking office in January, the Donald Trump administration quickly reversed course and approved of the DAPL's advancement. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.
