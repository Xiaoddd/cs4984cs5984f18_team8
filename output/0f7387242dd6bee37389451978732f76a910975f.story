(NOAA) Here are five reasons why oil spills in rivers differ from spills that occur in the open ocean: Some oils are denser than river water. Oil usually floats because it is less dense than the water it is floating on. These oils will float in either a river or the ocean. Sometimes the density of an oil is so close to that of river water that the oil moves along the river partly underwater. This doesn't happen very often, but it's something we have to think about whenever oil is spilled in a river. If spilled oil sinks, it can be very difficult to clean up. If something causes it to pool on the bottom (for example, it may get trapped behind a sunken vessel), then vacuum devices can be used to try and get the oil off the bottom. As you might guess, this method may not be very effective because vacuums may capture a lot of water and sand along with the oil. Movement is usually downstream. Unlike in a bay or the open ocean, currents in a river are generally directed downstream (except very close to the mouth of the river, where it enters the ocean; here, a flood tide might actually reverse the flow of the surface water). The greater predictability of river currents makes it easier to forecast which way the oil will move. Wind blowing across the river also affects where the oil will come ashore. If the wind is blowing straight down the river (as might happen on a river with high banks), it often will travel quite far down the river before it comes in contact with a beach. In order for the oil to beach, the wind must blow the oil to one side of the river or the other. You can see how the wind affects movement of an oil slick by looking at some predictions from GNOME, our oil spill trajectory model. (NOAA) Dams and locks influence oil movement. Rivers sometimes contain dams or locks that slow or divert water flow. Dams and locks also slow down the movement of spilled oil. Vegetation may grow right at the water's edge. Along many rivers, plants and trees grow right up to the river's edge. Those rivers don't have the open, sandy shores that you find along many parts of the open coast. It's much harder to remove oil from vegetation than from a hard-packed sand beach. Spill responders try to protect the plants by using booms, but if the vegetation gets oiled, responders often either cut, burn, or flush it with water to try to get the oil out. Oil can interact with sediment carried by rivers. Rivers often carry a lot of sediment in their currents. That means when oil droplets drift into the water column of a river, the sediment has the potential to stick to the oil droplets. Eventually (depending on how strong-flowing and full of sediment a river is) some of the oil-sediment combination may settle out to the bottom of the river, usually near the river mouth as the water slows down and reaches the ocean.

Notable River Spills Oil in the Ocean: Watch what happened on the Mississippi River in 2008, when a 600-foot tanker collided with Barge DM932, a 200-foot fuel barge, tearing the barge in half. Athos I Spill: Here are photos and other information about the tanker Athos I, which was damaged in November 2004 while it was docking at the CITGO refinery on the Delaware River and began spilling its cargo of Venezuelan crude oil. Failed Pipeline on Kalamazoo River: Read about a 2010 pipeline failure, which released 819,000 gallons of oil into a tributary creek of the Kalamazoo River in Marshall, Mich. The oil eventually traveled approximately 40 miles downstream in the Kalamazoo River.
