Chief Jason Ziegler of the Mandan Police Department and Sheriff Paul D Laney of Cass County can be identified in the footage here, shared by George on Facebook. One of the pair, she said, told her the pipeline construction would go ahead as planned. She said they asked him why he believed that, sparking a conversation about how the police and protesters are engaging with each other. She said one the police officers then told her that protesters blocking intersections, as some had done in Mandan that morning, would not win them local support. George continued to say that she and Newell had tried to sit and talk constructively, with the aim of bridging gaps in communication between police and protesters. She told Storyful that they tried to explain their positions, answering questions from the police, but the sheriff and the police chief began speaking over them and getting aggressive.
