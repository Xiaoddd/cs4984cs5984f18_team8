(Photo by Victoria Pickering) As several cities have moved to cut ties with Wells Fargo in recent weeks over the bank's investments in the Dakota Access Pipeline and other business practices, several members of the D.C. Council say the nation's capital should consider following in their footsteps. A coalition of groups came together last month to lobby the D.C. government to divest from the city's bank of record. At-large Councilmembers Anita Bonds and Elissa Silverman, Ward 1's Brianne Nadeau, Ward 6's Charles Allen, and Ward 7's Vincent Gray joined as co-sponsors of the sense of the council resolution. The city is in the third of a five-year contract with the bank, according to a spokesperson for Grosso. Introducing the resolution is meant to be the beginning of a conversation about how to move forward. It has been referred to the Finance and Revenue Committee so it can have a full public hearing. Seattle; Davis, California; Santa Monica; and West Hollywood have already begun discussing or taking steps to divest from Wells Fargo over investments in the pipeline, along with allegations of predatory lending, lending to private prisons, and recent fraud cases. There are also divestment campaigns underway in Raleigh, New York, and Albuquerque. This post has been updated with comment from Wells Fargo. best of dcist The Best Ways To Get Local News In D.C.
