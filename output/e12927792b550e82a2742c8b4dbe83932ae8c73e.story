Cattle ranchers and lumberjacks, college students and nurses, landscapers, investment bankers and a waitress from a Florida restaurant called Smokey Bones. All have been drawn by a 30-inch steel pipe that, in the unlikely setting of a desolate North Dakota prairie, has become a powerful symbol of heritage and history, progress and oppression, indigenous rights and corporate might. Walking and working the land, each brings a personal history and set of values to a conflict many see as pitting sovereign rights against corporate might. It is more than 90 percent complete. Now, nearly 2,000 are living in tents, tepees, yurts, RVs and cars. They are native and non-native, elderly and newborns. The camp has become so large and permanent that it has a book-swap library and a medical center. More than 560 people have been arrested in protests that have spread 40 miles north to the capital, Bismarck. Each side blames the other for the increasing violence. Protesters claim police have brutalized them with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, concussion grenades and water cannons. North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R) and the Army Corps of Engineers have ordered protesters out of the camp, but they vow to remain. With the first snows of a bleak North Dakota winter threatening, The Washington Post visited the area to record the personal accounts of people on all sides of an issue that is tearing at the American heartland. In Native American culture, dreams can be prophetic. The black snake in this case, he said, is a pipeline filled with oil. On a cold November morning, Goldtooth sat next to a warm wood stove in a canvas tent and described the struggle in flowing indigenous imagery: the four cycles of life, the sacred hoop and the importance of circles in nature, the spiritual power of eagles and grizzly bears. Then his words turned sledgehammer blunt. Goldtooth sees the pipeline as a threat to the drinking water of thousands downstream. Goldtooth was raised on a Navajo reservation in New Mexico, the grandson of a tribal medicine man and the son of a pioneering Navajo woman who earned a college degree in microbiology. Now he travels the world speaking about climate change, energy, pollution and sustainable resources. Goldtooth lives in Minnesota but has been coming to Standing Rock to visit relatives since he was a young man. He has become a key face of the movement here, and one recent morning he nodded as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist and lawyer, visited and likened the pipeline encampment to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The same day, Goldtooth stood in an empty field amid a circle of volunteer architects, engineers and builders who had come from as far as Spokane, Wash., and Santa Fe, N.M., to help build a more permanent camp to ride out the bone-cracking winter. Play Video Replay video or Read story Cory Bryson Local union official Cory Bryson watched as 200 demonstrators marched through his home town of Bismarck, protesting the project being built by his union workers. But one young man suddenly tried to push his way through the line of riot police, who threw him to the ground and cuffed him. over and over and spat at the officers. Bryson shook his head. To him, it was obvious the man had provoked arrest, for the benefit of the news cameras. Bryson, 32, is business manager for Local 563 of the Laborers International Union, a second-generation union member and a North Dakotan. Moving the Bakken field shale oil to market by pipeline is safer and more efficient than moving it by rail, he said. It has created at least 3,000 good-paying jobs in the past couple of years and will provide maintenance work well into the future. From the beginning, Bryson has gone to observe the protests in this capital city of 67,000. People have put dirt into gas tanks of heavy machinery, smashed windshields and committed other acts of vandalism, reports confirmed by local police. He himself received an anonymous email that included a photo of himself, his wife and his three small children taken from his Facebook page and his home address. He turned it over to police. He is sympathetic to concerns about burial grounds and water purity but said that he thinks the project still can be completed safely and sensitively. Bryson said about 15 of his union members working on the pipeline were Standing Rock Sioux from the reservation. He kept his eyes on protesters and police outside the federal office building. One carried a gun for firing tear-gas canisters. A heavily armored SWAT vehicle sat a half-block away. The young woman, a waitress from Florida, chose kitchen duty, so Obom sent her to a nearby tent to help prepare meals. Obom arrived here in early November, driving 25 hours in her Dodge minivan from Olympia, Wash., to join a movement she had been monitoring on social media, which was making her increasingly upset. She is among thousands of other non-indigenous people from around the country and world who have been drawn to Standing Rock. They chop firewood, build tepees, pick up trash, paint protest banners, help with recycling and composting, and attend training sessions on indigenous rights. Obom was raised in North Carolina and Washington state, and both of her parents deployed to the Middle East in Operation Desert Storm. She was deeply influenced by her mother, who was an ardent environmentalist. She soon found a gift for organizing. Now she was sleeping on the hard-packed ground in her small REI tent, pitched next to the tepee and campfire of an indigenous family that had taken her in. He said that he has been hit with rocks fired from slingshots and chunks of firewood, and he has seen protesters pelting officers with bags of urine and feces. Own it. The square-shouldered, 6-foot-3 deputy works the overnight shift, which until August usually meant handling bar fights and traffic accidents. Now, the department is consumed with confronting pipeline protests, helped by police reinforcements from as far away as Louisiana. Protesters in Mandan, N.D., face off with police during a rally against plans to pass the Dakota Access Pipeline on Nov. 15. That night, police used fire hoses to douse protesters in subfreezing temperatures, sending several to the hospital. A 21-year-old woman suffered severe damage to her left arm. Protesters, and her family, said that she was hit with a concussion grenade, a weapon that creates a loud sound designed to disorient people. Police said that they do not use those devices and that the woman was probably injured by a propane tank the protesters were trying to use as an improvised explosive device. Each side accuses the other of lying about the incident. Moll, who said that he was hit on the helmet by a rock that night, defended the measures as justified. Moll spent his teenage years in Philadelphia, where his father entered the Lutheran seminary, and in Yonkers, N.Y., where his father preached. He graduated from Norwich University, a military school in Vermont, thinking that he would enlist in the military. But instead he gravitated back to the Midwest and enrolled in a North Dakota police academy.

Reindeer sausage. Dried Caribou and salmon. She and 13 other Native American women had carried that homemade food in coolers and boxes on a four-flight, 10-hour odyssey from their home in Arctic Village, Alaska. Gemmill came here in early November from her tiny village, 500 miles north of Anchorage, to join the encampment. She had seen news coverage of clashes between protesters and police and felt ill over what she considered another violent indignity against native people. Her solution: bring women. Since her early 20s, Gemmill has worked against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other areas, and she sees the Dakota Access Pipeline as a dangerous over-reliance on fossil fuels that is exacerbating climate change. Gemmill was born in Arctic Village, population 150, and raised in a culture of protecting natural resources. She returned home and started programs to make sure young people were aware of their heritage, and she quickly became a rising star in tribal efforts to protect the local environment. Gemmill said that she and the other Alaska women joined a recent protest on a local highway, where they sang and drummed and prayed. Some young men in the group walked onto land owned by the pipeline developers, and, she said, they were quickly surrounded by needlessly aggressive police who sprayed them with mace. Gemmill knows the political climate in the United States is shifting sharply against her, with the election of Trump, who has vowed to lift restrictions on oil and gas producers and who is invested in an oil company that has a 25 percent stake in the pipeline. Play Video Replay video or Read story Adrian Brown Foreman for a local excavating company Adrian Brown woke at 4:30 a.m. and pulled on his blaze-orange hoodie. Deer season was winding down, and he was itching to get his buck. But after five hours of tromping through the blustery prairie, he was ready for a mushroom and Swiss burger and a pile of fries. To get to the only restaurant out here, in St. Anthony, he and a buddy drove 15 miles down a gravel road, crossing over a 30-foot wide gash in the vast plains running straight as a ruler for as far as the eye could see. Brown, a burly, bearded 30-year-old in a black ball cap, said the increasing protests are costing local people money. He is a foreman for a local excavating company and said the day before, protesters tried to burn a truck on railroad tracks crossing the road to the gravel pit where he needed to pick up a load of rock. This is how these people support their families. Sitting in a restaurant with walls decorated with huge racks of antlers and other trophy heads, Brown said shipping shale oil by rail has overloaded lines and made it harder for farmers to get their wheat and other crops to market. Do it. I spend money at the gas station by the casino. I go to the casino. Police say about 93 percent of those arrested have been from outside North Dakota. Schools are being locked down.
