Wells Fargo is invested in the Dakota Access Pipeline. Sasja Beslik, head of sustainable finance at Nordea, one of the largest banks in Europe, recently traveled to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on a fact-finding mission. Originally from Bosnia, Beslik has seen his share of war and says that the Oceti Sakowin Camp reminded him of a war zone. The Standing Rock movement has brought a wave of financial rabble-rousing to the United States. He says activism aimed at banks is common in Europe. But the Standing Rock movement has brought a wave of financial rabble-rousing to the United States, and Beslik is just one of many people who believe it can strengthen the greater movement for divestment from fossil fuels, which is growing quickly. Think of divestment as the opposite of investment. By convincing firms to sell off stocks, bonds and other investment assets in companies involved in extracting fossil fuels, activists hope to make it more difficult for these companies to get financing. Nordea has holdings in three companies behind the Dakota Access pipeline: Energy Transfer Partners, Sunoco Logistics and Phillips 66. Nordea then sent Beslik to Standing Rock to meet with tribal representatives, including Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman David Archambault II. While there is widespread agreement on the goals of the divestment movement, advocates approach them differently. This week, Nordea came to a decision. The bank demanded that the companies behind DAPL reroute the oil pipeline so it does not pass near the reservation. Greenpeace regards this decision as significant. Its goal is not only to stop this pipeline completely but also others that imperil indigenous communities. While there is widespread agreement on the goals of the divestment movement, advocates approach them differently. Indeed, Standing Rock has set off campaigns focused on at least three major forms of divestment. First is the individual withdrawal of funds and bank account closures by tens of thousands of concerned citizens. Second is divestment by mutual funds and institutions, which sell off stocks and bonds invested in the companies. These banks can exit these agreements. That may sound like a lot, but the numbers are relative. He points to the Royal Bank of Scotland, which has issued a statement saying it did just that. Beslik says Nordea and other banks interested in responsible investing need more information to guide any divestments they make. Clark Williams-Derry, director of energy finance at the Sightline Institute, a sustainability think tank based in Seattle, agrees. Beslik thinks the movement needs to get better at doing this. Divestment activists should become more proactive in their strategies, he says, especially in regard to the financial, legal and analytical data they provide banks. Prior to coming to Standing Rock, he slogged through 20 hours of reading material provided by the companies behind the Dakota Access pipeline. He says he would love to see indigenous communities, NGOs and environmental organizations provide something comparable. Greenpeace USA spokesperson Mary Sweeters says a number of NGOs already do this kind of work, including Rainforest Action Network, Food & Water Watch and Bank Track. Greenpeace, too, has campaigners dedicated to engaging the finance sector. Money talks, and we need to make sure our dollars are saying the right thing. For example, Citibank has internal corporate responsibility policies on indigenous, human and environmental rights. These are based in part on the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet Citibank is a leader among the 38 banks offering credit to the Dakota Access pipeline companies. The role of Greenpeace is to put pressure on the banks to make sure they really do that. Indigenous financial advisers are joining the conversation, too. Instead, she says, the priority is to coordinate the divestment movement that rose up against the Dakota Access pipeline with larger, global divestment initiatives. Jamie Henn, a co-founder of the environmental group 350.org, agrees. And its successes are having an effect. Not surprisingly, the companies behind the pipeline oppose the strategy. She is also the creator of Catch the Sun, an organization which takes homeless children in Los Angeles into nature. website.
