Several weeks ago, law enforcement dealing with DAPL protests sent out a list of goods they could use if the community would like to donate them. The International Indigenous Youth Council saw that list and decided to use it as an opportunity for de-escalation. Lead by the council, demonstrators dropped off Gatorade, water, batteries, breakfast bars and more. The teens said they wanted the police to know they have compassion for all people and all walks of life. Water Protectors offer these donations to the Morton County officers in generosity and compassion, despite the aggression and hostility they have shown innocent unarmed Protectors of this camp. Despite this excessive financial support, Morton County officers are asking taxpayers to donate supplies. The Oceti Sakowin camp is a prayer camp, and a resilient, self-sufficient community. Oceti Sakowin has enough to share. Bookmark the permalink. Leave a comment. account. Notify me of new posts via email.
