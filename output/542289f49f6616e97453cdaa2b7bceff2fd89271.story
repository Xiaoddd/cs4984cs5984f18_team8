Dozens of different tribes have gathered at a protest camp near the pipeline construction site in North Dakota, which has led to occasional clashes with police and security guards. Several arrests have been made, with journalist Amy Goodman issued with a warrant after she went to the camp to report on the protests. In total, the pipeline will make 200 river crossings, including the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, in four states. The US army corp of engineers, which has jurisdiction over pipelines that cross major waterways, approved the Dakota Access plan despite warnings from the Environmental Protection Agency that leaking oil could pollute the rivers. The pipeline was originally meant to run near the city of Bismarck, which has an overwhelmingly white population, before objections resulted in it being relocated to a site near Native American land. The bottom line for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe is and will always be protecting our lands, people, water and sacred sites from the devastation of this pipeline.
