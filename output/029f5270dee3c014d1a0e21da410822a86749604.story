Published by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and the Sightline Institute, it spotlights a potential economic weakness of the project: the January 1 deadline by which Energy Transfer Partners had promised oil companies it would have completed construction. Missing the January 1 deadline opens up the possibility the pipeline company may lose its contracts with oil companies. This is viewer supported news. Please do your part today. Michael Vendiola a member of the Swinomish Indian tribal community. Copy may not be in its final form. We refuse to be silent community members in your decision to support the destructive fossil fuel economy, in general, and the Dakota Access pipeline, in particular. It spotlights a potential economic weakness of the project: the January 1st deadline by which Energy Transfer Partners had promised oil companies it would have completed construction. Missing the January 1st deadline opens up the possibility the pipeline company may lose its contracts with oil companies. It kept rising and rising. And all the forecasts said that oil prices were going to remain high and that oil production in North Dakota was going to remain robust. But almost as soon as the companies signed up its first set of shippers, the first commitments from oil companies to ship through the pipeline, you started to see oil markets collapse. And as that happened, oil companies in North Dakota started to pull back. A lot of them were starting to lose money from some of their oil projects in the Bakken region in North Dakota. And so, what you started to see is a decline in production. There have already been a bunch of pipelines built and approved. The extra capacity of the Dakota Access pipeline just may not be necessary. And that poses a real risk for the company. The company really depends on those contracts. You can actually imagine that some of the oil shippers might be thinking, well, you know, with production down, with prices down, maybe this would be a great time to pull back from our commitments to the pipeline. And, in fact, I think the investors in those companies should be encouraging the oil shippers to pull back, to take a second look and to think about whether it makes sense for the long run. AMY GOODMAN: Michael Vendiola, you were one of the organizers of the Wells Fargo protest on Saturday. On Sunday, the decision came down by the Obama administration, the Army Corps of Engineers, to deny the easement under the Missouri. MICHAEL VENDIOLA: Sure. So, this is just another so-called agreement that is put forth, which could be turned over as soon as another president comes in. MICHAEL VENDIOLA: Yes, our action this past Saturday was against Wells Fargo. We have a list of 17 banks that are investors within the Energy Transfer Partnerships and putting the Dakota Access pipeline together. MICHAEL VENDIOLA: Right. You know, that looks to be the West Coast version of DAPL. And really, we were working on providing testimony. Michael Vendiola, thank you for joining us.
