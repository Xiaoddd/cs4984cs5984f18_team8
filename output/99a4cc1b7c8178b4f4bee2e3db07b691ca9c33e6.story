Jan 26, 2017 Why Standing Rock is Fundamental for the Resistance. That this was one of his very first acts as president of the United States is no coincidence. Donald Trump and his team recognize the symbolic significance at stake in Standing Rock. This photo essay is a call for us all to understand why the resistance to the pipeline in Standing Rock is more crucial than ever. It is bigger than one site or one community because its here where the ideologies being aggressively pushed by Republican leaders clearly converge. Energy Transfer Partners, the corporation behind the pipeline, suggests the project will lead to greater economic development and increased efficiency compared to the railroads that currently transport the crude oil. As the protests swelled, water protectors were attacked by heavily armed police from Morton County. Yet, as the repression grew, the people stood resilient and the symbolic power of the struggle continued to grow. At this point we felt we had to go. We needed to support this movement and work to spread its message and report on what was happening on the ground. We were told by friends and fellow supporters to drive up through the south as opposed to the main road through Bismarck. Instead, we went in through Aberdeen, a couple of miles south of the camp. Hundreds of flags representing nations and movements adorned the makeshift road that led us in. We arrived at the beautiful, bitterly cold reservation only days before the announced eviction date. Beyond the Sioux nation and numerous other tribes represented at the camp, supporters continued to pour in from every corner of the country, and the world. We immediately heard the helicopters circling the camp throughout the day, in attempts to intimidate the protestors. The Indigenous Environmental Network handled the film permits. In trying to assure that our time there was as productive as possible, we had been communicating with them about coming to produce a piece. Clearly, we were not the only ones. The Sioux opened each day with prayer and while everyone in the camp was invited, absolutely no cameras were allowed. The kitchens served free meals to anyone who needed it. Folks were busy securing tents and windshields. Organizers kept track and registered newcomers. We spent our days filming, helping out in whatever way we could, and trying to stay warm. The conditions were already harsh when we arrived and it only got colder. Yet, people kept arriving. At least one thousand veterans arrived the day after we did (we heard that in total there were well over two thousand veterans in Standing Rock), committed to supporting and shielding the water protectors. As we reflected on what moved them to make the trip in the first place, it became clear that, like us, they were moved by a formidable sense of justice, an unshakable feeling that we were standing on the right side of history. In 2010, a single pipeline spill poured one million gallons of toxic bitumen crude oil into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. And in January of 2015, more than 50,000 gallons of Bakken crude oil spilled into the Yellowstone River in Montana. It was the second such spill in that area since 2011. When Michigan Governor Snyder took office in 2011, he rapidly pushed a multi-billion dollar tax break for corporations through the Republican legislature. Less tax revenues, translated into cutting costs in pensions, education, and infrastructure. He invoked executive privilege to take over cities by replacing the elected mayors and city councils with his own appointees. Cut services to save money. A largely black and brown community now faces the disproportionate effects of systemic neglect. Few question that the crisis would have been handled differently if it happened in a white suburb outside of Detroit. We were not the first to discern the clear parallels between what is happening at Standing Rock and Flint, Michigan. The mobilization of thousands of veterans from the armed forces speaks volumes. Their declaration as protectors against enemies foreign and domestic reflects a clear indignation with a system many of them have risked their lives to protect, but which now seems to serve the interests of a select group. And as the day of the eviction approached it was these veterans who offered to serve as human shields for the protectors back in Standing Rock. We felt the tension and unease. Then, unexpectedly, the Obama Administration intervened and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers legally blocked the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, denying it the required easement to drill beneath the Missouri River. There were tears of joy and sighs of relief, but the native leaders knew that this was only the beginning. And, of course, they were right. Today, Donald Trump signed executive actions to advance approval of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines. But just as Standing Rock has come to symbolize a greater struggle, so has the Trump presidency come to symbolize something much greater. On the one hand, a Trump presidency signifies an emboldened resurgence of the more outright champions of white supremacist ideology, which has given rise to an increase in racist attacks, and could result in virulent anti-immigrant, xenophobic legislation as well as a critical backtrack to the gains of the civil rights movement and the rights of Indigenous Nations. On the other hand, the Trump presidency appears set to secure, cement and bulletproof the continued privilege and dominance of the super-wealthy minority. One look at his cabinet and this becomes painfully clear. Standing Rock stands out to us because it confronts the ideologies so clearly represented by Trump and his cronies: white supremacy and wealth domination. And although folks will cringe at hearing this, these two ideologies lie deep within the building blocks of this country. Sadly, it takes the Standing Rocks, the Flints, and Fergusons of the country to unveil them. It is clear that the Trump administration will continue to support the DAPL while investors wait to see how long it takes him to reverse the decision. The Sioux hope that the battle over the environmental impact assessment will stall the pipeline long enough that investors will pull out of the deal. If not, they have made it clear they are ready to continue fighting to protect their rights, their land, and their water. We hope the rest of us are too. At Human Pictures we thus recognize and celebrate Standing Rock as not only a catalyst of a new environmental movement that is supportive of indigenous peoples, but as a symbol of numerous ongoing struggles across the world that reject profit as the driver of history and which present different models that allow us to move forward driven by principles of justice, dignity and harmony with our planet. In our efforts, we will continue to highlight connections across these movements and shed light on the struggles where we can all gather strength in the years to come.
