Handcuffed and wearing orange and white stripes, she sat with her three attorneys before District of North Dakota Chief Judge Daniel Hovland appeared to discuss details of the plea agreement she signed Sunday. At her change of plea hearing Monday, Fallis pleaded guilty to felony counts of civil disorder and possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon. Under conditions of her plea agreement, federal prosecutors will move to dismiss the most serious charge of her indictment, discharge of a firearm in relation to a felony crime of violence, and recommend no more than seven years at sentencing, as well as no fine or restitution. From here, Hovland told Fallis she will undergo a pre-sentence investigation with a federal probation officer in the weeks ahead. She could be sentenced as early as April or May; however, her attorneys will discuss a sentencing hearing date to be determined, possibly in mid-May or June. Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary Delorme said he may call no more than one or two witnesses at sentencing. Hovland said she was unaccounted for an entire day from the halfway house where she has resided since October. She said her time on pretrial release has allowed her to better her life, from GED testing to diet and exercise to volunteerism. She was accused of firing a handgun as officers arrested her during protest activity against the Dakota Access Pipeline in southern Morton County in October 2016. Your notification has been saved.
