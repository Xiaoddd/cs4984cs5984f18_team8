The attack used a large number of attacking IPs where each IP generated a huge number of these attacks. It is the largest, most aggressive breach to date, with over 14.1 million brute force attempts per hour. With more than 87 million sites worldwide, WordPress is the leading CMS of the internet. But being a leader in your space doesn't come without its pitfalls. many site developers disable the automatic update feature because it could impact their site's design and function. Simply purchasing a WordPress site isn't enough to protect your data. Users have to buy WordPress security plugins and installs from third-party companies to not only protect their site, but stay updated on new vulnerabilities. So every time there is a security threat or a big fix, those updates are not completed on a set timeline. is a centralized CMS, which means all of our updates are quickly deployed at once to every site we power. We often deploy multiple updates every day. security is one of the many reasons RebelMouse is the best CMS. Keep reading...

When we were acquired by AOL in 2011, I inherited 53 properties built on dozens of different content management systems. It wasn't long after that I soon realized they were all built by IT people who didn't fully grasp the concepts of traffic and distribution. It went viral with eight million users worldwide. The viral success made me realize that there wasn't a CMS to bring it all together, yet. I am extremely proud of the powerful product we've created. RebelMouse was built to solve the complex intersection of product, engineering, editorial, and revenue. A lot of the time it's because they're bogged down with a clunky CMS like WordPress. We're all trying to publish and make money in a competitive industry that's always changing. But to be frank, WordPress isn't keeping up with the industry fast enough. WordPress is a decentralized model that requires every platform update to be completed independently. Every time there's a security threat, the core developers at WordPress must deploy patches in the form of product updates. From there, it's up to the managing developers of each individual site to deploy and configure around these updates to avoid breaking custom code and plugins. And this happens a lot. we operate on a centralized model, every update on our platform is updated at one time, and sometimes multiple times a day. Usually our clients never notice the difference. this doesn't mean our platform is closed off by any means. We started out on the cutting edge of social in 2012, and stayed close to the heart of digital publishing ever since. That's why our clients don't get a stagnant software platform like WordPress. Instead, they get a full-service creative agency full of content optimization specialists, social media gurus, and monetization experts. From there, we restructure your content strategy so you can see results at scale. The RebelMouse CMS has the tools to help you optimize each post for SEO. The industry let intrusive ads take over the internet, and now we're all left cleaning up the mess and re-prioritizing user experiences to get users back and make them stick. When we launched Axios on our new Social UX for Media layout in 2017, it mimicked the social feeds to drive more pageviews, engagement, and user satisfaction. Luckily, it's something we've been working to perfect since we launched our CMS in 2012. This is why dynamic distribution is so important in order to succeed in today's digital world. Using proprietary technology, Discovery enables you to identify key pages and profiles that could be interested in sharing your content. And through varying levels of social outreach, you can repurpose and share content from your Discovery findings in a way that validates the original message of those influencers. sharing cycle has led to the success of some of our biggest clients. If that's true, you may still view content on your website and in social feeds as two different entities you have to control and manage. Entry Editor isn't simply a way to publish articles. It's a full-blown toolset for content creators. Before each piece of content is pushed live, it can be optimized for design, social, and SEO. writers, editors, creators, and community deserve tools that make them fast and efficient. CMS operates on a data-driven product cycle. Our testing includes how each version affects pagespeed and user experience. We also take big data and distill it into easy-to-consume insights that you can quickly act upon. addition, we have a deep Google Analytics integration, so you can easily add in components, promos, third-party units, and ad units. Let's create something together. Keep reading... Show less Shifting Culture Through the New Media Landscape The media landscape has changed quite a bit since President Trump took office. While this has been tough to digest personally, it has made me realize more clearly what RebelMouse is as a company: Contagious media with a cultural impact. We aren't just a technology company. We have a platform, and it's growing with each new site we create. But it's about more than technology. We have values that drive us and shape and lead our culture. Last year, I closed our NYC office in the SoHo neighborhood. I hate offices. Instead, we have a global distributed team of geniuses. Everyone is creative and everyone's role is bordered with blurred lines. We plan to lead as an example. Together, we can shift culture (which has never been more malleable) through the media landscape. We can do it together by working together on issues like gender fluidity. Right now, the right is winning and the left is caught behind again. We can turn that around and change the world. We can shape the landscape back to a modern message. It's a game that's winnable. No more single sources; it's time for a change. We're rethinking the role that websites play in today's dynamic infoscape. The feed has dominated social media for years now, but the website has never caught up. Now, RebelMouse gives you the toolset to not only distribute your content across platforms, but also ensure that users can easily move across platforms too. We call it Social UX for Media, and it's an absolute game changer.
