I am an actor and activist. I have had the privlege to join the water protectors at Standing Rock in their fight to protect water. We say Mni Wiconi, water is life, because without water, life is simply impossible. Our water is threatened by pipelines transporting tar sands and crude oil. Pipelines are known for their proclivity to leak and cause environmental disaster. There are over 500 indigneous peoples from all around the world standing in solidarity with their brothers and sisters to protect the land and the wilderness. There are also environmental advocates and activists camped with them. We believe that the Dakota Pipeline is a threat to all life and all peoples. While at Standing Rock, I had the opportunity to meet and work with several camps at Standing Rock, including many of the tribal elders of and leaders. Certain camps are well-funded, others are not. Their lives depend on our support. It is freezing cold. On the gorund, non-violent protectors have been shot at with rubber bullets, concussion grenades, tear gas and water cannons mixed with mace. It is horryfying. Many are staying in traditional tipees and camping tents. Their only refuge is the warmth of a small fire. I am setting up this general fund in order to allocate funds to the causes and camps that need money the most. I am in constant contact with a number of tribal members and activists currently on the ground. I intend to have utter tranparency as to where these funds will be allocated. There are men and women who are putting their lives and livelihoods on the line for us all that we may seek a better future for the next generation, our grandchildren and our planet. We need immediate support. Lives are on the line. Please search your heart to support these protectors and share this message. You're keeping protectors safe and warm.
