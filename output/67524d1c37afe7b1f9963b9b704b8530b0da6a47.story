When I read your history, I can see myself and my people reflected in yours. I feel in my core that your fight is my fight, and that I am not alone in the battle against injustice. My ancestors were not the only ones who lived in Palestine. Jews, Christians and Arabs all lived side by side in my country. And they suffered the same fate as your people. We know what you know: that our land is sacred. More than 10,000 others were massacred. Palestine today is just 22 percent of our original homeland. Like your reservations, they are characterized by high rates of unemployment, poverty and suicide. In Gaza, where I live, only 10 percent of our water supply is drinkable due to the conditions in which we must live. And yet no one regards whites as all the same. Like yours, our resistance has been labeled as acts of terrorism and violence rather than as a fight for survival and dignity. It gives us strength to go on with our own struggle. As a Palestinian in Gaza, I have grown up feeling detached from the rest of the world as Israel tightens its decade-long blockade. I am sure many of you feel the same way. But we are not isolated. Sincerely, Israa Suliman We Are Not Numbers About Israa Suliman Israa Suliman, 20, is an English literature student at the Islamic University of Gaza. She is crazy about three things: cats, the Gaza sea and writing. Other posts by Israa Suliman. Yes, the struggles of the Palestinians are the struggles of the native Americans, of blacks, of Arabs and Muslims, of women and of all other marginalized and oppressed groups here and around the world. When it does, when all of these groups come together from having seen the commonality of their struggles, true justice for all WILL be secured, for the rich and powerful will not be able to resist such an all-powerful force.

The more Palestinians work with them, the easier it will be for Americans to emerge from the cultivated media narrative of victimization of Israelis.

The difference between American indigenous, and indeed indigenous in all other countries pretty much, and Indigenous in UN mandated Israel and Occupied Palestine is that it is only the latter who do not have full and equal rights as citizens and who remain under colonial military rule.
