Five years later, the eye had gone about blind, was diagnosed as malignant cancerous ocular melanoma, and I was given only 8 months to live by leading eye doctors at both UCLA Stein Eye Institute and the USC Downey Eye Institute unless I had immediate surgery to remove the left eye. Even if I were to have had that surgery, my chance to avoid death would be only fifty percent, and for five years only. Even though I am not well off enough to do retirement, even at my age 85, and natural cures are only for the well off and retired, and workforce me could not kick back with a full Gerson diet and protocol with therapy, but I have gone for the diet and whatever of the protocol I could afford and manage, and I am not dead yet after a couple decades. However, I continued teaching part-time until a couple years ago, when we moved here to rural Kula, where our landlord has provoked grand mal epilepsy seizures in my body, every time he has sprayed Monsanto RoundUp weed killer. We are looking desperately for another place to live on expensive rental Maui to escape my potential extermination with the weeds. Since I am blind in my left eye from my terminal ocular melanoma and uncertain from my grand mal epilepsy, I no longer drive and depend on my family here for transportation and access to work and people and bed and meals. My son has been given my 1995 Mercedes which has been sitting in our driveway many weeks but has only stashed stuff and left trash in it, including a nest of hornets still living there, encountered in my short-sleeved Aloha shirt and short pants, as I broke open their home as I opened the stuck old car door, sitting down in their swarming midst, getting several dozen stings all over my legs and arms, disabling me completely for several days, and making us wonder if I would make it Still, with all the natural healing, today my stings are better, and I am better again, and only the itching all up and down my arms and legs has continued a bit maddening, but a good earth mix coating finally has soothed it, but then the itching came back, and I soothed with aloe vera, and the itch came back, and I soothed with CD herb mix, and the itch came back, and God has continued kind enough to not pick me a sub teacher job to tempt me foolishly this morning. What finally pretty much purged the itch was my taking five cascara sagrada laxative herb capsules in one day to cleanse my intestine. And our kids have researched on the internet and found that hornet venom is reported to kill human cancer cells. And I only got the venom in me because our kid was sloppy, like all the kids, no matter what. And only survive the venom because my body is full of their natural supplements and healing. I am grateful for the love of my family. I have gone to work successfully four days in the past week. Gaining strength.
