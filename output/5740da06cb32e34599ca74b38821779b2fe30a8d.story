Citibank is a key investor in the Dakota Access Pipeline, part of a sickly web of extractivist industry stretching across the entire Midwest, and whose expansion has of late happily encountered fierce resistance from indigenous and non-indigenous warriors determined to stomp out its poisonous impact on their lives. We took this small and simple action to send a greeting to our friends, but also to our enemies. To all DAPL-financiers, you may read this as a warning: disinvest in the pipeline now, or it will remain open season on your offices, homes, and projects.
