Considering the fragility of the lives of Native Americans in the U.S., the people with the most severe health problems in the nation, we are talking about real destruction of both health and livelihood here at the hands of Big Oil. This is in keeping with a legacy connected to genocide that began 500 years ago against the Indigenous of this hemisphere. The destructive and murderous train set in motion centuries ago continues to run, this time with Judge Boasberg as conductor and his Oct. 11 ruling that the Dakota Access Pipeline could continue to pump oil pending an environmental review by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sued the Corps in July, 2016 contending that the pipeline destroyed sacred Indigenous sites and threatens the water quality of the Standing Rock Reservation that sits only a half-mile or less from where the pipeline crosses the Missouri River in North Dakota. The Tribe has consistently filed motions to stop the flow of oil while litigation is ongoing. In the latest round of courtroom battles DAPL claimed that a pipeline shutdown would cause a major economic downturn. It was originally anticipated that the study would be completed by December, 2017. The Justice Department indicated it would take longer than expected to obtain spill modeling information from Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the Texas-based developer that owns DAPL. Obviously, ETP is in no hurry to provide that information. The longer the process, the more this works in favor of the oil company. The Corps now anticipates that the review and analysis will not be completed until April 2, 2018. What a windfall for ETP, as it will rake in millions of dollars in the meantime from the deadly pipeline. How convenient for DAPL when the judge chimed in a few days later, on Oct. 11, and confirmed that the oil can flow in the meantime. Consistently, Boasberg remains in the ideological hip pocket of the rapacious oil industry. To recount this sordid trajectory of judicial misfeasance keep in mind that in June , 2017 Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the initial approval of DAPL failed to adequately consider its environmental consequences. The court ruled that the Army Corps had not fully complied with the environmental review laws before issuing permits to cross the Missouri River. It was expected that the judge would reach a decision sometime in September. Boasberg, who has been noted for stalling in this case, issued another determination on Oct. 11, agreeing with Energy Transfer Partners, that the pipeline should remain in operation and that the oil should continue to flow. From a legal perspective, standard procedure is that in such an operation the flow of oil would be stopped by the court pending the additional environmental analysis. But, lickspittle, bootlicking Boasberg has turned the system upside down in order to wallow in the slimy muck of injustice with Big Oil. Never mind that this is environmental disaster for the Indigenous of Standing Rock, never mind that the health problems of the Standing Rock Sioux will only be perilously exacerbated by the infamous pipeline as Boasberg carries on the work of the oil profiteers. Oil will continue to flow if this rogue jurist has his way. And they want it with tribal input. Or will he simply wait until April with his characteristic foot-dragging deliberation.
