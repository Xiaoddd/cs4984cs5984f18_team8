Vandalism in two states A sheriff in Iowa said there was an incident of vandalism earlier this month on the pipe at an above-ground safety valve. Someone used a torch on a section of pipe that is above-ground, a sheriff in Iowa said. His department is running extra patrols near the site and six others, which are fenced in. The company believes the vandalism occurred between March 3 and 13, the sheriff said. There was a similar incident in South Dakota. Chief Deputy Chad Brown of the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office told an energy reporter for the Duluth (North Dakota) News Tribune that someone apparently used a torch on a pipe at a valve site near Sioux Falls. The incident happened between March 15 and 17, Brown told the newspaper. Dakota Access says in its court filing that the attacks will not stop the filling of the pipeline with oil.
