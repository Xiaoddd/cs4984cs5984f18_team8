This breaking news signals a victory for the water protectors movement and the unity and prayer of Indigenous peoples who have taken the lead in protecting water for future generations. What has emerged through this experience has shed light on the injustice embedded within state development policy. The fight for our water is tied to the fight for protecting all that is sacred. Protecting ancient burials, sacred sites help us protect our water. Standing up to Indian mascots, offensive logos and cultural appropriation helps us to fight against exploitative projects. All of these themes are present right here in Texas. There is still much to be done. Natives stand against the mine because it threatens to pollute the Rio Grande River, which affects thousands of people. At the time, the corporation running the mine, North American Coal Company (NACC), denied the presence of any burials. It is common for archaic burials to be found in large numbers and while we are now in possession of evidence of at least one burial, we are suspicious of the authorities in granting us our rightful information for the remainder of the site. The dishonesty by Dos Republicas, NACC, the Texas state authorities and the USACE have operated in unison to deny the rights of the Native peoples of Texas to free and fair consultation. To our knowledge, there has been no further testing or excavation since the time of this report. However, there has been a commencement of mining in the area. Desecration of sacred sites is not unique to Eagle Pass, unfortunately as has been uncovered recently with two pipelines currently under construction in West Texas. The Trans Pecos Pipeline (TPPL) and Comanche Trails Pipeline are both owned by Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) the company behind DAPL, and they threaten some of the most historic places for Natives in Texas. According to local news source, The Van Horn Advocate: The TPPL will cut a 143 mile-swath through the last vestige of wilderness in Texas desecrating as many as one ancient Native American site per square mile of its path. The Trap Springs archeological site, a very recent and significant find is in imminent danger of being bulldozed despite evidence of at least 5,000 years of occupation and a pending nomination as a State Archeological Landmark. Further west, Comanche Trail Pipeline cuts through Hueco Tanks, possibly the most remarkable archeological site in Texas. Hundreds of pictographs and thousands of artifacts including pottery and burial sites cover the Hueco Tanks state park and surrounding area. This land has been used for ongoing ceremony for a diverse array of indigenous peoples including the Mescalero Apache, Kiowa, Tigua, Comanche and Xicanxs of El Paso. Exports are driving the current expansion of oil and gas infrastructure throughout South Texas. Much of this fracking boon connects at three proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals in South Padre Island. The Garcia Pasture site contains an indigenous cemetery, an ancient village and numerous nomadic artifacts, all threatened along with the beach, the bay and the local economy. All of this destruction and the gross disrespect paid to the sacred nature of burial grounds, life-giving sources of water or cultural and historic remains may come as a surprise. When we look deeper, we find that there is no mistake being made by the companies and no benefit of the doubt to give them. Their disrespect is calculated, and deep. Reminiscent of the infamous Washington Football team logo, this logo carries more negative implications than mere cultural appropriation. They have been used at various times in the colonial period and in later U.S. history to designate a place where whole bodies, heads and later scalps of Indian people (men, women and children) could be brought in for bounty payment. The bounty practice is one reason why many American Indian people are so opposed to the use of these logos. We can add mining company to the list of things that should not be by signified by a severed Indian head; and we can add to this narrative the aspect of grave robbery and bounty payment. Theft of Native land is a trophy for settler colonial society as it symbolizes domination over the land and native peoples. The present case at Dos Republicas brings these themes together, as land, bodies and images are all taken from native peoples in a single act of destruction. Recently Apache Corporation has acquired vast oil reserves, which threaten sacred Apache sites, including Balmorhea in West Texas. ETP also share a corporate headquarters with Chief Oil and Gas, another severed head oil company. It is no accident that these companies overlay multiple expressions of anti-Indianness. However, focusing on the details of the procedure misses the reality of how state processes generally work and why and how they are so racist. The consultation process is already overwhelmingly pro-extractive capitalism and consistently and publicly admits to hold an abstract economic benefit over the wellbeing of land and people. Said process is even less likely to recognize or respect Indigenous land, culture or life. The consultation process, or lack there of, is a continuation of a colonial relationship between the settler state and Native peoples. The destructive development in Eagle Pass, West Texas and North Dakota demonstrates how colonial society justifies its own expansion by devaluing indigenous land and culture. State parks such as Hueco Tanks and Big Bend are unlikely to remain protected while Kelcy Warren, ETP CEO, sits on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission. The government is not on our side. It took great sacrifice to earn a victory in North Dakota, and even this win is tenuous. It will be up to the people to come together to defend our water for future generations. The Army Corp of Engineers told them to stop months ago and they ripped up burial grounds anyway. DAPL is expected to continue despite the lack of easement. They will pay fines after they are through destroying the land and river. No big deal to them. Standing Rock is not standing down. The only reason this came today is because over 5,000 veterans are due to show up by tomorrow. This fight is not over and even if it was in North Dakota, there is a whole nation out there that is dealing with pipeline ruptures.
