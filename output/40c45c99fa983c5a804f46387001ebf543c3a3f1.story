Nation Dec 10, 2016 1:08 PM EDT In the standoff over the Dakota Access Pipeline, neither side is calling it quits after a recent decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to halt a final leg of the project in order to research alternate routes. The Army Corps on Sunday refused to grant the permit needed to build a section of the pipeline under the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, a decision that the tribe celebrated as a victory. The agency ordered that alternate routes be explored. Large crowds of demonstrators set up camp near the proposed route in August, refusing to leave until the project is stopped. Some protesters took shelter in local casino resorts after blizzards blew through the main encampment. Archambault has said that protesters should vacate the main encampment as North Dakota grows colder this winter. A federal court could still rule in favor of Energy Transfer Partners, ordering the Army Corps to grant a permit for the pipeline. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama could designate the federal land near the Missouri River a national monument, forcing Energy Transfer Partners to find another route. But it is unclear whether he has any plans to do so. Trump has already appointed Scott Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. She said that will benefit Native Americans living in areas with abundant natural resources. The company behind the pipeline and other investors are also continuing their fight. Some protesters plan to remain at the pipeline camp, despite tribal council leaders advising them to go home. Others are focusing on how the recent protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline could be replicated elsewhere. Native and environmental groups are protesting the expansion of the Alberta Clipper pipeline, which the State Department approved in 2009 and spans 1,000 miles from Hardisty, Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin. Protesters say the construction will harm the production of wild rice on tribal land. A separate project, the Trans Mountain pipeline, owned by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, has proposed a new expansion that critics say could endanger nearby lakes. Kinder Morgan aims to begin construction on the pipeline by 2017 and complete it by 2019. In October, climate change activists tried to shut off pipelines in five places in the U.S. One of the protesters, Ken Ward, was arrested and charged with criminal trespass and burglary after he went live on Facebook while he closed a safety valve of the Trans Mountain pipeline, owned by Enbridge. Ward said his actions were in solidarity with Standing Rock. Support Provided By: Learn more Educate your inbox. Thanks for subscribing. Please check your inbox to confirm your email address.
