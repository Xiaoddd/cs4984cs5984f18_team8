Energy and Environment Trump seeks to revive Dakota Access, Keystone XL oil pipelines By Steven Mufson and Steven Mufson Reporter covering energy and other financial matters Email Bio Follow Juliet Eilperin Juliet Eilperin Reporter covering national affairs Email Bio Follow January 24, 2017 Anti-pipeline protesters rallied outside the White House on Jan. 24, after President Trump signed executive orders to revive the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. Many activists traveled to Washington, D.C., from Standing Rock, where they had been camping out for months in opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline. Many are statutory and the legislation that created them cannot be swept aside by an executive order. Trump said that both pipeline projects would be subject to renegotiation. In an Oval Office signing before reporters, the president hinted at a possible new wrinkle. He said he would want any new projects to make use of American steel, though that requirement is not mentioned in his executive order. The orders will likely have an immediate impact in North Dakota, where the pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners wants to complete the final 1,100-foot piece of the 1,172-mile pipeline route that runs under Lake Oahe. The pipeline would carry oil from the booming shale oil reserves in North Dakota to refineries and pipeline networks in Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other Native American groups have been protesting the project, which they say would imperil their water supplies and disturb sacred burial and archaeological sites. The Army Corp of Engineers called a halt to the project in December to consider alternative routes. The tribe is expected to return to court in a bid to block the project. The camp is in a flood plain, and heavy snow could pose dangers when it starts melting. TransCanada, the Calgary-based project owner, has said it would be interested in reviving the pipeline. Originally, TransCanada had planned to get about 65 percent of the steel pipe from U.S. manufacturers but other supplies from Canada. We build the pipelines, we want to build the pipe. President Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to revive the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. During the daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer discussed the timeline for the Keystone XL pipeline project. (Reuters) As news of the move surfaced Tuesday morning, oil industry officials hailed it as overdue. Environmentalists, by contrast, vowed to continue to fight the two pipelines. Americans have tended to favor the Keystone XL project even as Obama rejected it. Earlier Post-ABC surveys found that Americans widely expected the project to create a significant amount of jobs, but that they were divided on whether it would pose a significant environmental risk.
