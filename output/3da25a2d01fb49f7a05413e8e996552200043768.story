Police and private security forces outfitted in riot gear and armed with assault weapons have unleashed dogs, pepper spray and rubber bullets on peaceful Native Americans and their allies. Overzealous law enforcement officials in North Dakota have jailed journalists and celebrities who were exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech and the press by documenting police attacks on protesters. These actions are a serious affront to the Constitution and sovereign tribal rights and are an egregious abuse of power by the police and government in order to protect the fossil fuel industry. Tell North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple and the U.S. Department of Justice: Stop police abuse and protect the Constitution, not the fossil fuel industry. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and members of over 200 other tribes from across the Americas are leading the resistance to protect sovereign land and drinking water from destruction by the fossil fuel industry. However, in an attempt to quell these historic nonviolent protests, Gov. Dalrymple ordered a state of emergency that has militarized the police force, set up a highway roadblock and mobilized the National Guard to intimidate protesters. Her reporting went viral, with over 14 million people on Facebook and millions more through the mainstream media viewing her reporting. Tell North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple and the U.S. Department of Justice: Stop police abuse and protect the Constitution, not the fossil fuel industry. Based on the reports, it appears that government officials are attempting to intimidate indigenous people resisting the pipeline and silence the press from spreading the word. The injustices perpetrated by the government and the fossil fuel industry against journalists, Native peoples and their allies are an unacceptable assault on the First Amendment. We must stand with them now and ensure their constitutional rights to assemble and report are fully protected. Tell Gov. Dalrymple and the DoJ: Stop police abuse and protect the Constitution, not the fossil fuel industry. Thanks for all you do. 2016. 2016.
