We would not trigger events, but we would respond by growing the rapid-response list and demanding that any new AG protect the investigation and that Congress pass the Mueller protection legislation. These events are only the first step. Together, we will communicate unmistakably that this is not okay and that this act to undermine democracy is not going to be allowed to become a new normal. Congress is the only body with the constitutional power and responsibility to hold a president politically accountable for major violations of the public trust like this. Certainly, everyone at an event should also call their member of Congress to demand action. And everyone is encouraged to communicate that demand directly at congressional offices. Demand the creation of a modern-day version of the Senate Select Watergate Committee to investigate all matters involved in the Russia scandals and Trump's abuse of power and obstruction of justice. Demand bipartisan hearings in the House Judiciary Committee on obstruction of justice and abuse of power. Some groups will call these the first steps to impeachment hearings; others will not. Impeaching Donald Trump is not a demand shared by all partner organizations. Nor is supporting impeachment a prerequisite to attend these events. We can all be for the three things above if some of us are also for additional things, such as impeachment. Powered by MoveOn takes your privacy seriously. Take a look at our Privacy Policy.
