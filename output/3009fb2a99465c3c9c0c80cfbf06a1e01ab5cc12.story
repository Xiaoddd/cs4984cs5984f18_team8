In all of this time, sacred burial grounds and concern for alternative water intake sources were never raised by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Some facts: The pipeline is not near any sacred tribal lands. The pipeline is not on Native American property. The pipeline company tried many, many times to meet with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. For over seven years, the tribe never felt this project was important enough to participate in the planning. Standing Rock is now home to an estimated 4,000 protesters. The occupy-style protest continues to expand as the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline grows increasingly popular as a topic among mainstream news outlets. I know that there are many honest, patriotic people who have put their heart into the fight at Standing Rock. Their motivation in most cases was pure. This situation is no different than the many honest people who protested against the police involved shooting of Mike Brown in Ferguson, MO or the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, MD. In each case (and there are many others like these) the Globalist controlled media used a false narrative to stir emotions, generate anger and cause riots. Mike Brown assaulted Darren Wilson, tried to take his service weapon (resulting in its discharge) and then tried to attack him again. The death of Freddie Gray was a tragic accident and the media knew it. These too are simply fabricated false narratives perpetuated by the media. Globalist greed requires control. The loss of the most recent election to a nationalist (Donald Trump) has caused the Globalists to redirect all of their efforts to his destruction; even if it requires the destruction of our economy to achieve the goal. It is also important to point out that like the Black Lives Matter movement; the Indigenous Rising movement seeks to drive deep wedges between the protesters and local law enforcement. The Globalists know that federalization of the police and diminishing the authority of local police and sheriffs is critical to their success. The protesters have blocked entrances to businesses and banks. They have also blocked critical roads and highways. The way this works is as follows: Find a cause; racial, environmental or social. While President Obama is in office, these initiatives have been supported by his administration (Black Lives Matter, the plight of the illegal aliens, Islamic terrorism, safe-cities, sanctuary cities, climate change, etc.). Because of the outcome of the most recent election, federal government supported divide and conquer cannot be the final step in the sequence. It has two main targets; banking and commerce. The protests in Portland Oregon have focused damage on the retail sector. It works. This approach is very efficient and has already caused banks invested in the project to lose customers and deposits. Standing Rock is the prototype. With Hillary Clinton as President, our out-of-control spending would have led to our need to seek financial assistance from the Globalist masters. Under Hillary Clinton, Our acceptance of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement would have ensured that a European Union like control mechanism would be able to end our national sovereignty and subject our citizens to the will of unelected TPP union officials. Our borders would remain open, destroying our economy and requiring an ever increasing need for debt to feed, house, educate and provide medical care for an unlimited number of illegal immigrants and refugees. After reading this article, you may think the solution to this problem is simple; lock up George Soros. He is just the face of an evil entity intent on world domination. Lock him up and another will take his place; instantly. The solution to our problem is to end the Globalist controlled mainstream media hypnosis our people are being subjected to. I am talking about NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, MSNBC and to some extent FoxNews. In addition to getting your local community squared away to ride out an economic collapse and the resulting violence (see our Community Preparedness Team (CPT) initiative), we must also develop strategies to defeat the Globalists. We must communicate with and support other liberty-minded organizations. We must take back the college campuses by aggressively engaging the Marxist enemy there (something Oath Keepers will be doing with our new College Oath Keepers initiative that will establish Oath Keepers student groups on campuses nationwide this Spring Semester). In order to diminish the effectiveness of their false narratives, we must be vigilant in producing media and articles that expose the lies. Other ideas that have been suggested and should be discussed include: Boycott their National News programming. Protest at their news headquarters in New York City, Washington, DC and Atlanta. Publicly ridicule their false narratives using alternative media outlets. Purchase roadside billboards to discredit their journalism and expose their bias. In order to prevail, we need to be uncompromising and steadfast. While this is being hailed as a major victory for the protestors, I see it as no different that the actions of the Obama Administration raising the hopes of protestors in Ferguson, MO when Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the U.S. Justice Department would use every resource of the Federal Government to pursue civil rights charges against police officer Darren Wilson. No permanent action was taken today by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Certainly nothing that will withstand a court challenge. If the actions of the Obama Administration cause protestors to leave North Dakota during the most brutal winter months of northern plains weather, then maybe, just maybe some good can come of this. I doubt that will be the case. If anything, the Obama Administration has proven itself to be predictable when it comes to appeasement of environmental and social justice causes. After weeks of protests from Native Americans and environmental activists, the Army Corps of Engineers announced Sunday that it was refusing to let Energy Transfer Partners LP build a section of the project under Lake Oahe in North Dakota and would begin a lengthy environmental review. But that decision runs headlong into the pledge from Trump to greenlight new energy infrastructure. 0 Navy Jack During my service I deployed on various platforms, including submarines, amphibious assault units and special boats. I participated in expeditionary and humanitarian missions to the North Atlantic, Iran, Beirut, Libya, and the Caribbean. I am a Patron Life Member of the NRA. I am an Oath Keeper Life Member. Like I keep repeating, until there is a consequence for these evil doers, we the people will not see any improvement but rather a continuation of their goals. Josie says: December 6, 2016 at 12:06 am I second your post. I grieve for the Finicum family, and my heart is heavy knowing a good and fearless man was ambushed and murdered. Many people do not even realize they are being sold a lie again. Norton II says: December 4, 2016 at 11:47 am Too right Jack : My little glimmer of information about Standing Rock has come from a Tribal Elder, and her take away after visiting was not positive. All they are doing is pushing a can of worms on Trump. Blueotter says: December 4, 2016 at 1:15 pm I am a Native American Church leader and an Oathkeeper. I have been doing weekly interviews on Prophecykeepers Radio since August with some of the Grandmothers who have been involved, and one of them told me that she feared Soros was behind and had evil intentions to use them. Going back into history, our young people have long caused trouble for us, going against the wishes of their elders, because we believe no man should be forced to do what another tells them to do. Smitty says: December 4, 2016 at 2:45 pm The Standing Rock protest are simply a green party creation, remember Jill Stein vandalized equipment as a campaign stunt. These marxist will be very disruptive over the next few years and may turn violent like the anarchist. It is very possible they will be the genesis of a civil uprising where we will be forced into the streets to protect our communities. I think we crossed that bridge weeks ago. Navy Jack is a digrace to the service. I fought to keep keep opression from this country, not to allow it to happen. Water cannons and sting ball gernade use on protesters sounds like that to me. Their right to free speech is being being beaten out of them with military equipment. Since you have brought this up, I will say that a peaceful protest does not involve lighting fires on private property, killing rancher livestock, blocking key highways needed for emergency response vehicles, vandalizing of property and businesses in the nearby towns and cities, chaining people together inside banks and other financial institutions, assaulting police officers and sheriff deputies, hurling objects at first responders or trespassing. All of which the citizens of North Dakota have had to deal with from the Astroturf protesters that have been flocking to this event. All of which preceded any response from the Sheriff and the local authorities. Now with regard to the use of the water cannon, I do not think that it was appropriate considering the temperature at the time. Regardless of what you may have heard on the mainstream news, nobody was seriously injured as a result of its use. There were 17 cases of mild hypothermia. As for the other crowd control measures used, I think if you read my previous articles you will see I have always been opposed to the militarization of civilian police. With that said, based on the violence being perpetrated by the protesters, the Governor of North Dakota had every right to deploy the Dakota National Guard to stop the violence which the protestors alone were responsible for. The behavior of the anarchists and social justice warriors that have come to North Dakota is no different than that of the protestors that travelled to participate in the riots in Portland, Baltimore, Ferguson or any other city targeted by the Globalists and their mainstream news media accomplices. I suggest that before you jump on the bandwagon for a cause, you consider actually talking to the people whose lives have been affected by the violent actions of the protesters. kmcgaugh says: December 13, 2016 at 1:09 pm I agree with every part of this article except you left out the science of steel underground pipes. They all corrode and will leak. They must all be dug up and replaced at some point in the future. The oil is toxic so even a small leak will cause a some environmental damage. Oil floats on water so an oil leak under a body of water will rise to the surface of the water. Commercial engineering is not to be trusted without some codes of conduct that consider the long term economic risk to others. Oil tankers are required to have a double hull. Gas stations must place their underground fuel tanks inside a double vault with sensors to measure liquid intrusion and surface dip tubes to sample any liquid in the vault. The evil motives of George Soros are not the only motives to be considered. He is just trying to capitalize on the situation. If this was my land I would oppose the underground pipe and support an over ground pipe. Nice try. Mac says: December 16, 2016 at 4:24 pm BlackWolf1, you are so wrong about this issue. The pipeline uses NEW technology that Environmentalists themselves demand be used to replace existing at-risk pipelines. President Obama ends his term with one sad DISGRACE after another. First we find out that for his 8 years CHINA deemed what countries (not Taiwan) could call the President. Second, today we find the Army Corps completely caves in, the pipeline will have to traverse a much more built-up area on the other side of Bismarck, N.D. with much more intrusive construction. I should have addressed it in the article. Thank you. are all OWNED by the very globalists who are causing the problem. What they are doing is wilful and with complete knowledge and intent. I think the world is pretty fucked. Our country has become so partisan and the lack of constructive, nuanced discussion between sides is so toxic. I seriously doubt humanity will exist in 200 years Sun City Media says: December 5, 2016 at 8:55 pm Well written article by Navy Jack. It has been happening throughout history and some are obviously very clever at doing it. Yes, articles such as this need to be read so people get exposure to the bigger picture. They can then do the due diligence and make more informed decisions about where to put their allegiances. Hopefully a Trump presidency will see the emergence of a more honest and accountable and Constitutional 4th Estate. You can read what I consider to be some of the responsibilities of good media business on the Blog page of the Sun City Media website. Yoda says: December 6, 2016 at 5:17 pm I understand that there are a lot of vets at Standing Rock in support of the protest. It is not a good feeling to think you are giving honorable service only to find out later that you were working for the enemy. Passing this article might just save some from that. It is also information warfare action. Many times the pen really is greater than the sword. Great info, Jack. Hopefully, local law enforcement can provide the necessary wood shampoos to these hippies. I wish I had more time to study any trends in messaging. You make it quite clear to which side you are on when you go to length in mention of cattle , machinery, or property being vandalized, yet not one Elder has condoned such actions, nor has every one of those actions been proven true, as done by the protesters . MTguy says: December 20, 2016 at 10:55 am If the tribe would have taken part of the regulatory meetings (not the non regulatory meeting with the company and not the Army Corps of Engineers that you reference which is actually an audio recording put out on youtube in video format) they would have been able to go and identify what is sacred to them. If any person reads the opinion from his ruling and still thinks the tribe was in the right here, I truly feel sorry for their lack of intelligence. You mention that not one elder has condoned these acts, but that is not true as Chase Iron Eyes (former Senate Candidate) has called for these acts. There have only been a few Elders who have condemned these acts as well. I have been living through this for over 100 days now and have had the benefit of seeing the local news coverage and going to the camp. You make it clear which side you are on, which is that of the rail road who stands to lose significant amounts of money if this pipeline is completed. Jason says: February 2, 2017 at 1:47 pm As long as you continue to believe that everyone who protests is a globalist Marxist instead of someone who simply does not believe the multinational corporations should have all the power you will be a puppet for the people who really want to control all aspects of American life. To suggest for a second that this pipeline is not a project developed by globalists is absurd. The people who run these corporations are the ones who wrote TTP, which was support by both the Obama and the entire Republican Party as well as the Democratic Party. As long as you see everyone who stands up for their rights as a Marxist, except yourself, you will never achieve anything. Under US CODE 18: Paid Protesters are TERRORISTS. The PENALTY under Code 18 is 20 years to life in PRISON, or death. Blacks against Whites in the USA, Muslims against Christians in Europe, these civil wars will have the immense advantage to destroy the people without confrontations between degenerate countries into nuclear power world war. People are being MANIPULATED into causing riots and wars to unwittingly assist them with this NWO agenda. pixels. file is empty. file is not an image. exceeded. error occurred in the upload. was a configuration error.
