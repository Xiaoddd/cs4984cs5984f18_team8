See disclosure. Thankfully, Chase has a dedicated team in his corner. You are among a group thousands strong who stood with Standing Rock in its hour of need, who have followed this story to the courts, and who have taken repeated action to keep the fight for justice on track. Now, in order for that justice to be served, we need your financial support. This includes more than 50 depositions, requiring travel to Texas and North Carolina to question, under oath, officials of Dakota Access pipeline parent company Energy Transfer Partners and their hired mercenary security firm, TigerSwan. This time, we are confronting racism and violations of the Federal Civil Rights Act and the Environmental Protection Act in support of our First Amendment rights under the Constitution. We will continue to provide updates to you as the team uncovers the truth and explores the extent of the rights violations at Standing Rock. With your continued aid, we will turn the tide in this country at its darkest hour. With your support, we will prevail. All donations are tax-deductible.
