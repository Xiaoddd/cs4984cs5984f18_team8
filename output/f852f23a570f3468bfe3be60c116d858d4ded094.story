Then Their League Expelled Them. Native Americans who play and coach lacrosse today have recent ancestors who were forced to play in secret. Jeremiah Moreno, who coaches the 7 Flames youth lacrosse team in the Dakota Premier Lacrosse League (DPLL), says he views instilling a reverence for lacrosse and its history as a part of his job. 7 Flames draws most of its players from two Lakota reservations, while two other Native-majority teams in the league, Susbeca (which means dragonfly in the Dakota language) and Lightning Stick Society, field mostly players from Dakota reservations. Last month, these three Native American teams were suddenly expelled from the DPLL by league administrator Corey Mitchell, for reasons players and coaches say they still do not understand. Members of all three teams say they have experienced severe racial abuse from other DPLL players, parents, and referees, and they allege they were kicked out of the league because Mitchell was uninterested in addressing their allegations of racial abuse. On March 8, Cody Hall, director of 7 Flames Lacrosse, called Mitchell to discuss allegations of racism that have plagued the DPLL from its inception. Then, Hall says, Mitchell informed him that he was expelling 7 Flames and the two other Native teams from the league. Lightning Stick Society director and head coach Franky Jackson was never notified of the expulsion by Mitchell, and only noticed something was amiss when he found he had been locked out of the DPLL registration web page. Mitchell did not return several requests for comment. Deadspin reached out to him via phone and email and left numerous voice mail messages. On the same day Mitchell broke the news about the expulsions to Hall, he spoke on the phone with Ali Vincent, a volunteer grant writer for the 7 Flames. Vincent recorded this call and shared an audio file with Deadspin. In the audio, Mitchell said he had made this decision to expel the teams in June 2017, shortly after the last season ended. A Native American student who has played in the league for five seasons (and who requested to remain anonymous because he feared blowback from the league or its players) said he has dealt with racist comments every season. The player said he heard racial slurs and insults regularly while playing in DPLL games. Another Native player said he heard racist remarks from opposing players and coaches who assumed he was white. Members of the 7 Flames pose for a team photo. I was really upset. They were teasing us about the tomahawk chop. Our boys, some of them were upset.

Moreno, the head coach of 7 Flames, said that non-Native teams seem to increase their physicality when they play Native teams. We were adamant about getting off the field if something happened. Representatives from Susbeca, Lightning Stick Society, and 7 Flames each said they had conversations with Mitchell and the DPLL regarding their concerns about racism in the league. Lightning Stick Society assistant coach Dan Paur said he wrote a letter to the league in June 2016 about opponents using slurs against his team, and detailing an incident in which a team made mocking Indian war cries when Lightning Stick Society won an award at a year-end award ceremony. Deadspin reached out to representatives of all eight teams that remain in the league via emails, texts, phone calls, and Facebook messages. The Grand Cities Predators and Red River Valley Polars declined to comment, beyond a denial that their players or coaches had witnessed or participated in any racism. The Bismarck-Mandan Rattlers, Aberdeen Cobras, and Watertown Warriors did not respond to requests for comment. The current president of the Black Hills Shock denied that his program had participated in any racist incidents, and said that if any such behavior was uncovered by the organization the offending coach or player would be banned from the team immediately. The Sioux Falls Spark and the Brookings Rage list Mitchell as the official point of contact. After informing Hall that the Native teams were being expelled from the DPLL, Mitchell wrote a formal letter about his reasoning, which U.S. Lacrosse CEO Steve Stenersen provided to Deadspin. Mitchell cited seven reasons: Not having US Lacrosse certified coaches (which, like other sports, requires a clinic, online modules, and background checks, as administered through the national governing body, US Lacrosse) Coaches neither acknowledging nor accepting the Code of Conduct Illegal players (non-rostered or playing on multiple teams or age groups) Not showing up to games, leaving tournaments early, and giving no advanced notice Rosters which were incomplete or not submitted for required validation Coaches and players not being registered members with US Lacrosse Unwarranted hostility toward officials, opponents, and league administrators Coaches and administrators from the Native teams deny the accuracy of all seven allegations. Deadspin obtained a league incident log that lists each time a team was officially reprimanded, as well as coach suspensions. Advertisement Advertisement Coaches failing to secure U.S. Lacrosse certification has been an issue for nearly every team in the DPLL. Lightning Stick Society had three coaches cited for violations, Susbeca had two, and 7 Flames had two. Meanwhile, the Watertown Warriors had three coaches serve certification-related suspensions, the Spearfish Spartans (now part of the Black Hills Shock) had one, and the Red River Valley Polars had one. Those teams are still playing in the DPLL. Coaches from the Native teams said the issues were not due to a refusal to follow the rules, but simply long waits for paperwork to be processed. All of the coaches were eventually certified, and none violated their league suspensions, they said. Multiple coaches are cited for late Code of Conduct filings numerous times: Black Hills, Watertown, Bismarck-Mandan, Grand Cities, Spearfish, Red River Valley, and Aberdeen, in addition to all three Native American teams. 7 Flames does acknowledge using a non-roster player on one occasion: When the high-school JV team found itself a man down before a game, the coach decided to play a 21-year-old, a clear violation of the rules. Hall, who was at a U14 game being played on a nearby field at the time, said he found out about the illegal move after the game. It was tough fielding enough guys. I have to get support from council and district meetings for these programs to pay the team registration fees. During a summer of 2015 game between the Sioux Falls Spark (the team Mitchell founded and coaches) and the Sicangu Thunderhawks, which are now part of the Lightning Stick Society, Mitchell demanded a roster check on Sicangu before the game because he objected to the team using younger boys playing up a level (which is allowable under league rules). Butler said. He never, ever came to me for a roster report for the Black Hills team, or for any other non-Native team. In the audio recording provided by Ali Vincent, she asked Mitchell if any of the majority-white teams that served suspensions for various violations were being kicked out of the league. We served our suspension. And you are just now saying this in passing. Several people affiliated with the three lacrosse teams say the racism they have faced is reflective of a broader sports culture in the region. And as a guy working with youth, I find that very disturbing. Even before the expulsion, Susbeca was contemplating not rejoining the DPLL this year because of their negative experiences in the past, Red Eagle said. Now, the team is looking for a different league in which to compete. Lightning Stick Society is planning to join a league in Minnesota despite the long drives from the Rosebud Reservation such a move will require. 7 Flames is still practicing but has yet to commit to another league. U.S. Lacrosse CEO Steve Stenersen said the organization is in the process of investigating the DPLL situation. U.S. Lacrosse representatives, including a lawyer and Stenersen himself, have reached out to all of the expelled programs, and are considering a mediation session with the league and the teams. 7 Flames, meanwhile, is considering a lawsuit. But we still play. We still practice. Curtis Waltman is a freelancer and reporter for MuckRock, based out of Boston. American Lacrosse Teams Reported Racial Abuse.
