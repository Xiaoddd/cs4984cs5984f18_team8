They have stood for centuries at the edge of a graveyard, watching the white man dig more holes. With every breath, the timeline of existence shrinks backward one step. In my heart, I could wear a headdress, I could smell the burnt leaves wafting like spirits around my skull, like voices turned to ashes swirling and sticking to my tongue. I could sing songs around the fire in a language I never learned.

His work can be found here or there, mostly there.
