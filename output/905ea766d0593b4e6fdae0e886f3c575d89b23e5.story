She says when Kinder Morgan suspended non-essential spending they pointed to the province of B.C. for the hold-up. Land defender Kanahus Manuel says the Secwpemc-led Tiny House Warriors initiative is not a protest but an assertion of their Indigenous rights and jurisdiction. Manuel says injunctions such as the one granted to Kinder Morgan favour corporate interests over Indigenous rights that are protected under international law. Land defender Kanahus Manuel (centre) and Secwepemc people and allies have vowed to defend unceded Secwepemc territory against the Trans Mountain pipeline extension. Some say Secwepemc title and jurisdiction make the controversial project a risky investment. Justin & Rachel should dig up the pipe, recycle the metal and fill in the hole. A province of Our country need a pathway through these lands to transport its product to all available markets,for the wellbeing and benefit of all our citizens. There is already an existing pipeline in this same path,this pipeline at some point in the future will no longer be needed and it will be returned to its natural habitat. They entered into this risky dispute because they had their backs up against the wall. Only buying out this risky venture ensured its journey forward. These 2 groups are using taxpayer money & the power of law to move any opposition out of the way. However, there is one group that can not be bought or sacrificed for profit. Those citizens who who want to guarantee protection of Mother Earth in all its forms, Something those in power vaguely consider or try to put a price on. The time has finally come on this planet to change our destructive ways. Thank you. You may also have the option to invest and claim part ownership of that infrastructure. Third: you are being lied to by the self-serving and obfuscating high priests of economy. Presumably she feels she is not subject to Canadian laws. If so, she should reject all education health care welfare and any financial support from Canadian taxpayers. The indigenous peoples had a raw deal in many ways from our colonial ancestors but that points to the need for intelligent cooperation in the 21st century not confrontation. Google it. Any pilgrim must know that that we have adapted to their laws and we still can live it in a healthier way then destructive leaks, spills and blow ups. The following weekend we had all First Nations chiefs, including Grand Chief Stewart Philips. They were all left alone as if it was a can of worms Kinder Morgan did not want to open. No one was arrested that weekend. No one. But the folliwing weekend it started up again with arrests. Yup. Kinder Morgan knew this was an untenable situation because they knew about unceded lands. Justin Trudeau knows this well but chooses to competely ignore unceded rights. Arrogant to the point of not wanting to be told by the Supreme Court of Canada that he has no jurisdiction on land that does not belong to the Canadian Confederation. He knows that jurisdiction is with First Nations all the way. Rule of law is meaningful consultation. But this could be very interesting because your leaders have made agreements with kinder Morgan. It will be your own people enforcing the injection. Should be very fun to watch. We are all Canadian citizens and will all benefit from the income generated by the pipeline and the bitumen that flows through it. Third: you are being lied to by the self-serving and obfuscating high priests of economy.
