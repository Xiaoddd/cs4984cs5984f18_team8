The letter is now closed to editing so that we can organize the current signatures and prepare it for mailing. Specifically, we urge you to grant the request by Congressmen Huffman and Grijalva, along with 21 of their House colleagues, to (1) deny the easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross Lake Oahe and (2) direct the Department of Justice to send observers to the protest sites. Additionally, we ask that you permanently protect Standing Rock by declaring it a national monument, thereby protecting the territory from destruction under future administrations. In transporting around half a million barrels of crude oil per day, the proposed pipeline risks the contamination and destruction of critical water sources of the Standing Rock Sioux, posing a fundamental threat to their health and wellbeing, and furthering the health disparities between indigenous and non-indigenous inhabitants of this country. Moreover, the pipeline endangers the health of the public at large, by further entrenching our reliance on fossil fuels and contributing to emissions that drive anthropogenic climate change beyond a point of no return. The lands and territories of indigenous peoples, and the natural resources contained therein, are inextricably tied to their physical and cultural survival. The proposed pipeline would jeopardize areas of significant cultural importance to the Standing Rock Sioux, including burial grounds and prayer sites. You have demonstrated a resounding commitment to the environment, to the rights of people of color and indigenous peoples, and to the health and wellbeing of all inhabitants of this nation. For this, we are deeply grateful, and truly hope that you act in accordance with these principles in attending to our request. PhD. Faculty member, UC Berkeley School of Public Health.
