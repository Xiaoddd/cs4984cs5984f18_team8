CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. Gas and oil development, exploration and fracking operations are colliding more and more with subdivision and housing developments as the front range continues to grow. Voters in Broomfield on Tuesday approved by a 57 percent margin giving their government more authority over the industry. Industry forces said the ballot initiative in Broomfield was not in compliance with state law and was sure to invite costly litigation that taxpayers would have to pay. Even though the courts have ruled that state power to regulate the industry trumps local measures, local residents continue to push local elected officials for action at a time when oil and gas interests also have mobilized themselves politically. The night before voters went to the polls, the Lafayette City Council passed a six-month moratorium on oil and gas drilling to give time for the city to forge new regulations. Hours after Lafayette acted, industry-backed City Council candidates won elections in Greeley while an engineer who works for Noble Energy, the second-largest driller in the state, narrowly beat back a challenge to a council seat she holds in Thornton. One night after election night, controversy continued to erupt, this time in Adams County over plans for 26 wells near Silver Creek Elementary School in Thornton. Homeowners near that proposed well site asked Adams County commissioners to block the wells. All the skirmishing is coming in advance of a projected drilling boom across the Front Range that could last as long as 30 years. Many local government officials say they are trying to respond to angry residents who are jamming public meetings and demanding action. Industry forces have fought back, signaling they probably will take the Broomfield voter initiative and Lafayette moratorium to the courts, where oil and gas interests prevailed in the past. Last year, the Colorado Supreme Court struck down efforts by Fort Collins and Longmont to regulate the industry. Lower courts thwarted similar efforts by Boulder and Larimer counties. She said concerns have been enhanced by the fatal house explosion in Firestone in April that was linked to a severed natural gas pipeline. They point out that state regulators have adopted methane rules for drillers. Oil and gas advocates say leaving regulations up to local governments will crimp an industry they contend supports more than 230,000 jobs in Colorado. Jim Alexee, executive director of the Colorado Sierra Club, noted that his side prevailed despite being outspent tenfold in the fight in Broomfield.
