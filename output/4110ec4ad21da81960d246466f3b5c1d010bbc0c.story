Menu Skip to content Oceti Sakowin Tribes Hold Meetings, Provide Testimony on Dakota Access Pipeline in D.C. The tribes present strongly asserted the need for the EIS to assess the entire pipeline, rather than just a small portion of the route. Tribal representatives expressed a strong desire to hold the scoping meeting in the Dakotas. Whether that will happen remains to be seen and will continue to be pursued. Officials present stated that they will strive to meet that request. This issue was raised in order to address fears voiced at the Standing Rock camps that the water was being raised.
