The filings are part of a lawsuit filed in November by pipeline protesters who accuse police of excessive force in a Nov. 20 clash over a blockaded bridge. That number previously had been disputed by officials, who used tear gas, rubber bullets and water hoses on protesters who they say assaulted officers with rocks and burning logs. Larson details numerous threats on social media, including one against ex-Gov. Assistant State's Attorney Marina Spahr declined to discuss the case in detail since it's ongoing, and the man did not respond to a request for comment left with a woman who answered the telephone at his home. The sheriff and his wife were given personal security while the threats were investigated, and officers are still doing extra patrols and residence checks for the couple, Schulz and another commissioner, sheriff's spokeswoman Maxine Herr said. That comes even after the large protest encampment has dwindled to a few hundred and protest actions are being encouraged across the country instead of in North Dakota. The Standing Rock Sioux and its supporters maintain the pipeline threatens drinking water and Native American cultural sites, which Dallas-based project developer Energy Transfer Partners disputes. Opponents have long described their protest as peaceful and have attributed violent actions to rogue antagonists. The Red Warrior Society, a protest group that advocated more aggressive tactics than the prayer and meditation called for by Standing Rock elders, did not respond to requests for comment.
