Wednesday, the Chippewas of the Thames will be thrust under a national spotlight as the community finds out if its fight against a pipeline giant over an aging oil line that runs through its traditional territory, is over. A loss in the high court would clear Enbridge to not only reverse the flow of oil in the 40-year-old line, sending it from west to east, but also to raise its capacity to 300,000 barrels a day from 240,000. The high court heard the case November 30 and is expected to issue its decision Wednesday morning. Built in the mid-1970s, Line 9 first carried oil west to east but its flow was reversed in 1998, allowing cheaper foreign crude to be sent to the Sarnia area for refining and its petro-chemical industries. Five years ago, as higher oil prices made North American production more attractive, including from unconventional sources such as the oilsands, Enbridge applied to reverse and expand the line. One portion of the line, 9A from Sarnia to North Westover near Hamilton, is already reversed. Line 9 runs through the London region and crosses the Thames River in Middlesex Centre, a spot about 35 kilometres away from the reserve but through Chippewas treaty territory. Dozens of environmental groups and First Nation communities along Line 9 argued against the project during NEB hearings. Critics have held demonstrations, sit-ins and protests. Henry, who was elected chief on Saturday, defeating incumbent Leslee White-Eye and two other candidates, said the community hopes for the best but is braced for whatever the court rules.
