The environmental groups questioned whether the plans for pipeline construction adequately control erosion and sediment. The court said it was sending two decisions back to the appropriate agencies for further review. The other was a right-of-way through the forest granted by the Bureau of Land Management. The Sierra Club celebrated the ruling, declaring that MVP should halt work immediately within the publicly-owned Jefferson National Forest. The Sierra Club also contended the ruling could mean further trouble for MVP along its entire proposed route in Virginia. Environmental groups have also filed a similar challenge about the separate but similar Atlantic Coast Pipeline.
