Allpress, who, along with his brothers, raises corn, alfalfa and cattle on their ranch along the Keya Paha River in north central Nebraska, is one of several landowners who plan to install solar panels along the pipeline route with help from advocates opposed to the pipeline. The panels will provide solar power to the landowners, with any excess production intended to go into the electric grid. TransCanada declined to comment. Eminent domain allows the government or private companies to take land from reluctant owners who are paid fair market value. The proposed project must benefit the public; something that landowners and environmental advocates argue is not the case with Keystone XL. The pipeline would carry approximately 800,000 barrels of oil per day from the Alberta tar sands in Canada to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would connect with the existing Keystone pipeline. Nebraska's Public Service Commission is scheduled to hold a formal, legal hearing on the pipeline starting on Aug. 7. The commission will rule whether to approve or reject the proposed route within the state of Nebraska following the hearing. Allpress, who along with other landowners will testify in opposition to the pipeline, hopes state regulators will put a halt to the project or reroute it somewhere where leaks would pose less risk to freshwater aquifers.
