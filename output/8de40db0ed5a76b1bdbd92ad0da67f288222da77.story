This is the very definition of hypocrisy, and it absolutely has NO place in this country. The events taking place at Standing Rock are crimes against humanity, and the people there need our help. On December 6th, I plan to travel to Bismarck, North Dakota on my own dime so I can help get supplies that are desperately needed to the camps. They need everything we can possibly give. Any and all donations to this fundraiser will be used for the purpose of renting a truck, buying supplies, and getting those supplies to the people who need them at the camps. Additionally, I plan to bring my camera gear and shoot as much footage of what's actually going on inside these camps as I can. The media is ignoring this human rights violation, and we need to do everything we can to get the word out, and show America that these people deserve to have the same rights as the rest of us. It is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE for government agencies to FIRE UPON UNARMED AMERICAN CITIZENS without reprocussion. Thanks for your time, and I hope you'll support me and the Standing Sioux tribe. Thank you all once again for helping to bring aid to the water protectors at camp Oceti Sakowin, on the banks of Lake Oahe in the Standing Rock Reservation. The good we did was appreciated and will go a long way to helping them survive the winter. Though the original sacred fire at Oceti Sakowin has since been extinguished in victory, the other camps - Sacred Stone Camp and Rosebud Camp endure. The fight is far from over, and thousands of water protectors plan to stay throughout the brutal winter. In my four days there, I was able to triple the amount of wood supplies they had in camp, and did so with sturdy, long-burning ash and oak, to get the greatest bang for our buck. I also donated the supplies I had procured for myself, along with the tarp I grabbed to line the SUV. Additionally, I gave rides to town for water protectors who were there without transportation. All in all, I felt like I did as much as I could in my time, while also being respectful of the difficulties faced in camp given the blizzard conditions. If you've got any questions at all, feel free to ask. I'm working on a video as well to give a little more insight into the trip and what's going on at Standing Rock at this point, and what the next steps are. I'm making sure to do research on which fund is most appropriate to ensure the money goes to the protectors who are staying through the winter. Thank you one more time for all of your support, and for enabling me to go on this incredible journey. It was unbelievably inspiring. Through Standing Rock we've seen what people can accomplish when they stand up with a common goal and refuse to be abused and swiped aside by the power of corporate America. We need to take this lesson into the fights ahead. I hope you're all ready for that fight. Thanks again. We've won a huge victory in the announcement that the Army Corps of Engineers will NOT grant the easement to Energy Partners for the completion of the DAPL. THIS is the power of peaceful protest and demonstration. Our voices have been heard. THAT SAID - and this is big - both Energy Partners and Sunoco have released a statement saying they plan to finish the pipeline without re-routing it, regardless what the Obama administration says. That penalty is a drop in the bucket to them. Let me say that again. Their intention is to complete an ILLEGAL pipeline no matter what the law or federal government has to say about it, so that means this fight isn't over, and that the water protectors are there at Standing Rock to stay until the pipeline is officially and completely shut down. We won the battle, but the war is far from over. The temperatures are going to plunge below zero for the next few days, so the Water Protectors still need your help. I'll have more updates to follow in the coming days. Thank you all so much for your support. So far multiple banks have pulled out of the DAPL, and Wells Fargo has offered to have talks with tribal elders. Because of all of your voices, we ARE seeing change. But we cannot, cannot stop now. The Nissan Pathfinder 4x4 is rented, the snow chains ready to be fitted. My current plan is to work on acquiring as much firewood as possible once I get to Bismarck, as that is the number one need right now in camp. It's cold. Extremely cold. And we need to help keep our water protesters warm throughout the winter. I've also been in contact with the Medic and Healer Council and will update you all with whatever other supplies they tell me they're in most desperate need of. I also will be shooting photos and video for them to help spread the word about the amazing work they're doing keeping people healthy in these sub-freezing, winter conditions. On a personal note, my respirator, rubber-bullet resistant goggles, and other winter gear I'm going to need have arrived and it's all starting to sink in. To be completely honest with you I'm scared, but when I watch the videos of the veterans joining the fight, the people who have been out there for months, and see the incredible good we're doing, dammit if I don't also get pretty damn excited to be a part of it. Thank you all for allowing me to do this. If you can, consider donating again. The more we raise, the more good we can do, and the longer we can keep our brothers and sisters in the fight. Thanks again. You all inspire me. It's been completely mind-blowing. I've got another week and a half before I go, so I'm raising the target goal so we can do even more good, but that said, for all of you who have already contributed, there is more YOU can do without donating any more of your money. If any of you bank with TD Bank or Citi, I urge you to withdraw your funds and switch banks if at all possible. These are the two biggest investors in the Dakota Access Pipeline, and speaking with our money is the most powerful form of speech we have as individuals. Again, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm so glad so many people care as deeply about this tragic blemish on our country's human rights record as I do. People are people. It's that simple.
