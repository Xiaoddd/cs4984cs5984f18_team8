Building on an earlier demand that agencies dump two regulations every time they issue a new one, the policy requires government officials to assess federal rules and recommend ways to repeal, replace or modify them. One of the first major environmental regulations to be singled out, however, is the Clean Water Rule, a policy developed under former president Barack Obama to clarify which water bodies receive federal protection under the 1972 Clean Water Act. The Waters of the United States rule, as it is also known, was designed to provide something that Republicans often say they want: regulatory certainty. If a sign of a good policy is that both sides complain about it, then this was excellent. Interstate commerce falls under the purview of the federal government, and the courts have interpreted this to mean that the federal government has jurisdiction over navigable waters. The Clean Water Act rightly extended this coverage to water bodies such as wetlands, but the courts have ruled that there are legal limits to this: not all waters are waters of the United States. Where the US government is in charge, landowners and companies need permits for a host of activities. Under Obama, the EPA and the Corps of Engineers attempted to create regulations to settle the issue. In January 2015, the EPA released a 400-page assessment documenting the full array of hydrologic, biological and chemical interconnections between isolated water bodies and their adjacent streams and rivers. Examples abound: contamination at the surface can migrate into shallow groundwater and re-emerge in a stream or pond somewhere else. Even seasonal water bodies can be crucial resources for plants and wildlife, and wetlands can provide protection from flooding and erosion. The agencies issued their final rule in May 2015, creating simple criteria to determine which waters are covered by the Clean Water Act. In all cases, these limits are conservative; if anything, they should be increased. The Corps of Engineers made this quite clear when it raised concerns with the EPA about losing jurisdiction over water bodies it has long governed. One of the parties who sued the EPA to block the rule was none other than Scott Pruitt, the former Oklahoma attorney-general who now heads the agency. As Nature went to press, Trump was expected to sign an executive order clearing Pruitt to begin the long process of rewriting the rule. The administration would be within its rights to do so, but cannot change the science. Tampering with wetlands and other inland waters has downstream impacts that must be addressed when making decisions about land use, and the government has a role in this.
