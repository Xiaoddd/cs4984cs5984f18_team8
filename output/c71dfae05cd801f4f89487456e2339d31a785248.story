In recent days the Water Protectors at Standing Rock have endured increasingly harsh and degrading actions by law enforcement agencies. Water Protectors have been sprayed with water cannons in freezing temperatures, shot with rubber bullets aimed at their heads and genitals, and have had concussion grenades and tear gas lobbed at them. Further, the Army Corps of Engineers has issued an eviction notice for Oceti Sakowin Camp, effective December 5, which leaves the peaceful demonstrators there exposed to further violence through the enforcement of this eviction from their rightful treaty lands. Call the people and agencies listed below to demand that protesters be treated with dignity and respect. Demand that the Dakota Access Pipeline be stopped. I am calling to ask for a de-escalation of the violent tactics being used by law enforcement and that respect be shown for the constitutional rights of those engaging in nonviolent direct actions involving civil disobedience. Please use your influence to pressure the Army Corps to rescind the Dakota Access pipeline permit. Please stand up for citizens of North Dakota and the United States, Native and non-Native, who are entitled to a healthy environment and the assurance that they can assemble, pray, and protect their water without being subjected to violence. I ask that you allow the Water Protectors to remain within the Oceti Sakowin camp on the Cannonball River. The threats to public safety do not stem from the presence of protesters, but rather from the violent methods used by law enforcement to oppose the people who have assembled to protect their water supply and sacred landscapes. While Federal Regulations grant you the power to restrict the usage of Army Corps managed properties, relying on these regulations to close the Oceti Sakowin camp amounts to an escalation of the conflict against peaceful demonstrators, not a de-escalation. The lands in question are within the territory granted the Sioux under the still-valid 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie. The Army Corps has failed to properly define the pipeline project area, failed to allow tribes to guide the process of identifying sacred places, and thus failed in its responsibility to adequately consult with the Sioux nation within their own treaty lands. By denying water protectors the first amendment right to peaceful protest, you will be violating their constitutional rights, and by placing liability for harm on the protesters, you will be complicit with the violation of human rights as well. Specific talking points: The Army Corps of Engineers Omaha office issued an eviction notice for the Oceti Sakowin camp late last week, declaring that any water protectors that remain after December 5 would be trespassing and liable for whatever action is taken against them. I demand that you demilitarize your tactics and I remind you that you protect and serve the people of this country, not the corporations. I request that you refrain from mass arrests, macing, clubbing, hooding, strip searching, and armed confrontation with UNARMED, peaceful water protectors engaged in constitutionally protected civil disobedience. I am horrified that you have used water cannons, rubber bullets, tear gas, and concussion grenades on the very citizens you are meant to protect. By perpetrating acts of violence on indigenous people involved in prayer, you are continuing a two-hundred year legacy of the subjugation of Native peoples by the United States. In addition, I want to remind President Obama of the promises he has made to indigenous communities in the United States. The president has the opportunity to secure his legacy by strongly opposing the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and calling for an end to militarized violence against protesters. In recent days the people at Standing Rock have faced violent, militarized actions leaving hundreds wounded. As freezing temperatures set in and violence perpetrated by police worsens the imminent danger only increases for the people at Standing Rock. Note: They will often try to transfer you to the Tribal Justice division. Safariland Group (307) 235-2136 This is the private company that outfits the militarized police force and that has provided many of the weapons used against peaceful protestors. Thousands of people have peaceably assembled in the interests of public safety to protect the water supply for millions of Americans who rely on the Missouri River. Your products are being used against journalists, medical personnel, children, elders, and people engaged in prayer, all of whom are exercising a constitutional right in the common interests of public safety. Many observers have commented that the actions of law enforcement, enabled by your products, may constitute violations of basic human rights. While I recognize that supply and distribution of your products is likely complicated, I request that your company cease to supply law enforcement agencies that are infringing on the rights of citizens in North Dakota. Banks Invested In or Funding the Pipeline There are 17 banks invested in DAPL. They are more susceptible to pressure than the gas and oil companies. Please consider pulling your money from any of these institutions. Furthermore, you can call or email every single one on this list and demand that they stop funding DAPL. I know that this bank is invested in and funding the Dakota Access Pipeline. In the last few days there has been a dramatic increase in violence perpetrated against the peaceful protesters by militarized police. For many months there have been mass arrests, macing, clubbing, hooding, strip searching, armed confrontation with UNARMED peaceful water protectors engaged in constitutionally protected civil disobedience. In the last week, they have used water cannons, rubber bullets, tear gas, and concussion grenades on journalists, media, men and women in prayer, medics and doctors trying to aid those that have been hit, and children. Additional Talking Points Additional Talking Points (if the staff member or assistant that answers the phone asks questions or continues to engage in conversation). DAPL is slated to cross Lakota Treaty Territory at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation where it would be laid underneath the Missouri River, the longest river on the continent. Construction of the DAPL would engender a renewed fracking-frenzy in the Bakken shale region, as well as endanger a source of fresh water for the Standing Rock Sioux and 8 million people living downstream. DAPL would also impact many sites that are sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux and other indigenous nations. At this point, they need to correct the mistake the Army Corps made through inadequate consultation. Tribal Groups decide what is a sacred site, not the government, industry, SHPO, or archaeologists. Water can be a cultural as well as natural resource. Freedom of press has been infringed upon through arrests, prosecution, and targeting of press by law enforcement personnel. Comparison of the treatment of the (Euro-american) occupiers of the Malheur National Wildlife refuge and native protestors at Standing Rock reveals a stark, racialized contrast in the treatment of indigenous peoples by law enforcement. I keep calling both. I want the DOJ and the DOJTD to hear me. Thank you for the direct number. One suggestion I have is for a script for people calling their local police departments that have loaned officers to the standing rock police force, per the suggestion from this article which is circulating fb suggesting this action.
