Now it's been returned to his only living heir. The tribes had said the 1,170-mile line violates their hunting, fishing and environmental rights. On Wednesday, Boasberg set out a schedule of hearings that will decide what will happen to the line while additional review is completed. A lawyer for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is responsible for environmental review, would not estimate when asked by Boasberg how long additional review would take. The judge could still order the line to be shut at a later date following a series of hearings scheduled through the summer. The line runs from western North Dakota into Patoka, Illinois, where it hooks up with another line to refiners in the Gulf of Mexico. The Native American tribes have been protesting the line's construction for more than a year. The line finally went into service in June.
