Suess said he expected to have more information later today about the volume of spilled oil and the cause. He said the break occurred where a section of the pipe is exposed over a narrow ravine in the creek, a short stretch extruding from one hillside before entering the other and considered to be self-supporting. He said it appears a slough, or small slide in the soil could be the cause and a geotechnical expert will be involved in the investigation. The 6-inch pipeline has been shut down. The EPA is involved because Ash Coulee Creek empties into the Little Missouri River, waters under federal jurisdiction. The spill appears to be contained to a 2.5-mile stretch of Ash Coulee Creek, about 20 miles upstream from where it reaches the Little Missouri River, Suess said. The creek was still flowing at the time the spill was detected, but froze Tuesday, with good and bad outcomes. The freeze prevents more migration of oil, but also makes it more difficult to pump oil, he said. The spill location is about 16 miles northwest of Belfield. Your notification has been saved.
