Mainstream outlets from ABC, NBC, and CBS to TV behemoths CNN and MSNBC rushed to report the breaking news, many pouncing on a story they spent months ignoring. That report, read by Anne-Marie Green, aired on the CBS Morning News at 4 a.m. on September 5. Protesters confronted workers Saturday at a construction site. Police say four private security guards and two guard dogs were hurt. Still, FAIR noted gaps in coverage across establishment sources. The media went on to ignore other instances of journalists being abused by law enforcement. One independent journalist who contributes to mainstream outlet Politico was shot with a rubber bullet while reporting on peaceful protests in November. Indeed, over the course of several months, the establishment media avoided providing extensive coverage of the DAPL protests, even as police tactics grew increasingly aggressive. Where the mainstream media failed, the independent media relentlessly covered the protests, promoting livestreams of the events that showed journalists and protesters being brutally arrested. Independent outlets made videos, posted articles, and ensured literally millions of people learned about what was occurring at Standing Rock, all while their journalists were under attack on the ground. During this period, the mainstream media was busy propping up Hillary Clinton, spreading Cold War-era propaganda, and most recently, attempting to smear independent media in the fallout from the election. The weekend before Thanksgiving, the corporate media took an unprecedented interest in the protests at Standing Rock after police fired water cannons at protesters in freezing temperatures. After livestream footage showed hours of the onslaught, headlines from establishment print media outlets began to emerge. But as FAIR noted, many failed to convey the severity of the situation. In fact, FAIR contends multiple outlets intentionally downplayed it. Though FAIR notes several media outlets did acknowledge the severity of police behavior in their headlines, some of the biggest names in news failed to fully report on the events of that evening, throughout which hundreds of protesters were injured while one cop was hit in the head with a rock. They were reaching huge audiences. The latter had a reporter on the ground corresponding live, and CNN, too, had a reporter on the ground. And this is precisely the problem. There are many lessons to be learned from Standing Rock. Most notably, it is the power of protest, overwhelmingly peaceful action, and the ability of people of all walks of life to come together and collectively and effectively challenge the establishment. Without the help of government or the lapdog media, protesters were able to raise thousands of dollars and enjoyed abundant donations of food, cold weather gear, and camping supplies. The veterans, alone, were able to raise over a million dollars (though mainstream media coverage admittedly must have helped boost that figure). The mainstream media is becoming increasingly irrelevant because of the exact behavior they displayed at Standing Rock. Please help continue this trend by supporting the news outlets and journalists who forced them to cover the story in the first place. Unicorn Riot had multiple journalists on the ground and provided some of the best live stream footage of the events, even as some of them were arrested in the process. Derrick Broze was reporting and livestreaming for Anti-Media and others in North Dakota. He made three trips to Standing Rock to cover the events and in addition to being tasered by police four times after identifying himself as media (see video above),he was also pepper sprayed. This was achieved through social media and the independent media. We can end the oilgarchy, statism, and environmental destruction once we change our thinking and ultimately our habits.
