Native Americans and activists from around the country have been gathering at the camp for several months trying to halt the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The proposed 1,172-mile-long pipeline would transport oil from the North Dakota Bakken region through South Dakota, Iowa and into Illinois. An estimated 4,200 barrels of oil leaked from the Belle Fourche Pipeline on a hill just above the Ash Coulee Creek, and an estimated 3,100 barrels made it into the water, said Bill Seuss, a program manager for the North Dakota Department of Health. The leak was first reported to regulators on Dec. 5, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). The incident may serve as something of a rallying cry for groups opposing the pipeline, which have said a spill could enter important watersheds and contaminate water. Rick Perry Sits On The Dakota Access Pipeline Company Board The point of release into the Ash Coulee Creek is about 18 miles from where it feeds into the Little Missouri River, which then feeds the Missouri, a major drinking water source, Seuss said. Frigid temperatures have made cleanup conditions difficult, but has also slowed the movement of oil down the creek because the water has frozen, he added. PHMSA on Tuesday said an investigation into the incident was ongoing. The 24,000 barrel per day, six-inch pipeline runs intermittently, and at maximum has capacity to flow at 1,000 barrels per hour, Owen said. For more on oil, watch: Monitoring equipment on the line did not detect the leak, possibly because of intermittent flow, she added. Two cows were reported dead near the site of the spill, but whether the leak caused their death was unclear, Seuss noted. Belle Fourche Pipeline Company has reported 12 pipeline leaks since 2010. In 2011, the company reported two major leaks, one that spilled more than 1,900 barrels of refined products Campbell County, Wyoming, and another that leaked 1,000 barrels of crude in McKenzie County, North Dakota, according to PHMSA data.
