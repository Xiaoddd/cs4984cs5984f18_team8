Canadian Minister of Finance Bill Morneau speaks during an interview with Reuters in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, May 17, 2018. Morneau declined to say whether the government was in active discussions with potential investors. Kinder Morgan has set a May 31 deadline for Ottawa to provide assurances it can proceed with the expansion that will more than double the capacity of its Trans Mountain line from Alberta to British Columbia. British Columbia, through which most of the pipeline runs, opposes it on environmental grounds.

U.S. companies are likely more focused on easing pipeline bottlenecks south of the border and are not interested in taking on the Trans Mountain project, which faces fierce opposition, the source said. Hundreds of people have been arrested in Burnaby, the British Columbia port where the pipeline ends. Kinder Morgan Canada already operates the Trans Mountain pipeline and it is unclear whether it would welcome a rival taking over the expansion. Andrew Botterill, national oil and gas leader at Deloitte, which advises energy companies, said investors think Canadian pipelines and other resource projects generally face high political risk. The agency is open for business but has yet to facilitate financing for any project. Morneau and the Infrastructure Bank declined to comment on whether it could be involved.
