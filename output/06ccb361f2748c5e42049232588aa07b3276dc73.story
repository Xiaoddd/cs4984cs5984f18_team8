The proposed ordinance, put forth by City Council member Seth Yurdin with support from local environmental activists, was a protest of Citizens Bank and other financial institutions with links to the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). But what started out as preliminary hearing ended up as a full-blown vetting of the proposal, with opposition coming from 20 union members, the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce and top officials from Citizens Bank, including its Rhode Island president, Marc Paulhus. Marc Paulhus, second from left, president of Citizens Bank Rhode Island, attended the hearing but didn't offer any remarks. Paulhus didn't speak, and sat with a group of company executives watching the proceedings. Union leaders Michael Sabitoni, president of the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council, and Scott Duhamel, of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, both insisted that divesting from the bank undermines a prominent Rhode Island business and creates a slippery slope that would lead to pulling funds from other local companies. Narragansett Indian tribe leader Randy Noka said divestment was about stopping the destruction of sacred land in North Dakota. Other activists said the action was about applying local pressure to stop environmental destruction. Supporters of the resolution equaled the opponents in number, but more likely would have attended had the meeting not been downplayed by city officials as a mere formality, saying a full public hearing would be held on another day. Yurdin said the vote effectively kills his proposal, because he must reintroduce it to the full City Council before it can brought before the committee. But council member Terrence Hassett insisted that the resolution could be brought back. Hassett and other members of the ordinance committee instead voted to create a commission that will examine policies for ethical investing of city funds. In 2013, the City Council approved divesting its pension funds from the top coal polluters in the country. Divestment from fossil-fuel companies was a popular cause about five years ago as students from Rhode Island universities pushed their colleges to rid their endowments from fossil-fuel companies to combat climate change. Brown University students led a high-profile divestment campaign that was ultimately rejected by the school's board of trustees. Students from the Rhode Island School of Design succeeded in having their school divest from fossil fuels. In a series of recent protests, activist groups No DAPL Rhode Island and The FANG Collective drew attention to Citizens Bank for lending to oil and natural-gas pipeline projects.
