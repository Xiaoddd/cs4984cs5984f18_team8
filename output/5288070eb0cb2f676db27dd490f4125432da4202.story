Add to Cart Vehicle tracking technology is the easiest way any business can improve profit, routing, customer service, and efficiency. Large fleet management operations are no longer the only businesses taking advantage of vehicle tracking technology as almost every company with a mobile asset has been modernizing communication and accountability efforts. Having the ability to route an employee, easily document mileage traveled, or see everywhere an employee has been with only a few clicks of a mouse empowers a business. The tracking systems can be easily hidden from a driver's view, being permanently installed to a vehicle's power supply, or used as portable monitoring devices, functioning off the GPS tracker's internal battery source. Using a vehicle tracking unit as a portable device gives employers and businesses the ability to move the GPS system from vehicle-to-vehicle if they suspect potential employee misuse of a company vehicle. Cutting down on unauthorized trips, excessive vehicle idling, and poor route management will increase a company's bottom line and vehicle maintenance efforts. Tracking System Provides Data Police Issued Ticket Is Battled With GPS Tracking Device Nobody likes receiving a speeding ticket from police no matter what the surrounding circumstances are, but when a ticket is given when a speeding violation has not occurred, that can be the catalyst to an extremely frustrating situation. David Riesmeyer, a New Brighton resident, understands that frustration more than anyone after he was recently ticketed for a speeding violation in Pennsylvania by a police officer. Riesmeyer was driving his company vehicle at the time of the incident, and the company vehicle was equipped with a fleet management tracking system that was used for documenting driver speed, location, and time on the clock. The tracking system recorded that Riesmeyer was traveling 10 miles per hour less than what the officer had clocked him driving. A radar gun was not used by the police officer who issued the ticket, rather a device that is similar to stop-watch that calculates speed driven between 2 lines on the roadway. Currently, only state police are authorized to use radar gun technology for calculating driver speed in Pennsylvania. GPS tracking system technology is viewed as more reliable and precise than all other forms of calculating speed currently used by traffic officers. GPS Tracking System Goes To Court Riesmeyer now intends on bringing his GPS tracking data to court, fighting the ticket he feels was wrongly given. Vehicle tracking devices that use GPS to capture driving information are viewed by almost every court room as credible and reliable, making Riesmeyer's case a strong one. Considering the vehicle tracking system technology that recorded the speed Riesmeyer was traveling is used by numerous government agencies, Riesmeyer may be sitting in a position of power.
