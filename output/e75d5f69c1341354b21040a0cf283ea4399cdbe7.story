A A Environmental and indigenous groups said Thursday they are worried Canada may soon own the Puget Sound Pipeline that delivers crude oil to refineries in Whatcom and Skagit counties. They are concerned the 69-mile pipeline may be expanded or the amount of oil that flows through it may be increased. They are also worried about plans to expand the larger Trans Mountain Pipeline that runs through Canada and connects with the local pipeline. The Canadian government announced May 29 plans to purchase the Trans Mountain Pipeline system from Kinder Morgan to ensure completion of the planned expansion. That system includes the Puget Sound Pipeline spur. Those four refineries currently receive more than half the oil sent through the Trans Mountain Pipeline across Alberta and British Columbia, according to Kinder Morgan documents. While the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion plan focuses on construction in Alberta and British Columbia, the potential to expand the Puget Sound Pipeline as well is penciled into some Kinder Morgan documents. Local refineries have not said whether the planned Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion or a potential Puget Sound Pipeline expansion would impact them. The Andeavor Anacortes Refinery did not respond to a request for comment. A document filed Feb. 20 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission states that although Kinder Morgan does not have plans to expand the Puget Sound Pipeline, its capacity could be increased from 240,000 to 500,000 barrels per day. In recent years, the pipeline has operated below capacity. Between 2015 and 2017, it moved an average of 180,000 barrels per day to the refineries in Whatcom and Skagit counties, according to Kinder Morgan documents. No plans to expand While there are no current plans to expand the local pipeline, Liestman and several other representatives of environmental organizations and indigenous communities who spoke Thursday said they have concerns about the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion and what it would mean for Washington. Their primary concerns are that the planned expansion would increase tanker traffic in the Salish Sea and increase the amount of oil that would be exported overseas, burned and contribute to climate change. According to Kinder Morgan, the expansion would include building a second pipeline alongside the existing Trans Mountain route between Edmonton, Alberta, and Burnaby, British Columbia. A marine port in Burnaby, near Vancouver, would also be expanded in order to ship more oil overseas, according to Kinder Morgan documents. The Associated Press reported that the number of oil tankers moving oil from Alberta through the Salish Sea would increase from 60 to 400 as a result of the pipeline expansion. Washington Gov. Tribal and environmental leaders in Washington, along with First Nations and environmental leaders in British Columbia, have spoken out against and protested the expansion plans for several years.
