All rights reserved. For months, opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline have been expressing fears that it would affect local drinking water, because it was to be built under the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation - the primary water source of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Last week, the US Department of the Army announced that it would not approve the crossing of the pipeline under the Missouri River. And while local drinking water will not be affected, at least two cows have been confirmed dead in the area, but a definitive connection between their deaths and the oil spill has not been made. Perhaps even more concerning than a freak accident splitting the pipe is the fact that electronic monitoring equipment failed to detect the leak - something that would have prevented the pipe from spilling so much oil out into the countryside. While there's no guarantee that a leak like this would happen at the Dakota Access Pipeline, this kind of thing is not exactly rare in the area. Belle Fourche Pipeline Co. has reported 10 oil spills since 2011. So while none of that means the Dakota Access Pipeline is necessarily a risk, the Billings County leak is making the protesters' point for them: it's clear we need to do a better job at ensuring the structural integrity of those pipes. 5 days ago Politics & Society Semi-Automatic Rifles Really Are More Deadly, New Study Clearly Shows Numbers don't lie. 6 days ago Politics & Society To Save Ourselves It's Time to Rethink Our Economic System, Warn Scientists The market is killing the planet. 3 hours ago PHYSICS Single Hydrogen Atoms Could Form Eerie 'Ghost Bonds' With Nothing, New Study Shows It shouldn't be possible. 14 hours ago SPACE SpaceX Has Announced The First Tourist to Go to The Moon - And Take Other People With Him Such a wild project. 14 hours ago NATURE Potentially Deadly Threats Are Now Lurking in Post-Hurricane Flood Waters Hurricane Florence isn't over yet.
