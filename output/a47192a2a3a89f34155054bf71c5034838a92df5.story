Early results confirmed the exit polls, with his centre-right VVD Party on course for 31 out of 150 seats. Three parties are projected to win 19 seats each: Geert Wilders' anti-immigration Freedom Party (PVV), the Christian Democrats and the D66 party. Mr Wilders' party had been leading in opinion polls but support for the party appeared to slip in recent days. Analysts say a high turnout may have benefited pro-EU and liberal parties. Although the VVD had lost several seats since the last election, many had expected the party to lose much more ground to the Freedom Party.

France goes to the polls next month to elect a new president, while Germany is due to hold a general election in September. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called Mr Rutte to congratulate him, while Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel has also tweeted his congratulations. Champagne but no fizz: Anna Holligan, BBC News, the Hague Image copyright Getty Images Pharrell Williams' song Happy pumped out across a conference hall converted to host the victorious VVD. Entry to the gathering was invitation only. Most of the foreign press were contained in a side room. The champagne was flowing but there wasn't much fizz. The mild-mannered, measured Mark Rutte appears to have been given a mandate. As parliamentary seats are allocated in exact proportion to a party's vote share, the VVD party will need to go into coalition with other parties. The VVD had ruled out a coalition with the Freedom Party - but not the other two runners-up, the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) party, and the Democrats 66 (D66) party, which are both pro-EU. The CDA said it was delighted with its election result and looked forward to helping form a coalition.

Hence, the other smaller parties will be seen as potential power-brokers. Exit polls suggest the Green-Left party performed strongly, winning a total of 16 seats, compared to four in the last parliament. Meanwhile, the Socialist Party took 14 seats, while the VVD's previous coalition partner, the Labour Party, saw its number of seats plunge from 38 to nine. Analysts said it appeared to have been punished for its role in the coalition government, where it helped pass austerity measures. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.
