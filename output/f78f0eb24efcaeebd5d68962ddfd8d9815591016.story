Molly Longman Jan 24, 2017 2:34PM EST Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog Pinterest Toronto Star via Getty Images A pipeline in the Western Canadian province of Saskatchewan leaked approximately 200,000 liters (52,834 gallons) of oil, the government told Reuters on Monday. The leak was reported on Friday afternoon and 170,000 liters have been recovered since that time by Tundra Energy Marketing Inc, the oil and gas company leading the cleanup effort, according to Reuters . It's still not clear how the Saskatchewan leak happened or even which company owns the pipeline, according to Reuters . Not unlike the discourse concerning oil pipelines in the United States , oil pipelines are a controversial topic in oil-rich provinces of Canada, such as Saskatchewan. Pipelines in the area move crude oil to the coast, but are under scrutiny from environmental groups who are wary of the environmental effects and indigenous groups who oppose the pipelines due to the usage of indigenous lands, Reuters noted . And this spill comes just before U.S. President Donald Trump signed executive orders making it possible for the Dakota Access and the Keystone XL pipelines to move forward with production on Tuesday. CBC News said the Canada leak happened in the lands of the Ocean Man First Nation, and reported that according to Ocean Man Chief Connie Big Eagle, one of Ocean Man's residents said they'd been smelling oil for a week before reporting it on Friday.
