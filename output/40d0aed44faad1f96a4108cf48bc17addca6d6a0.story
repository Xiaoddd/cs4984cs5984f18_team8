As you likely know, Donald Trump issued an executive order yesterday ordering that construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) continue. The order not only violates the rights of the people of Standing Rock, but it also violates the current order from the Army Corps of Engineers to halt construction while a true environmental impact study is completed. Courageous protestors physically stop the construction. Legal decisions order the halt of the pipeline. We need you to donate your best donation. We need you to ask everybody you know to join you. Ask them on the phone. Ask them via email. Just know, that as you read this email, Energy Transfer Partners, and all of the banks behind the Dakota Access Pipeline, have hired the top law firms in the world to defeat us. I have sources inside some of those law firms who have reached out to tell me just how hard they are prepared to go. That is why we are even in the position we are in today where the pipeline construction has been halted. Give your best gift today, please. And encourage everybody you know to join you.
