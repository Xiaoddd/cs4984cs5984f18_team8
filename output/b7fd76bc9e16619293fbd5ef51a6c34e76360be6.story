You may also be responsible the next time America is shocked by an election upset. For several years, a data firm eventually hired by the Trump campaign, Cambridge Analytica, has been using Facebook as a tool to build psychological profiles that represent some 230 million adult Americans.

In future Republican campaigns, a pro-gun voter whose Ocean score ranks him high on neuroticism could see storm clouds and a threat: The Democrat wants to take his guns away. A separate pro-gun voter deemed agreeable and introverted might see an ad emphasizing tradition and community values, a father and son hunting together. In this election, dark posts were used to try to suppress the African-American vote. Instead, his campaign pumped its money into digital, especially Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg and others had already built the infrastructure the campaign needed to reach voters directly. There are surely more changes to come.
