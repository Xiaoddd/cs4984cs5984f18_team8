Harold Hamm, a billionaire oilman and President-elect Donald Trump's top energy adviser, doesn't seem to believe the protests were authentic. He even questioned the motivations behind the efforts to stop the construction of the controversial pipeline.

Hamm didn't shy away from expressing his support for the pipeline. The 1,172-mile pipeline from Energy Transfer Partners hopes to reshape the landscape of U.S. crude oil supply by transporting crude from the oil-rich Bakken Formation in North Dakota through the Midwest. But tribal leaders argue that the pipeline, which would carry 470,000 barrels of oil a day, threatens the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's environmental well-being and would destroy sacred tribal sites. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe won a victory on Sunday when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it would seek alternative routes for the pipeline. But the victory is tentative as Energy Transfer Partners (ETP)said it would fight to continue to build the pipeline. North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven said in a recent statement that Trump has expressed his support for the Dakota Access Pipeline. Hamm, who on Thursday shot down talk that he could be Trump's energy secretary, said he's been in contact with Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault.
