Tracy Loeffelholz Dunn posted Nov 07, 2016 Updated Nov. 17 Not two weeks after one of the major banks funding the Dakota Access and Bakken pipeline companies said it may withhold its funding over concerns for the treatment of the Standing Rock Sioux, it announced Nov. 17 that it has sold off all assets in the companies. But the sudden divestment can be seen as an indication of which way the Norway bank is leaning. DNB is one of a handful of banks out of a total 38 that has offered funding to all Energy Transfer entities, including direct loans to Dakota Access. Several CEO email addresses have been changed. The Standing Rock controversy recently intensified as thousands have gathered in North Dakota to help the Standing Rock Sioux protect the area from pipeline construction. The pipeline is nearing the stage at which it would pass under the Missouri River, a drinking water supply for 18 million people. The Army Corps of Engineers has refused to give the pipeline the easement it needs, and Energy Transfer has filed a federal lawsuit compelling the government to do so. People power is winning. The news that DNB has sold its assets and is considering terminating its loans is a victory for the water protectors who are fighting to stop this disaster of a project. All financial institutions with a stake in the pipeline must quickly realize that financing this project is toxic. It would be smart for them to get out ahead of the growing movement of customers looking to divest from banks that finance the destruction of our planet and ignore Indigenous rights and sovereignty. The Bakken pipeline includes the 1,170-mile Dakota Access pipeline plus a 700-mile pipeline from the end of the Dakota Access, in Illinois, to refineries and export facilities in Texas. No Paywall.
