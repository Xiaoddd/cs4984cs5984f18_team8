As America settles down to celebrate Thanksgiving, we are presented with a grim irony that the holiday which allegedly celebrates cooperation between white colonists and Native Americans is overshadowed by violence at the Dakota Access Pipeline. There are many convoluted theories and histories that have confused the truth around the first Thanksgiving, relegating it to the status of myth and legend. Back then, Americans were desperately in need of unity and inspiration. The legend of Thanksgiving becomes even less palatable when you consider the atrocities against Native American water protectors at the Dakota Access Pipeline, in Cannonball North Dakota. A young woman may lose her arm after police threw a grenade into a crowd of protestors and hundreds have been injured by water cannons fired in freezing weather, rubber bullets and tear gas. The chilling reality of the relationship between Native Americans and the U.S. government is now staring us all in the face. This is sad and horrible but also true. By abusing the people who lived here first. My mom had no clue. There is no doubt that the DAPL protests are waking up more people to the oppression and violence that Native Americans face. As police and mercenaries crack down on the peaceful protesters and their camp, safely sitting at home with a hot meal is something truly to be grateful for.
