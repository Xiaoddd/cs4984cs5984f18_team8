Just this week law enforcement used tear gas and fired bean-bag rounds to disperse crowds and arrested nearly 40 people since Monday, the Billings Gazette reported. One Water Protector appears to have suffered a nasty wound in his leg after an alleged confrontation with an officer on Thursday (warning, the photo is graphic). But that's not the only concerning news story developing around the controversial project. 1. On Tuesday, reports emerged that the North Dakota National Guard had sent two Avenger missile launchers near a critical work site near the pipeline. National Guard spokesman William Prokopyk told the Daily Beast the missiles were unloaded and had no authorization to be loaded. Apparently, she was driving past a long line of cars parked along shoulder of the road when a protester jumped in front of her car waving a sign. On Jan. 17, Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners asked U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to stop the corps from publishing a notice announcing the study in the Federal Register. The corps did not immediately respond to ETP's request. 4. Company Engaged in Deceit and Fraud in Acquiring Land Easements, Lawsuit Claims Some two dozen landowners in Morton County, North Dakota, have filed a lawsuit this month in U.S. District Court against Dakota Access. The Associated Press writes: Those suing say Dakota Access engaged in unfair tactics and fraud while negotiating to lay pipeline on private land, resulting in compensation that was as much as nine times lower than what other landowners got. Landowners also allege they were told if they didn't agree to the offered amount, they faced losing money or getting nothing either because their land would be condemned through eminent domain or the pipeline would be moved elsewhere. The company has until about the end of the month to file its response in court. Water Protectors at the protest campsite have noticed desperation and declining morale due to the new Republican president, according to Billings Gazette. Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections: For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S., particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century. The comments of our readers are the most vibrant, best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News. Accordingly, we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services. It is, however, important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in. Adapt and overcome. The whites will come and, hopefully, the veterans too. The battle moves to round 2. Be tough everyone, your cause is certainly worth it. Where they expecting the protesters to have their own airforce. Maybe someone told them the Apaches would be coming and the national guard thought they meant AH-64 helicopters. Sending stingers to the protest, is like using dynamite to crack a nut. Of course. a delusional Trump would feel that is what the American people want. But at least now that Trump is sitting in the Oval Office, more people are seeing how terrifying is the Surveillance and Police State.
