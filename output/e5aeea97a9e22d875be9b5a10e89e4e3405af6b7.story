But, like so many reports intended to get us riled up, there is much more to it than that. From the reports, one would think pipeline company executives woke up one morning and decided to build a 1,172-mile pipeline across Native American lands. Yet the pipeline is the result of years of study and thousands of pages of filings seeking approval from federal, state and local regulators. The North Dakota Public Service Commission, South Dakota Public Utilities Commission, Iowa Utilities Board and the Illinois Commerce Commission each must authorize construction and operation of the crude oil pipeline in their states. The Pipeline & Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation is responsible for ensuring safety in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the line. Dozens of highway, cultural resource, historic preservation and other agencies are involved as well. But the website Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now, created by energy companies and business groups in the region to give facts about the pipeline, tells the other side of the story. One hundred percent of landowners in North Dakota voluntarily signed easements allowing for construction of the pipeline on their property. The Missouri River intake serving the tribe is being switched to Mobridge, South Dakota, nearly 50 miles south of the current water intake and about 70 miles south of the planned Dakota Access river crossing. That includes a Northern Border natural gas pipeline that parallels the planned crossing for Dakota Access for 40 miles, as well as existing high-voltage transmission power lines. Throughout that process, the SRST and its allies were consulted by both Dakota Access and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Such gasoline was brought to them through North American pipelines that make the oil-based fuel available at cheap enough rates that nearly everyone can afford to travel cross-country. And while doing so, they can still learn about and respect the original native cultures.
