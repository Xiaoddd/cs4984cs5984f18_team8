Yes, the results are just as magical as you would imagine. Elsa and Anna are climate change scientists. Snow White, meanwhile, is a therapist, drawing inspiration from her relationships with the Seven Dwarves. She now fights for equality on university campuses, ensuring that men and women are given the same treatment and opportunities. And Belle, the university chancellor. Inspired by her love of books and knowledge, Belle went into academia. After receiving her doctorate in education, Belle has risen to the level of chancellor at a major university. The careers for each princess are so on point and perfect. When it came to coming up with them, Burt said it was a team effort. Check out Pocahontas, who now heads up a nonprofit fighting for environmental conservation. She heads a non-profit organization committed to preserving and protecting the environment. And Cinderella, who is an animal rights activist. And of course Tiana ended up a James Beard award-winning chef. We definitely saw that one coming. She now stands at the top of the culinary world, winning the James Beard Award and owning one of the most popular restaurants in the country. Ariel is now a pop star and record producer, which is just as fitting. Considered the best of her talented sisters, Ariel took her skills and made it her career.

Using these strengths, Moana has excelled in the Navy, rising to the rank of lieutenant commander. She has been awarded multiple honors during her service, such as two Navy Achievement medals and a National Defense Service Medal. Jasmine, who always considered all people equal regardless of their background and social standing, is now a United Nations ambassador. A natural politician, she now advocates for her country of Agrabah at the United Nations.
