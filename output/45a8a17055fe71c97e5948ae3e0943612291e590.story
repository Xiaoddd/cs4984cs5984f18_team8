The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America The Collapse of The American Dream Click here to view the breakdown of the Fortune 500, from how much they made compared to how many people they employ. It might sound a little cruel, but I don't see it that way. Let's hope that it is quick and painless for them so we can both get back to our own business. The first thing to remember whenever dealing with any agents of the court is to remain humble. I cannot stress this enough. The knowledge you are about to receive will put you in a position of power over them. If absolute power corrupts absolutely, then remembering that is prudent for keeping composure and staying humble. If we are called to do battle with them, then we go armed with the truth; for truth is something that no one can refute. I would suggest to anyone who has never read the rules for criminal procedure for your particular state you will be fighting in, to go on line and read the rules. Each state has different rules so you want to know them before you go into any battle. You should be able to go in there, without fear and state your case. It took years for me to get over the fear. Sometimes I would pop a sedative before going into the courtroom. But there was no one there to teach me like you are getting taught now. Sure, I had my mentors, William Thomas and David Dodge, but most of it I learned on my own, through trial and error, and so will you. Just be glad that you will have all this knowledge dumped on you all at once and an Internet to do all your research from. For me it took over 30 years of going to law libraries and dozens of appearances before the court. So just be glad. These teachings are for our benefit. If a semester of high school was devoted to teaching the students how to file all of these, there would be no need for filing any of these things after a few years. Most are simple to learn. The best way to beat them is with the truth. If you know you are not in the wrong you will be able to find a law that can prove that. Some of these methods I take are the following: Writ of Habeas Corpus Writ of Mandamus Writ of Certiorari Bill of Particulars Using any of the four above-mentioned pleadings will give you an edge over the governments. They have been told to do things one way and of course this way is usually unCon-stitutional. None of them have ever checked the law to see how things are really supposed to happen. So when they see any of these documents cross their desks, they overheat and blow a gasket. You can click on any of the links to be brought to that page to learn on each. They are three ways of suing the government officials and the last one is for after you have been arrested. The rest of this page will be devoted to appearing before the court. If you are incarcerated you will make a first appearance either in person, or by live video. This is very scary, but this is where the fun begins. So hold on tight, there are many moves from here that will set the stage with the court and how they will treat you. Remember that whole you go amongst the wolves as sheep thing and all that. The law used to be Title 18, United States Code, section 3161, the speedy trial act, but courtrooms today are so filled that they ignore that law, to give them some breathing room. We are not going to play that game. There is a difference between first appearance and arraignment. It is not a legal term found in any dictionary. Twenty years ago there was no first appearance. When you got arrested you got arraigned. And the law back then was for arraignment to happen within ten days of the arrest. Arraignment is something totally different. The same things that happen at an arraignment happen at a first appearance with the exception that you do not enter a plea. You will be informed of your rights and the judge will determine if there is probable cause for your arrest and incarceration. If the charge is a felony the rules are a little different. When you bail out of jail right after your arrest, there is usually no first appearance. You show up for arraignment. Before you speak to the judge, either the clerk or the judge will Marandize you. This is to cover their bases. They will then have you raise your hand and either swear or affirm that what you will say will be the truth and all that. That is usually done as a group. They never hear me. They are usually toting between one and three hundred cases they have to work on. Most of them are a year or two out of law school and none of them would ever expect what you are about to unleash on them. At first appearance, the judge is going to inform you of your right to remain silent, read over the police report and determine they had probable cause to arrest you, inform you of your rights and set a bail; or not. He may let you go R.O.R., released on your own recognizes. He will make a court date for your arraignment and send you on your way. Next is the arraignment. Your case is called and the judge asks you how you plea. Number one, do not make a plea. This is something they never see, except with me. Once it has been retrieved everything starts up again. Now really read the law. The law may read that if you have 20 grams or less of marijuana it is a misdemeanor and if you have 20 grams or more it is a felony. So you look it over. For this scenario it is less than 20 grams. So you read the law. There are many scenarios that could happen next. It is all in how you want to play this. The judge is going to ask you how you plea. No matter what, you are still to determine whether or not this court and its players have jurisdiction over your body or not. Not yet at least. One thing we used to do back at the Compound in Atlanta, was to immediately inquire about the flag and why it has gold fringe and tassels hanging from it. According to title 4 of U.S. Code, chapter one about the flag, sections 1 and 2, give what a flag looks like. Section 8 is about respect to the flag. That flag is a flag of Admiralty. Why they fly that flag is all explained in there. Read it all. However, since the nineties, I have seen this military flag start to disappear. Back in 1994, I was living in Lexington, Kentucky, working on a few cases throughout the state. One was one of mine. He and Gatewood Galbreath were arrested at a pot demonstration. One day, we were listening to a call in show, which Gatewood was a guest on. That morning, in the newspaper The Lexington Herald, was a photo of a courtroom that showed an Admiralty flag flying in background. He said that no courtroom in America flies a flag of admiralty. When he was told to go to the Lexington Herald, he said that was probably left behind from some type of meeting that must have happened in there. I got it on tape. Not sure if I could still find it today. Maybe. If not, let it pass. Also, as I said, a lot of the courtrooms have removed this flag today, so you might not even get the chance to use this in court. Another case stopper that pretty much guaranteed you walked away from the charges, was mention of the original 13th amendment of 1819. There is pleanty on this subject in my book, or on line. Upon looking over the letter of the law, kindly mention that you have discovered the original 13th amendment to the constitution, ratified in 1819, and that you believe there are foreign agents working for the court. You then ask the judge, the court, if you may have a continuance so that you may study this more closely, then file a copy of the law with the court. The judge may grant your request or he might not. If he does not, then go to the next step, if he says sustains it, says yes, then leave after making a new court date. You may also at this time go to the next step, which will be in the making of motions. This is why it is important not to make a premature plea. There are many pre plea motions that you will lose the right to make once you have entered into a plea. So, never enter into any pleas. If you are still standing there, ask for a continuance so that you may prepare and file any pre plea motions. The judge should have no problem doing that for ya. You want to make very clear to the court that you do not give up your right guaranteed by the sixth amendment or a speedy trial, and you in no way want this continuance to be seen as a disqualifier for the speedy trial act. Once you ask for more time, the speedy trial act is off the table for good, so make sure to reserve that right. Or, you can be one of the people who enter the jail with your motions already in hand and file your motions right there and then with the judge. It is then up to the judge to set the motions on the schedule and continue the case until then. Or they might here them then and there. The prosecution would have to be in on that. More than likely though, the prosecution will need some time to go over the motions and prepare an answer to them, so it is very likely that your case will be continued to the hearing date. Now these motions will be pre written by both you and me before your planed actions commence. They will have the proper court names and parties on each of them, along with a blank line for where the case number will go. Each will be tailored to fit the state and crime of each case. Some of the motions I have written and filed will be placed on this page, as soon as I can gather them up. Read them to get some ideas. All motions will cover a rang of subjects from the constitutionality of the law to the jurisdiction of the courts. That is another possible thing you can all fight. If the judge either hears your pre plea motions and denies them all, or just runs your through the process, never, under any circumstance, enter a plea. You will not submit to the jurisdiction. Once you do, they have you. So you make it known that you go kicking and screaming all the way. You tell them that. You just tell him that you cannot afford an attorney as they want more for an hour of work then you make in day or a week or something like that. Then you express your distrust of the any court appointed attorney, the public pretender, because the plaintiff pays for them and those who arrested you, and you feel that any lawyer would cover his bliss source before he covered his client. He might want to assign a lawyer to you, just incase you need some help. You can do whatever you want. You can always call or email him questions you might have. Either way, it is you who will handle the case and not them. Sometimes, I will take a public pretender with the intent of using him all the way to the closing argument. If we ever got there, I would fire him and tell the jury about FIJA. You are not going to be representing yourself, you are going to be yourself. Pro Se means you represent yourself. So, rather then standing before the court, Pro Se, you will stand there, In Propria Persona. That means you are the real person in the matter and you question their perceived jurisdiction over you. All your paperwork will be signed that way. Judges hate having to deal with a defendant. First off, they have to look them in the eye and talk directly to them. The judge does, and so do the defendants. With a lawyer, the judges can disconnect themselves from the defendants. But when there is no lawyer it becomes more personal. It is no longer the meat grinder, it is a person whose eyes they have to look at and lie to. If any of you are real brave and think you have a good grip on the conspiracy and what is going on, and you think you can be a good lawyer, then another aspect you can go after is the fact that the courtrooms only let licensed attorneys work for plaintiffs or defendants. When the judge starts telling you that only a licensed attorney can tell you what to do, or something like that, you tell him that sounds like a monopoly for the American Bar Association and that you will probably be filing charges against them for this practice. The judge will probably blow that off and look for any reason to allow you to go it alone. For those of you who will be using a jailhouse or ex bar member lawyers, which we will call the New World Ninjas, you too should keep this in mind. Who ever is representing you, will speak for you and file the already signed power of attorney form you and the arrestee brought with you. In fact, if at possible, the New World Ninjas will file all that with the court before you even see a judge, if possible. Maybe even before the start of the action. All that having just been taken care of, now the judge is going to demand a plea from you, maybe not. Maybe your case will be continued. But if not, and you find yourself standing before the judge who is demanding you make a plea, you then switch to inquiring about the plaintiff. You want to make sure you understand the nature of the charges, but more importantly, the nature of the plaintiff. Doing that could backfire on you as well. The judge could hold you for a 710-30 hearing saying that you are not mentally capable of assisting in your defense. Writ of Habeas Corpus is supposed to be suspended right now in this country, so it will be interesting to see how they deal with hundreds of them being filed. Let him. It shows you never answered the jurisdiction question and stood moot while the state entered you into this matter. Good luck. Other pages will be drawn up to deal with the trial, but I doubt many of you will ever get that far. I have a feeling that most of them will be dropped.
