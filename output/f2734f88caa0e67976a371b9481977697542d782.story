But the project they want to kill is not the long-sought modernization of Caltrain: they are aiming at high-speed rail, which would ultimately use the same rails as Caltrain in the Bay Area. The electrification project is a way to bring immediate greenhouse gas emission benefits to a corridor that will eventually be served by high-speed rail. Using old diesel engines, Caltrain currently provides more than 60,000 daily trips between San Jose and San Francisco. Electrification would not only reduce emissions immediately but allow Caltrain to add more trains and boost service along this very busy corridor. The funds, in fact, are sought by the Caltrain Joint Powers Board, not by the High-Speed Rail Authority, and are aimed at improving Caltrain, not building high-speed rail. Streetsblog, among others, called him out on his mistake, but his article seems to have had its intended effect. Clearly the Republicans who wrote to Chao read at least that far. The grant agreement is currently under a 30-day review, which ends on February 18. If the DOT declines to approve it, the Caltrain electrification project may be dead for now. Our minimum wage increase has not only helped our poorest workers, it has boosted the economy while unemployment continues to drop. That said, the people of Fresno should be BEGGING for this train to bring 21st Century signs of life to that large he.. hole. And shame on their elected politicians to advocate otherwise. mmlowe Fresno is a very large Metropolitan area in need of some positive Economic growth. Greater Fresno is DISMAL. This defies logic. If they are successful Fresno gets to remain an isolated area flowing backward to NO where. The election is 18 months away. Focus on Denham of Modesto. He is the weakest. Used to be a Democratic seat. Actions have consequences. It amazes me how these 14 republicans can betray your own State. They all need to be voted out. But the whole point of debating policy issues is to at least try to arrive at sensible policies regardless of how we may differ on what that means. To me it makes sense for the Democrats in charge of California to dump a dumb, botched-from-the-beginning high-speed rail project and instead raise the money to electrify Caltrain, which I agree is a good idea. The end result of this will be potentially scrapping Caltrains electrification, which will have devastating impacts on the quality of life of everyone who rides Caltrain or breathes the air anywhere around the Caltrain corridore. The IER and proposals for Caltrain electrification do allow for future HSR, but they do stand on their own even if HSR never happens. Rob Anderson No. California should dump that and pay to electrify Caltrain instead. Marven Norman No, I just go on the website and read the documents. Marven Norman Yes, cap-and-trade is up in the air, but there are now Democratic supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature and even interests like the WSPA now are expressing interest in seeing the program continued, so I would be surprised if it is not ultimately reaffirmed. Ziggy Tomcich The push for electrfication should be focused on solving the health problems with breathing the 40 different carcinogenic gases those dirty old diesel locomotives spew out. All of us can smell that awful Caltrain stench long after a train left the station. Cumulatively those diesel locomotives are dirtier and more toxic than a coal driven power plant running up and down people back yards along the peninsula. The politicians that are opposing Caltrain electrification are only doing so because they want the people of the Bay Area to suffer both economically and physically for no reason other than their hatred towards us. The only argument against Caltrain electrification is ignorance and hatred. Rob Anderson The cap and trade legislation is being litigated and the legislature may not renew it. The project was fatally flawed from the start, since there was no guaranteed source of money to build the system. Flubert For HSR that is probably most true. This is all about CAHSR, which the rural areas hate, under the mistaken belief that they are actually the ones paying for it. Marven Norman So if the Feds withhold the money, it just spites Caltrain. So go ahead, cancel the Caltrain electrification. Marven Norman The initial operating segment is from Bakersfield to San Jose. Flubert Read the article. The two are related, Flubert All I know is that Hilary lost, and some folks are still struggling to understand that, let alone come to terms with it. Richard I wonder how much has been spent to date. The feds money is last in, first out and would need to be repaid. So if the CAHSR is killed, there probably wont be any more money coming from the state for pet projects like Caltrain and Metrolink improvements. Rob Anderson This may be the only issue that Republicans are right about. On the other hand, I think electrifying Caltrain is a good idea. But it should be done without high-speed rail money. Governor Brown should kill the high-speed rail project and instead get money for Caltrain. President Obama and the Democrats made a big mistake on the high-speed rail project, and I say that as a Democrat who voted for him twice. Richard In your fantasy world perhaps. Hillary won Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, Miami, Austin, and San Antonio. She lost the states, but won the cities. Marven Norman Well no, the stated effect is to harm CAHSR, but the actual effect will be to harm Caltrain. If they succeed at this, Caltrain is the only one that will lose out as the CAHSR business plan has an IOS through San Jose, not San Francisco. Dan Allison Caltrain is not a vast transit scheme, it is a successful system used by thousands. I do use Caltrain, and my observation says the end points are the most prominent. Flubert Republicans are typically more sceptical about vast transit schemes, and the risk that HSR is a multi-billion dollar boondoggle is non-zero. It had nothing to do with other states. The main point of the article is that by going after HSR with a blunt instrument, Republicans were harming Caltrain, which though it runs through suburban areas, is serving the urban areas at both ends, San Francisco and San Jose. Almost every major city in the South, Texas and Arizona voted for Trump, as did many mid-sized Mid-Western cities. And anyway, south of the 22nd Street station in SF, CalTrain stops are all in suburban areas. Erik Griswold Remember, the Republicans listed above are all about screwing over their own state. Like petulant toddlers, they will stew in their and others own poop just to make a point. They hate high-tech because of the globalization-realities that it entails. So screwing over the peninsula that houses it has an appeal to these luddites. The current HSR business plan calls for opening first to San Jose, so this has absolutely zero bearing on whether HSR will be able to start running on the IOS. It wouldn't require any transfers and it would save hours off the current trip, making it competitive with driving. Local officials are trying to adjust on the fly to salvage the project. If all goes according to plan, electric services will begin in 2020.
