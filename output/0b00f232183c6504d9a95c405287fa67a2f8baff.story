The city said it was investigating the possible leak of up to 24 gallons (91 liters) of an asphalt emulsifier called Indulin AA-86. The chemical can cause eye and skin burns, respiratory tract irritation and damage to the digestive systems but is not known to be carcinogenic, according to safety data. The Gulf of Mexico coastal city, home to oil and petrochemicals operations and a large port, asked residents to use only bottled water and to avoid showering with tap water until it could verify the water supply was safe. The city expected water testing results later on Thursday and told residents to discontinue tap water use at least until then. Local officials plan to set up spots in the city to distribute bottled water. City spokeswoman Kim Womack said several area cities and supermarkets are donating water, and she appealed to others to send drinking water to Corpus Christi. Energy company Valero said it believed the possible backflow problem came from third-party operations in the area of its asphalt terminal.
