History of the Jews in Saudi Arabia From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Not to be confused with History of the Jews in the Arabian Peninsula. Map of the territory and area covered by present-day Saudi Arabia. The history of Jews in Saudi Arabia refers to the Jewish history in the areas that are now within the territory of Saudi Arabia. It is a history that goes back to Biblical times. Banu Nadir was particularly hostile to Muhammad's new religion. Other Jewish tribes lived relatively peacefully under Muslim rule. He may have hoped to settle there, but there is controversy about the reasons for his travels. It has been suggested he may have had a commercial motive as well as a religious one. The city has a population of 287,841 (2004 census) and is part of a larger populated oasis area of towns and villages of around 600,000. It is located inland, southwest of Abqaiq and the Dhahran-Dammam-Al-Khobar metropolitan area on the road south to Haradh. With increased persecution, the Jews of Najran made plans to evacuate. Saudi soldiers accompanied them to the Yemeni border. The Saudi King Abdulaziz demanded their return, but the Yemeni king, Ahmad bin Yahya refused, because these refugees were Yemenite Jews. According to Yemenite Jewish tradition, the Jews of Najran traced their origin to the Ten Tribes. Persons with an Israeli government stamp in their passport or who are openly Jewish are generally not permitted into the Kingdom. In late December 2014, the newspaper Al-Watan reported that the Saudi Labor ministry website permits foreign workers of a variety of different faiths, including Judaism, to live and work in Saudi Arabia. In practice Christians and Jews may hold religious services but only in their homes and may not invite Muslims. Beirut. 1988. Dar Al-Marifa Publication. Beirut. Al-Nafezah Publication. Cairo. 2006.
