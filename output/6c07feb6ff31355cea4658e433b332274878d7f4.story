What really made Poltergeist a cult classic with cultural import that continues to hit harder and harder was that everything, from the daughter getting swallowed alive by TV Land to the son being terrorized by his own overgrown toys were perfect metaphors for the real psychological horrors of modern American society. With the current ascension of a true Grinch president to the throne of the most powerful country in the history of countries just as the showdown over the Dakota Access Pipeline, which pit the overconsumption of fossil fuels that continues to drive the American Dream against the preservation of native ancestral lands, happening in the background, there is no better time to examine Poltergeist again than now. The horror is in our very foundation. The largest and longest continuous protest in U.S. history, Standing Rock was to me a sign that America was at last starting to deal with the ghosts in its closet. His use of horror movie language underlines just how grotesque this situation really is. The answer, if we pay attention to our native first peoples as well as our own top storytellers and myth-makers, everyone from Spielberg to Carlin to Dr. Seuss, may lie in the asphalt beneath our feet. Kunstler is right. Depression is now the leading cause of disability not just in the U.S., but across the globe, according to the World Health Organization. And its real. Not only are whole ecosystems being decimated to feed our oil addiction, but we are on the brink of launching another world war over the largest crude reserves left in the Middle East. Like Freddy Krueger on steroids we are intent on expanding our dream cum nightmare way past Elm Street to encircle the globe. The first is indigenous, the second is capitalist. At Standing Rock these same to two world views that are in conflict in the Amazon faced off right here on American soil. Like a real-life Poltergeist flick, the oil that suburban America needs to thrive needed to be transported across a real-life Native American sacred burial ground. To me, this is a sign that change is imminent. As I have argued over and over again in this column, indigenous and traditional ways of life point the way forward towards a planet free of both pollution and misery. For this to happen we are going to have to leave the fake security of our isolated homes and cars and join the Whos down in Whoville just like we did at Standing Rock. Just like they finally figured out at the end of Poltergeist, to exorcise this demon we are going to have to throw out the squawk box completely and join our brothers and sisters who are already on the front line. In the end, the only way to wake up from the nightmare is to completely face reality and reclaim the ground beneath our feet.
