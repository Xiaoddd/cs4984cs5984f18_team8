A new bill would protect drivers who 'unintentionally' hit Dakota Access protesters with their cars Sonam Sheth Jan. 26, 2017, 2:04 PM createPerformanceMark('first image displayed'); Native Americans and other activists celebrate after learning an easement had been denied for the Dakota Access pipeline at Oceti Sakowin Camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation on December 4, outside Cannon Ball, North Dakota. House Bill 1203, which began receiving committee hearings last week, was written as a direct response to protests at the Standing Rock reservation in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, against the Dakota Access pipeline, Rep. Keith Kempenich, the bill's lead sponsor, told The Star Tribune. He said however that the legislation would not protect those who intentionally hit pedestrians on the roadway, and it would not protect drivers who hit jaywalkers or children who wander off the sidewalk and onto the road. The bill's text highlights no such exemptions, according to James Grijalva, a professor at the University of North Dakota School of Law and Director of the Northern Plains Indian Law Center. The bill's text, in effect, creates a specific exception to North Dakota's code of criminal law relating to negligent homicide, which is classified as a felony in the state. Whether HB 1203 will become law remains to be seen. Clark and other activists are gearing up for a fight on the heels of executive orders signed by President Donald Trump on Tuesday aimed at advancing the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines. Activists have promised grassroots opposition to Trump's executive actions. He also promised to continue to financially support the millennial groups working to curb the effects of climate change through his organization, NextGen Climate. HB 1203 isn't the only bill introduced in the North Dakota legislature in response to the pipeline protests. One proposed bill would make it a crime for adults to wear masks, and another would allow the state to sue the federal government over policing costs related to pipeline protests.
