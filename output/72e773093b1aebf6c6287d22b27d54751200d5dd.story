Certain information has been redacted from the records, either because specifically required by law or pursuant to the Wis. Stat. In addition, I have been mindful in preparing these records for release that the purpose of the Wisconsin public records law is to shed light on the workings of government and the official acts of public officers and employees. Building and Constr. Trades Council v. Waunakee Comm. Sch. Dist., 221 Wis. 2d 575, 582, 585 N.W.2d 726 (Ct. App. 1998). Home telephone numbers and personal cell telephone numbers have been redacted pursuant to the Wis. Stat. In performing the balancing test, I determined that the public interest in disclosure of this information is outweighed by the public interest in the expectation of privacy on the part of individuals in their personal lives. Direct telephone numbers assigned to specific law enforcement officers have been redacted pursuant to the Wis. Stat. In applying the public records balancing test to these phone numbers, I concluded that the strong public interest in effective investigation and prosecution of criminal activity outweighs any public interest in disclosure of these direct telephone numbers of law enforcement officers. General use, publically available telephone numbers for the law enforcement agencies have not been redacted from the records. Wis. Stat. Pursuant to Wis. Stat. Pursuant to Wis. Stat.
