Call on President Obama to direct the Corps to instead cancel all permits for construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and investigate police violence and intimidation tactics. In this week's parshah, Toldot, we read about how the Phillistines blocked up the wells Abraham had dug, forcing Isaac to redig them in search of Rechovot--wide open spaces where he could live in peace. The Native American water protectors are standing up not just for their own protection but for all of us who want clean water, sacred sites, and human rights protected from corporate greed. Tell the government that, as Jews, we stand with the protectors for the right of peaceful protest. If the pipeline is not completed by January 1st, it has the potential to be permanently halted. Email the President now and ask him to leave us this legacy.
