November 30, 2016 Dear Governor Dalrymple and Sheriff Kirchmeier: I pray that this letter finds you well, and I want to assure you of my prayers. It has been my privilege to visit and learn firsthand about the Standing Rock Sioux Nation and the Dakota Access Pipeline, and I appreciate the complexity of the conflict you currently manage. The Episcopal Church is grateful to stand with the people of Standing Rock in their efforts to respect and protect the Missouri River and the sacred burial grounds of the Sioux Nation. We do so seeking to follow the way of Jesus of Nazareth who taught us that love of God and love of our neighbor is the highest moral law and religious duty (Matthew 22:37-40, Luke 10:25-37). Hundreds of Episcopal clergy and lay leaders have traveled with other people of faith to Standing Rock over the past several months to bear non-violent witness to the water-protection efforts underway near Sacred Stone Camp. Reports from the ground from our own members present alarming accounts of undue force used by law enforcement against the water protectors. I also ask that you take action to address and stop the use of water cannons and rubber bullets, as well as the use of military equipment that escalates tensions between the parties. I am deeply concerned about the number of protectors who have been injured, and the potential loss of life that could result from the continued use of these tactics. A delegation of approximately 30 chaplains trained to assist people experiencing trauma will be standing with the water protectors in the coming days, especially as veterans also gather this weekend to stand with Standing Rock. These religious chaplains are called to care for those who are wounded, traumatized, or seeking spiritual support; they have pledged not to participate in demonstration activities. As they carry out their work, I ask that you safeguard them, ensuring that they meet no harm or violence as they seek to bring healing to all those gathered at Standing Rock. I close once again asking your patience, attention and respect for the people and communities in your care. Please trust that we will keep you in our prayers moving forward. If our church may be of assistance in the creation of a peaceful and just way forward, I would welcome that invitation. Faithfully, The Most Reverend Michael B. Curry Presiding Bishop and Primate of the Episcopal Church Tags Advocacy Peace & Justice, Dakota Access Pipeline, Indigenous Ministries, Presiding Bishop Michael Curry, Standing Rock Comments (46) Donna Jerome says: December 2, 2016 at 11:06 am Unfortunately, Really seems like the Episcopal Church is becoming a political lobbying organization. Brenda Harris says: December 2, 2016 at 11:45 am Fortunately I see a broad base of love that has come from the church to help assist those in need. We will help them maintain their optimal health and will help with their spiritual needs. We do stand with them and will help them. Catherine Cheek says: December 2, 2016 at 12:29 pm The Episcopal Church is carrying out the teachings of our Lord, Jesus Christ, to love and seek justice. If that is lobbying, I support it. Melissa L. Smith, PhD says: December 2, 2016 at 1:37 pm Doing what Jesus did, speaking up for the disenfranchised among us. Gayle Fisher-Stewart says: December 2, 2016 at 2:49 pm The Episcopal Church is following in the footsteps of Jesus; going to places where people are hurting, where people are living into who God has called them to be; challenging the status quo which says that some people are more important than others. I agree, if that is political lobbying, then count me in. Christine Draughon Wantland says: December 2, 2016 at 5:41 pm The Church has always stood for justice and the oppressed. I hope you will join us in this action because it is the only action that will bring us back together. Will Smith, MS says: December 2, 2016 at 7:39 pm Donna Jerome, In the Book of Common Prayer, pp. Richest blessings. Tad Tadlock says: December 2, 2016 at 7:53 pm There is a vast difference between political lobbying and following the teachings and example of Jesus. Without that commitment resulting in the willingness to stand against the politics of greed and the need to control, this country would still have laws on its books approving of and sustaining racism and other forms of injustice. Barbara Cavin says: December 3, 2016 at 10:52 am In a way, yes. Cynthia Bloomquist says: December 3, 2016 at 9:04 pm The Episcopal Church has alays supported the Christian value of nonviolaence. And support of the disdnfranchised. The first Episcopal Bishop in Minnesota two centuries ago, worked as a partner with the Chippewa. The MN Episcopal flag is a broken tomahawk and a cross combined. At devout ceremonies like the induction of Bishops, there are always drumming circles. So we have not become political suddenly. In the 60s and 70s we provided sanctuary for frightened immigrants. And to be witnesses and counselors in times of trauma. Christianity is not a passive thing. Episcoopal Community Services is always on the front lines. Kate Rose says: December 2, 2016 at 11:21 am Thank you Bishop, chaplain and water protectors. Elaine Wilson-Reddy says: December 2, 2016 at 11:45 am Thank you, Presiding Bishop Curry for asking for the monitoring and safety of the water protectors, the veteran protectors, and the chaplains. You are our role model in living the Jesus Movement. Catherine Cheek says: December 2, 2016 at 12:30 pm That is being done. It was mentioned in church last week. Nancy Mott says: December 3, 2016 at 11:45 am PB Curry is clear in his expressions of caring and prayer for persons of all sides AS PERSONS. That crime against property went right against the core values of many of us. They are the ones who know how to help and what to do. They do it all the time. David Whitted says: December 2, 2016 at 12:10 pm Thank you, Bishop. Thank you for making sure we treat others as we would like to be treated. Donna Blankman says: December 2, 2016 at 2:45 pm Thank you Bishop Curry. This needs to be said over and over until reasonable action takes the place of aggressive tactics. Rev. Kathleen Bleyaert, Ph.D. says: December 2, 2016 at 3:04 pm Bishop Curry, Thank you for guiding all of us to lovingly, compassionately, and directly address challenging situations. May we all continue to pray and try to find a constructive, respectful, and peaceful solution. Chaplains with special training and experience can bring a healing presence. Thank you for your strong and compassionate leadership regarding the travesty that is NODAPL. christine grem says: December 2, 2016 at 5:06 pm I encourage any one of white privlege to stand up not stand by and go pray and thank out water warriors. They will thank you for coming and there will be no violence when the crowd is filled with faces of many colors. John Miller says: December 2, 2016 at 7:16 pm Thank you Bishop Michael for your speaking out and offering a hand of reconciliation to the ND governor. I believe Jesus would be among those Native Americans and their other supporters. The Rev. Gayle Bridges, deacon says: December 2, 2016 at 10:27 pm I am very proud of the Episcopal Church and PB Michael Curry. I will pray for the chaplains that are going to Standing Rock. I wish I was going. But probably not physically able. I went for Katrina Relief in Louisiana twice for SAMSHA. We are one in Christ. Valerie Ohle says: December 3, 2016 at 2:08 pm I think Donna Jerome has the Episcopal Church confused with the churches and ministries of Franklin Graham, Jerry Falwell, John Hagee, Marcus Lamb, James Dobson, et al. Susan Fiore says: December 3, 2016 at 8:18 pm Our Presiding Bishop is not a toadie of money and power. Those who choose to remain ignorant about the impact of these pipelines, and oil itself, on our air, water and soil have no right to an opinion. Those who choose to put money and power ahead of our children and the future of our planet are among those whom Jesus called hypocrites, snakes and vipers, whited sepulchres. Christians are not called to be cowards, we are called to care for one another and creation itself. Kathryn Kerr says: December 3, 2016 at 10:08 pm Thank you, Bishop Curry for being the leader we need. It is clear from the comments that the work of Evangelism is still needed even within the Body of Christ called Episcopalians. If there is an allegiance higher in ones heart than the promises made at baptism then soul searching is needed. May we all stand with those who seek to do justice. The Episcopal Church is helping the victims in TN. Peace be with you. Carolyn Legg says: February 8, 2017 at 12:07 pm To quote the presiding Bishop, The Most Rev. Curry, If is not about love, it is not about Jesus. This pipeline is not about love but greed. The oil is not for the US but will be exported. We must support the downtrodden as Jesus commanded. The government is breaking another treaty and not respecting the sacred land of the Native Americans who were here first. Comments are closed. You have reached our comment limit of 5.
