On a fargo radio show Friday morning, Creamer said he expects the Environmental Impact Study, granted earlier this week under the Obama administration, will be rescinded, possibly as soon as Monday. He said that the easement to drill under Lake Oahe would be ordered and issued next week, and that construction to finish the line would begin soon. Because the next administration could rescind it at any time. And I would expect that Dakota Access could begin finishing that line within a week.
