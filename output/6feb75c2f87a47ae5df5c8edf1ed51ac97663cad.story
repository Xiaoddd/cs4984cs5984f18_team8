It is received wisdom that it must be so; everyone says it is so. The expert panel on the NEB commissioned by the Trudeau government made this point. No, said the NEB. In the NEB Kinder Morgan hearings, the largest union in the oilsands, Unifor, intervened. You might be forgiven for assuming that a union, interested in jobs, intervened to ensure Kinder Morgan got built. You would be wrong. Unifor attempted to enter evidence that building Kinder Morgan would cost jobs. The Alberta Federation of Labour represents 170,000 workers in Alberta. Shipping out unprocessed solid bitumen to refineries in other countries ships out Canadian jobs at the same time. And it increases the carbon footprint of the product. In 1953, when the Trans Mountain pipeline was first built, it was not for export. It shipped crude to four refineries on the Lower Mainland. Shipping solid bitumen diluted with toxic fossil-fuel condensate for export bypasses the last remaining refinery. That refinery cannot process bitumen. It has already cut its workforce by 30 per cent, and if Kinder Morgan goes ahead, it will likely close. The NEB refused to accept the evidence. It ruled that its mandate did not include jobs, or climate, or upstream or downstream impacts. The claim that the Kinder Morgan expansion would create 15,000 jobs is thrown around in the cloud of confetti. B.C. economist Robyn Allan went on a quest for the source of the claim. The more realistic figure is less than 20 per cent that size. There is no technology to clean up a dilbit spill. NRCan studies are also in tanks in Alberta. What DFO found in real-world conditions is that the diluent separated from the bitumen and the bitumen formed oil balls around bits of sand and sediment and sank. By all means, let Kinder Morgan spill its dilbit in tanks of water in Alberta. But it must not put our marine environment at risk. Certainly, creating a petulant trade spat between provinces is not. Ignoring Indigenous rights is not. We need an energy policy that puts energy security, jobs and climate action as shared goals. Build upgraders and refineries in Alberta, sell finished product across Canada; end the import of foreign oil; and plan for an orderly phase-out of fossil fuels. Decades from now, we might realize that a molecule of carbon is more valuable for petrochemicals than for burning.
