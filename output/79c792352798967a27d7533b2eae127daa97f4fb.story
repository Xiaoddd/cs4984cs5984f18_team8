They say the cleanup process is expected to resume shortly. ORIGINAL STORY: At a press conference Thursday, North Dakota Highway Patrol Lieutenant Tom Iverson said 33 people were arrested near the Oceti Sakowin protest camp Thursday morning. Since the eviction notice was delivered, 44 people have been arrested. Iverson said cleanup has not started, as they are waiting to make sure the camp is cleared before continuing the cleanup process. This is a developing story.
