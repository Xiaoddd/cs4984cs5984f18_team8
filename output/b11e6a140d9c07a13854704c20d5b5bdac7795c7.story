By Simon Worrall PUBLISHED March 12, 2017 Within a week of his inauguration, President Trump signed an executive memorandum reviving the Keystone XL pipeline that President Obama had previously blocked. Set the scene for us and tell us how you came up with the idea for this insane trip. I wanted to write a book about that but ran out of money, so I moved to Alaska and got a job dishwashing in the middle of the Prudhoe Bay oil fields. The Keystone XL was all over the news. People were going to jail over it, protesting it. Here were these people living lives of meaning and sacrifice on this important battleground in the war over climate change. And yet here I was, washing dishes for the oil industry. It was a kind of existential crisis. So my buddy Liam, who was a cook working alongside me, suggested we hike the Keystone XL pipeline. So my hike became a solo adventure: Frodo going by himself to Mount Doom. by STEPHEN ST. Cliff Tice of the Dare County Sheriff's Department walks down damaged NC 12 leading into Mirlo Beach in Rodanthe,NC on Tuesday, Oct. 30, 2012. Doubters. New Jersey coastline post hurricane Sandy. Concerns over BPA's potentially toxic effects led manufacturers to develop a range of similar-looking alternatives. But mounting research suggests these, too, may pose health risks. You started your trek in the tar sands of Alberta. Give us a picture of this landscape and explain how the pipeline will increase the threat to the environment posed by the tar sands. The tar sands are a massive area in Northern Alberta, about 54,000 square miles or the size of England. But to get to the oil you have to bulldoze the boreal forest and create this hellish, lunar landscape with enormous tailings ponds where they put the liquid residue from the refining process; giant, black fields of petroleum coke, which is an extract from the refining process; and these weird, yellow sulfur pyramids. What a project like the Keystone XL will do is make this area expand, by creating more demand for the tar sands area to be developed. There is wildlife displacement, Native American villages are experiencing unprecedented rates of cancer, the rivers are being polluted, and the tar sands themselves are contributing unbelievable amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Tell us about some of the random acts of kindness you received. I walked into this project as a cynic, a misanthrope. One time in Oklahoma, while trespassing over land alongside a road, a truck rode past me. Yet, more often than not, they responded with hospitality, compassion, and charity. I was called crazy and told that I was going to be shot, pretty much every day. Anyone who goes on an adventure has to deal with that. As to the pipeline, it varied by region. In Alberta and Saskatchewan, they were in support of the pipeline because oil is such a huge part of their economies. Alberta is like the Canadian version of Texas. Many people oppose the proposed Keystone XL pipeline because they fear it will contaminate the aquifer. They are very afraid the pipeline will contaminate their precious source of water. Soon after I entered Nebraska, I spoke with a woman at a library, who posted a little thing about my walk on Facebook. It took off with Keystone XL pipeline radicals, and soon enough I was being interviewed by local newspapers and TV. But the moment I walked across the border into Kansas, the light switch turned off. In Kansas, I was confronted by law enforcement 2-3 times a day. People were really suspicious and paranoid. I was no longer a champion of the environment. Now, I was an anonymous drifter. Talk about the logistical challenges you faced. I bought a lot of food, boxed it up, and my buddy in Denver then shipped these boxes of food to post offices along my route. I had a little tent. In the Great Plains, there are not many trees so oftentimes I camped out in the open under this big sky. They were usually very generous about offering me a lawn to set up my tent and often allowing me to sleep in the church. As a suburbanite from New York State, with no exposure to cattle, I was appropriately terrified. Talk about some of the highs and lows. I felt like I had the whole Great Plains to myself, and this region of North America is completely under-appreciated for its natural beauty. This was not a flat, boring landscape. This was rolling grasslands, with deer and pronghorn, and enormous skies with no hills or forests obstructing them. I would carry this wild joy in my chest for hours. And at the beginning of the trip I had terrible shin splints, so I was walking with unbearable pain every step of the way. You feel reluctant to bring them up because you know how explosive they are. When I did have conversations with folks about climate change, they usually dismissed it as a left-wing hoax or a government power grab. They were climate-change deniers. On the Great Plains I came across countless ghost towns and abandoned homes. The folks out there realize the sense of mortality when it comes to community. These are folks who see themselves as hardy, self-sufficient, small government individualists. This conflicts with so much of that heartland identity. When you hiked the pipeline it had not been approved. The pipeline got going in 2008. One of the driving forces behind my book was the idea of coming to terms with climate change and not feeling constant doomsday despair. Human beings are such terrible predictors of the future. But the climatologist Kerry Emanuel says we might also trigger a negative feedback loop. That may only be a sliver of hope. This interview was edited for length and clarity.
