Lonnie Whitemountain said he's a member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and drove 33 hours to take part.

The Two-Way Dakota Access Pipeline Court Challenge Denied, Oil Could Flow As Soon As Next Week According to a website set up by march organizers, the goal of the demonstrations is to highlight the responsibility of the federal government to respect tribal sovereignty. Since the Dakota Access Pipeline route near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation was approved in July 2016, tribal leaders have argued in public statements and court filings that their concerns about the pipeline were not adequately considered by the federal government. The march comes days after the latest legal setback for the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes, who are suing the Army Corps and the company building the Dakota Access Pipeline. On Tuesday, a federal judge denied a motion by the tribes to halt final construction of the portion of the pipeline that runs under part of the Missouri River called Lake Oahe. The pipeline company says oil could begin flowing as early as Monday.
