One of those bills made it illegal to wear a mask while committing a crime, while another increased the consequences for illegal protest activities. A third allows law enforcement to cite trespassing as they would, say, a speeding ticket. A fourth bill to make it illegal to cause economic harm while committing a misdemeanor crime, which has also been approved by the House, has not yet been taken up by the Senate. Minnesota has struggled struggled with its own extremist political movement. Raising fines for illegal protest activity is all well and good, but holding people who organize and perpetrate illegal protests financially liable for the mayhem they cause is a better way to address the problem. Opponents of the legislation are, of course, claiming that it intends to silence protest. But illegal protests are, you know, illegal. Those who use the tactic should be held responsible, but using the criminal code to address the situation can be tricky. Allowing for a civil remedy, on the other hand, makes much more sense.
