A variety of Oyster mushrooms have proven to be extremely efficient at consuming oil and turning it into a non-toxic compost in less than 3 months. Here is a video describing the process that was successfully used in 2007 during the oil spill in San Fransisco. Clearly this is a viable solution and we should be jumping at the chance to use it with the most recent spill. I would hope that all the top scientists and companies related to this disaster would be investigating this concept to the fullest extent. Sadly we are not hearing any recent news or anything updated on this topic. Hair naturally absorbs oil from air and water and acts as the perfect sponge for an oil slick. Once the mats are soaked with oil you can inject oyster mushroom mycelium or simply place it on the mats to absorb and grow off the oil. The mushrooms will take approximately 12 weeks to absorb all of the oil, converting the oily hair mats into nontoxic compost. This past event has inspired Spores101 to try and get involved and we are currently investigating ways we can help by using this technology given to us by nature.
