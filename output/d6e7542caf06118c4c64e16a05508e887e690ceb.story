GPS Trackers: Holiday Treat For Cities At Xmas The holidays can be a time for fun and excitement for both children and adults, but the holiday spirit also brings out more than it's fair share of Grinches. This is because many criminals see the Christmas holidays as an opportunity to take advantage of unsuspecting people. Although most individuals are probably aware that criminals will often cruise through parking lots, looking to find a vehicle stuffed full of holiday presents, many cities are also falling victim to criminal activity. The main target: nativity scenes. However, many towns are fighting back by using GPS trackers to help catch the bad guys who try and steal baby Jesus and other nativity scene figures during Christmas time. GPS Tracking: How Technology Is Safeguarding Jesus One of the more common forms of vandalism and theft occurs when some people feel it's a good idea to steal the centerpiece of a nativity scene, the baby Jesus. What makes GPS surveillance solutions so special is that they give police a quick and accurate way to locate any criminals who steal nativity scene pieces, even when hidden cameras and witnesses are not present.
