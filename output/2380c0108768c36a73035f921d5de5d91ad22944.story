Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that the US Army Corps of Engineers did not sufficiently evaluate the environmental impact of the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL) and needs to go back and redo its environmental assessment. Under NEPA, a federal agency must prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) that evaluates the impact of a major project (like a pipeline) on people in the area and on the environment. That would mean the pipeline couldn't operate the pipeline until the corps complies with the law. He could also decide to keep the pipeline running. protesters outside the Trump International Hotel in DC.

While the controversial pipeline, which has been transporting oil since June 1, continues to run, the possibility of it being shut down feels very real for the first time. The DAPL was the subject of massive protests and an encampment that attracted Native Americans and activists from across the country. The cause attracted media attention in the fall and winter, especially after clashes between activists and cops. Near the end of Barack Obama's term, the corps announced that it was looking at alternate routes, but that decision was quickly reversed under the Trump administration, prompting a court challenge from the tribe. The court found that the corps violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Under NEPA, a federal agency must prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) that evaluates the impact of a major project (like a pipeline) on people in the area and on the environment. The corps never did this. Watch: Toxic Air in Steam Valley In a sense, the decision puts them right back to where they were before Trump took office. The corps did prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA), which is the first step toward determining if an EIS is necessary. This was one of the issues at the heart of the tribe's case. The question now is obviously what happens next. That would mean the pipeline couldn't operate the pipeline until the corps complies with the law. That's complicated by the fact that the DAPL is already transporting oil along its 1,200-mile course. The court has the option of allowing the pipeline to stay operational for now and will hear arguments from both sides in the coming months. Next week, parties will meet before the judge in Washington, DC, to lay out the timeline for filing briefs. The judge could decide over the next few months that the pipeline needs to be shut down while the corps does its review. He could also decide to keep the pipeline running. The court didn't order a full EIS, but if after hearing arguments it decides that an EIS is necessary, that could potentially take years.
