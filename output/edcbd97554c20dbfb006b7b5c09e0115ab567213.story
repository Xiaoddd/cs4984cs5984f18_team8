Capital Weather Gang Polar vortex unleashed: Severe cold snap likely in U.S. next week By Jason Samenow Jason Samenow Editor and writer covering weather and climate Email Bio Follow December 7, 2016 European model simulation of progression of Arctic air between Monday and Thursday next week. A punishing blast of Arctic air will plunge into the northern half of the Lower 48 in five to seven days, dispensing some of the most frigid air since 2014 or 2015 in some areas. Computer models are unanimous in predicting that such a cold wave will occur, although they differ some on exactly how cold and how far south and east the Arctic air will penetrate. It is unlikely that this cold wave will be as intense as the January 2014 event because it is happening earlier in the winter and less snow is on the ground in North America (snow cover acts like a freezer and helps cold air masses stay cold when they exit the Arctic). The bitter cold air is expected to first arrive in the northern Rockies and northern Plains on Sunday. It should reach Chicago on Tuesday and the northeast United States by Wednesday or Thursday. While subject to change, the GFS model predicts temperatures from Chicago to western Montana to be 30 to 50 degrees colder than normal next Wednesday morning. Temperature difference from normal predicted by GFS model next Wednesday morning. Forecast low temperatures next Wednesday morning from GFS model. Minneapolis could have several days with highs in the single digits and lows below zero during the middle part of next week: GEFS outlook for Minneapolis:while it's Dec-like now wait until next week. This would mean the potential for subfreezing high temperatures between Washington and Boston. It is not clear whether extremely cold air will reach the southeastern United States. Its counter-clockwise circulation, coupled with two companion lobes of the vortex to its north, helps create what is essentially a superhighway for bitter cold air to stream across Siberia over the North Pole and into North America. European model simulation of high-altitude weather pattern next Tuesday. The red painted line is illustrative of cross-polar flow transporting frigid air into Lower 48.
