The North Dakota Legislative Management Committee canceled the 2017 tribal leader address to the state Legislature. The tribal leader address takes place every two years, at the start of each legislative session. The 2015 speech was delivered by Dave Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Chairman Richard McCloud of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians was more blunt about the cancellation. He gave the address in 2013. Chairwoman Myra Pearson of the Spirit Lake Nation was due to deliver the 2017 address. She told The Herald that relations have deteriorated to the point that she was recently refused entry to the State Capitol amid a Dakota Access protest. I was removed from there. In his January 8, 2015, address, Chairman Archambault called on the state and the federal government to work with tribes to address public safety, environmental and other impacts of energy development in North Dakota. And in prophetic remarks, he cited a need to protect the land and the water. North Dakota is home to five tribes: Standing Rock, Turtle Mountain, Spirit Lake, the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation and the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate. Native Americans represent 5.5 percent of the population in the state, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
