The Associated Press Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault said Monday it was time for Dakota Access oil pipeline opponents to leave a camp along the pipeline route in southern North Dakota. They believe the four-state pipeline threatens tribal drinking water and cultural sites. The Army Corps of Engineers has denied a permit for the pipeline to cross under a Missouri River reservoir in the area. Pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners could still prevail over the Corps in federal court. Another snowstorm was hitting the area Monday, and people in camp were busy shoring up housing and stockpiling firewood. Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Monday that the incoming president supports construction of the pipeline. The segment under Lake Oahe is the only remaining big chunk of construction on the 1,200-mile pipeline to carry North Dakota oil through the Dakotas and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. The pipeline is designed to carry oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Patoka, Illinois. State regulators in all four states approved the route through their territory. The proposed route skirts the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation that straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border. The company examined other routes when federal regulators conducted their initial environmental review. Energy Transfer Partners and the Corps agreed initially that the proposed route appeared to be the safest and most cost-effective path. The initial review looked at factors including the number of water crossings, how close the route came to homes and whether it crossed wetlands. One alternative the company considered called for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River north of Bismarck, about 50 miles upstream of the current path. That option was rejected because it was 10 miles longer and required more water and road crossings. Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault has said the tribe does not oppose oil pipelines if they do not threaten water sources, environmentally sensitive areas or sacred sites. He said a route that would follow existing west-east and north-south oil pipeline corridors that avoid Missouri River crossings would be acceptable to him. Stop watching this discussion.
