Since then, I've been wondering about what came of that initiative, and today being Martin Luther King Day felt like a good reason to do a bit of research on the topic. The boycott itself persisted from December 1, 1955, when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat, until December 20th, 1956, when the Supreme Court ruling ending bus segregation took effect. In that time, African Americans in Montgomery got intensely organized under the umbrella of the newly formed Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA), which held regular mass meetings and brought together leaders from a broad cross-section of the community. While the impetus for that organization's establishment was handling the logistics of the boycott, it also became a vehicle for advancing other civil-rights related projects, one of which was a credit union. Among these ideas, which were approved by the Executive Board on May 30th, includes the recommendation that: In order to valuably utilize the present relaxed phase of the bus situation and capitalize on the prevailing enthusiasm and amazing togetherness of the people, a strong emphasis shall be placed on ... increasing our economic power through the establishment of a bank. If the charter is denied at this level a committee shall be immediately sent to Washington to appeal for a charter through the head office of all savings and loan banks. The program committee shall be requested to allot more time in the mass meeting to the voting and banking committees for purposes of the idea over to the people. In the months that followed the idea of forming black-owned financial institutions apparently continued to percolate. To establish the first bank in Montgomery to be owned and operated by Negroes. We have found that in the present situation many Negroes who are active in the protests have been unable to secure loans from the existing banks. 2. To organize a credit union. As a result of the protest, there is a strong desire among the Negroes to pool their money for great cooperative economic programs. We are anxious to demonstrate that cooperation rather than competition is the way to meet problems. Despite these setbacks, however, King's interest in the credit union model remained strong. When he took up as pastor of Atlanta's Ebeneezer Baptist Church in 1960, he made the following recommendation to the congregation: In order to instill the idea of thrift in our members and reveal the concern of the Church for the economic life of man, a committee shall be appointed to organize a Credit Union. It is hoped that every member will become associated with this Credit Union, and that it will become a powerful economic agency in the community. The need for such an institution in our Church is unquestioned. It will serve as a channel through which members can save money, and it prevents them from having to go to downtown finance companies to make loans for exploitative interest rates. Actually when the individual makes a loan from the Credit Union of which he is a member, he is borrowing from himself. As a result, the Ebeneezer Credit Union was established in 1971 as part of a wave of Black Church Credit Unions that took root in that era. In any case, the above was about what I was able to track down with Google and an afternoon's work, so there's much left that I'm curious to learn more about, especially where the papers of the MIA's Credit Union Committee might be housed, and what happened to the Ebeneezer Credit Union. Fortunately, I will hopefully have a chance to find some answers on my coming trip in March, when I plan to take a train across the South conducting oral history interviews with African American credit union elders.
