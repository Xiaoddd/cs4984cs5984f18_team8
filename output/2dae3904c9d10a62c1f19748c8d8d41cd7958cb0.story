Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Stop the Plains All American Diamond Pipeline 0 have signed. Kamryn Baker started this petition to Senator John Boozman and 3 others In light of the recent events dealing with the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, there is another pipeline, here in our own backyard, that poses a large threat to our health, safety, and well-being in the Natural State. The pipeline itself will make its way through five different water systems, including the Arkansas River and Mississippi River. The company was cited and prosecuted over 10 oil spills from the years of 2004 to 2007 in states including Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Kansas. In 2010, the EPA ordered the company to revisit their pipelines and restructure, as they have not been meeting safety codes for many years. If we allow the Arkansas Public Service Commission, the Arkansas Government, and the Plains All American Diamond Pipeline the chance and opportunity to desecrate and destroy the natural beauty of the Ozark landscape, we will have done Arkansas a great disservice.

The pipeline itself will make its way through five different water systems, including the Arkansas River and Mississippi River. These water sources are major key components to not only the recreational activities of the 'Natural State', but also to the citizens who drink the water that comes from these river systems. Plains All American Pipeline L.P. is a natural gas and petroleum distributor located out of Houston, Texas. company was cited and prosecuted over 10 oil spills from the years of 2004 to 2007 in states including Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Kansas. In 2010, the EPA ordered the company to revisit their pipelines and restructure, as they have not been meeting safety codes for many years. Obviously, safety and the request for more did not mean much because in both 2011 and 2012, Canadian crude oil companies monitored and owned by the Plains All American Pipeline suffered from large oil pipeline spills that together dumped over 40,000 barrels into rivers and Alberta Boreal forest areas. we allow the Arkansas Public Service Commission, the Arkansas Government, and the Plains All American Diamond Pipeline the chance and opportunity to desecrate and destroy the natural beauty of the Ozark landscape, we will have done Arkansas a great disservice.
