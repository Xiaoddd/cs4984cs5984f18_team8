The truth is that at the center of both conflicts, real and ficticious, they share a common core: The very same beating heart. And, despite representing two very different cultures, the themes of social identity, environmental health, and healing old wounds ring just as true in both cases. Well, here's the rub. To expand the concept, in many peoples' opinions, good art should mirror and comment upon the world at large; bring something new to the table, so to speak. Contextualizing any piece of art is an important step in any act of conscious creation. The bottom line: Art isn't made in a vacuum. The artists over at Disney definitely have their mouse-eared thumbs resting on culture's pulse at all times. Their movies have grown and changed with the times they are produced in. This is, in fact, a huge factor in their success. Their newest blockbuster hit continues this tradition, whether it was entirely aware of it or not. Or something more eloquent.). By this time, if you haven't been living in a pit at the bottom of the sea (like actor Jemaine Clement's brilliantly Bowie-an Tamatoa), you will have seen pictures or heard about the amazing North Dakotan camp-in of the Standing Rock water protectors against the Dakota Access Pipeline. It is an uncannily familiar new chapter in the continual American land grab story - the needs of a Native nation are trampled over by the greed of the rich. Though the proposed legal easement to build under a river (and its tributaries) used for drinking water was recently denied by the Army Corps, that victory is nothing less than a crucial but indecisive battle in the less-than-proverbial war. The important takeaway here is that it is not the time to back off or be lulled into any sense of complacency. The easement decision was announced two weeks ago, and already major news sources have stopped running anything on the story. It is a good thing then, that Disney films with boppin' tunes, a plucky hero, and a wholesome story often stick around in the public vernacular and conscience a little longer. There are a plethora of lush parallels to be sketched from Moana and the Standing Rock story; the first of which is the dedication to keeping indigenous tradition, spirit, and cultures alive in a changing world. Moana's relationship to her grandmother and upholding her village's tradition parallels the relationship many Native people have experienced in passing down their culture generation to generation. Many Native water protectors have said that their efforts go beyond protecting the environment to increasing solidarity between Native nations as they work together toward a peaceful and spiritually charged demonstration. His wise words bring us to another potent message that both feature: the act of giving Mother Earth the love and respect she deserves. For those who haven't seen the film, and chose to keep reading anyway, here is a super speedy breakdown of the plot points this article concerns itself with: Moana is laden with the task of returning the sacred heart of earth goddess Te Fiti to her before too much gets wonky. Demi-god Maui's greedy need for validation and power over humans convinced him that stealing it would bring him and the human race control over the environment, as well as plenty of extra fame and fortune. After a visually stunning boss battle between Te Ka and Maui, Moana finally recognizes Te Ka for Te Fiti, and heals Te Ka by returning her the heart. It is a gorgeous, Disney-simplified demonstration of the way humanity has been treating the earth for far too many years. In this story, any sort of greed is shown to be cruel, and generosity, as in Moana's offering of the heart, is given the properly positive weight it deserves. In much the same fashion, blaming the earth for protesting the treatment we have given it ourselves with rising temperatures, more natural disasters, and a lack of biodiversity, is as effective as Maui battling Te Ka: not effective at all... Actually making the situation worse. The only way to move forward - to push past the uneducated, ignorant views of Donald Trump and others who refuse to hear Mother Earth's call for help - is to place focus on game changer movements, like Standing Rock, that raise global consciousness of the many ways Mother Earth has her heart stolen out from under her by the industrial extractions she endures every day. The only answer lies in having the courage and wisdom to heal the wounds we have inflicted by asking for forgiveness and changing our actions. I understand that this analysis may seem oversimplifying of two very complicated and diverse cultures; my intent was never to lump them together, but instead to use them as two examples of the shift in consciousness that we can only hope is occurring in the western world at this time. For such an enlightened way of thought to be brought to a national and international awareness level at an uncannily close range in time shows that there is progress being made, and as that people can affect change when they follow their inner truth. In the coming years, I hope to see us all be able to live in better peace with our planet. Click here for some simple ways to take a stance and decrease your footprint.

There is a stigma in society that implies one who is more inclined toward science and math will somehow be more successful in life, and that one who is more passionate toward literature and other art forms will be destined to a life of low-paying jobs and unsatisfying careers. Somewhere along the line, the world has come to think that literature is insignificant. To me, however, literature serves as a gateway to learning of the past and expanding my knowledge and understanding of the world. Here are just a few reasons why literature is important. 1. Expanding horizons First and foremost, literature opens our eyes and makes us see more than just what the front door shows. It helps us realize the wide world outside, surrounding us. With this, we begin to learn, ask questions, and build our intuitions and instincts. We expand our minds. 2. Building critical thinking skills Many of us learn what critical thinking is in our language arts classes. When we read, we learn to look between the lines. We are taught to find symbols, make connections, find themes, learn about characters. Reading expands these skills, and we begin to look at a sentence with a larger sense of detail and depth and realize the importance of hidden meanings so that we may come to a conclusion. 3. A leap into the past History and literature are entwined with each other. History is not just about power struggles, wars, names, and dates. It is about people who are products of their time, with their own lives. Today the world is nothing like it was in the 15th century; people have changed largely. Without literature, we would not know about our past, our families, the people who came before and walked on the same ground as us. It allows you to understand and experience these other systems of living and other worlds. We get a view of the inside looking out, a personal view and insight into the minds and reasoning of someone else. We can learn, understand, and appreciate it. Well, many of those authors, poets, or playwrights used literature to expand their writing. 6. Addressing humanity All literature, whether it be poems, essays, novels, or short stories, helps us address human nature and conditions which affect all people. These may be the need for growth, doubts and fears of success and failure, the need for friends and family, the goodness of compassion and empathy, trust, or the realization of imperfection. We learn that imperfection is not always bad and that normal can be boring. We learn that life must be lived to the fullest. We need literature in order to connect with our own humanity. Literature is important and necessary. It provides growth, strengthens our minds and gives us the ability to think outside the box.
