Since April, protesters have gone there to try to block construction of the 1,172-mile Dakota Access Pipeline, which would cut through tribal lands and compromise its water supply in order to carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. As I approached a camp and saw all the tipis, all the individuals brought together as defenders of water, I found myself pushing back tears. Ranging in age from infants to elders, people had traveled from all over the country and the world to stand in solidarity with the protesters. Then we would all gather in a circle and pray as the sun rose. Our prayers would be for those who opposed us, those who supported us from afar and those who were among us. These prayers continued all day and all night in many forms. It was truly a wonderful place to be. When I left the camp after a month, I wept again. This time, I felt like I was walking away from my family in their moment of dire need as the police kept pushing towards our sacred site. Here are some of the portraits I took while in Standing Rock. The heartbeat of the people Benjamin Conrad and Willard Price sing and drum by the side of the Cannonball River at the Oceti Sakowin camp. At night, Will would sit, sing and drum, and people would emerge from the dark to join him before disappearing into the starry night. Caro is committed to staying at Standing Rock for as long as it takes to stop the pipeline. Here, she kneels in prayer before the police. A sage protest A protester smudges the air with sage, an act of purification that helps clear negative energy from a place. This sacred tradition is one of the daily peaceful practices at all the Standing Rock camps and on the front lines of the protest. Standing up for those no longer here James Wyatt Hawk, a Cherokee two spirit, came to Standing Rock for his late grandmother. He says he knows that if she were still alive, she would have been there. An eagle of bravery Actor Wes Studi stands next to a fellow water protector holding an eagle staff. An eagle staff is passed from generation and generation, accumulating the medicine, or energy, of those who have carried it and the brave acts it has witnessed. To have a staff at Standing Rock brings its medicine to the area as a form of protection and honor. Wes traveled to the protests from Santa Fe, New Mexico, with his son so that they could show their dedication to protecting the lands and livelihood for all indigenous peoples. Many of the people wore bandanas on their faces to preserve their anonymity. Jade told me that being at Standing Rock was the first time in her life she has ever felt like she belonged. Mike came to help as part of the security team at Oceti Sakowin. Getting ready for winter Tracy Hsu (far left) is from a nearby town in North Dakota. She and her friends raised the first of many Mongolian ger (yurts) at the Oceti Sakowin camp. The blowing winds, frigid winters and treeless terrain of North Dakota are similar to the Mongolian steppe, and the design of these ancient structures is well suited to provide shelter during the daunting cold of the coming winter. Thinking of the future Audrie Ellen traveled to North Dakota from Tennessee with her daughter and their dog. She said she came because she needed to stand for her daughter and for future generations.

Man and horse A spirit rider sits on his horse. The horses can often be seen roaming free around the camp or galloping through the grass. Their calmness is a testament to the respect that riders and horses have developed towards each other. The richness of culture Sophia Blackcloud was a small child when she was adopted away from her Hunkpapa Lakota family. As an adult, she has worked hard to reestablish her connection to her native culture. She came to Standing Rock to teach her daughters that the advantages of the life she had in California pale in comparison to the richness of their culture and connection to the people and land. She says that being at Standing Rock has been both life-changing and soul-changing.
