Water Protector Rodrick Joe was convicted of Tampering with a Public Service, a Class C felony. It happens to all indigenous women everywhere. I want to bring awareness to it. I have relatives who got cancer from drinking that water. Joe was sentenced to a 360 days deferred sentence with mandatory fees not to exceed the bond amount, and with credit for two days of time already served. He was released immediately after trial and sentencing. Joe was the first of over 20 Water Protectors going to trial during the coming weeks from that arrest date. Most are facing felony charges. The next group of three will be tried tomorrow, January 5, 2018 in Morton County. Over 300 Water Protectors are still awaiting trial on state charges in North Dakota, and six Water Protectors are preparing for federal criminal trials. Bookmark the permalink. 1 Comment. account.
