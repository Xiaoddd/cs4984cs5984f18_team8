The controversial Dakota Access Pipeline is being built by a company subsidiary. Investors, apparently, are not among them. The soft-spoken Texan owes much of the bump to the climbing stock price of Energy Transfer Equity, the Dallas-based oil and gas giant he cofounded and chairs. Warren personally views his spiking net worth as nothing more than a rebound from a dreadful 2015, when Energy Transfer suffered from soft commodities prices and an investor-reviled proposed merger with Williams Companies, an Oklahoman rival. But Energy Transfer has undoubtedly also benefited from the election of Donald Trump. The donations, Warren suggests, were money well spent. The oil line, which will connect production fields in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, has generated tremendous controversy, in part over concerns that it will threaten the water supply of adjacent Native American tribes. Protesters have clashed fiercely with local law enforcement, whom they have accused of deploying excessive force. Warren is pleased with the turnabout, but dismisses the legitimacy of the initial roadblock. Born in rural Texas to an oil field worker father, he failed out of the University of Texas at Arlington during his freshman year, though later returned to complete a civil engineering degree. In 1993, after stints at a number of energy firms, he partnered with friend Ray Davis to purchase Endevco, a former employer, out of bankruptcy. They sold the business for a profit two years later and founded Energy Transfer soon after. The firm is now back on the upswing, and has plans to merge Energy Transfer Partners with Sunoco Logistics to further streamline its balance sheet. Warren, for one, shrugs off his fluctuating net worth. Right now, things are booming. I'm currently a reporter on the wealth team at Forbes. or via our SecureDrop. All Rights Reserved.

In the early 2000s, good luck came in the form of Enron&a;rsquo;s collapse, which created a glut of cheap pipelines available for purchase. Revenues steadily increased thereafter, as did Warren&a;rsquo;s personal fortune. &a;lsquo;The energy business is very cyclical.
