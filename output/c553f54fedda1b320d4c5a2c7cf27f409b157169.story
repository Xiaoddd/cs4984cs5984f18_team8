They also left behind two dogs and six puppies, apparently abandoned. When The New American reported a month ago on protesters polluting the environment they allegedly claimed to revere, the amount of time, effort, and money it would take to clear the site was understated. That was a month ago and the cleanup continues. It was anticipated that the protesters would leave the site by February 22, the date set by the Army Corps of Engineers, in order to allow the cleanup to begin. There had already been over 700 arrests, but some stayed beyond the curfew, blocking the road into and out of the site. They also set some 20 fires, causing at least two children to suffer burns. In addition, the local Comfort Inn announced that it would no longer be honoring vouchers issued by DES to protesters needing a place to stay, thanks to some of them trashing their rooms. As this article is being drafted, cleanup continues in attempts to keep the trash from polluting Lake Oahe and the nearby Missouri River when the snow begins to melt. Those protesters, if they can be called that, have left behind overwhelming evidence that they are not environmentalists concerned about protecting the environment. They are not even hypocrites. The Dakota Access pipeline project just provided them an excuse to vent their anger and spleen at a world they refuse to accept.
