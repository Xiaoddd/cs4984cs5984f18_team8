Read the Brief Modern, cloud-based finance systems can generate significant growth for businesses because they can empower more employees to make better decisions, Oracle CEO Safra Catz said during a luncheon with finance professionals at Oracle OpenWorld 2016 in San Francisco. However, as Catz's experience at Oracle illustrates, new technologies have their greatest impact when they are part of an overall corporate transformation. When Catz joined Oracle in 1999, Larry Ellison asked her to help with a complete information technology transformation at the company, moving from multiple, disparate systems across the globe to a single source of truth for the business. But what at first looked like an IT or enterprise resource planning transformation, she says, became a companywide transformation, and the impact was enormous. That shift served as a foundation for subsequent successes. Catz noted that she'd come without a PowerPoint presentation, because she's much more a spreadsheet person. Her drive for data resulted in the discovery of duplication of effort across Oracle and organizational silos. That is the goal with these ERP transformations. But getting to that kind of result isn't easy, and the people element is the biggest challenge. Actually, they love it when you change. The solution is to provide employees with so many benefits in terms of productivity, cost savings, and efficiencies that they begin to look for other opportunities to push the capabilities of the systems. Taking the Next Step In the end, it's the customer who benefits most from all this transformational effort, in the form of new and better products and services, said Catz. And now it's time for the next step. The cloud services that Oracle uses today empower employees to make decisions about the future and execute quickly and efficiently.
