The pipeline is planned to cross the Missouri within a half mile of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Organizers warned veterans participating that they could be confronted with multiple state police agencies, some of them in riot gear and equipped with rubber bullets, pepper spray, water cannons and tear gas. Veterans have been instructed not to bring weapons and not to fight or destroy private property. Protesters and law enforcement have clashed during the past several months. Last week, police used a water cannon in freezing temperatures as crowd control, according to news reports. One woman protesting the pipeline could lose her arm after being wounded during a confrontation with law enforcement. There are conflicting news reports of whether her injuries were caused by officers or fellow protesters, with each side arguing it was the other. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested at the site. Diggs said the group of veterans is coming prepared. The announcement stated protestors must relocate for safety reasons to a free speech zone south of the Cannonball River. In a news conference Saturday, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said it would stand its ground. In a video of the Saturday news conference, protesters are shown cheering when one of the lead organizers said the veterans were still planning to show up. Veterans Stand for Standing Rock was started by Army veteran Wes Clark, Jr. and Marine Corps veteran Michael Wood, Jr., both of whom have been outspoken against the pipeline. Elected officials will be present at a news conference at the start of their trip, Diggs said. All Rights Reserved.
