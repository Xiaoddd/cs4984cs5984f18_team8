Sophia Wilansky was one of several hundred protesters injured during the standoff with police on Sunday on a bridge near the site where the pipeline is planned to cross under the Missouri river. Graphic photographs of her injured arm with broken bones visible were circulated on social media. Sophia will require additional surgery in the next few days and her arm may still have to be amputated, he added. Sophia Wilansky is one of thousands of activists who have travelled to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota to attempt to halt the construction of the pipeline. The tribe fears the pipeline will jeopardise their water supply and say that construction has disturbed sacred burial grounds. Most of the injured had hypothermia after being hit by a water cannon in below-freezing weather. Advertisement The incident on Sunday began when about 100 activists attempted to remove two burned trucks from the bridge just north of the main encampment. The bridge has been barricaded for several weeks, blocking the most direct route to Bismarck, North Dakota, and raising safety concerns among residents of the camp and the reservation. She was subsequently airlifted to another hospital in Minneapolis. Wilansky has received a massive outpouring of support online. Friends of Wilansky are planning a prayer vigil in Minneapolis on Tuesday. Bookmark the permalink. 3 Comments. How can a Country feed a baby an oil filled glass of water.
