Karenna Gore, the daughter of former Vice President Al Gore, was among more than 198 people who were arrested because of their 2015 actions protesting the pipeline in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, a neighbourhood of Boston. Thirteen people were to go on trial this week, though prosecutors downgraded their original criminal charges to one of civil infraction. On Tuesday, Judge Mary Ann Driscoll of West Roxbury District Court, found all 13 defendants not responsible, the equivalent of not guilty in a criminal case. found not responsible by reason of necessity. The irony is that we are making ourselves responsible. Police drag 85-year-old Green activist across road during anti-fracking protest Marla Marcum of the Climate Disobedience Centre, which supported the activists, said that each of the 13 had addressed the judge about why they had been part of the protests against the pipeline, which was constructed by Houston-based company Spectra Energy. She said she expected an audio recording of the hearing to be made available by the court and her group would then share it. Neither Ms Driscoll or the court clerk was available for comment. The person denied, however, that the judge had made the ruling on the grounds of legal necessity. A few minutes ago a Boston judge acquitted 13 pipeline protesters on the grounds that the climate crisis made it necessary for them to commit civil disobedience.
