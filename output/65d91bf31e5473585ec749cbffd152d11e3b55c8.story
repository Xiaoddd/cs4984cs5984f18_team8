You cannot be a party which on one hand says we're in favor of working people, we're in favor of the needs of young people but we don't quite have the courage to take on Wall Street and the billionaire class. People do not believe that. You've got to decide which side you're on. We need a Democratic National Committee led by a progressive who understands the dire need to listen to working families, not the political establishment or the billionaire class. We'll deliver your signature to members of the DNC to send a strong message about why Keith should be DNC Chair. Our Revolution is a 501(c)(4) organization.
