We get an update from Wayne Wilansky, the father of 21-year-old activist Sophia Wilansky, who was injured during the standoff at Standing Rock in North Dakota. Sophia has been undergoing a series of surgeries after reportedly being hit by a concussion grenade during the police attack against water protectors protesting the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota Sunday night. The Standing Rock Medic & Healer Council says 300 people were hurt in the attack, with injuries including hypothermia from being sprayed by water cannons in subfreezing temperatures, seizures, loss of consciousness, and impaired vision as a result of being shot by a rubber bullet in the face.

On Sunday night, Sophia Wilansky was evacuated and airlifted to a Minneapolis hospital after suffering a critical injury to her left arm. A warning to our TV audiences, these photos are graphic. This is Army veteran Brandy King of the Fort Belknap Reservation who helped transport Sophia after she was injured. King served in the U.S. Army for eight years, including in a combat tour in Mosul, Iraq. She had shrapnel wounds. Her arm was split open. Her bones were broke. WAYNE WILANSKY: She is resting. She had a second surgery yesterday so they could try to clean out the open wound. She still has an opening from her elbow to her wrist. She will have a third surgery on Friday. Apparently, they have changed their story three times since the incident occurred. My daughter is very clear about the fact that she was being shot at the time. And Instead of throwing them on the ground, they pulled the plug, held them for five seconds, and through them directly at her. So, yes, he pulled all of the shrapnel out. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, Wayne Wilansky, I want to ask about the FBI agents who visited your daughters hospital room, yesterday. At least one of the FBI agents was wearing a jacket from the joint terrorism task force. Eventually, I got to speak to a supervisor and learned that what they were looking for was her clothing. I did eventually consent. I had taken her clothing back to my hotel room the night before and I did consent to give them the clothing eventually after talking to the supervisors. They need to clear that bridge so that people can get to hospitals. The Army Corps of Engineers has asked them to stop. Number two is they have to demilitarize the police there. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, I want to thank you very much for joining us from Minneapolis, Wayne Wilansky, father of 21-year-old activist Sophia Wilansky.
