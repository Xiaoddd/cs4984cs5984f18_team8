The Council of Canadians was at an Indigenous-led action today to draw attention to TD Securities investments in the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. The pipeline could carry up to 570,000 barrels per day of fracked oil from North Dakota to Illinois. It would cross 200 waterways, including under the Missouri River, upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe reservation in North Dakota (which draws its drinking water from that river). Presently, there are about 3,000 land defenders gathered on Standing Rock territory blocking the construction of the pipeline. Council of Canadians organizer AJ Klein, who was at today's protest, tells us that at least two people closed their TD accounts during the action this morning. Water campaigner Emma Luis was also at the protest. We employ due diligence in our lending and investing activities relating to energy production. We also work with our customers, community and environment groups, and energy clients to better understand key issues of concern, and to promote informed dialogue. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approved the construction of the pipeline on July 25, construction began on August 10, and the water protection protests began on August 15. On September 9, the U.S. government announced that it was temporarily halting work on the project within 30 kilometres east or west of Lake Oahe, explaining that the concerns raised by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe necessitated a reconsideration of previous decisions regarding the site. Energy Transfer Partners had previously vowed the 1,700 kilometre long pipeline will be completed by the end of this year.
