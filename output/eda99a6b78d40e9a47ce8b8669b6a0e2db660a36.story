In a decision made April 30, St. James Parish-based Judge Alvin Turner Jr. ruled that the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) violated portions of state law protecting both the environment and residents. Local residents have argued that, as they have only one road running in and out of their town, any pipeline failure and subsequent emergency would leave them without an emergency exit. Turner said DNR must require pipeline developers to include emergency evacuation components before a permit is issued allowing construction to continue. Federal court temporarily pauses construction of controversial Louisiana pipeline The Bayou Bridge pipeline is being constructed by the same people who built the Dakota Access pipeline. Part of the great Dakota Access pipeline system, the Bayou Bridge pipeline is a crude oil pipeline intended to span 162.5 miles across the state, running from Lake Charles to St. James. The pipeline will bring oil refineries in the state closer to neighboring Texas, which serves as a regional energy hub. Approximately 280,000 barrels of crude oil would purportedly pass daily through the pipeline, coming into contact with hundreds of wetlands and waterways. That includes close proximity to drinking water for upwards of 300,000 people. The pipeline would cut through the Atchafalaya Basin, the largest U.S. river swamp. Opponents of the the pipeline argue the project would increase the likelihood of oil spills and could impact the local fishing industry. Crawfishermen have already suffered considerably due to the presence of the oil industry in Louisiana. These states want to make planning a pipeline protest a crime A slew of proposed bills would impose harsh penalties for planning to trespass near energy infrastructure. That decision was overturned a month later by a U.S. appeals court and is facing a challenge filed by Earthjustice. DNR did not say whether the state would appeal the ruling. Louisiana is also one of several states currently eyeing legislation that would make planning protests opposing pipelines a crime.
