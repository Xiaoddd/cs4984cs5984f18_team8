The stand against Dakota Access also became the largest gathering of indigenous tribes that the world has ever seen. Needless to say, what has occurred over the last year will go down as a dark chapter in Native American history. Native Nations Rise March Native Americans came to DC from all around America to participate in the Native Nations Rise March. The march, led by the Standing Rock Sioux, began west of Union Station, went through downtown, and past Trump Hotel. With thousands of Native Americans in the area, it should come as no surprise that the National Museum of the American Indian received higher than average traffic. Water is Life On Saturday, Pennie Opal Plant posted to her Facebook page a video and two photos taken just after Jolie Varela had been asked to take off her jacket that had Water is Life flag on the back. The caption with the post read as follows. These women were told that they could not wear their water protector flags pinned to their clothes at the National Museum of the American Indian in DC. They put their water protector flags back on and were fine after that. In the video, Varela states that they came to the museum for lunch after a closing ceremony at the tipi camp. Varela was hurt and in shock that the museum would ask a Native American to remove her jacket for bearing such a symbolic icon to so many Native Americans. We were not able to reach anybody from the National Museum of the American Indian for comment. Native American Discrimination It is everyday discrimination such as this the Native Americans have been trying to bring attention to over the months from North Dakota, and around the country. This discrimination does not just apply to trips to the museum. Native Americans are the most likely ethnic group to be killed by police during a stop. Reservations are kept in poverty by the American government, and their land is in constant strife due to the federal government. are using a browser that does not have Flash player enabled or installed.
