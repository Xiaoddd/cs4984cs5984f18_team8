The Keystone XL project was rejected by the president himself in November 2015 after the state department concluded that the pipeline promised no major benefit for energy security or pricing. Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines to be revived by Trump administration Read more The Dakota Access pipeline project stalled out more recently, in December 2016, when the US army corps of engineers announced it would not grant a permit for the line to run under the Missouri river at a proposed site in North Dakota. Both pipeline projects have also been mired in court battles. The company behind the Keystone pipeline, TransCanada Corporation, filed two legal challenges in January 2016 accusing accusing Obama of overstepping his authority and violating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The company behind the Dakota Access pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, asked a federal judge in December to allow it to drill under the Missouri river immediately, despite its failure to win a permit from the army corps. While both pipelines have produced high-profile clashes between environmentalists and energy interests, the conflict over the Keystone pipeline has run for much longer, since Obama first blocked it in early 2012. The plan for the Dakota Access pipeline, which is mostly completed, was presented to the public in 2014.

Resurrection of Keystone and DAPL cements America's climate antagonism Read more Opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline was identified with the Native American protesters who began to set up protest camps in April 2016, warning that a portion of the proposed pipeline route crossed sacred tribal grounds and that the line threatened to contaminate sources of drinking water. The local Standing Rock Sioux tribe and thousands of Native American supporters from across North America eventually set up camps in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, to try and block the oil project. The Keystone project was projected to cost about twice as much. The finished Keystone pipeline would carry tar sands oil from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf Coast. Defenders of the Keystone project argued that it would create as many as 50,000 construction jobs. The state department estimated the project would create 5,000 to 6,000 construction jobs, while the Obama White House put the figure even lower, at 2,000 construction jobs, and then just 50 to 100 jobs a year. The Canadian government lobbied on behalf of the Keystone project.
