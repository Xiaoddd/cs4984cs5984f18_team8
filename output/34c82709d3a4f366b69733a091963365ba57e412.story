This should have happened months ago. Before I start popping champagne and everyone rolls up their sleeping bags, I have a few more questions. We don't need forty-eight days. We need change that will last 48 years, and beyond that. That might be one way to prevent this from happening again. I ask if the president could please finalize this before he leaves office to prevent that from happening. The president must make a stand for the people of Standing Rock, immediately. In a permanent way, one that is substantial and provides permanent protection and legislation. He must speak up. He must show up. He must for the people who are out there in subzero temperatures fighting to keep our water clean and protect sacred earth; for all Americans who value clean drinking water, not only for themselves, but for their children. His silence has been deafening. On Thanksgiving Day, while our brave citizens, most of whom are Native Americans, were being shot in the face with rubber bullets, pepper sprayed, beaten and arrested for peaceful prayer and protest, the president smiled for cameras and pardoned two turkeys. And he hosted the White House Christmas party earlier this month, with his beautiful family, which would be really heartwarming if we didn't know what was happening on the other side of the country. Now he has finally spoken up, but he needs to finish the job. I do. So do the parents whose children drank poisoned water. I think it's a pretty good idea to try to have stuff like that not keep happening. I believed once that perhaps moving some oil around in the United States might be better than the sinister relationship we have with the Middle East. Corporations will always put profits before people, and so we look to the president to stand for us, because our policymakers simply have not. This pipeline will not serve the public interest, yet we will suffer the consequences and pay the price for generations to come as our water is compromised. In 2008, I stood up for Obama. I stood out in the freezing rain in New York, seven months pregnant, for eight hours at a time, asking people on the streets to vote for him. I drove to Pennsylvania while I was nursing a newborn, to knock on doors asking people to vote for him. I was a maxed-out donor. I made videos asking people to vote for him while my little brother served in Iraq. Right now, the president has, at last, offered us some hope. But this needs to be a permanent solution. If the president does not finish the job, I can assure you that people will remember. I hope that our president-elect has been paying attention to all of this, and hope that he does not underestimate the people's will to resist. We simply will not stand idly by and let these injustices occur. I would also like to thank, with my entire being, the people who have been showing up and continue to stand at Standing Rock. Thank you for protecting me, and my daughter and every American who cares about clean water. You put your lives on the line for all of us. It will not be forgotten. Obama can show the world, during his last days, that the United States of America protects its people, protects sacred land and protects its resources. To show the world that the United States finds the abuse of power and violence against peaceful protest not only unacceptable, but morally reprehensible. I'd like to cash mine in now, please. Protect Standing Rock permanently. Finish the job.
