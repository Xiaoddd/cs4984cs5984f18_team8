Advocates hailed the decision but cautioned that pipeline construction is still underway, with activists still working to prevent the controversial project. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals handed a win to conservation groups on July 27, declaring that the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had erred in granting approval to pipeline developers for part of the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP). The 3.6 mile segment in question cuts through the Jefferson National Forest and would run under the Appalachian Trail. Thacker rescinded permissions for pipeline-related activities within the publicly-owned forest and sent the issue back to both the Forest Service and BLM for further inspection. The suit was brought by a coalition of organizations, including the Sierra Club, Appalachian Voices, Wild Virginia, the Wilderness Society, Preserve Craig, and Save Monroe. Anti-pipeline activists in Virginia face fines for protesting on their own land Protestors have also been denied medical care and at least one may not have access to food and water. Activists greeted the ruling with applause. Other activists were less optimistic. In a statement to ThinkProgress Monday morning, the group Appalachians Against Pipelines cautioned against reporting that construction on the pipeline had halted and emphasized that no stop work order has been issued as of present. A spokesperson for the MVP downplayed the court decision but did not indicate what impact the ruling will have on the broader project. The MVP has generated controversy across the region, worrying environmentalists and residents alike. The pipeline is set to run 303 miles through West Virginia into Virginia, with the possibility of extending to North Carolina. Approximately 2 billion cubic feet of fracked natural gas are expected to pass daily through the pipeline. Both the MVP and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP) are expected to come into contact with around 1,000 water crossings in Virginia, according to a February report from the Natural Resources Defense Council and the environmental consulting firm Downstream Strategies. Doctors attempting to visit the women were denied access by law enforcement agents and the duo ultimately came down in response to fines imposed by a district judge. The U.S. Forest Service had prevented activists from attempting to supply her with sustenance and similarly denied doctors access to the protester when they attempted to visit her. Appalachians Against Pipelines hailed the protesters and credited them with much of the success opponents have seen in their efforts to halt the pipelines. While the MVP struggles in court, the ACP is moving ahead. The pipeline is expected to run 600 miles from West Virginia to North Carolina, passing through Virginia along the way.
