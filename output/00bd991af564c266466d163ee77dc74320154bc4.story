But it is a big win, and a high-profile one that happened on a global stage. In an earlier piece, I looked at the lessons of Standing Rock for progressive philanthropy writ large. Tilsen, a citizen of the Oglala Lakota Nation, is an organizer at Standing Rock, and has been assisting the movement with communications and fundraising efforts. 'Standing Rock is a Microcosm' Both individual donors and a set of committed foundations played an important role in fueling the resistance to the pipeline (see more coverage here), providing support for things like daily operations of the camp, trainings, legal expenses and communications. But an important takeaway from Standing Rock is that when it comes to the needs of that community, and Native communities as a whole, the philanthropic response has really only scratched the surface. As the movement readies for its next stage following the Army Corps decision, the Stand with Standing Rock website continues to be a reliable entry point for donating to the tribe, following updates, and finding nonprofit partners involved. But even setting aside the Dakota Access pipeline, the Standing Rock Sioux community was extremely vulnerable in the first place, enduring some of the highest poverty, childhood mortality, and dropout rates in the nation. When high-profile resistance moments happen, even with a spike in donations, communities are often left to rebuild and bear the burden. Beyond the pipeline fight, the community is working to develop a positive vision for its future. Members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe are developing new funding mechanisms to support long-term investments such as wind and solar energy, sustainable housing, job creation, education, and language preservation. For the time being, Thunder Valley CDC, which has existing capacity and infrastructure, has served as a conduit for foundations like Surdna and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation to fund this type of work. There are also a number of organizations that were crucial during the protests; for example, the Standing Rock Youth Council, International Indigenous Youth Council, Indigenous Environmental Network, and IP3, which will need continuing support to expand their impact, Tilsen said. Among foundations that responded to Standing Rock, a similar hope has emerged that overall philanthropic support for Native communities will increase. Aside from the need in Native communities, Standing Rock has demonstrated the power of an indigenous-led environmental movement, which brought a unique outlook and resilience to the issues involved. The protests also rallied activists from several geographies and causes, with groups like Black Lives Matter and labor unions recognizing and responding to shared issues. The organization held an educational tour of Standing Rock for funders in October, and holds periodic funder strategy calls. Standing Rock can be seen as both a culmination and an entry point for longstanding Native issues. Tilsen at Thunder Valley CDC noted a number of places where funders can get involved. In addition to organizations mentioned above, he recommends reaching out to peer funders who are already committed to Native-led groups such as the Northwest Area Foundation and the Bush Foundation, as well as newer arrivals like the Solutions Project and Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. There are also funder intermediaries like the First Nations Development Institute and the Seventh Generation Fund that can serve an educational role. Ultimately, Tilsen hopes philanthropy will recognize that the equity problems facing Native communities are problems we all share, and that Native people must be center stage, not an afterthought, in the country's equity movement.
