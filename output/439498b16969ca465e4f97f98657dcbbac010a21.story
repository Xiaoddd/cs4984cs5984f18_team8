A legal team working with the Standing Rock Sioux told us they were not aware of who sent the message or who wrote it. The mass check-in is a new and unusually public step in the months-long conflict over the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The pipeline, which would connect the Bakken Formation oil fields to a shipping depot in Illinois, must cut across the Missouri River, a federally controlled waterway that holds religious importance and also supplies clean water to the Sioux reservation. The pipeline also cuts through land, now privately owned, that was ceded to the Sioux by an 1868 treaty. We want to hear what you think about this article.
