Last month Minnesota regulators approved Line 3, another controversial Enbridge pipeline that would cross lakes on Ojibwe treaty lands, affecting indigenous wild rice harvest, hunting and fishing. Indigenous and environmental groups will continue to resist new pipelines because spills jeopardize land and livelihoods, especially when the pipeline crosses ecologically and culturally important places. These are some of the issues we are tracking as part of the Climate Alliance Mapping Project, an initiative we started to address issues of climate justice through research, maps and digital stories. The U.S. version of our map shows data pertinent to domestic climate justice demands, including: oil and gas pipelines and spills, power plants, waterways, native lands (as designated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs) and public lands. We are working with climate justice organizations and indigenous peoples across the Americas to add digital stories with photos and narrations that talk about the social and environmental impacts of oil and gas infrastructure. But public data already tells a story about pipeline spills. That's equivalent to a major spill every two day for the past 32 years. Our interactive U.S. Climate Justice Map visualizes these spills alongside other data and stories. New pipelines are also being resisted because they make no sense in the context of climate change. Take the now iconic Keystone XL, a pipeline that would carry tar sands, some of the most carbon-intensive oil. According to a 2015 study funded by the Department of Energy, Canadian tar sands emits 18 percent more greenhouse gases when processed into gasoline compared to conventional crude. This exacerbates climate change at a time when a rapid transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy is urgently needed. Under the more stringent 1.5 C degree target, 83 percent of fossil fuels must remain unburned and underground, according to a 2016 article. These numbers mean that any new fossil fuel infrastructure is simply incompatible with urgent climate goals. Despite the ubiquity of spills and the scientific evidence that new fossil fuel infrastructure is inconsistent with climate action, regulators continue to approve new pipelines. Just four days later, Nebraska regulators granted the extension of the Keystone pipeline as Keystone XL. If completed, Keystone XL will transport 830,000 barrels of heavy crude daily from the Alberta tar sands to Nebraska, where it connects to refineries as far south as the Gulf Coast in Texas. To be sure, companies like Enbridge and TransCanada claim new pipelines will be safer than existing ones, and that alternative forms of transport like rail present their own risks. However, this argument assumes that new fossil fuel production is inevitable. Given the social, environmental and economic risks, we must begin the phase-out of fossil fuel infrastructure and instead invest in renewable energy. The popularity of electric vehicles such as those made by Tesla demonstrates the enormous potential for a renewable energy transition in the transportation sector that can be eventually powered by solar and wind as we green the electrical grid. Proponents of new pipelines also argue that these infrastructure projects create important jobs. Wheeler is a former coal lobbyist, signaling the continuation of a troubling pattern of environmental regulators with uncomfortably close ties to the fossil fuel companies they are supposed to regulate. Rainforest Action Network and several other environmental and indigenous organizations have assessed the private banks most responsible for backing fossil fuel development such as pipelines and are calling on us to divest from these banks and invest in sustainable alternatives. Now more than ever, we need broad public participation in the Divest-Invest movement in order to shift investments away from new fossil fuel infrastructure like pipelines toward a clean and renewable energy future.
