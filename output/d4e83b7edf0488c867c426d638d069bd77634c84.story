Celebrations of the historic Super Bowl victory of the Philadelphia Eagles led to havoc on Sunday night, as cheering crowds damaged property and turned cars upside down, and an explosion was reported in the city. One policeman was run over, according to social media reports. This is riveting. Bottles being thrown. Helmets going on. These first responders have their hands full. And now there was an explosion. The situation in some parts of the city is apparently out of control, with most of the traffic lights taken out and people continuing to vandalize buildings. Damn it, Philly we better than this. This is a dangerous situation. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.
