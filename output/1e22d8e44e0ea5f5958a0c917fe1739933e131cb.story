Winds NNE at 5 to 10 mph. News organizations reported that the U.S. Army had denied a permit for the Dakota Access pipeline to cross under a Missouri River reservoir. Wachs and Thompson were among eight western Montanans who arrived Saturday in a two-vehicle caravan on the edge of the Standing Rock Reservation. The Missoula contingent moved up their planned departure for home Monday as a dangerous blizzard roared through the Great Plains. Thompson, speaking by cellphone from a crowded van stalled in a traffic jam on the outskirts of camp, estimated 4-6 inches of snow had fallen by early afternoon. That was accompanied by winds of 40 mph with gusts of up to 60 throughout the afternoon and evening, which were expected to drive wind chills to near zero. Thompson said she met a woman from the Pine Ridge Reservation who was running a shelter at the camp for women and children in need. She helped the woman get propane. Wachs brought his tools and helped build a bunkhouse, one of dozens of permanent structures rising in a camp dominated by tepees, wall tents and campers. Photos and even video don't do it justice, she said. An anthropologist and ethnographer, Thompson has written about and worked closely with North American Indian tribes throughout her career. She noted the irony that it was the Army that put a stop to pipeline construction. Over the objections of other military veterans groups, hundreds of veterans converged on the camp over the weekend to make a concerted stand backing tribal members from across the nation and Canada. Laura Lundquist, an environmental journalist who went with the Missoula contingent, was one of them. It was her second trip to the camp, the first coming during election week and Veterans Day in November. Wachs said he was moved by the compassion of the Native presence at the camp. Thompson said the campers from Missoula witnessed history at Oceti Sakowin this weekend. Click any reaction to login. Your notification has been saved. There was a problem saving your notification.
