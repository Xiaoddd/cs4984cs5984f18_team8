At the time, I was working on similar legislation in Iowa, so I traveled to Nashville to learn more. That conversation provided solid insight into the mechanics of back-room politics, which occasionally, but only occasionally, benefit the common good. Sometimes, all you have to do is latch on to an existing one. Consider these key points: 1. Under Iowa law, arson and vandalism are already serious crimes. The Iowa Code already has it covered. ETP originally said oil would flow through its pipeline in the fall of 2016. 3. It lumps a privately owned oil pipeline in with genuine public infrastructure, including lines that transport electricity, gas, broadband service, water, and wastewater. Of all the compelling arguments against the Dakota Access Pipeline, one of the strongest is that ETP is a private company merely transporting its product through Iowa. True public infrastructure is used by the people whose land it passes through. Not so with the Dakota Access Pipeline. If ETP can use its financial might to ram this legislation through quickly and quietly, it will effectively codify a private oil pipeline as a public necessity. Great question. Conservative or liberal, Iowans ought to oppose this legislation. Too bad it can still pollute our drinking water.
