Initially, the protest engineered to protect the water supply and sacred sites of Native Americans in its path was peaceful, and it remained peaceful for months. The first came last Friday from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who issued a letter to tribal elders telling them to be off the disputed land by December 5. However, Standing Rock protesters have been warned that if they stick around, they will be in violation of state, local and federal laws and subject to legal repercussions. On Monday, Standing Rock protesters got a second notice to get out. This one came from Governor of North Dakota, Jack Dalrymple. He told the Standing Rock Sioux leaders and their thousands of fellow protesters to get out of the area ASAP. Again, protesters have chosen to stand their ground, despite the dire threat of being cut off from emergency services (fire and EMT) for the duration of their protest. Now, after weeks of bad news and threats, the Standing Rock protesters are finally on the brink of something positive. As The Huffington Post reports, roughly 2,000 U.S. military vets are headed to North Dakota to lend a hand to the protest efforts. Vets are taking this Standing Rock deployment seriously. They're prepared to die to protect innocent unarmed water protectors. Make no mistake.This is why we fight. On top of that, the veterans are coming to Standing Rock loaded up with supplies to help the protesters hunker down for the winter ahead. Reportedly, local Ace Hardware stores are now refusing to sell supplies to Dakota Access Pipeline protesters, and have taken to Twitter to announce their new business model. That is, if not for the support of the incoming veterans.
