Domestic Swt. He is based in Pittsburgh, PA. A group of 31 environmental organizations sent a joint letter to the White House asking President Obama to halt construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,168-mile oil pipeline that would connect Bakken oil to refineries in Illinois. But there are several problems with the route, which have raised the ire of environmentalists, local communities, and native tribes. Dakota Access moves through the ancestral land of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and the tribe has mounted an energetic protest against the project, a fight that appears to be gaining steam and attracting greater national attention. The Dakota Access Pipeline, fittingly, is about the same distance as the now defunct Keystone XL project. And it appears to be following the same script, quickly emerging as a sort of Keystone XL Part 2. There are several parallels to the Keystone XL fight. First, the opposition comes from a diverse set of organizations and communities, resembling the earlier battle against the oil sands pipeline. That is what allowed the opponents of the pipeline to claim victory: it was not just tree huggers from the coasts that opposed Keystone XL, but also local towns and cities, ranchers, farmers and native tribes. And the letter from the 31 environmental groups has brought greens onboard for the fight. People from around the country have been arriving in North Dakota to support the protests. Dakota Access also resembles Keystone XL in the way that it began as a relatively small issue, but snowballed into a national controversy. The protests have been underway since April, but only recently became national news. The New York Times ran several articles last week on the protests in North Dakota where the pipeline is under construction. The newfound attention attracted Senator Bernie Sanders, who issued a statement on Aug. 25 in support of the protests. As the opposition picks up allies, just as the fight against Keystone XL slowly built momentum, the White House may eventually be forced into a response. Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners plays the role of TransCanada in this sequel, and it too is desperate to see its pipeline completed. So too are oil drillers in North Dakota, which have been forced to deal with more expensive railroads to ship their oil out of the Bakken. The Dakota Access could further unlock oil production in the Bakken, a region that has lost competitiveness in the East Coast refining market, where importing oil from abroad is cheaper in many cases to oil-by-rail from North Dakota. So while Dakota Access could take on broader political, social and environmental significance, it will remain a crucial project for the Bakken, which could see long-term oil production suffer if the pipeline is blocked.

Alas, that would require thoughtful, well informed debate and a spirit of collaboration. Seems like a lost art in America these days on all fronts...

This one is being built to carry US oil, so it's more environmentally friendly than Canadian oil. Leave a comment Name Email Captcha Comment We will save the information entered above in our website.
