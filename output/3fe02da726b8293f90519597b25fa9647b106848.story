The movement to demand financial institutions divest from the Dakota Access pipeline, which began late last year, is still in the early stages. Seventeen banks, including Wells Fargo, SunTrust and Citibank, are backing the pipeline. A recent protest in Seattle, lead by native leaders and water protector allies, targeting Wells Fargo, shows the movement is gaining momentum. Martha Baskin has our report. Download Audio Members of the Standing Rock Sioux, West Coast and inland tribes, accompanied by non-Native water protectors entered a Wells Fargo bank in Seattle late last week, chanting and drumming before security officers locked the doors, preventing hundreds more from entering. As Wells Fargo security personnel watched from the sidelines and made sure no one else entered the bank, the crowd formed an oval and continued to chant. Wells Fargo Seattle referred media inquiries to corporate offices in San Francisco. The bank is one of 17 financial institutions world wide involved in financing the pipeline. In early December, the Army Corp of Engineers announced it would deny an easement which would have allowed the pipeline to go under a crossing of the river at Lake Oahe and would prepare an Environmental Impact Statement. The tribe is still awaiting publication of a notice of intent to prepare the EIS in the Federal Register. This week the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed a motion with a U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. asking the court to throw out a Dakota Access Pipeline lawsuit filed against the Army Corp of Engineers late last year. The fight to stop the pipeline will continue, she says, but the focus needs to include divesting. Matt Remle, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux who lives in Seattle, says divestment is focused on individuals as well as cities. City Council member Kshama Sawant recently introduced an ordinance that would change the process by which the contract is selected to include social justice considerations. Remle says the divestment effort has already seen success. A recent report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis predicts more weakness in companies behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. The report concluded the pipeline is an example of overbuild in oil infrastructure in the Bakken region and as such risks becoming a stranded asset.
