June 26, 2017 at 6:08 pm Written by Derrick Broze Share Tweet Pin Yet another example of law enforcement provocateurs attempting to paint protesters in a negative light. On October 27, police pushed protesters back, crushing encampments, and forcing the resistance to the other side of the Backwater bridge. The protesters on the bridge set fire to an SUV, and threw rocks and other objects at a row of armored vehicles operated by law enforcement. This small faction of non-peaceful protesters and officers briefly tossed smoke bombs back and forth. Officers eventually lit two smoke bombs on the north side of the bridge before parking two armored vehicles at the exit to the bridge, preventing water protectors and protestors from evacuating in that direction. All law enforcement vehicles were gone within a matter of minutes, and protesters climbed aboard the armored vehicles before setting fire to them. The fires they set burned throughout the night, as neither law enforcement nor fire department personnel ever arrived at the scene to extinguish the flames. In the days following the vehicle fires the local authorities and media predictably placed the blame on the water protectors. As I mentioned in the above video, I was immediately suspicious of why the police would leave their vehicles on the bridge knowing that another vehicle had already been set on fire. Porter was the chief security officer for Energy Transfer Partners, according to documents leaked to media outlet The Intercept. A look at the documents and the communications of TigerSwan employees show their true attitude towards pipeline opponents. This acknowledgement shows that local police and former military elements are confidently prepared to take on any future uprisings. Daily reports from TigerSwan also expose what many onlookers have suspected: ETP and local police were heavily engaged in aerial surveillance, radio eavesdropping, infiltration of camps and activist circles. Corporate entities also have a history of attempting to spy on peaceful, law-abiding activists. A 2013 report by the Center for Corporate Policy found that a large number of corporations are hiring former law enforcement, CIA, NSA, FBI, and military employees to act as spies. As I wrote in October, Considering what is known about corporate agitation, it is possible that the provocateurs were hired by Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline, the banks financing the pipeline, or, really, any company that benefits from the pipeline in any way. Ultimately, though, whether the agitators were police, corporate lackeys, or activists practicing a failed strategy, their actions do not represent the whole of the water protector movement and should not be used to discredit or delegitimize it.
