Pipeline giant Energy Transfer Partners has another battle on its hands as West Texas protesters fight the construction of the 42-inch Trans-Pecos pipeline in an apparent anti-DAPL inspired action. However, it intensified this week when a number of protesters were reportedly arrested after chaining themselves to the construction site outside. This comes after the Texas-based natural gas company was served a blow last week, when the US Army Corps of Engineers refused permission for the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross Lake Oahe. However, the company issued a statement saying it would complete the construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe The Big Bend Defense Coalition, in West Texas, revealed their intentions to follow suit this week and set up a winter camp in opposition to the project after activists were arrested Tuesday, according to the Houston Chronicle. Two protesters chained themselves to a gate at the construction of the Trans-Pecos pipeline. Two Big Bend Defense Coalition protesters were arrested this morning at Trans-Pecos Pipeline protest in Alpine. Similarly to the Standing Rock protesters, the Big Bend Defenders have concerns over water contamination, specifically the the Rio Grande River, which the pipeline would cross and the lack of Environmental Impact studies carried out in line with the project. Drilling has begun beneath the Rio Grande despite a number of technical setbacks. This section known as the Presidio Crossing Project is the only part of the Trans-Pecos pipeline subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, according to Big Bend Now. The 148 mile pipeline is being built to transport up to 1.4 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from the Permian Basin to Mexico. Construction began in May and according to the company the pipeline is expected to be in service by March 2017. Well, unlike many news organisations, we have no sponsors, no corporate or ideological interests. Although underresourced & primarily volunteer-based, we do our best to provide the community with access to quality and true unfiltered news. Our goal and mission is to provide free and alternative access to impartial information, fighting media monopolization and adhering to honesty, neutrality, fairness, transparency and independence in collection and dissemination of information. It is a bumpy road with all sorties of difficulties. (Media ownership in Australia is one of the most concentrated in the world. Since the trend of consolidation is and has historically been upward, fewer and fewer individuals or organizations control increasing shares of the mass media in our country. This tendency is not only totally unacceptable, but also to a degree frightening) We can only achieve this goal together.
