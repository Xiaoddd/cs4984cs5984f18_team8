Despite the celebrations taking place at the site of protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), experts say the recent decision to stop the pipeline could be reversed by the Trump administration or the next Congress. On Sunday, in a stunning surprise, the Army Corps of Engineers denied Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the Dallas-based company building DAPL, the easement permit it needs to complete construction under the Missouri River. The Army Corps recommended studying alternate routes that would bypass the Standing Rock Sioux reservation and its water supply. But according to Deborah Sivas, a professor of environmental law at Stanford University, there are multiple ways the pipeline might still be completed legally in its current location. The Republican-led Congress could vote to clear the way for ETP to drill under the Missouri River by passing an appropriations rider. Then the company would no longer need an easement from the Army Corps to comply with the Clean Water Act, and could thus complete the pipeline. Alternatively, according to Buccino, Congress could exclude public input from the environmental impact statement ordered by the Army Corps, excluding Standing Rock Sioux tribal members from participating and thereby sidestepping complaints that the project desecrates sacred burial sites. Such actions would likely be subject to public criticism, she acknowledges. Buccino also points out that Jo-Ellen Darcy, the Army Corps official who made the announcement, was appointed by President Barack Obama and will leave her position in January. Trump has expressed his support for the DAPL project. She believes its recent announcement is a largely a gesture. As a blizzard set in Sunday night, campers celebrated by setting off fireworks.
