Six weeks later, on November 18, the Pawnee Nation and Pawnee tribal member Walter Echo-Hawk filed suit against U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to challenge federal oil and gas lease approvals on Indian trust lands within Pawnee jurisdiction. Under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), federal law dictates that federal agencies, including the BLM and BIA, assess the potential environmental consequences of the proposed activity and disclose these to the public. The lawsuit claims both the BIA and BLM have violated these directions. After investigating wells within Pawnee Nation in 2015, the Pawnee discovered there were 170-plus underground injection control wells, which are used for disposing of wastewater produced from fracking. Of the 170 wells, Knife Chief said the tribe had been aware of only eight. But by us knowing where the wells are, we can regulate them. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) regulates drilling, fracking, and injection wells on state land, but because allotment land is governed by the tribe and held in trust by the federal government, those entities are responsible for regulation. Typically, the BIA will approve the business lease for the underground injection well and the EPA will approve the permit to do the injections. But we can do it smarter. From the legal complaint: Under its Constitution and laws, the Pawnee tribal government must: ensure that a sufficient supply of good quality water is available to satisfy all present and future tribal uses; safeguard the quality of the available water supply to prevent irreparable destruction of that natural resource from contamination; protect the best interests, health, safety and well-being of its members; and ensure that all foreign corporations doing business in tribal jurisdiction comply with tribal law. So there was fraud. We can fine them all day long, but my guess is the big producers have fines and fees as line items in their budget. Too many people who are skirting the rule of law and doing some dangerous activity. Besides potential water contamination, the Pawnee are also concerned about the uptick in earthquakes as a result of wastewater injection wells. The tribe was already looking into the amount of wells on its land when Oklahoma was named the earthquake capital of the world in 2015. Energy companies in Pawnee County (among other counties) are drilling into the Mississippian Lime formation. Aside from it being a notoriously briny formation, which could contaminate the creeks, rivers, and shallow aquifers on which the community depends, the formation is also on a fault line that runs through Oklahoma City. The lawsuit cites technology and related policies, too: The intensity, scale and complexity of modern hydraulically-fractured wells far exceed the conventional development that has occurred in the past. Companies today drill wellbores that are nearly three miles long and where fracturing uses millions of gallons of water per well. The associated surface disturbance, traffic, noise, air pollution, and accidents also have major impacts on surrounding communities and their natural resources. Most dramatically, geologists have concluded that disposal of hydraulic fracturing wastes can cause earthquakes. For more from Liz, read her article on Arts Alliance Tulsa. All rights reserved.
