Though Senator Bernie Sanders has been a vocal supporter of the protest, even he has not taken the trip to blustery North Dakota to stand with the Water Protectors. Others like Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton have uttered barely a word about the human rights violations happening on U.S. soil. Meanwhile, President-elect Trump holds stock in the company seeking to complete the construction of the pipeline. The presence of hundreds of U.S. veterans will complicate matters for the Army corp of engingeers as they are expected to declare anyone still on the lands by December 5 as tresspassers. The Army corp says that they do not plan to forcibly remove anyone at this point, but also say that anyone who remains are doing so at their own risk and are subject to prosecution. I have my issues with Gabbard as a progressive champion, but if she truly joins the protest at NoDAPL this week, I will take back every thing I have ever said about the congresswoman.
