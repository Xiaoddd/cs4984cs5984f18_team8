Court battles continue, divestment efforts have pulled billions from the company, and resistance all over Turtle Island is ongoing. But while we, water protectors, stand up for the future generations, a massive strategy by state and federal law enforcement seeks to repress and destroy us. Police are combing social media, additional charges are being filed, and grand juries continue to issue indictments. Despite the attack dogs, mace, rubber bullets, Tasers, water and sound cannons, tear gas, pepper spray, concussion grenades, and dog kennels, our people remained strong. But we must protect ourselves, relatives. A quick moment of recognition is not worth the scrutiny of federal and state agents. Compiling a list of water protectors makes the job of law enforcement easier, and can get into consent issues. Do not spread gossip or rumors Divide and conquer is an old tactic, and one that can be highly effective. Remember our common goal, despite our differences. Do not tell others about your arrest prior to being in handcuffs What happened leading up to your arrest is the part most interesting to prosecutors. They want to build a case against you, to get details that will lead to a conviction. Do not believe law enforcement can get you out of trouble Law enforcement does not have to tell you the truth. They are looking for information to hand to a prosecutor building their case. Do not talk to anyone but your attorney about details of your case Telling friends, loved ones, fellow water protectors, etc. puts them at risk for receiving a subpoena from the court. Do not lie to law enforcement, that can get you in trouble. Police see those posts, too.
