Her client, who has returned to North Dakota from out of state to stand trial, faces misdemeanor trespass and riot charges. It is the first time that LaDonna Allard will testify for the defense on behalf of a Standing Rock defendant. In the past five trials with similar fact patterns, there have been three convictions and two acquittals. We continue to maintain a presence in North Dakota and provide legal advocacy, jail and court support, criminal defense, and civil and human rights protection to the Native peoples and their allies who gathered at the ceremonial resistance camps.
