But the fight to protect water access at the North Dakota reservation is likely far from over. There's also the possibility that the incoming Trump administration will simply overturn the decision. Trump has already come out in favor of the pipeline project, and was also revealed to be a shareholder of Energy Transfer Partners. This is big-government decision-making at its worst. I look forward to putting this anti-energy presidency behind us. President Barack Obama could use the Antiquities Act of 1906 to designate the land around the contested area as a national monument. This would ensure permanent protection for the area, and force Energy Transfer Partners to find another route. Despite bipartisan use (only three presidents, all Republican, haven't designated a single national monument), Republicans have criticized Obama for overusing the act, and might be inclined to make it more difficult to designate future monuments.
