by John Zada 16 Nov 2016 13:15 GMT British Columbia, Canada - On the morning of October 13, Tracy Robinson, a hunter and fisherwoman living in the Heiltsuk First Nation community of Bella Bella, British Columbia, was preparing to go out on to the ocean, when the news reached her: An American tugboat and oil barge transiting Canadian waters had driven into a reef in nearby Seaforth Channel. Fearing the worst, Robinson and her partner jumped into their boat and rushed to the scene. They arrived to find the tug still attached to its massive floating barge, but almost entirely under water. Earlier that night the tugboat Nathan E Stewart, heading south after delivering fuel to Alaska, missed its turn into the channel and drove straight into the rocks off Athlone Island. Although the 100-metre fuel barge it pushed was empty, the tug carried more than 200,000 litres of diesel and other industrial oils that were now leaking into the Pacific. You couldn't smell the fresh ocean breeze that you're used to. For Robinson the tug couldn't have run aground in a worse spot. Heiltsuk First Nation Territory is located at the heart of the celebrated Great Bear Rainforest - the world's largest intact temperate rainforest whose land and waters contain some of the greatest biodiversity of life on earth. The narrow passage between islands contains ancient village sites where, for millennia, residents have harvested traditional seafood such as clams, salmon, crab, sea cucumbers, urchins, and seaweed for the traditional roe-on-kelp herring egg harvest. A horrified Robinson and others watched helplessly from their boats as the widening, rainbow-hued diesel slick moved slowly towards the beaches and coves in the pass. Since that morning weeks ago, the Heiltsuk and first responders have been working tirelessly to contain and mitigate the slick that has contaminated the food-rich shores of those low-lying islands abutting the open ocean. That was our lifeline and breadbasket. We've worked so hard to steward this territory to protect it for future generations. You have no idea how difficult it is for our community to have to deal with this. Marilyn Slett, Heiltsuk elected chief The Heiltsuk, who have no significant oil-spill response capacity of their own, charge that official containment and cleanup efforts have been incompetent and disorganised - belying the world-class marine safety system that Canada and its industry partners have boasted about for years. It took almost one full day for responders to arrive at the site, they say. Containment and absorbent booms have been ineffective in containing the spill, often breaking in rough weather and storms and littering beaches with additional diesel. Divers were able to tap some fuel from the tug's tanks. A variety of fish and birds, seals, crabs and otters have been found dead near the sheen. The spreading contamination has resulted in shellfish harvesting closures in the area. We've worked so hard to steward this territory to protect it for future generations. Jim Guidry, executive vice-president of vessel operations for the US-based Kirby Offshore Marine, which owns the Nathan E Stewart, apologised to the Heiltsuk and to British Columbians days after the incident. The Canadian government had allowed the Nathan E Stewart (and other tugs and barges) to transit the narrow inside passages and channels without the usual requirement of a Canadian pilot with local knowledge of the area - an exemption that has since been revoked. The fact that the tug missed the turn into the channel and drove straight into the rocks has fuelled speculation that the ship's pilot may have fallen asleep. The Heiltsuk say that had the Nathan E Stewart been pushing petroleum, they would have had a far different spill on their hands. This comparatively smaller incident has confirmed long-standing fears over a number of controversial fossil fuel pipeline and tanker projects slated for the British Columbia coast. Job creation and economic investment were cited as key factors motivating the decision. The LNG site would occupy the entrance to the Skeena River Watershed - one of the world's last intact salmon systems. The decision prompted an outcry. First Nation groups have filed a lawsuit against the project, with some on social media calling for a Canadian version of the Standing Rock Sioux protests to stop it. Two other pipeline-tanker projects on the coasts, including the proposed expansion of the Kinder Morgan Trans-Mountain project in greater Vancouver, await similar federal rulings. In addition to promising more forthright and genuine dealings with First Nations, he pledged to formalise a moratorium on crude oil tanker traffic on British Columbia's north coast - a directive spelled out in the mandate letter to his transport minister after he won the election. It has yet to be implemented. We're sacrificing all we have for Americans to move their product.
