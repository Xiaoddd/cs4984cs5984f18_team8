They may drill up to the federal lands to try to provoke the campers. They will do this to create the illusion that the Army Corps of Engineers made the wrong decision. We do not need to engage them in this; we need to go home. Energy Transfer Partners, whose assets were recently purchased by Sunoco, has said it remains committed to the project and will not change the route. With a new blizzard dumping a foot or more of snow onto the camps full of thousands of water protectors, many of them in tipis, and below-average temperatures predicted for part of the week, the conditions were becoming dangerous. Strong winds and very cold temperatures will also yield sub-zero wind chill readings and blowing snow. The bulk of the water protectors are living in fortified tipis and other makeshift shelters outdoors at the camps. Archambault said the priority was keeping people safe, and letting them know that the job at hand was done. The current weather is severe, making travel impossible. If the camp stays, we run a risk of further provocation from local law enforcement. Once one person is hurt or property is destroyed, that will lead to more outsized actions by law enforcement. Putting people at risk in that way is something the ancestral leaders would never have done, he said. I believe in my prayers and in the Creator. Archambault suggested that each resident make a plan for closing and exiting the camp, leaving the land as it was when they got there, and to get home before the bitterest part of winter sets in. The winter, he added, has barely begun, and the current storm is tamer than what the worst of the season will bring. Temperatures drop even lower than they already have, and the shelters at the camps would be no match for blizzard conditions. Acknowledging that people were socked in by the storm, Archambault said it was time to take the water protection battles beyond Indian country, to the rest of the U.S. and the world. This factor makes it hard for some to stand down from continuing with a physical presence and performing direct action at Standing Rock despite the dangerous, and potentially deadly weather conditions they may face. Adding to the concern of water protectors is the possibility of all their hard work being overturned by the new Trump administration slated to take over come January.
