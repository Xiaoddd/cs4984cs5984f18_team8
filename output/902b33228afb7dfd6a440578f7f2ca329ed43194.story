Rob Malcolm reports. The incident occurred around 9:30 p.m. Saturday. Witnesses told police that 40 to 60 juveniles flooded the station, jumped the fare gates and rushed to the second-story train platform. Some of the robbers apparently held open the doors of a Dublin-bound train car while others streamed inside, confronting and robbing and in some cases beating riders.

Police received no reports of guns or other weapons being brandished. The train was held for about 15 minutes as authorities interviewed victims and witnesses and tended to the injured. Trost said police arrived at the station in less than 5 minutes, but that the robberies took place in just seconds. BART police had increased the number of officers patrolling Oakland stations Saturday night because of a recent rise in the number of police calls. They were the first to arrive at the concourse after the crime was reported. Rebecca Saltzman, president of the BART Board of Directors, said the board to examine ways to prevent a recurrence. Six of the nine cars on the train had working surveillance cameras, and BART police were viewing video from those cars as well as station cameras, Trost said. All BART trains are scheduled to be equipped with working cameras by the end of June. The images cannot be shared publicly, she said, because the attackers appear to be minors. Trost said Oakland police have told their BART counterparts that other incidents involving large groups of teens took place in the general area Saturday night. Oakland police officials declined to comment, and would offer no details Monday, referring questions to BART police. Robberies committed by small groups of people who snatch valuables from riders when trains stop at stations then dash off just before the train departs have been known to happen on BART, Trost said. But this was the first time she was aware of a train being swarmed by a large group of teens. Last month, according to two television reports, a swarm of teenagers invaded a carnival near the Oakland Coliseum, beating workers and stealing prizes from the game booths. Robberies involving small groups invading stores and restaurants in the Bay Area are not unheard of. But incidents involving such large groups are rare. The incident presents another challenge for BART, which hired a new police chief last week. The agency has struggled to contain fare evaders and is studying ways to make it harder to enter a station without paying.
