Culture Give Real Thanks: 7 Ways to Help the DAPL Protestors at Standing Rock by Miss Rosen Nov 23rd, 2016 Photo: After a prayer march to Backwater Bridge, protesters are lead in a defiant cheer by an elder and descendant of Chief Sitting Bull (the gentleman in the white jacket) against North Dakota State Police, who have been permanently deployed on the north side of the bridge. Also: Standing Rock Has Become the First Major American Battleground of the 21st Century Most recently, on the evening of Sunday, November 20, as temperatures dipped down to 26 degrees Fahrenheit, law enforcement officials blasted hundreds of people with water cannons near Oceti Sakowin camp. Video can be seen at The Guardian. Standing behind a barbed wire fence, militarized police dressed in riot gear also launch concussion grenades, rubber bullets, and tear gas, injuring 300 people; 26 were taken to area hospitals, while 21 year-old New York resident Sophia Wilansky, who was air lifted to County Medical Center in Minneapolis, where she has been undergoing extensive surgery to save her arm from amputation after being hit by a grenade. Since August 10 of this year, thousands of activists from across the United States have come together at Standing Rock to protest the construction of DAPL. This Thanksgiving, we invite you to give real thanks to the people risking their lives to protect the water supply of 17 million Americans in four states. Here are some ways you can stand tall with Standing Rock.

Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is: Big banks are heavily invested in the Energy Transfer family, the company that is funding DAPL. You can see a list of banks and their investments at Food and Water Watch to see if your bank is involved. A call has gone out for people to take their money out of big banks and put them into credit unions and community development banks. Credit unions are nonprofits with low fees and excellent interest rates that invest in local projects, so that you will personally be staking your community. Community investment banks work with financially underserved institutions, businesses, and people, making it another great way to give back.
