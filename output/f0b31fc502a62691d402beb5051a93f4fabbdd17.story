Photograph: Alamy Slovenia has amended its constitution to make access to drinkable water a fundamental right for all citizens and stop it being commercialised. The centre-right opposition Slovenian Democratic party (SDS) abstained from the vote saying the amendment was not necessary and only aimed at increasing public support. Slovenia is a mountainous, water-rich country with more than half its territory covered by forest. Slovenia is the first European Union country to include the right to water in its constitution, although according to Rampedre (the online Permanent World Report on the Right to Water) 15 other countries across the world had already done so. Amnesty International said Slovenia must ensure the new law would be also applied to the 10,000-12,000 Roma people living in the country.
