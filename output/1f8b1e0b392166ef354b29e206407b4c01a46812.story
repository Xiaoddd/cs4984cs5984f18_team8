With one call to local law enforcement, companies can have victims of their workplace crimes sent out of the country at the expense of taxpayers. It has become far too easy for these companies to manipulate the deportation system as a weapon against their employees, threatening retaliatory deportation of immigrant workers who try to organize or speak out about wages and working conditions. Bad employers send a powerful, chilling message in the workplace when they deport employees for speaking out. The result is that too many workers are treated as second class and are too susceptible to abuse. The fear of deportation is real. Recently, a group of workers employed on a public workers project in the Washington, DC area came together and organized to protest reported wage theft by their employer, only to have their immigration status used in retaliation against them. As a result, more than half of the workers were fired and many workers and their family members were placed in deportation proceedings. By driving down labor standards to the lowest common denominator, they make it harder to enforce laws and standards even for native-born workers, and harder for employers who play by the rules to remain competitive. Not surprisingly, most Americans are against the deportation of workplace whistleblowers. Communities and commonsense policymakers have had enough of the deportations. signed the TRUST Act into law last weekend, a bill that gives law enforcement much more leeway to respond to immigration detainer requests and sets a minimum standard to ensure that those with most low-level, non-violent offenses are not wastefully held for deportation purposes. All month, immigration advocates have held vigils, concerts, forums, and protests demanding Congressional action. This weekend, thousands more are planning a massive civil disobedience in Arizona aimed at shutting down Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for the day. When immigrant workers have rights and everyone competes on a level playing field, workers across the board do better. We need to stand up for immigrants who work in unsafe, abusive jobs with the constant threat of deportation hanging over them. By doing so, we stand up for the rights of all workers.
