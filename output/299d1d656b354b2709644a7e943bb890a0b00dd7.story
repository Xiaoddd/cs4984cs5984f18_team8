Federal investigators discovered that Wells Fargo employees had created two million fraudulent bank and credit accounts under the names of existing customers since 2011, prompting the California state treasury to suspend its Wells Fargo investment. In August of 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed its intention to withdraw from privately-operated prison contracts. Recently, Wells Fargo received negative press for helping fund the North Dakota Access Pipeline. Wells Fargo is one of several large banks providing loans and support for the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Francisco Ferreyra, a third-year community and regional development major at UC Davis and the environmental sustainability officer of the UC Student Association, said that Davis residents and several student groups asked the Davis City Council to also take action against the Dakota Access Pipeline. They care about two things: their profits and their reputations. The strategy for us on the ground is to hit them where it hurts, in those two spots. On Feb. 7, the City of Davis also ended its contract with Wells Fargo. Ruben Pulido, the vice president and communications manager of corporate communications for Wells Fargo, wrote over email that the bank will continue to support the UC despite the divestment. Pulido said that Wells Fargo does not deny lines of credit with private prisons. Due to chronic prison overcrowding, federal and state governments have for the past 30 years been contracting out detention services. Pulido added that the bank wields no influence in private prison policies and conduct. Wells Fargo holds no shares of either The GEO Group or CoreCivic. unable to load more posts. unable to load this post using ajax.
