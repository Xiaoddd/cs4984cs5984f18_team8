Weaving together centuries of history and science to showcase a vast interconnected civilization that took root in the Americas 13,000 years ago, the glossy big-budget series is one of the many and varied programs on Native America that will air across public television this fall and beyond. Scheduled for weekly runs on Tuesday nights, beginning October 23, Native America is already being promoted during station breaks. PBS went to unusual lengths to greenlight the documentary five years ago, according to Bill Gardner, VP of programming and development. The burgeoning pipeline extends into new genres and future seasons, including a Native American standup comedy series produced for the multicast channel FNX, and a PBS Kids show that will be the first to feature a Native American as the lead character. Cable TV channels and mainstream Hollywood have also been rolling out productions that feature Native storylines and characters. Rise, a documentary series that Viceland debuted in January, investigated ongoing environmental rights struggles facing Native Americans and Indigenous citizens. Native American journalists, bloggers and websites have incubated content that nudged modern Native American identity closer to the surface of U.S. popular culture, according to public television executives, Hollywood casting directors and film festival programmers. These observers credit national press coverage of the protests at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota in 2016 for bringing public attention to the needs and interests of Native communities. And efforts to support and mentor Native American creative talents have helped a new generation of directors, producers and writers move into key roles, opening new possibilities for telling the stories of their communities. Vision Maker provides grants to most Native American programs presented on public television. Sometimes Vision Maker produces shows in-house, such as Growing Native, a four-part series coming out this fall. Thousands of protestors and media crews from the U.S. and around the world converged on the camp through 2016. There was nothing. She points to websites such as Indian Country Today and Reclaiming Native Truth, a project launched in 2016 to dispel misperceptions about Native America, for amplifying voices from Native America. The popularity of A Tribe Called Red, a Native producer and DJ crew from Canada, is another reflection of creative expression in popular culture. Directing the shots In the filmmaking world, Runningwater is credited with helping to nurture the new generation of Native American talents who are bringing their work to TV and movie screens. Runningwater oversees the Native Forum, which premieres films by Native filmmakers, and programs like the Time Warner Native Producers Fellowship, the Full Circle Fellowship, the Merata Mita Fellowship for Indigenous Artists and the Native Filmmakers Lab. Together these programs support 12 to 15 fellows each year, he said, depending on the level of funding. Alumni include Julianna Brannum, Comanche, series producer of Native America, and Jeffrey Palmer and Jhane Myers, producers of Words from a Bear: The Enigmatic Life of N. Scott Momaday. That film, supported by Vision Maker, will air on American Masters sometime next year. Runningwater For Runningwater, real progress will be achieved only when more Native talents are behind the camera as well as in front of it. It requires every grantee to have a Native American on its team, he said. Grant applicants have typically listed Native Americans as advisors, according to Sneve. Carriage growth Vision Maker also helps its grantees secure public TV broadcasts of their programs. Heightened interest in Native American programs shows up in the growing variety of distribution channels and the number of telecasts. PBS series such as Independent Lens, POV, American Experience and Frontline give filmmakers a big shot at reaching the broadest possible audience. When offering its programs to stations for customized local scheduling, Vision Maker also works with APT, PBS Plus and the National Educational Telecommunications Association. The digital multicast World Channel, which rebranded itself six years ago to showcase programs by independent and diverse producers, and FNX, the only U.S. channel devoted exclusively to Native and Indigenous programming, offer new opportunities to engage Native American communities. FNX, airing on 23 affiliates including public and tribal stations, launched in 2011 through a partnership between KVCR in San Bernardino, Calif., and the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians. It carries every program funded by Vision Maker, but also features original productions such as the Native American standup comedy series First Nations Comedy Experience. Data shared by the consortium show a dramatic increase in carriage of Vision Maker programs since 2014. The footprint of Native American programs on World made a big difference. Its telecasts of Vision Maker films jumped by 151 percent over the same three-year period, and then doubled from FY 2016 to FY 2017. About 10 percent of the film submissions World receives annually are programs by or about Native Americans, Hastings said. The shows he acquires air across the schedule, including on the weekly series America ReFramed, Doc World and Local, USA. Seventy-two licensees covering 63 percent of U.S. television households now carry the multicast service, which is distributed by APT.
