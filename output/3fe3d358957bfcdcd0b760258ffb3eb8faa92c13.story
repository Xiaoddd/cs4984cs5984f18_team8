Around the world there were revolutions with new ideas being discussed. The people wanted fewer restrictions, but the few at the peak of the social pyramid tightened their grip and increased their hold. Revolt was a result of repression and exploitation. Despite the stranglehold their respective oligarchies that ruled over them, people broke free from the shackles of fear that kept them forever holding their tongues. It also produces faster reaction time and heightened short term memory. A brief history: In December 1600, Queen Elizabeth I commissioned The British East India Company for expeditions to Asia. They were to seek out the best tea, opium and spices to bring back to the British Isle. At the time, tea was so expensive that only royalty generally partook. As the years passed there was so much tea in England and Europe that it became affordable and popular. Charles II also created the Hudson Bay Company, which colonized much of Canada and acted as defacto government in parts of North America. By the late 1700s there was a major tea market established in the British Colonies. Some Colonists felt increasingly exploited and began to express their dissatisfaction and resentment toward the laws of the distant monarchy and their local authorities. Throughout the 1700s many Colonists considered themselves to be essentially Englishmen. And as Englishmen, they believed they were entitled to the rights provided by the English Bill of Rights, but the perception of the English institutions was that the Colonists were not English and therefore did not have the same rights. He informed the Sheriff, and on April 13, 1772, the Sheriff and his Deputy rode into Weare. The pair arrived to collect the relevant fine from the mill owner, a prominent member of the community, under threat of imprisonment. It was late when the Sheriff and logger met, both agreed to meet again in the morning to settle the fine then. Just before daybreak they woke him up with beating. Known as the Pine Tree Riot, a white pine tree stands in the area commemorating the event. Eight men of Weare were identified through their thin disguises and were eventually caught, tried and (to the disdain of the sheriff) ordered to pay a small fine. Months later, in May 1773, the Tea Act was passed. As a result, the Tea Act made tea more affordable to the Colonists, but it also gave them less choice, and parliamentary taxation, and gave The Company monopolization of the market. At the time, The Company was facing financial troubles and needed an income boost. The French and Indian War was fought all around the world, but was concentrated in the Americas; a battle for American resources. FACT: George Washington and those under his command fired the first shots of the French and Indian War. George was known as a bold and impulsive young officer. The British and Natives fought the French and other Natives for seven years. George hoped to become a British officer for many years. When the promotion did not come, he became a farmer, until the Revolutionary War. The Boston Massacre started over an unpaid wig bill. Words were exchanged, snowballs were tossed and the situation escalated. Paul Revere was involved in the anti-establishment propaganda, producing a famous engraving of the Boston Massacre. They let the whole community know that the tea they enjoyed leads to their own exploitation, the exploitation of others, and the profit of imperialist Company strangers. In that moment, tea became the catalytic symbol of revolution against the encroachment of oligarchy. It is literally everywhere, in everything. There is no getting away from it, whether one lives next to a processing facility or in wild seclusion. In short, Kuwait, once part of Iraq, was partitioned by the colonizing and monopolizing British Empire via the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913. Rudolf invented different types of engines and received his first patent in 1893. His ideas for bio-fuels were not environmental or extraordinary departure, just sensible. However Rudolf and his invention were ultimately caught up in the arms race leading up to WWI, and he subsequently suffered several nervous breakdowns. He was of German heritage, but did not support the German build-up to war. He was on his way to sell his new technology to the British for their submarines amid the arms race leading up to WWI. In reality, it is just one of many viable fuels, which are in the best interests of individuals and their independence. But it was not just about money. During and following WWI, bio-fuels and any alternative fuels to petrol became just a load of hot air. Petrol is exclusive: a limited resource, mined in far off places, refined, and then distributed by institutions. Overdevelopment is the result of misused power; doing what we can because we can, not because we should. Its manifestations are sometimes blatant and other times difficult to see and understand. Sickening pollution is the most blatant consequence. Clear cut forests cannot be seen from the road, but traffic jams and smog clouds are impossible to avoid. Clean water alone is difficult to obtain for most of the world, and growing more difficult. And none of it would have happened without the oil-igarchy pulling the strings.
