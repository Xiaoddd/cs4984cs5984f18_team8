Ahmad Tibi said his move was meant to protest the Israeli bill that aims to bar mosques from using loudspeakers for the call to prayer in East Jerusalem and Arab communities in Israel. He accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of standing behind the controversial bill. On Saturday, the Israeli Ministerial Committee for Legislation approved the anti-adhaan bill before it goes to the Knesset, where it then must pass three rounds of voting before becoming law. Tibi called on Palestinians in East Jerusalem and Israel to stage disobedience against the bill. In a statement, Palestinian presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh warned that the Israeli bill will drag the region into a disaster. Israel occupied East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East War. Independent of Ahmad Tibi, another Knesset member, Teleb Abu Arar, also performed the call to prayer in the Knesset, much to the anger of his parliamentary colleagues.
