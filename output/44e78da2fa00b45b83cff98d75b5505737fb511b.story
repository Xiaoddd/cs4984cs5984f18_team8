News has confirmed that the CIA believes Russia interfered with the 2016 presidential election in favor of President-elect Donald Trump. This comes as Trump's expected pick for secretary of state, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, has ties with the foreign country. Donald Trump is expected to nominate ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state, two sources close to the transition process told NBC News on Saturday. The 64-year-old veteran oil executive has no government or diplomatic experience, although he has ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. advertisement He will also be paired with former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton as his deputy secretary of state, one of the sources added, with Bolton handling day-to-day management of the department. Chairman and CEO of US oil and gas corporation ExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson, speaks during the 2015 Oil and Money conference in central London on Oct. 7, 2015. Transition Update: No announcements on Secretary of State until next week at the earliest. He is set to retire from ExxonMobil next year since the company has a mandatory retirement age of 65, Reuters reported. He has never previously worked in government, but reportedly holds conservative political views. Tillerson has made tens of thousands of dollars worth of political donations over the past two decades to Republican groups and candidates, including to President George W. Bush and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. The Wall Street Journal reported that Tillerson backed Jeb Bush during the GOP presidential primary and did not donate to Trump's campaign. Little is known about where he stands on foreign policy, and as secretary of state, he would have to hit the ground running on major issues. Among them: handling the nuclear agreement with Iran that the Obama administration made in 2015; the sanctions imposed on Russia; disputes with China and North Korea; the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria; and rebuilding Afghanistan and Iraq. While he has spent his entire career in the energy sector, Tillerson does have experience dealing with foreign governments since ExxonMobil operates in more than 50 countries.
