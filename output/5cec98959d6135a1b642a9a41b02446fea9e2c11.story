Need to get something off my chest that I witnessed and found very disturbing in my brief time there that I believe many others have started to speak up about as well. I mean that seriously. Plymouth rock seriously. They are coming in, taking food, clothing and occupying space without any desire to participate in camp maintenance and without respect of tribal protocols. Officers in riot gear clashed again Wednesday with protesters near the Dakota Access pipeline, hitting dozens with pepper spray as they waded through waist-deep water in an attempt to reach property owned by the pipeline's developer.

Another Twitter user said they had witnessed a protestor turn down tap water to spend donations on 'fluoride free' water. It says protestors should avoid drugs and alcohol, engage with the elders, and refrain from playing guitars around campfires. The North Dakota Pipeline protest was sparked by plans to construct a 1,170-mile long pipeline which would run across four states. Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline, says that it has taken measures to prevent leaks, and that there is no archaeological significance to the area. Standing Rock protests continue: 'Water is life' Thousands of people have been gathering to support the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in their legal battle against the plan. On Saturday activists protesting the continued construction of the pipeline were told to shut down one of their camps by 5 December in a letter sent to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's leader by the Army Corps. However US authorities said on Sunday that they had no plans to forcibly remove activists. The US Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the federal land where the main protest camp is located, said in a statement that anyone who remained would be considered unauthorised and could be subject to various citations. It also said emergency services might not be adequately provided to the area. High profile supporters who have expressed their support for the cause include Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, Lupita Nyong'o, Whoopi Goldberg and Mark Ruffalo.
