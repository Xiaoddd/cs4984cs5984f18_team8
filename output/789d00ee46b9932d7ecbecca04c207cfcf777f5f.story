The railway safety working group want railways, shippers and producers to assume full liability for accidents and spills of dangerous goods. Forty-seven people were killed and a large swath of downtown was destroyed on July 6, 2013, when an unmanned 72-car train jumped the track, spilling and igniting some six million litres of volatile crude oil. Ongoing decontamination work was also halted briefly to mark the tragedy. A low-key mass was held Sunday night. Politicians of all stripes marked the anniversary, vowing to continue to support the community. Premier Philippe Couillard hailed the resolve of locals and said in a statement the province would keep helping the town of 6,000. 02:38 Extended video: Lawyers for accused in Lac-Megantic disaster want charges dropped 02:01 Federal government reacts to Lac-Megantic report 02:09 Safety issues come to light in Lac-Megantic 04:23 Lac-Megantic report: An accident waiting to happen 00:48 TSB issues report on Lac-Megantic disaster 06:01 Re-building Lac-Megantic 03:15 TSB release animation recreating Lac-Megantic train derailment Prime Minister Stephen Harper also praised residents as the town rebuilds and heals. He added that those found guilty of breaking the law will be held to account. In late June, several people and the defunct rail company at the heart of the disaster were hit with new federal charges. Previously, Harding, two fellow railway employees and the company were charged by the Crown in Quebec with 47 counts of criminal negligence causing death. A trial date is expected to be set Sept. 8. NDP Leader Tom Mulcair and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau also marked the anniversary and both said not enough has been done. Mulcair said the NDP called in January for an independent investigation into transportation of dangerous goods by rail. In March, the government announced proposed new federal regulations that would give companies until 2025 to upgrade rail tank cars to a higher safety standard. If the legal challenge fails, lawyers representing victims and creditors hope money can start being disbursed later this year. Please read our Commenting Policy first.
