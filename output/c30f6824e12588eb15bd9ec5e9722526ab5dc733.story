The defense of water and assertion of Indigenous sovereignty did not end yesterday as law enforcement violently evicted Water Protectors from the unceded land we have called home for months. The struggle against the black snake and its world continues. We also remind our relatives that this violent eviction is only one part of a well-coordinated and multi-dimensional strategy of repression by local, state, and federal law enforcement that seeks to crush our resistance. Use social media with great care and always assume that your account is under heavy surveillance. If you or your loved ones are approached by law enforcement of any kind, exercise your right to remain silent. If you or your loved ones are approached by law enforcement or harassed in any way, contact WPLC Legal Support at (701) 595-0737. Continue to act in the spirit developed at the camps, one of graciousness and solidarity. Do not publicly condemn the tactics or choices of others. Maintain security of your phones and computers as much as possible. Use Signal Private Messenger for encrypted texts and calls whenever possible. Switch to encrypted email services like Riseup.net or ProtonMail.com. Visit our websites (links below) for lots more legal information, resources, and support. Relatives and comrades, be vigilant but unafraid. We have stood together in this movement through many battles. We will continue to hold one another through the trauma of forced removal from Oceti Oyate. Care for yourselves and one another. Make space to mourn but also to celebrate our victories. This is what solidarity truly looks like. Water Protector Legal Collective (WPLC), Freshet Collective, and the Water Protector Anti-Repression Crew work in coalition to provide on-the-ground legal support and training for Water Protectors engaged in resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock.
