APTN News reports, The Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Council has voted to oust the Red Warrior camp over the tactics it uses in the field. Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Council Vote 10-0. The burned hulks of heavy trucks sit on Highway 1806 near Cannon Ball, N.D., on Friday, Oct. 28, near the spot where protesters of the Dakota Access pipeline were evicted from private property a day earlier. Hall had also condemned the vandalism of Dakota Access construction equipment during protest actions. According to Mint Press News, Militarized riot police raided two frontline camps on Oct. 27, making 107 arrests as they deployed pepper spray, stun guns, and physical force in response to a crowd of unarmed water protectors who were blocking the path of pipeline construction. The water protectors attempted to keep police and pipeline workers from accessing the construction site by setting fires to barricades, but police were able to eventually remove everyone from the frontline camps and reclaim the land. Gabriella Scarlett, a water protector from Canada, signals for peace as a fire barricade burns off County Road 134. Behind her, water protectors establish a fire barricade to hold police back from the site of construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. Oct. 27, 2016 (Derrick Broze for MintPress) Hall, while saying that he does not speak for the group, believes the Red Warrior Camp is still present at the camp.
