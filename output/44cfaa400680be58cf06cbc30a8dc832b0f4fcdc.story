That is, if only they complied to the demands of the inching destructive crawl of white colonialism. The indigenous people agreed, though in most cases against their will. The flagrant disregard the United States holds for the treaties they signed with so many indigenous nations, is not simply an atrocity of the past. This fascist indifference is still playing out. In an attempt to stand in solidarity with these warriors, who are not only about to face down an attempt, by this rotten government, at an eviction. But, also the unforgiving freeze of the bitter northern plains. We will be holding a sale and donation drive Saturday (12.3) for our comrades who are continuing to fight, despite the threats and the unforgiving cold. The state has said it is coming to evict the camps on the 5th. So in a small gesture of solidarity, on Saturday (12.3) from 10AM to 2PM at Revolutionary Grounds, in Tucson, AZ, we will be holding a small but sexy benefit sale and donation drive for our rebellious comrades. This event will also serve as an opportunity for people in our community to donate to the Standing Rock Resistance. We plan on sending the items the fastest way possible, later that evening. Below we have included a list of what our comrades need in their struggle against the state and the bitter cold of the north. Please do not bring anything to donate that is not on the list. If you wanted to go to Standing Rock but cannot, this is a great opportunity to show via mutual aid, you stand in solidarity against colonialism, environmental degradation, and in solidarity with the sovereignty of the Indigenous Tribes of this stolen country. If you have any questions pertaining to the particularities of what to donate please feel free to email us. IGD is not the author nor are we responsible for the post content.
