Courtesy: MGN Online Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners asked U.S. District Judge James Boasberg (BOHZ'-burg) to stop the Corps from publishing a notice in the Federal Register announcing the study. Boasberg set a hearing on the matter Wednesday. ETP wants any further study put on hold until Boasberg rules on whether ETP already has the necessary permission to lay pipe under Lake Oahe, the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's water source. The Corps disputes permission has been granted, and says study is needed on alternate routes.
