The proposed ordinance, a collaboration between indigenous activists like Matt Remle and Kshama Sawant's office, dovetails with a national effort from anti-Dakota Access pipeline activists to take money away from banks financing the pipeline project. But the proposed legislation doesn't just cover concerns over the Dakota Access pipeline. The ordinance's authors take issue with another Wells Fargo scandal, including the recent revelation from federal regulators that Wells Fargo employees enrolled 2,000,000 people in fake accounts over five years in order to hit sales targets and secure multimillion-dollar bonuses. If the measure succeeds, the City Council would request that the mayor and his director of finance of administrative services divest from Wells Fargo in 2018 by not renewing the city's contract with the bank. The measure also requests that the city refrain from doing any new business with Wells Fargo for a full year once the legislation is passed. The bill has been referred to the City Council's Affordable Housing, Neighborhoods, and Finance committee in January.
