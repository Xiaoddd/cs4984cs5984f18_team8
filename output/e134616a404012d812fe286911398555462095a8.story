We will be sending AND fully supporting a group of ambassadors from the Wabanaki Region (tribal members and allies) to actively support those who are standing at Standing Rock. The water protectors need people in the camps to stand with them. And, every person there requires a great deal of material support to maintain their stand, especially during the winter months. Our goal is to provide the physical support needed at Standing Rock, without placing any additional burden on the camps. We will do this by fully supporting the individuals that we send for this three-month period. To accomplish our goal, we will need to purchase winter shelters, subzero sleeping bags, cots, food, water filtration devices, winter clothing, and ongoing replenishment of food, health care items, and other supplies. We will also need to provide any other necessary support, such as legal and medical services, as needed. To keep our people healthy, we will also be providing monthly support to those on the ground, by sending out a rotating crew of respite workers, to offer mental, emotional, spiritual, and practical assistance. We need your help to make this happen. We ask you to please donate to this page, and then share this page with your contacts. They are standing for us all. We still have contacts out there and a few members of the group have returned. We would like to continue to help them in anyway that we can. We have started sending loads of wood out and would like to continue to do so. For anyone wishing to see them off, we will be meeting at the community building on Indian Island. We are just about a week away from our departure date. If anyone knows of someone who would like to donate a van or SUV or sell fairly cheap, send them my way. Please try again.
