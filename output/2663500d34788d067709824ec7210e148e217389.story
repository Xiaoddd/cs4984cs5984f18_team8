Involved in environmental protection for 25 years, the Indigenous Environmental Network is working in opposition to the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. The project, which requires the approval of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, would cross a river half a mile from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation border. It has been protested by American Indians, environmentalists and others. Earlier this week, former UFC champion Ronda Rousey also was spotted in South Dakota, lending support to the anti-DAPL activists.

After following the events at Standing Rock over the last year or so, the band was motivated to get involved in its own way in late 2016. The band made time around its live obligations to record the song with producer John Seymour, and it's now available to purchase on iTunes or stream on Spotify.
