We have the power to join together and fight back. Now more than ever, we need to shore up our bonds of community, activate our networks, and make our voices heard. What to Expect from US Foreign Politics Time: Fri. With Medea Benjamin, Vijay Prashad, Jillian Schwedler, and Ingar Solty. Focusing on different regions, we will look at what to expect in terms of strategic alliances, shifting partnerships, conflict resolution, multilateralism, environmental policies, and more. This panel will bring together international and American experts who will try to explain how the new administration might reshape the current world order, and what the progressive global community should expect in coming years. Medea Benjamin will lead the discussion, providing an overview on the potentially radical shifts expected in US foreign policy. Ingar Solty will then discuss impacts on Europe. Jillian Schwedler will tackle the challenges facing the Middle East under this new administration, and Vijay Prashad will close by analyzing the implications of a Trump presidency for the global South. Afterwards, the speakers will sit together for a more open-ended discussion of US foreign policy under Trump. Triggered by the unpredictability of a Trump administration, this event will seek to offer a peek toward the deeply difficult years ahead of us. It will also try to provide tools to help us make sense of the world we live in and to understand how the struggle for a new system of global governance is more relevant today than ever. A Palestine Action Time: Fri. BRING FAMILY AND FRIENDS. SHARE WIDELY. WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. There will also be cash and Venmo donation options at the event. This event will use the story of Lower East Side squatters, who occupied abandoned city-owned buildings in the 1980s, fought to keep them for decades, and are now completing a long, complicated process to turn their illegal occupancy into legal cooperative ownership, to explore these questions. Ours to Lose not only tells a little-known New York story, it also shows how property shapes our sense of ourselves as social beings and explores the ethics of homeownership and debt in post-recession America. In this listening party and discussion Amy Starecheski, an oral historian, anthropologist, and former squatter, will play some of the oral histories on which the book is based and facilitate a conversation about the relevance of this history in the present moment. All are welcome. Books will be for sale, and refreshments will be served. All royalties from the sale of Ours to Lose go to Picture the Homeless. Amy Starecheski is co-director of the Oral History Master of Arts program at Columbia University. She received a PhD in cultural anthropology from the CUNY Graduate Center, where she was a Public Humanities Fellow. Readers will include Emily Skillings, Catherine Pond, and Jen Hyde among others. The floor will be open to any and all writers. Please feel free to bring any work to present, either your own or by others, that has helped you through this turbulent political season. We also welcome reflections, commentaries, and discussion. This event will be hosted by Gabriela Garcia and Halley Furlong-Mitchell. We hope you may join us as we mobilize together through poetry to help process this moment and to empower and support each other, especially those most at risk. We hope that this will be a gathering in the spirit of community and togetherness, meeting intolerance and atrocity with love, empathy, imagination and resistance. NYC Socialists Red Holiday Party Time: Fri. From millions supporting an open socialist Presidential candidate to the election of billionaire bigot Donald Trump. And 2016 is the year in which the Standing Rock Sioux have stood up to the combined forces of the oil companies and the state to protect their sovereign land rights and our water. There could also be no better time to become an organized socialist. Capitalism is certainly not working for most of us and we need a answer to this madness. All proceeds from the door and bar will be donated to a) the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council and b) the Water Protector Legal Collective (formerly Red Owl Legal Collective). Cash bar. No byob. Saturday, December 10 Organizer Training Time: Sat. OPEN TO EVERYONE. Non-CUNY peeps have to sign in at the West Building, so have an ID. Please note: Some portions will be CUNY-centric, but the techniques we will be going over are easily applied elsewhere. Please RSVP so a head count can be determined. All are welcome Send Love Through the Walls Time: Sat. This event is always a lot of fun, the food outstanding, the camaraderie lively, and the handmade cards flat out amazing. This year will be no different. So plan to bring your friends, your creativity, and a healthy appetite. When you go into the building, take the elevator to your left. This is manifest through the dual expectation that cultural producers work for exposure whilst institutional staff and contracted laborers work for less than a living wage. Arts-activist campaigns like W.A.G.E. and Gulf Labor have strategically focused on correcting certain inbuilt inequalities, but neither have yet incorporated a discussion of the economic underpinnings of white supremacy in the art system, despite it regularly being cited as one of the least diverse professional sectors. Decolonize This Place has operated on a maintenance economy that is more germane to movement-building work than the professional compensation structure of the established art world. In the years to come, with a Trump presidency likely to be hostile to the lifeblood of free and critical expression, movement art will be needed more than ever. Nitasha Dhillon Lise Soskolne (W.A.G.E.) Mabel Wilson David Joselit Eva Mayhabal Davis A Gallery Intern NoDAPL Party & Fundraiser with DJ Red Daughter & Flwrshrk Time: Sat. Late night dance party with DJ Red Daughter and FLWRSHRK spinning. The fight still continues. They are the on-the-ground legal support at Standing Rock. There are about 500 legal cases that lawyers are still trying to get through (and there are certain to be more coming up). Sunday, December 11 On the Ground Running: Protest Support Training Time: Sun. Our comrades are putting their bodies on the line, and they need our support in specific and tangible ways. In the spirit of solidarity and sustainability, join us as we practice and share skills for the difficult times ahead. The training is co-sponsored by the A.J. Muste Institute. Time: Sat. We are hosting a letter writing party where members, the local community and market shoppers can write and sign letters for the 12 Amnesty International cases identified for this campaign. These letters have been known to: help convince government officials to free prisoners of conscience, support human rights defenders, and end other urgent cases of abuse. Illumination Against Gentrification: Sign-Building Workshop Time: Sun. Meanwhile, anarchists, Black nationalists, communists, and socialists debate how to oppose capitalism and build the world anew. Anti-racist and anti-fascist brigades create marches, fundraisers, defense trainings, and direct actions. Cultural workers weaponize arts and literatures to counter the rise of a new imperial order. As post-Depression fascist regimes arose in the Dominican Republic, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain, Black and Jewish radicals co-organized against Jim Crow and anti-Semitic terror to form mass anti-capitalist coalitions. The event will be livestreamed and recorded, and a guide will be shared for future studies. Our informal gathering allowed us to connect with what is at stake for each of us in this work and continue building deeper together. In extension of community defense, we want our neighbors to visualize themselves in scenarios where they can protect their community members by plugging into a rapid response network that aims to intervene and can connect folks to sanctuary spaces in cases of emergencies. All are welcomed to attend and join the work, please bring some food to share. The State of Trans Health Care in New York Time: Sun. This workshop will broadly address some of the changes that may occur with the next administration change, featuring insight from legal, medical and public health experts in transgender medical care services. Vengan para aprender como proteger y defender nuestra comunidad de las redadas inmigratorias. Puerto Rico is a colony of the United States. Puerto Rico will not be free until all of our political prisoners are free, until all U.S military bases are closed, until the undemocratically elected fiscal control board is abolished, until our land, beaches, and natural resources are back in the hands of the Puerto Rican people, until we RISE UP. -We mattered when they came into our motherlands to rape and pillage our land and the women. -We mattered when our sugarcane, coffee, and tobacco fields were full and busting at the seams. -We mattered until we stood up and demanded a better quality of life and an actual future for our people. Our liberation is contingent on unity. Join us Decolonize This Place for an evening of resistance, where we will discuss the anti colonial struggle in Puerto Rico. There will be a presentation and panel that showcases voices from the island and the diaspora that are a part of the movement for Puerto Rican liberation. Light refreshments will be served. Art photography by Ana Francesca The Ongoing Struggle Time: Sun. On Sunday, join The New Inquiry to hear from activists and movement builders whose struggles we inherit. The event will feature organizers who have been working on the front lines of climate, anti-police brutality, prison abolition, queer health, anti-War on Terror, anti-racist, and anti-bigotry movements. It will be livestreamed and recorded. SOHO20 is an organization that started in response to a time when women were disenfranchised in the art world and beyond. DAPL has used mace, attack dogs, rubber bullets, and now water cannons against peaceful and unarmed protestors. Please come by for a night of live music and words by indigenous artists and allies. Mission: Mobilizing women and allies to leverage our collective power as citizens for immediate action against any effort to erode the rights of women and other vulnerable groups. Strike out message: The president-elect has demonstrated overt contempt for women and a troubling sexual misogyny before and during his campaign. So we must take action ourselves.

In addition, we stand in solidarity with the myriad other groups the president-elect has maligned during his shameful campaign. Victory: On the 12th of December, women and allies in cities across the country unify to demonstrate our collective power.

Special guests who will share their experience in movements and as composers of rebel music are Abiodun Oyewole of The Last Poets & Mahina Movement. Free event. Spread the word. New York must end mass incarceration, promote community empowerment, stop state violence and torture, and end structural racism while protecting the rights of Black, Latino, Muslim, and Native people; women; LGBTI people; poor people of all backgrounds; people with mental health needs; and all New Yorkers. Toward these ends, New York must adopt parole and bail reform, HALT solitary confinement, close Rikers and Attica, raise the age of criminal responsibility, revamp all sentencing, restore voting rights and college access to people in prison, protect domestic violence survivors, and promote racial justice including through a truth, justice, and reconciliation commission.

Politics in Public Space in Words and Pictures Time: Tues. LEN (a lawyer in history) provides us with historic perspectives on occupation from the case of the Chicago 7, and the newly re-issued War in the Neighborhood gives insight into gentrification and displacement from the viewpoint of the 1980s Lower East Side. LEN (A LAWYER IN HISTORY) is a a graphical biography of radical attorney Leonard Weinglass who represented the Chicago 7, Daniel Ellsberg, the Cuban 5 and many other political defendants. This book examines 60 years of American history through the life and work of one man, and is available now from AK Press. Now available in a new edition with an introduction by AK Thompson, it is a first hand account of the Squatters movement during which abandoned buildings were seized to make low income housing, and then had to be defended within a divided community. So many, that not all could fit in the space and many held a speak out at a nearby park. Committees are meeting this week. The anger is ripe, women are showing up for the movement in droves. We have the momentum to build real power. Wednesday, December 14 Panel on Intergenerational Trauma Time: Wed. The collective impacts of oppression and harm are passed down from one generation to the next. Light reception will follow. This evening was organized by the Icarus Project and co-sponsored by the Barnard Center for Research on Women. This event is located in the James Room on the 4th Floor of Barnard Hall. Barnard Hall is located immediately upon entering through the main gate of the Barnard College campus at Broadway and 117th Street (Manhattan). We must also expect that Trump and his cronies will halt, abandon or repeal recent progressive improvements in workers rights protections at the federal level. This forum will be an opportunity to strategize how we will continue to fight for economic justice and respect in the workplace, but also to tell our legislators, regulators, and allies the ways in which we expect them to stand up for and defend immigrant workers in New York. While this seems like a positive step in the right direction, we all know how Trump likes to say one thing and then do the exact opposite. Sort of like how he denounced White Supremacy and then appointed Stephen Bannon as his Chief Strategist. The same children who have appeared at numerous state functions and Trump administration planning meetings. He needs to understand that he will be held accountable every step of the way, and that we will hold him to his promises. Protest against the racist, misogynistic, anti-science appointments Trump has made, Protest against his implicit encouragement of hate crimes across the country, and against government corruption, nepotism, and favoritism to special interest groups. I will update when we have more info. Bring signs and most of all energy and a loud voice. Art After Trump Time: Thurs. Line-up to be announced. This event will directly benefit Housing Works, and no other entities involved are spending money or making money on the event. All performances at Housing Works are donations. Housing Works was started out of ACT UP, and we knew then that raising our own money would be essential to our survival and the survival of the communities we served, because the state and federal government was refusing to help. Trump and the Republican Party have pledged to overturn the Affordable Care Act, a critical platform Housing Works has leveraged to address disparities in health based on poverty, race, sexual orientation, and other markers. And we now know we are facing a federal assault on reproductive rights, LGBT rights, on immigrants and the cities and states that protect them. On December 15, we will gather members of the creative and artistic communities to speak for human rights, just as the founders of the AIDS movement did thirty years ago. We hope you will join us. On December 15, we will gather members of the creative and artistic communities to speak for human rights, just as the founders of the AIDS movement did thirty years ago. We hope you will join us. Protest Hillary Clinton Party to Thank Millionaire Donors Time: Thurs. Limousine Democrats gave us Trump and weve just about had it with them. At a time where change was demanded, the DNC decided to give us the same type of campaign that catered to the millionaire and billionaire class as well as Wall Street while ignoring the working people.. This is exactly why the Democratic party lost. Americans are turned off by the tone deaf approach that was carried out throught the primary and election. No we dont want Pelosi as minority leader and we want a DNC chair that will bring about the transformation that we desperately need. Home About Contact Submissions ABOUT We are Blunderbuss Magazine, a web magazine of arts, culture, and politics, an ordnance of fire and improvisation. What ties together these essays, stories, poems, photographs, comics, and other bits of aesthetic shrapnel is a common attitude of visceral humanism. We aim for earnest noise.
