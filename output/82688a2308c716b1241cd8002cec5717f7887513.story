Officials are restoring normal traffic on a stretch of North Dakota highway that was closed for months due to protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Part of state Highway 1806 was shut down in late October after a bridge was damaged by fires during protests. Late last week, authorities began allowing traffic with the assistance of pilot cars escorting vehicles over the 9-mile stretch near the site where pipeline opponents camped for months. The camps were cleared out and shut down late last month in advance of spring flooding season. Morton County sheriff's spokesman Rob Keller says the highway is being fully reopened, without pilot cars, at noon Tuesday. Environmental activists who tried to disrupt some oil pipeline operations in four states to protest the Dakota Access pipeline say they aren't responsible for any recent attacks on that pipeline.

Jay O'Hara with the Climate Disobedience Center told The Associated Press Tuesday that Climate Direct Action wasn't involved, and he isn't aware of anyone claiming responsibility. In October, Climate Direct Action activists tried to shut valves on oil pipelines in North Dakota, Minnesota, Montana and Washington. But O'Hara says the group has no plans to target Dakota Access.
