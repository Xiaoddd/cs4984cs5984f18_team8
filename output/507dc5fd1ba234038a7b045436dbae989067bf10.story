Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stands during question period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on May 7, 2018. The federal government may be setting itself up for tough times after it nationalized the Trans Mountain pipeline, Tim Harper writes. The Liberal government will own the Trans Mountain pipeline twinning project on the west coast, but it will also own all the baggage that comes with a project that is still not guaranteed to be built. Buying the pipeline was the least palatable option available to a prime minister who has repeatedly called the project a matter of national interest.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau sold the move Tuesday as a shrewd investment, a temporary nationalization that may end up costing taxpayers nothing, perhaps even making money.

(The Canadian Press) If, in fact, it gets built and legal challenges or civil disobedience do not eventually kill it. That is just the first risk. Maybe they can find a pension fund or another energy company or a First Nations community to buy this project, but if no buyer is found, Ottawa has a pipeline project that is going to run into the billions of dollars with an uncertain payout. This does not send a message to international investors that Canada, as Morneau, put it, can get big things done. It tells the world that to get big things done, the government has to step in as the foreign investor takes its money and runs. A prime minister who styled himself as a progressive environmental champion will now be known as the leader who purchased a pipeline to ensure it was built. And then there is the opposition on the ground in Burnaby. The country will be watching as emotional protests are no longer centred on a federally-approved project being built by a company from Texas, but are now centred on a federally-owned pipeline and the federal government itself. Confrontation in Burnaby will build and Trudeau will have to answer for that. The Liberal government should have seen this train bearing down on it a year ago, but it ultimately had to bow to a timetable set by the energy company. If this expansion is being built by a private company this time next year, Trudeau may find some relief, but this will cost him both in British Columbia and Quebec where the steamrolling of provincial wishes by the federal government do not sit well with voters. Tuesday was a great day for a Texas-based energy behemoth, but it was something less than that for Canadian taxpayers.
