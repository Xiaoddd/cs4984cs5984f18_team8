Too much time has already passed, too much damage has been done. They are dogmatic zealots who consider themselves beyond reproach and incapable of iniquity. They see themselves are noble warriors waging an unrelenting war against injustice, when in reality they are lunatics lost in a world of ghosts. Unfortunately, ALICIA ROSE MITZEL is paying the price for falling victim to their siren song. It never had to be this way. It would have been one thing if she had been the casualty of a movement that mattered. Instead of screwing up, learning her lesson, and brushing herself off, a little wiser for the experience, ALICIA ROSE MITZEL vanished from the midst of thousands of protesters who should have had her back, but instead gave her disappearance the same concern one might have for a lost sock. Operating under the cover of mainstream and independent media sympathetic to their cause, the public was oblivious to the fact that the protests camps were hastily assembled activist boom towns perpetually teetering on the brink of anarchy. Good publicity coupled with an intriguing narrative that portrayed the movement as a David vs Goliath struggle of spiritually-awakened indigenous Americans against corporate greed interests unconcerned enabled the movement to grow quickly, buoyed by celebrity endorsements and a wave of financial support from concerned citizens. Without the influx of large sums of cash and supplies inspired by this perception, the water protectors would never have evolved into anything more than a curiosity on the prairie. If the public ever found out that the idyllic assembly of tipis, solar panels, and sacred fires they saw on TV was nothing more than a Potemkin Village concealing radical eco-extremists, con artists, and opportunists, the house of cards would have quickly crumbled. The movement needed immediate, overwhelming support in order to succeed. Therefore, one of the first initiatives of the camps was to implement strict press controls. By controlling information coming out of the camps, the movement was able to manipulate the national conversation in its favor. Sympathetic news outlets played along, lest they lose access to a hot story, while critical news outlets were denied access at best and physically intimidated at worst. activists, the camps were largely autonomous communities with no official organization, infrastructure, or long-term strategy. The Sovereigns of Standing Rock continued to focus their efforts on slick direct action stunts that kept the movement in the news and kept the cash flowing. Water Protectors were equated with civil rights legends such as Martin Luther King, Jr and Cesar Chavez. Intoxicated by delusions of grandeur and a sense of invincibility, the practical considerations of running the camps were little more than an after thought. This was a righteous crusade against the Black Snake, the rebirth of the American Indian movement, an indigenous renaissance. He was on the front lines of the Occupy movement and the fight against Keystone XL. He was on the ground supporting the community during the Ferguson riots. His commitment to the environment and social justice has been demonstrated by his actions time and again. It motivated him to travel to Standing Rock with the intention of staying six months. As with previous efforts, he went straight to work supporting the workaday infrastructure of building a community that was all but ignored by a media presence more concerned with reporting on the action at the front lines rather than humdrum efforts like building toilet facilities. Working security at the Sicangu (Rosebud Sioux Tribe) Camp, Cunningham experienced a seedier side of the camps ignored by activities that went on behind the scenes that are ignored by sympathetic media and trust fund hippies tourists. The only reason he was there so long was because he had to find a way to evade vindictive security personnel. In perhaps the worst rude awakening imaginable for a dedicated activist, Cunningham found the camps rife with criminal activity. The camps were a law unto themselves which presented a very real threat to anyone considering reporting violations to tribal authorities. In the end, Cunningham made the courageous choice to approach the Tribal Council of Rosebud about what he witnessed out of concern for maintaining the integrity of the movement. He was attacked as a sell out, accused of being a federal agent, endured attacks on his character, attacked by the Standing Rock stalwarts as an infiltrator, and alleged to be corrupted by the Black Snake, among other things (seriously, read the comments at the bottom of his note). I respect him even more for having the courage to address faults he found in an effort to improve the movement. Likewise, those who are legitimately concerned about the success of a movement welcome the opportunity to improve that criticisms provides. Forcing children to engage in sex acts in exchange for food. They are so certain they are right, they never even consider the possibility that they might be wrong. They are not interested in debate; like true radical militants, they do not achieve their goals through rational discourse, but through brute force. Such dogmatic thinking breeds environments of intolerance that quash any hint of dissent. In such societies, the will of the collective takes precedence over individual autonomy. Rape cases are notoriously difficult to prosecute. Rape victims are scrutinized in ways no other victim of violent crime experiences. One such situation played out during the protests. True to form, the crime was downplayed and the situation resolved in the quietest (as opposed to the most effective) was possible. In other words, a rapist was set free, with his anonymity preserved, in order for the camp to save face. Thanks, Obama. It is not concerned with justice. Given how seldom rape is reported in mainstream society, I have a hunch there were quite a few more sexual assaults in the camps than protest leaders have admitted. Just pay a visit to Cannon Ball district chairman Robert Fool Bear Sr. and ask him about the five-count federal indictment that accuses him of sexually abusing a young girl from 2009 to 2010 and again in 2015. I could write an entire article about all the batshit crazy ideas that fall out of their heads. We can expect such people to make rational decisions as often as we expect chickens to pick winning Lotto numbers. Nevertheless, such things need to be mentioned because it raises tremendous suspicion about their culpability in the disappearance of ALICIA ROSE MITZEL. I AM NOT EXAGGERATING. ALICIA ROSE MITZEL was seen by a medic on 25 OCT 2016 after being burned in an explosion. Both the details of the explosion and location of the explosion have not been widely publicized. However, we know for a fact that she was seen in the camps (likely Sacred Stone). This much is irrefutable. In spite of the fact that she was seen by a medic, for a protest-related injury, she simply vanished without a trace the very same day. The poor state of security was nothing short of criminal, but the whole endeavor was organized haphazardly to begin with, so perhaps they can be forgiven for not having the foresight or initiative to properly organize the camp infrastructure. Worse yet, there is evidence of a subsequent cover up and intimidation of those trying to find ALICIA ROSE MITZEL. ALICIA ROSE MITZEL has been missing for 4.5 months. It was known that she was missing since 25 OCT 2016. To their credit, Oceti Sakowin made a post about her on 12 MAR 2017. Likewise, Lost and Missing in Indian Country and Lost and Found Standing Rock People both started publishing notices asking for information on her whereabouts last year. The situation could be much more complex than evidence available to an outside observer suggests. Kids run away for a lot of reasons. There are not words of condemnation strong enough to adequately censure fanatics who would intimidate people for trying to find a missing girl. They have no shortage of time and money to waste building illegal structures they know are just going to be torn down, but organizing a community effort to find a missing girl is just too much to ask. As far as I can tell, these despicable charlatans would rather ALICIA ROSE MITZEL be forced to turn tricks in truck stops at the mercy of sex traffickers than jeopardize their lucrative cash cow. The vast majority of them may indeed be peaceful, prayerful protesters, but those angels of the movement are used by arsonists, terrorists, sex offenders, and con artists who use legitimate protesters as cover for their nefarious activities. It resides in the hearts of double-tongues who put their own pride and self-interests ahead of the safety of a child. I can only hope that ALICIA ROSE MITZEL is found safe, found well, and found soon. Give Zuzeca Sape a round of applause.
