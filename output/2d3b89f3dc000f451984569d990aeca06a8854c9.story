Jeniece and David LaCross, who operate separate law firms in Port Orchard and defend clients accused of everything from murder to meth possession, traveled last month to North Dakota to defend people cited as part of the demonstrations against the Dakota Access Pipeline. More than 700 protest-related arrests were made from August 2016 through February, according to reports. The LaCross siblings each have been assigned a handful of defendants. On the morning of a trial last month, prosecutors in North Dakota dismissed the charges, then refiled different charges after the LaCross siblings returned home to Washington state. So they will return again in August, prepared for trial. She watched the demonstrations, which prompted outrage when authorities used hoses and dogs to disperse protesters. She said she was inspired seeing people come together and stand up for the environment and the rights of indigenous people. Although it may be the farthest the two lawyers travel to perform free legal defense, it has become a passion for the brother and sister, who both represent liberal-cause demonstrators charged with crimes across Western Washington. Most recently, last month, David represented six women in Skagit County charged with obstructing a rail line during an environmental protest against coal trains. David asked, responding to a question about why they are liberals. It was never their lifelong plan to become liberals, or lawyers, or work in criminal law, or oppose the government in the hardest, heaviest cases. David joined an apprentice program at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard after leaving the Navy. Jeniece dreamed of being an investigative overseas journalist. Although the cases they take defending protesters are for minor crimes, like disorderly conduct or trespassing, both have taken on first-degree murder cases in Kitsap County Superior Court. Each has a different perspective on how they were led to pick the same career. Jeniece likes the intensity. After flying back to North Dakota in August, whether the cases resolve or not, they intend to keep working pro bono for those prosecuted as part of their involvement in protests.
