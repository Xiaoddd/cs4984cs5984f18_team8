RELATED: Ecuador Indigenous Groups Ravaged by Chevron Will Fight On In 1993, a group of 30,000 Indigenous villagers from the Ecuadorian Amazon organized the Union of People Affected by Texaco, or UDAPT. Together they filed a class action lawsuit against Chevron for its harmful behavior, including spilling 60 billion liters of toxic water into the Amazon. ANALYSIS: Correa: 'Corruption' Lets Chevron off Hook for Amazon Pollution Chevron tried to convince the court that their harmful practices did not cause any health issues, by paying experts to support their innocence. With their team of well paid lawyers and experts they dragged the case out, which in turn stretched the economically weak UDAPT. And that the case is not just important to Chevron, but also to other corporations that are immune from being held accountable for their environmental neglect. Fajardo also explained that Chevron had a vested interest in global conflict as a pretext for the cheap exploitation of oil. Chevron has a dark past as the first U.S. oil company to support and sell oil to Spain's fascist dictator Francisco Franco, as well as Mussolini in Italy and Hitler in Nazi Germany. Chevron also exploited oil reserves in developing countries, particularly in Latin America but also in Niger and Burma. It was the first time an Indigenous group has successfully sued an oil company. Chevron refused to pay, pulling operations out of Ecuador and hiding their assets in other parts of the world, making it difficult for victims to gain compensation. Numerous witness and supporters were paid by Chevron to influence legal outcomes, allowing them to evade justice.
