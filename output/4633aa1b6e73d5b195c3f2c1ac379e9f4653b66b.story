The Keystone XL pipeline was intended to connect oil (technically diluted bitumen) from the oil sands of Alberta, Canada to refineries and ports on the Gulf of Mexico. The pipeline was strongly opposed by advocates for action on climate change because the processing required to extract useful oil from the thick bitumen makes it an even bigger source of CO2 emissions than usual. In November 2015, the Obama administration rejected the pipeline after a long period of uncertainty, citing the contribution to climate change and a lack of significant benefits in terms of jobs and US energy prices. The Dakota Access pipeline was intended to run between the Bakken Shale oil field in western North Dakota and facilities in Illinois, but protests near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation brought national scrutiny to the project. Details on how the Trump administration intends to get around these decisions are not yet available. President Trump has owned stock in Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the Dakota Access pipeline. reader comments Share this story Scott K.
