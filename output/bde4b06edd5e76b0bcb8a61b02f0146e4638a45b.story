(fade in and boost cameras clicking) TRUMP: This is with respect to the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. (fade cameras clicking) This particular memo is what many in North Dakota have been anxiously anticipating. It directs the Army to review the project in an expedited manner. Trump also asks the department to consider scrapping its plan to prepare an environmental impact statement. The Army Corps of Engineers launched that study in the final week of the Obama administration. That environmental review could be lengthy, slowing down an already stalled permit process. The White House says it wants to sit down with all sides in the conflict to negotiate a solution. They have doubled down again and again on putting a pipeline in this place. If the federal government grants the pipeline a permit in the near future, the tribe plans to pursue legal action to force the full environmental study. Ron Ness is president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council. (boost in helicopter and keep under) At the protest camp, a helicopter flies overhead. The camp is adjacent to the pipeline construction area, and the demonstrators are still under surveillance.

HOUSER: We are not here in force. He tells reporters that protesters should abandon camp and start contacting their congressional leaders and the Trump administration. ARCHAMBAULT: We have to get out there, and we have to make our voices be heard. The fight is now in D.C. The population of the camps here has thinned tremendously since its peak of several thousand people this fall. The tribal council last week passed a resolution to shut the camps down. That, for once, has the tribe on message with the North Dakota government. While some protesters are leaving, others are merely moving their shelters to higher ground. And the disconnect between camp and the tribe, and the tribe and the federal government deepens.
