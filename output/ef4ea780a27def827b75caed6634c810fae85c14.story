Associated Press Razor wire and concrete barriers protect access to the Dakota Access pipeline drilling site on Feb. 9 near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. The developer says construction of the Dakota Access pipeline under a North Dakota reservoir has begun and that the full pipeline should be operational within three months. The Cheyenne River and Standing Rock Sioux had asked a federal judge to temporarily stop pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners from drilling under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota until the tribes' legal claims are resolved. Those claims include that pipe under the tribes' source of water would desecrate the water they need for religious practices. Federal Judge James Boasberg on Monday refused to immediately grant the request but said he'll more fully consider the idea at a Feb. 27 hearing. Frazier says he still has hope that the tribe will prevail. American Indian activist Chase Iron Eyes says he's not deterred by a judge's ruling that the developer of the Dakota Access pipeline can continue drilling under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota. Iron Eyes is helping lead opposition to the pipeline, which would move North Dakota oil to Illinois. He says opponents will continue fighting the project in the courts and pushing for more environmental study of the Lake Oahe crossing. Federal Judge James Boasberg on Monday refused to halt construction while legal challenges by the Cheyenne River and Standing Rock Sioux are resolved. But he said he'll more fully consider the request at a Feb. 27 hearing. There have been more than 700 arrests in the area since August. A judge has rejected a request by two American Indian tribes to halt construction of the remaining section of the Dakota Access oil pipeline until their lawsuit over the project is resolved. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, in Washington, D.C., issued his ruling Monday. He says he'll consider the request more thoroughly at a Feb. 27 hearing. The Cheyenne River and Standing Rock Sioux requested the temporary injunction last week after Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners got federal permission to lay pipe under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota. The tribes say the pipeline would endanger their cultural sites and water supply. They added a religious freedom component to their case last week by arguing that clean water is necessary to practice the Sioux religion. The Army Corps of Engineers is objecting to a request by the Cheyenne River and Standing Rock Sioux tribes to stop construction of the final big stretch of the Dakota Access pipeline. The Corps last Wednesday gave developer Energy Transfer Partners permission to lay pipe under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota. That's the last big section needed before the pipeline could carry North Dakota oil to Illinois. The tribes have asked a federal judge to block the work until their legal challenges of the pipeline are resolved. They maintain the project threatens cultural sites, water and their religion. The Corps says in court documents that the tribes will have plenty of time to make their case before oil flows through the pipeline, and a work stoppage isn't warranted. Energy Transfer Partners takes issue with the tribes' argument that the work threatens its religion, which depends on pure water. That's the last big section that would need to be completed before the pipeline could carry North Dakota oil to Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux later joined the request. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, in Washington, D.C., is hearing arguments Monday afternoon. The Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux argue the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites. The tribes also say it threatens their freedom of religion, which depends on pure water. Work is underway. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is to hear arguments this afternoon on whether it should be stopped while the lawsuit plays out. This can be removed when origin is fixed.
