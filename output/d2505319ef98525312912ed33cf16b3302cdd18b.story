Court documents confirm the U.S Marshals were set to transport Fallis Friday from the Stutsman County Correctional Center to the facility in Fargo. Chad Jackson, administrator of the Stutsman County Correctional Center, confirmed Fallis has left the Jamestown facility. She will stand trial beginning Jan. 29 in Fargo for alleged crimes related to discharging a handgun as officers tried to arrest her for disorderly behavior at a Dakota Access Pipeline protest on Oct. 27, 2016. Last summer, Chief Judge Daniel Hovland signed an order allowing Fallis' release to the halfway house once bed space became available. As a term of her release, Fallis must wear GPS monitoring. Fallis is charged with several federal crimes including discharge of a firearm in relation to a felony crime of violence and possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon. Her trial is expected to last 10 days. This can be removed when origin is fixed. Trigger the set to pull in again. getRecommendations. audiences or keywords to work with.
