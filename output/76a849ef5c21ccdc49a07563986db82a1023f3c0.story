Many protesters and journalists have been arrested while protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. The ACLU of North Dakota posted an article in August, 2016 stating that the curbing of peaceful protests at the construction site of the pipeline violates the First Amendment. Law enforcement is using military equipment against these protesters. Robert Allen, a reporter at the Detroit Free Press, covered the protests in Standing Rock in December. Not once did he have any interaction law enforcement officers because they would have seen his approach as a hostile one. Allen attributed the peace between protesters and law enforcement to the presence of veterans at the reservation. There have been instances where oil was spilled and ruined entire ecosystems. For example, in 2010 when the BP-operated Macondo Prospect spilled about 5 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico and killed 11 workers. The pipeline is not directly on native land, but it crosses the Missouri River, which could be a threat to the tribes who have reservations close to it. Scott said. Seasonal issues can come in place, especially migration and breeding. Once you take one little piece out of an ecosystem, it changes it. Besides environmental issues the pipeline may cause, people are upset because it will affect native land. About Jessica Hanna Jessica is a student journalist at Michigan State University.
