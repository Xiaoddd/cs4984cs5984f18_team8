All Art is Political. My first keynote- heyyyyyy (update-that might not be true, but still, heyyyyyy). The topic I was given, arts education and social justice, was nice and roomy, but it also left me struggling with what I wanted to say. An update on the PA Arts Council (PCA) budget for 2017-18 as it pertains to equitable payments to African, Latino, Asian, Arab and Native Arts (ALAANA) arts organizations. You will remember from my earlier post that 96 of the 100 largest arts budgets that are in the state system are predominantly white led when considering the majority of their board, staff, and how they define their art form.
