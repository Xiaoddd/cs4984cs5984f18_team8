Native Americans have long been stripped of the rights and lands by the US and its residents; we hope that Intesa would not profit from a project that continues this shameful legacy. DAPL would transport 570,000 barrels of crude oil a day across the Missouri River, less than a mile upstream from Standing Rock Sioux territory. The construction of the pipeline has desecrated Sioux historical and sacred sites and the pipeline itself would put the drinking water of 18 million people at risk of contamination. This pipeline was originally routed through Bismarck, a predominantly white community, but due to concerns around drinking water contamination, it was re-routed to travel just upstream of Sioux territory. Thousands of indigenous people and allies gathered at the Oceti Sakowin and Sacred Stone Camps to stop the construction of the pipeline. Although their protest was peaceful, they were abused by law enforcement officials. Militarized police unleashed dogs on peaceful protesters. They detained protesters in dog kennels and used tear gas, rubber bullets, and strip searches to intimidate and humiliate. On November 21, The Guardian reported that over 300 protesters had been injured after police deployed water cannons in freezing temperatures. The United Nations and Amnesty International have both condemned the ongoing human rights abuses at Standing Rock. Given the injustices faced by Indigenous peoples in Standing Rock today, it is imperative that Intesa SanPaolo live up to its commitments and show leadership in defending social justice. We ask you to follow these examples and divest from a project that tramples the rights of sovereign nations and endangers the environment. We ask Intesa SanPaolo to live up to its commitments to the environment and human rights by issuing a public statement to denounce the human rights violations taking place at Standing Rock and to withdraw its investments from the pipeline.
