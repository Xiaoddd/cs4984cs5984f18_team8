The Capitol Hill condo where Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has stayed in Washington. The expansion, a project of Enbridge Inc., a Calgary-based energy company, would allow hundreds of thousands more barrels of oil a day to flow through this pipeline to the United States from Canadian oilsands. The fine was the second-largest in the history of the Clean Water Act, behind the penalty imposed after the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt Associated Press A spokesman for Williams & Jensen said that the lobbying firm did not intervene with the EPA or Pruitt on the Enbridge pipeline expansion either before or after Pruitt was living in the condo owned in part by Vicki Hart, the wife of J. Steven Hart, the chairman of the firm. Williams & Jensen, for example, was lobbying the EPA early last year, according to its disclosure reports, on behalf of both Oklahoma Gas and Electric, a major coal-burning utility, and Concho Resources, a Texas-based oil and gas drilling company. The work for Oklahoma Gas involved the effort to repeal or revise the landmark Obama-era rule that pushed states to move away from coal in favour of sources of electricity that produce fewer carbon emissions. An EPA calendar in March 2017 shows that Pruitt and his chief of staff were scheduled to meet with company executives at the request of a Williams & Jensen lobbyist. Brian Alford, a spokesman for Oklahoma Gas, said the company had received no favours from Pruitt. Pruitt has considered revisions in both regulatory areas. In the Enbridge case, the EPA was asked to evaluate the potential environmental effect of the pipeline expansion application, as well as the quality of a preliminary review of the project that the State Department had already conducted. When the pipeline opened in 2010, it was permitted to carry only as much as 500,000 barrels of oil a day. The expansion would allow it to move an additional 390,000 barrels through a key three-mile section near the Canadian border. The oil it carries comes from the Canadian oilsands, like the oil for the proposed extension of the Keystone XL pipeline. Extraction from oilsands has drawn opposition from environmentalists, given that the process requires more energy than traditional drilling. Pipelines, like this one, that cross an international border into the United States require a presidential permit, which is issued only after the State Department has conducted a detailed environmental review and has taken input from other federal agencies, including the EPA. Investigators later found that employees allowed the oil to continue to flow after wrongly assuming that the alarms sounding were caused by a harmless vapour bubble. Enbridge has argued it has learned from that accident and taken corrective measures to prevent it from happening again. The conclusion stands in contrast to a similar evaluation by the agency in 2013 of the Keystone XL pipeline project. With the signoff by the EPA and the State Department, Enbridge received the expansion permit it needed in October, five years after it first applied for permission. Additional pumping stations have already been built, meaning the pipeline expansion project is already completed, the company said. Discussions have already started on Capitol Hill about asking the EPA inspector general to expand his inquiry to include the condo deal. Late Monday, three House Democrats who serve on the committee with oversight of the EPA sent a letter to Pruitt asking a series of questions about the condo lease, which was first reported by ABC News.
