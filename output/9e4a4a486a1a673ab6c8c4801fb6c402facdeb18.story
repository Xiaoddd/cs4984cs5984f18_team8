Jan 11 Jan 11 Future Left Podcast Ep. 53: Understanding Standing Rock Future Left SUBSCRIBE HERE FOR EMAIL UPDATES We're joined by Alexander S. Heaton to discuss the organizing success at Standing Rock back in December. Heaton is a US Marine veteran that joined a large busing campaign to that sent over 4500 veterans to support the Standing Rock Sioux defend their territory--and longstanding US treaties--from corporate interest and private security forces. How does this activist view the such social movements and direct actions in light of the long four years that lay ahead of us. Also: Heaton will soon be heading down to Mexico to collect the oral histories of US military veterans who were deported after serving their country. It's a frustrating story (which we mention in the podcast) and we kindly ask you to consider funding Alex's upcoming trip on GoFundMe.

We should say here that Future Left, given the current political context we today find ourselves in, will be making more of an effort to talk with the organizers and participants in ongoing social movements and protests. We view this as wholeheartedly within our mission to prioritize a democratic and equitable future. Adam and Casey are also, with this changing political context in mind, revising Future Left's Founders' Statement. We very much would appreciate any feedback and guidance our listeners may have as we go about clarifying how we view this project of ours.
