I will stand to protect the water, the land. I wanted to lend my energy to the beautiful movement that is being borne out of the glaring act of violence which is the Dakota Access Pipeline. I wanted to learn from those who were standing up to the environmental status quo. I wanted to spend my Thanksgiving in honor of native people rather than over a full plate of willful avoidance back home. The people, the attitude of work and service, the prayers, the songs, the hope, the solidarity, the reverence to the natural elements- it was all beautiful. The camp and the movement that drives it is borne out of the very real threat that is the Dakota Access Pipeline. It was also socially disorienting; it was hard to be sure what my role would be and where I would fit into this place. The daily structure was kicked off with a morning prayer at 6:30 or 7:00 that started at the Sacred Fire and ended with a water ceremony at the muddy banks of a tributary of the Missouri River. From there on there was work and meetings and meals. The meetings included orientation, nonviolent resistance training, media training, legal training and decolonization worksops. Most events began and ended with a prayer led by an elder. My group connected with a Michigan camp in advance and we met with them upon arrival. There were indigenous and non-native Michiganders arriving and departing every day, bringing donations, sharing meals, discovering common friends and sleeping side-by-side in dark but warm bivouac tents. The Michigan camp and hundreds of others were part of the larger settlement known as Oceti Sakowin camp. It is one of many that have grown in response to the pipeline opposition. Along with Red Warrior Camp, it lies off of the official reservation on contested land. A few months ago, these hills were pristine and untouched as the sacred hills that surround them, and now a bustling settlement is underway. Oceti Sakowin camp is not merely another protest or spontaneous gathering, it is a massive sacred occurrence: its presence, all actions that take place within it, and all people who visit are a part of the sacred ritual. Peacefulness was taken seriously. There were no weapons, no weapon substitutes, no drugs nor alcohol, no swearing, and no violent language. Not even gossip was welcome. Overall, the energy was peaceful but purposeful, loving but strong. All of this spreads, and it takes awhile to sink in. To be a white person there and a newcomer was to be a demographic majority but a cultural minority. It was important for the integrity of the camp that all actions and decisions be indigenous-centered and indigenous-led. The learning curve was steep. I cringe to consider what offenses I may have committed due to my lack of knowledge of proper protocol. It required constant vigilance. On my last morning at camp, I stood in a ring of hundreds of people around the Sacred Fire. My mouth dropped open. I was stupefied with honor to be included in the ceremony. As we walked, the woman instructed other women to take turns holding the copper urns and led us in a song of respect for water. She taught us the words and encouraged us to join in. I approached her afterward and told her how much this meant to me and she said that a woman is not a woman until she carries the water. I was not there to learn, I was there to serve, but I wanted to learn and I was fortunate enough to have a direct and indirect education from trainings to observation of others. It was academic and immediately relevant. For three hours we looked directly at the uncomfortable issues of our history and our current surroundings through the lens of awareness and progress. The facilitator was an incredible woman who navigated us with knowledge and deftness through some deeply uncomfortable issues. There were a thousand wincing moments throughout the discussion- mostly from white people. People entered the room late but still saw fit to add their voice to the conversation without knowing what it was about. The end was the worst. After three hours of powerful painful discussion, an elder received a tobacco offering and closed with a beautiful heartfelt prayer. I wanted to raise my hand and tell her that the agony of detailing the obvious (day after day) to well-intentioned but often oblivious white people was not in vain. I have the sincere hope and belief that each of us left that experience with a greater humanity, which we will bring back to our families and friends. the stuff of it Then there was the stuff of it- the real reason we all were there, that we had come to show our support, that we had been called to stand with standing rock, and that was the pipeline. Glaring lights penetrated the night with their powerful beams like a barren ski slope. The focal point of this action is a hill called Turtle Island. It is sacred to the Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota tribes. He said he wants to have children and for his son to one day be able to fish from that river. He cried as he said this. We were admonished to be peaceful in all ways, we were schooled in chemical weapons and what to expect in jail. We formed a mock action by circling around water protectors and banner holders and lacing arms back to back. I was eager to attend a direct action but, by the time I got the training, it was time to leave. I was willing to go though, I signed the legal paperwork detailing my preferences in the event of an arrest. I regret that I was not arrested if that would advance the cause. I regret not joining an action while I was there. I was told, though, that prayer is an action. I love this idea and it has motivated me to write this down- to retain the prayer in my heart and to share it with others. The Seven Council Fire sat at the center of a wide circle surrounded by seven large tepees of the seven coalition tribes come together for the first time since they were forced to stand together against the genocide and banishment threatened by the US Army culminating in the Battle of Greasy Grass back in 1876. In addition to those seven tribes, it was said that over 300 indigenous nations are represented among the water protectors who have joined the stand against the advancing pipeline. He described how the four colors of the medicine symbol are black, red, yellow and white, they represent the races of the earth and the North, South East and West. Those colors join in the middle, and we, at that fire in that moment, represent the middle. We who have come from all corners of the county and the earth are the merging of the races and the converging of the directions. Almost everyone there was a visitor- whether from another native tribe or a non-native- and most people were not indigenous. At two of the events I went to, the attendees organized ourselves by state and the whole area filled in from east coast to west coast and beyond. Probably, because we were asked. As I see it, this movement is about many things. It is about water and the importance of keeping that life source pure. It is about abuse of a common resource for the benefit of a few. It is about representation and the disparity that leaves native people voiceless in decisions that affect their well-being. It is about land and the historical encroachments that continue to the present. It is about environmental racism and the continuation of practices where the worst environmental hazards are co-located with the poorest and least represented people. It is about energy infrastructure and the need to disinvest in dirty extractive sources to reduce energy consumption and increase renewable and sustainable sourcing. It is about a holistic approach to the environment, as embodied by ancient indigenous cultures that respect and limit what they use. It is about current indigenous realities that recognize that recognize their remaining land as finite, non-transferrable and non-expendable. It is about the militarization of business interests, which show extensive police and National Guard support for an illegal private investment over individual human rights. It is about stepping up for what we believe in when it becomes clear that the threat is real and that our government leaders are not going to save or solve us. It is about learning another way to do things. It is about being better people.
