The requested change of venue would move the trials to a different county, outside the reach of negative media coverage and hostile community perception. A randomized survey conducted by the National Jury Project (NJP) concluded it is highly likely that the over six hundred water protectors facing criminal charges in the coming months will not receive fair trials from petit jurors impaneled in Morton and Burleigh Counties. A substantial number of of the surveyed population have connections to law enforcement, the oil industry, landowners and others who have been affected by the protests. The actions of county and city authorities have also contributed to an atmosphere of prejudice and fear in the general public. Elected officials called for economic boycotts and advised local businesses to deny service to those they suspect connected with the Standing Rock encampments. North Dakota GOP lawmakers also introduced bills to crack down on demonstrators by restricting the use of face masks and protecting drivers from liability if they injure or kill a pedestrian obstructing traffic on a public road or highway. The Freshet Collective is a non-profit organization supporting the legal defense of water protectors arrested during actions against the Dakota Access pipeline near Standing Rock.
