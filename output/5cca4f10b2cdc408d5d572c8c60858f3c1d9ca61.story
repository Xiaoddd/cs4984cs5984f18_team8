The Canada Elections Act provides a framework designed to make the financing of the political system transparent and fairer. This includes requirements respecting contributions to and spending by various entities involved in the federal electoral system. Disclosure requirements have existed for candidates since the beginning of the 20th century, but the current regime was essentially laid out with the introduction of political party registration and the Election Expenses Act in 1974. The latter introduced limits on election expenses for both candidates and political parties, as well as the first forms of public funding through partial reimbursement of expenses and tax credits for contributions. As of January 1, 2004, the scope of the legislation was extended to electoral district associations, nomination contestants and leadership contestants. Limits on contributions adopted in 2003 became effective in January 2004. Further restrictions were imposed as of January 1, 2007; consequently, corporations and trade unions are no longer allowed to make political contributions. Legislation passed in 2014 introduced a new set of rules on political financing. The legislation increased contribution limits and set matching limits on testamentary dispositions. It raised by 5 percent the spending limits for parties and candidates. In the case of an election period longer than the statutory minimum of 36 days, the legislation provided for proportionate increases in spending limits for registered parties, candidates and third parties. The legislation modified and standardized rules for loans to registered parties, registered associations, candidates, and nomination and leadership contestants. Contribution Limits Major changes to the political financing regime that came into effect in 2004 and 2007 set limits on political contributions. Tax Credits for Political Contributions Although contributions can take the form of money, goods or services, only a contribution of money to a registered political party, a registered electoral district association or a candidate qualifies for an income tax credit under the Income Tax Act. According to a Canada Revenue Agency interpretation, a monetary contribution to a candidate is eligible for a credit only if it is received between the date that the candidate's nomination is confirmed by the returning officer and 30 days after election day. Such expenses are subject to limits for candidates and registered political parties. These limits are calculated according to a formula based on the number of names on the preliminary or revised lists of electors for each electoral district, and on the length of the election period. Expenses limits are also calculated for nomination campaigns. The Canada Elections Act defines a nomination campaign expense as an expense reasonably incurred by or on behalf of a nomination contestant during a nomination contest as an incidence of the contest. For a nomination campaign, a nomination contestant can spend 20 percent of the amount allowed for a candidate's election expenses in the same riding during the previous general election if the boundaries of the electoral district have not changed since then. In any other case, a nomination contestant can spend the amount that the Chief Electoral Officer determines. The Canada Elections Act does not set limits on the amount of leadership campaign expenses that each contestant may incur. A registered party may set its own limits by internal rules, but such limits are not enforceable through the Act. Third parties are limited in the amount that they can spend on election advertising. Electoral district associations cannot incur election advertising expenses during an election. Reporting Each electoral participant or political entity must submit financial reports to the Chief Electoral Officer. All financial reports are published at www.elections.ca. This reimbursement is publicly funded. Reimbursements for Political Parties Registered parties become eligible for a reimbursement of 50 percent of their paid election expenses for general elections if they file the proper financial reports and receive at least 2 percent of the valid votes cast nationally or 5 percent of the valid votes cast in electoral districts where they endorsed candidates. Regulation of Third Parties The Canada Elections Act regulates third parties that engage in election advertising. A third party can be a person or a group, other than a candidate, registered political party or registered electoral district associations of a registered party. A foreign third party is an individual who is not a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident, or resident in Canada; a corporation that does not carry on business in Canada; or a group for which the person responsible is not a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident, or resident in Canada. Even if it is not required to register, any election advertising transmitted by a third party must identify the third party and state that it has authorized the advertisement. A registered third party must report its election advertising expenses within four months of election day.
