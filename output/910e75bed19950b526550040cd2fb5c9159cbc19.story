Today I can report that Morton County, which rescued the woman from the camp, has arrested the daughter. The full press release is below. An excerpt: A 58-year-old Las Vegas woman was arrested yesterday around 4:10 pm on a felony warrant for endangering a vulnerable adult. And remember, the woman was living in a teepee. In the middle of a blizzard. If the allegations against Bennett are true I hope they throw the book at her.
