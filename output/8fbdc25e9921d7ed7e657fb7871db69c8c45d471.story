Protesters include various Native American tribes as well as environmentalists and even actors including Shailene Woodley. State officials issued an order on Monday for activists to vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp, located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, citing harsh weather conditions. The 1,172-mile (1,885 km) pipeline project, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP.N), is mostly complete, except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. Veterans Stand for Standing Rock, a contingent of more than 2,000 U.S. military veterans, intends to go to North Dakota by this weekend and form a human wall in front of police, protest organizers said on a Facebook page. Organizers could not immediately be reached for comment. Dull Knife, a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe from the Pine Ridge Reservation of South Dakota, said he has been camping at the protest site for months. Former U.S. Marine Michael A. Wood Jr is leading the effort along with Wesley Clark Jr, a writer whose father is retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark. U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat from Hawaii and a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, has said on Twitter she will join the protesters on Sunday. The Army Corps, citing safety concerns, has ordered the evacuation of the primary protest camp by Dec. 5, but said it would not forcibly remove people from the land. Local law enforcement said on Tuesday they planned a blockade of the camp, but local and state officials later retreated, saying they would only check vehicles for certain prohibited supplies like propane, and possibly issue fines. Dalrymple on Wednesday said state officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters and there had been no plans to block food or other supplies from the camp. He also warned protesters that while emergency responders will try to reach anyone in need, that would be contingent on weather conditions. That decision has been delayed twice by the Army Corps.

The people at Standing Rock have had so many of their Constitutional rights violated, not to mention the violation of the treaty that gave them that land. Our military men and women take an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Please pass this idea forward if it seems of value. Could plastics be next, Tar, ETC. The Idea is to build on and expand on this context. Whatever your beliefs we can all come together understanding that we are all one, all part of the earth and sky and that when we pray our being moves with the truth of our heart inside those prayers. Let us all stand together united in one peaceful understanding that the water is sacred to all life. Let us all direct our energy to praying for the water, and the water inside us all that creates life. Allow us to understand our part in what we take from the earth and what we give back. As the creator guides us with conscious truth may we all seek our direction with a peaceful heart of the veteran who has seen the pain, frustration, agony and despair of battle and is ready to become one with the earth inside the circle of hope. Daneho. Aho. Amen. Peace. LikeLiked by 1 person Marian Murray says: December 1, 2016 at 2:16 AM Good news from the Vets. Some strong support. With you in spirit from England.
