The hogs live on slatted flooring which their waste is washed through and gathered before being pumped into covered lagoons. Because as she ambles down the two-lane street, stepping over pebbles and sprouts of grass, the stench takes hold, an odor so noxious that it makes your eyes burn and your nose run. INDY Still, Miller makes this trip often, to honor her family and pay her respects. Purple and yellow wildflowers nip at its edges; nearby, a Steelers flag rustles in the wind. For years, their waste and its stink have been the subject of litigation, investigations, legislation and regulation. The issue has been well examined in the media, too. The New York Times and the Washington Post covered it. So have Dateline and 60 Minutes. The News & Observer earned a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on it in 1995. But those hogs also produce millions of tons of feces. In one year alone, an estimated 7.5 million hogs in five eastern North Carolina counties produced more than 15.5m tons of feces, according to a 2008 report by the General Accounting Office. If you extend the radius to three miles, as many as 960,000 North Carolinians fall into that category. Within two miles, there are more than 80,000 Murphy-Brown-owned hogs at seven different farms, according to a lawsuit Miller filed in 2014. That scent is so bad. That system prevents the cesspool from overflowing, but Miller says it also makes her life miserable. After spending time outside, she says, her eyes burn and her nose waters. She says she also suffers from asthma, which she began to develop shortly after she returned to her childhood home from New Jersey in the late 80s to care for her ailing mother. People told me about contaminated wells, the stench from hog operations that woke them at night, and children who were mocked at school for smelling like hog waste.

The hogs live on slatted flooring which their waste is washed through and gathered before being pumped into covered lagoons. In North Carolina, large corporate pork producers are mistreating small contract farmers and externalizing their costs on to vulnerable communities, polluting the air, water, and soil, and making kids and families sick while reaping large financial rewards. Similar environmental injustices are occurring right now all over the United States. In May, US Representative David Price, a Democrat who represents parts of Wake and Orange counties, took his own stab at a legislative solution. Three years ago, Miller and more than 500 other North Carolina residents, mostly poor and African American, filed 26 federal lawsuits against Murphy-Brown, alleging its behavior adversely affects their health and quality of life. The industry dismisses these claims. Smithfield points to the fact that between 2012 and 2016, the DEQ only received 25 odor complaints, and of those, none resulted in fines or notices of violations. Other industry advocates have also alleged that greed is at the heart of these claims. Hog farmers are conscientious neighbors, the industry argues. The cases are pending in federal court. No trial dates have been set. When they have to relieve themselves, slatted, slanted floors filter their waste into pits that feed into open-air cesspools that sit just behind the hog houses. These pools, known as lagoons, come in muted tones of brown and sometimes Pepto-Bismol pink, courtesy of a cocktail of chemicals and pig waste. Starting in the 80s and early 90s, a new method of pig farming began to take hold as corporate hog producers and CAFOs began replacing independent, family-owned farms. In an arrangement known as contract farming, many larger companies bought family farms or merged with them by providing pigs in exchange for land and waste management services. According to census data, the number of farms in the state fell from more than 11,000 in 1982 to 2,217 in 2012. In 1986, he voted in favor of a bill that eliminated sales taxes on hog and poultry operations. By 1995, Duplin County was home to more than 1 million hogs, more than six times the number it had when Murphy was first elected. Five years later, Murphy Family Farms was acquired by Smithfield, and its name was changed to Murphy-Brown LLC. Photograph: Alex Boerner To an outsider, it might seem like business as usual. Murphy played politics and his company came out for the better. But for Don Webb, a living history book on all things related to hog farming, something was amiss. He grew up on a farm in Stantonsburg and cropped tobacco and picked corn with his bare hands. His father sold pigs right off the family farm. After a brief stint as a PE teacher, Webb started a successful hog farm in Northampton County in the mid-70s. Webb, 76, has a thick drawl and is prone to impassioned rants. He got into hog farming at the urging of a friend. When those filled up, they sprayed it elsewhere. It was a matter of conscience that charted his current path, he says. Several of his neighbors told him that the stench from his farm was making their lives miserable. They grumbled about being quarantined indoors on sweltering summer evenings, unable to go outside on account of the pungent, fly-infested air. When he returned to Duplin County six years later, however, he was greeted once again by that stench. In May, Shane Rogers, a former EPA and USDA environmental engineer, published a report that concluded that this is exactly what happens. The study, which was filed in court documents on behalf of plaintiffs suing Murphy-Brown, relied on both air and physical samples collected from the exteriors of homes located near Murphy-Brown hog fields. To test for the presence of pig-manure DNA, Rogers and his team collected DNA swab samples from the exterior walls of homes and from the air itself. In total, they collected 31 samples from the outside walls of 17 homes and submitted them for DNA testing; 14 of the 17 homes tested positive. Even more, we expect all farmers to be good neighbors. On 5 April, Dixon stepped past dozens of protesters into a crowded committee meeting inside the legislature. It would also have negated the 26 pending claims against Murphy-Brown. Mark Dorosin of the UNC Center for Civil Rights drilled down on that point during public comments, citing research showing that the proportions of African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans living within three miles of industrial hog operations are 1.5, 1.39 and 2.18 times higher, respectively, than the proportion of white residents. The contentious provision invalidating the pending lawsuits against Murphy-Brown was stripped from the bill. With it gone, HB 467 cleared the house easily, then the senate. The hog industry fought back. In addition to its eight registered lobbyists, Smithfield enlisted the services of Tom Apodaca, a former senator from Hendersonville. Its efforts paid off. The following day, the senate followed suit. HB 467 became law. Two weeks later, Murphy-Brown filed a motion in federal court, asking a judge to apply HB 467 retroactively, thus negating the pending lawsuits despite the fact that the legislature had explicitly voted to remove that provision from the bill. The court has not yet ruled on that motion. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Elsie Herring. Photograph: Alex Boerner A copper-haired 69-year-old, Herring lives on the same property her mother, the daughter of a slave, lived on for 99 years. Everything was segregated, but we still got along. The lawsuit contends that the hog facility began spraying liquefied waste in the mid-90s and planting trees between their properties to act as a buffer, which proved ineffective. Herring says her grandfather purchased the property in the 1880s from his aunt, who was white and his slave mistress. Her parents built the home she now lives in; her mother, father, brother and sister all lived on the land until they passed away. About two years after she moved back, the spraying began, Herring says. Herring felt like she was going to be sick, so she went back inside. She became involved in local activist networks, joining the NC Environmental Justice Network and the Warsaw-based organization Rural Empowerment and Community Health, or Reach. Everything was segregated, but we still got along. But now, after these hogs came in, everything has gone downhill Elsie Herring In 2007, her activism took her to the lawn outside the general assembly, where she joined other Reach members to protest about the effects of hog farming for more than 50 consecutive hours. She ticks off a list of issues she believes the stink and the spraying have brought: flies, mosquitoes, mice, poisonous snakes. To avoid the odor, she stays indoors. HB 467 came as a surprise, she says. But, to her, its motives were transparent. Herring sighs. I never knew my grandfather, but I know he walked on this ground. She pauses and looks at her house. The suits were initially filed in Wake County superior court in 2013 by two out-of-state firms, whose lawyers recruited clients in North Carolina without a state license and signed hundreds of clients to contracts requiring them to pay hundreds of dollars an hour for work performed on their behalf, even if the attorneys decided to drop the case, as the News & Observer previously reported. In hearings, Judge Donald Stephens admonished the firms for their behavior and, after the contracts were rewritten, required that they partner with a North Carolina firm, which ended up being Wallace & Graham.
