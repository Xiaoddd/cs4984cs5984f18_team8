Advocates see his quick action to pave the way for two oil pipelines as indications a possible harbinger of further cuts to national preservation programs. Whatever signals Trump gave during the transition that he is open to some environmental causes seem to have been tossed aside. Those actions, though expected, frustrated environmentalists. Last month, under the outgoing Obama administration, the Army Corps of Engineers denied a permit needed for a crucial segment of the 1,172-mile Dakota Access Pipeline that would cross under the Missouri River just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The Dakota Access Pipeline would connect Bakken oil fields with Illinois, while Keystone XL could link the Gulf Coast with controversial Canadian oil sands. Environmentalists point to climate research that says oil sands emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases when compared with other forms of oil production. Green groups point out that new technologies also create jobs, but not at the expense of the environment. In addition to reviving the pipelines, the new administration instructed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to freeze all contracts and grants, which fund research, and stop releasing updates through social media platforms. Similarly, the administration banned the U.S. Agriculture Department from releasing its research.
