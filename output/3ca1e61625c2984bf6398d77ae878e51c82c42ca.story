We can pressure banks to stop financing human rights abuses and environmental destruction. Sign the petition to banks that are financing the companies behind Dakota Access and the four new proposed tar sands pipelines (Keystone XL, Trans Mountain, Line 3, and Energy East). As consumers and customers of all sizes, we demand banks stop using our money to fund tar sands pipelines that our communities and planet cannot afford. And we call on our neighbors, elected officials, and pension managers to close all accounts with these banks unless they immediately stop financing tar sands pipelines. People across Turtle Island are fighting the four proposed new tar sands pipelines. Meanwhile, fossil fuel companies continue to drill for oil on Indigenous lands and ecologically sensitive areas around the world. But many banks continue to finance pipelines and other fossil fuel infrastructure like refineries and export terminals, as well as the companies sponsoring these projects. Tell these banks not to touch this new deal with a 10-foot pole. Turn up the pressure, and where possible, move your money. We need everyone, from those of us living paycheck to paycheck on up to millionaires and billionaires, to align their money with their values. Withhold your consent from a global finance system that puts profits ahead of Indigenous rights, climate truth, long-term economic analysis, and a safe planet for all. Sign the petition to put banks on notice and defund new tar sands pipelines. All signatures will be delivered to the banks in June. 1. The 17 banks listed here are primary targets.
