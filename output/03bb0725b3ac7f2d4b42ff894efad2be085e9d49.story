In December, the US Army Corps of Engineers rejected the permit that the project needed for its completion. But on Tuesday, Trump signed a series of directives aimed at speeding up the pipeline's approval process. Those reviews are seen by many government agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as environmentalists, as cornerstones to ensuring the environment is taken into account when new construction projects are ordered. The project is a proposed 1,172-mile pipe that would shuttle half a million barrels of North Dakota-produced oil to refining markets in Illinois. Proponents of the pipeline say it would lessen dependence on foreign oil while creating jobs and growing domestic industry. As proposed, the pipeline would pass through North Dakota's Lake Oahe, a burial site sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux and a major source of drinking water for the community. But as I reported in December, it may have been too early to celebrate. Here's why environmentalists and people who live and work near the proposed pipeline are so concerned. Contaminated water is a massive health problem Should the Dakota Access pipeline leak or burst, the effects could be devastating. And leak pipelines do. An average of 121 accidents happened in both 2013 and 2014. In addition, people who had used contaminated water for bathing or laundry appeared to experience more skin problems, ranging from mild rashes to severe and lasting eczema and malignant skin cancers. Passed in 1970, NEPA basically ensures that the government considers the potential environmental effects of any federal project, like a new highway or airport, before building it. The Standing Rock Sioux say that the Dakota Access pipeline's review process was not done properly. In a lawsuit it filed in July against the Army Corps of Engineers, the tribe said the permit process was rushed and undertaken largely without its input. If the pipeline were to leak or burst, it would send oil deep into the Missouri River, the Standing Rock Sioux's primary source of water, which the tribe relies on for everything from bathing to drinking. For that reason, the tribe says the Army Corps of Engineers could violate not just one, but two laws: NEPA and the Clean Water Act. Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, waits to speak against the Dakota Access oil pipeline during the Human Rights Council at the UN in Geneva, Switzerland, on September 20. Trump also owned stock in Energy Transfer Partners, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission, The New York Times reported on Tuesday. The Times added that a Trump spokesperson said last month that Trump had sold all of his stock during the summer, yet Trump has failed to provide any documentation proving the sale.

But as Bill McKibben wrote in The New Yorker, officials rerouted it when people there raised concerns that it could jeopardize the community's water supply. But now, instead of risking Bismarck, the route could threaten the Standing Rock Sioux. Get the latest Oil WTI price here. All rights reserved.
