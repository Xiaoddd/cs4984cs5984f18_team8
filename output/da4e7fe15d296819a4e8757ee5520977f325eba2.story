By Taryn Finley, HuffPost US Boston Globe via Getty Images Protesters have been fighting against the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline in their territory. The protestors of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota are about to get some major support. They launched the effort, called Veterans Stand for Standing Rock on Tuesday and after months of protesters clashing with the police over the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. The same day the group announced its initiative, state officials threatened to impose fines and block supplies from reaching a nearby camp where protesters reside. The veterans will protest through the December 5 deadline the Army Corps placed on the Sioux tribe to vacate. Though their protest will be nonviolent, they urge participants to bring body armor, gas masks, earplugs and shooting mufflers since protesters have been injured by police force. No drugs, alcohol or weapons will be allowed. Veterans Stand for Standing Rock also launched a GoFundMe in early November to raise money to provide food, transportation and supplies for protesters.

Language has been updated to note that The Guardian has reported that damage has already been done to other sacred tribal sites. Newsletters may offer personalized content or advertisements.
