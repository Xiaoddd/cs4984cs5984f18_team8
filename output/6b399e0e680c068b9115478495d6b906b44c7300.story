This is their story. The indigenous activists of Standing Rock, North Dakota, won a major victory on Sunday in their battle to halt the Dakota Access Pipeline. In an unprecedented move, the Department of the Army - under Obama's watch - said it would block construction below the Missouri River at Lake Oahe and force stakeholders to look for alternative routes. It's an enormous breakthrough. But it wasn't easy - and the decision could still be overturned under Trump. Huck met the activists holding fort at Standing Rock as they buckled down for winter and the hope of victory was still a distant dream. This is their story. A prayer march to sacred sites destroyed by pipeline construction the previous Saturday had been shut down by police, who surrounded the group as Lauren tried to get a young boy out of danger. All the guns were pointing at us. There was mace, there were riot shields and batons, and hundreds of police and armoured vehicles. She says they started hitting her head and hands as she tried to protect herself. She was pulled back into the crowd by friends, and managed to escape, but others were charged with crimes including rioting, trespassing and resisting arrest. Despite the fact that the company overseeing DAPL, Energy Transfer Partners, lacked the necessary permit to drill under Lake Oahe, and despite government departments requesting that they voluntarily halt construction in September, building continued as close to the water as workers could get. When Lauren returned to the frontline, a group had decided to physically block the pipeline route. All the long-term encampments at Standing Rock are on tribal-owned or -leased land. In the intervening decades, the land had been taken back without being formally ceded by the Sioux, who were ancestors of the current Standing Rock Sioux Nation. The police gave the protectors a deadline to clear the site, and when it passed, they moved in with hundreds of officers in riot gear, armoured cars and two helicopters. They blasted sound cannons and pepper spray, fired rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, set off concussion grenades and hit one man in the face with a taser barb. Three people locked themselves to a truck and a blockade was set on fire, creating billowing towers of black smoke. Lauren is explaining all this the following day, as the people gathering at Standing Rock catch their breath, crowdsource bail money and discuss next steps. Jasilyn Charger, front. But by August, Jasilyn became frustrated. We know how it feels not having a voice. There are more women warriors than there are men here. We know women all over the country who know how it feels to be raped. Youth council members are helping out around the camp, organising prayer gatherings and apprenticing themselves with medics and legal teams. Those supporting it argue that the new infrastructure will create jobs and decrease dependence on foreign oil, and they insist that pipes are deeply buried and strong enough to stay intact. As recently as 21 October, a Sunoco pipeline broke in Pennsylvania, spilling about 55,000 gallons of gasoline into the Susquehanna River, and residents living nearby were advised to reduce their water use. In mid-November, they announced that further consultation was needed before Energy Transfer Partners are granted permission to complete the pipeline. Protectors say that sacred sites have already been bulldozed in the DAPL construction process, that people were dragged out of religious ceremonies to be arrested, and that there was a failure to properly consult tribal elders as leaders of sovereign nations. Remy is camped at Oceti Sakowin and prefers to withhold his full name. The reservation, he says, was surrounded by seven coal-fired plants (of which six persist today) that have been linked to birth defects and asthma among the local population, who are still living in houses with no electricity or running water. Statistics bear this out. Originally, the proposed DAPL route crossed the Missouri about 10 miles upstream of the state capital of Bismarck, but the plan was rejected by the Army Corps for reasons that included the risk to the municipal water supply. For Remy, this is part of what it means to grow up in a Native American community. She sees the fight against DAPL as part of a larger struggle to uplift indigenous communities across the continent. We see the reservations as prisoner-of-war camps. We still carry that trauma. We want to live in peace. We want to go back to our heritage. Against this backdrop, the gathering of people from more than 300 Native American tribes at Standing Rock offers an opportunity for communal cultural and spiritual celebration, as well as defiance. Three times a day, the encampments gather for meals around a constantly burning sacred fire, with offerings made to the Creator, and elders and children served first. Traditions from across the continent are shared, and there are displays of horsemanship, regular sweat lodge ceremonies, singing and prayers. Linda Black Elk is an ethnobotanist and teacher at the nearby Sitting Bull College, who has been spending recent weeks documenting local plant life that is being endangered by the pipeline construction and supporting the medical teams at Standing Rock. This is what it feels like to be able to defend your land for your children, to be able to defend their culture from continued genocide. There are few home comforts here: sub-zero temperatures at night, little cellphone or internet reception, no running water or electricity. People want to get back to living closer to Mother Earth.

The ubiquitous smell of woodsmoke is in the air, surveillance planes are droning overhead as usual, and teepees, gers and army tents with stoves built into them are being assembled and insulated for winter. Cold-weather sleeping bags are being added to Amazon Wish Lists and a wooden kitchen is taking shape at the original Sacred Stone camp. In a few months, President Trump will take office. But no one here is talking about leaving until the pipeline is dead. There are already plans for youth council members to go to Brazil next year, to help indigenous people there fight against deforestation and water pollution. But now her determination is paying off.
