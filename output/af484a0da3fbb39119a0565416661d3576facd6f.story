First and foremost, this is a struggle that has made the shape and function of colonialism quite clear. Our society can no longer pretend that the atrocities against us have ended, and with that knowledge comes a renewed accountability. These events should also reinforce to everyone the realities of state violence, in all its forms. Native people are killed at a higher rate by police than any other group in the United States. As we have witnessed with police attacks on the movement for Black lives, structural violence is cyclical. It is a remix of old atrocities and abuses. It is the character of law enforcement, born of slave patrols and Indian Constables, on full display, and we must not pretend otherwise. The Army Corps and Obama have repeatedly invoked politicized language of empathy and concern. While our people have converged in peace, police from around the midwest have also converged, to play their role in this moment of colonial and anti-colonial struggle. produce is to further repress us. and retold. We are not simply Protectors and warriors. We are storytellers, and we will not allow the indulgence of forgetting. Lastly, I want to reinforce to everyone that this is not over. Our people have not backed down, and I do not anticipate any such action. Elders, children and other vulnerable individuals will likely be evacuated when an eviction attempt seems imminent.
