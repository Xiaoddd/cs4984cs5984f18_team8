The North Dakota court system is struggling to process the large volume of cases resulting from mass arrests at the protests. Around 200 trials and final deposition conferences scheduled for January were recently postponed indefinitely according to the New Yorker magazine. Many of the Standing Rock protesters were held on trespass and riot charges. In addition to logistical difficulties, the large amount of video, photographic and other evidence relevant to the cases has created further delays after a judge ruled that the prosecution was not fulfilling its legal obligation to provide all relevant material to the defence team. The first trial of protesters, scheduled for December 19th, was delayed by six weeks when it emerged that three hours of footage and more than 500 photographs were not properly disseminated to defendants by the prosecution. However, there are concerns that incoming President Donald Trump, an advocate of the fossil fuel industry, may reverse the decision after his January 20 inauguration.
