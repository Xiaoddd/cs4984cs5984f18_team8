If you're not in tune with what's going on here, Standing Rock is an Indian reservation where a major oil company is trying to drill a pipeline underneath the river that supplies drinking water for millions of people on and off of the reservation. Drilling that oil pipeline could contaminate the livelihood of so many people, primarily indigenous people of this land that have been systematically destroyed since Europeans arrived in America. Thousands of people have come from all over the world to Standing Rock to stop that pipeline from being drilled and protect the water. Mensa explained the history of the demonstrations in a series of social media posts, describing the violence protesters have faced from authorities. He joins a long list of celebrities condemning the project including Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Pharrell Williams, Katy Perry, and Neil Young. This is by treaty, by law, this is land that belongs to the Standing Rock Sioux. if you believe in the inalienable rights of people; the right to clean drinking water, the right to food & shelter and the right to freedom then you have to support standing rock. Get on a plane, drive, take a bus do whatever you have to do. December 5th the Army Corps has set an ultimatum for the people camped at standing rock, saying that they will forcibly remove the water protectors. When one of our freedom is on the line all of our freedom is on the line. Fight for freedom. standing rock is LGBTQ rights. standing rock is the latino struggle.
