'script', 'twitter-wjs'); Nov 25, 2016 Police used water cannons and rubber bullets in confronting Dakota Access protesters last weekend. The renewed calls for action come after police used tactics Sunday night that included the use of rubber bullets, concussion grenades, tear gas and water cannons sprayed on hundreds of protesters for hours in freezing temperatures, according to live streamed video and protesters' accounts. At least 300 individuals received medical treatment during Sunday's standoff. One protester, Sophia Wilansky who traveled to Cannon Ball, N.D. from New York, faces potential amputation after an explosion severely damaged her left arm. Amnesty sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Oct. 28 calling for the Department of Justice to investigate the actions of law enforcement agencies. It also criticizes the arrest of members of the media and legal observers. On Monday, Amnesty sent a letter to Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier decrying the use of excessive force during Sunday night's confrontation with protesters. Similar concerns were voiced by the American Civil Liberties Union. Cook said the current escalation is similar to that seen in Ferguson, Mo. in 2014 following the shooting of unarmed Michael Brown by a police officer. Five other members of the department resigned or were fired. Morton County officials said the law enforcement response to protesters on Sunday was appropriate. The Morton County Sheriff's Department posted a photo on its Facebook page on Wednesday of a green propane tank it said was found at the protest site following an explosion early Monday morning. After a Sept. 3 confrontation between Dakota Access security personnel with dogs clashed with protesters, North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer called for increased law enforcement. Cramer asked. That money exceeded the total of all campaign funding received by his opponent, Chase Iron Eyes, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux, the tribe leading the opposition to the pipeline. Cramer along with North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple and Sen. John Hoeven, all Republicans, urged President Obama to provide federal law enforcement in a letter sent on Wednesday.
