Protesters claimed that the grievous injury was the result of law enforcement throwing a concussion grenade at her. Law enforcement responded by pointing out that they had no such ordnance at their disposal, and suggesting that Wilanski was injured by the protesters themselves who were allegedly building improvised explosive devices and who were also using a semi-truck to try and remove a barricade on the bridge. The federal government convened a grand jury to investigate the matter earlier this year, but one of the protesters they subpoenaed to testify refused to cooperate. Now the feds have withdrawn the subpoena. The proceedings of federal grand juries are secret. It could be that the feds are letting this go. Earlier this month The Guardian reported, in a thoroughly one-sided way, that agents of an anti-terrorism task force were looking into the matter. Maybe they come up with something. You would think that Martinez, if he had information as to how that injury happened, would be happy for the opportunity to appear in court and provide that information under oath. It was badly injured, but she did not lose it. The post has been corrected to reflect that.
