Everyone, everywhere, is contributing to climate change, but there is only one Standing Rock. I have spent a lot of time listening here - to people who have probably spent a lot of their lives being ignored. I have heard talk of revolutions, of dual citizenship, of black snakes and of the process of making entire communities invisible. At the camp, our group of students was able to go through an orientation designed for non-Natives. Whiteness is about more than skin color. Those privileged by whiteness tend to feel that they belong everywhere or that they deserve to know things. While these beliefs are oftentimes unconscious, it is important to confront the assumptions behind them because we do not belong everywhere, and sometimes we do not need to know. This fight is not about white people, nor is it fodder for NGOs to advance their cause. It is about real people who have spent hundreds of years doing exactly what they are doing now. This movement is part of a deliberate and determined process, and is guided by the seven principles of the Lakota people: prayer, respect, honesty, compassion, wisdom, generosity and humility. Following these principles, the Oceti Sakowin camp is a place of prayer and ceremony (two things with which I am not very familiar). The NoDAPL movement is being advanced in ways that you or I may not entirely understand, but it is incredibly important to recognize that this is okay. As I write this I consider the reality of a Trump presidency. But this is about more than a pipeline. It is about human rights and dignity, and the fact that Native people deserve access to clean water simply because they are human beings, and not because they are part of a larger discussion about environmentalism or climate justice. It is also about halting the erasure of Natives by non-Natives that has been ongoing for far too long. Nations exist inside this space, and only through the pursuit of understanding and connections can the rights of all humans and all nations be given the respect they deserve.

If this deadline is missed, a majority of the stakeholders with contracts to ship oil through the pipeline will be able to renegotiate or cancel their contracts. This could be devastating to Energy Transfer Partners and the other pipeline companies behind DAPL. Indigenous leaders are calling for a month of solidarity beginning with a Global Day of Action on December 1st. They are asking people to target the banks funding Dakota Access Pipeline and the Sheriff Departments that have been brutalizing peaceful water protectors. Something went wrong. Something went wrong.
