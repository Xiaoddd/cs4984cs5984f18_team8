Story continues below advertisement The 78-page report is believed to be the first major study on the issue by an international human-rights organization. Amnesty's report comes two months after the launch of the two-year independent National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. Among the catalysts for the federally funded probe was a 2014 RCMP report that found Canada had 1,181 police-reported homicides and long-term missing person cases involving indigenous women and girls between 1980 and 2012. She noted that the Liberal government is working on a gender-based violence strategy. Concerns about the link between resource development and violence are not unique to British Columbia. Amnesty makes 30 recommendations to the province, Ottawa, the RCMP, local governments and private industry.

The B.C. Ministry for Aboriginal Relations and Reconciliation noted, for example, that the province held a workshop earlier this year that brought together First Nations communities, government officials and industry stakeholders to discuss how to mitigate the potential impact of work camps. Julie Rogers also noted that the city supports social-service agencies through property-tax exemptions, and said staff were offered two days of indigenous cultural training this year. Connie Greyeyes, 45, who is from the Bigstone Cree First Nation and encouraged Amnesty to undertake its work, said racism is rampant in and around Fort St. John. Ms. Greyeyes, who lives in the city and once worked in the oil industry, said the mere fact that Amnesty researchers descended on the area has heightened tensions. The Amnesty report does not single out particular corporations, but it calls on the federal and provincial governments to immediately revoke or suspend all permits and approvals associated with B.C. Hydro's Site C dam. The provincial Crown corporation released a statement on Thursday highlighting the funding it has provided to local social-service agencies during the first year of the dam's construction. She is urging corporations to make internal changes such as creating a work environment that is more welcoming to women and ensuring employees have access to addiction treatment. Story continues below advertisement Ms. Knott, 28, is a survivor of violence. She told The Globe she has been sexually assaulted four times since she was 13 years old, including once, she believes, by several men on her birthday about five years ago. Ms. Knott does not recall the assault, but said she was physically and emotionally traumatized by it. She said her understanding is that the men were among tens of thousands who pass through the city for resource-sector work. She said she has long been speaking up about the connection between violence and resource development, and said she will continue to do so.
