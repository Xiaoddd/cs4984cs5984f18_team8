Esteban Santiago, 26, also faces weapons charges over the attack at Fort Lauderdale international airport. A federal complaint said he admitted to planning the attack and had bought a one-way ticket to the airport. Authorities said they had interviewed roughly 175 people, including a lengthy interrogation with the co-operative suspect, a former National Guard soldier from Alaska. Flights had resumed at the Fort Lauderdale airport, though the terminal where the shooting happened was still affected. On Saturday the FBI agent in charge of investigating the case said terrorism was being considered as a possible motive. Santiago is expected to make his first court appearance on Sunday. He is a National Guard veteran who, his family said, developed psychological problems after returning in 2011 from a tour of duty in Iraq. Investigators said he had flown to Fort Lauderdale from his home in Alaska, with a stopover in Minneapolis, and appeared to have acted alone. Piro said the suspect used a legally held 9mm semi-automatic handgun, which had been checked on to the flight in accordance with security requirements. Speaking to reporters from her apartment in New Jersey, she said he had become increasingly unstable after returning from Iraq. He seemed normal at times but other times he seemed lost. Several witnesses told how they escaped the attack, including a man who said his life was saved by a laptop in his backpack. A woman from Weston, Florida, who asked not to be named, said the gunman walked around the baggage carousel while shooting. Another witness, Mark Lea, from Minnesota, spoke of helping those who had been shot, including a woman with a shoulder wound who was looking for her husband. Lea told KETV. Family members named an elderly couple from Council Bluffs, Iowa, as victims, saying the husband had died and that his wife was recovering in hospital from gunshot wounds to her neck and shoulder. Authorities were yet to formally identify the victims, but the number of wounded was reduced from eight to six. Three were described as being in good condition, while three remained in intensive care. The baggage hall in Terminal 2 remained closed on Saturday , although all other areas of the airport reopened and flights resumed, with delays, after a 16-hour shutdown. Airport authorities said they were trying to reunite 20,000 bags and personal items abandoned during the chaos with their owners. The last of thousands of passengers stranded for hours on planes or the tarmac were evacuated from the airport by early Saturday and were taken by bus to the Port Everglades cruise terminal where many had to spend the night.
