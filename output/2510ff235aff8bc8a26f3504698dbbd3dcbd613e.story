A U.S. military veterans group announced new efforts to support the Standing Rock Native American tribe and protesters who oppose completion of the Dakota Access pipeline, just days after President Donald Trump took action to move the project forward. Those efforts include developing the capability to deploy thousands of veteran volunteers to Standing Rock, potentially putting the White House in a politically difficult position. They come as tensions have escalated between protesters and law officers in recent weeks. Veterans Stand launched a fundraising drive on GoFundMe last week to support a network of protesters camped out near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. About 4,000 veterans traveled to the reservation in North Dakota last month to support the protest by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, environmentalists and other activists, according to figures provided by Veterans Stand. The Standing Rock Sioux oppose completion of Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access pipeline because it would pass beneath a source for the tribe's drinking water and construction would disrupt sacred land, they say. Dakota Access pipeline route, source: Energy Transfer Partners The project, which would deliver oil from North Dakota to Illinois, is nearly complete except for a small portion about half a mile north of the reservation. That stretch requires an easement from the Army Corps of Engineers. Protesters won a temporary victory under former President Barack Obama when the Corps denied the easement. Problems for Trump Anthony Diggs, communications director for Veterans Stand, said the new campaign is motivated in part by Trump's presidential memo ordering the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite its environmental review and consider other actions that would pave the way for the project's approval. The group's ongoing support sets up a potential confrontation between veterans and an outspoken president who frequently praises the military but rarely holds back when challenged. Trump suffered backlash during the presidential campaign after he made disparaging comments about Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the Pakistani-American parents of a fallen U.S. soldier. The couple spoke out against Trump's policies, including a ban on Muslim immigration to the United States. The president ignored a reporter's request to make a statement to the Standing Rock community after signing the presidential memo. White House press secretary Sean Spicer later said Trump would speak to all parties involved. The decision to send more volunteers will be made with tribal leaders, he added. Still, Diggs said the veterans group has the ability to rapidly scale up its presence if necessary. Diggs said an escalation took place this month after the Morton County Sheriff's Department and private security firms began moving to clear protest camps. Rob Keller, a spokesman for the sheriff's department, said authorities had not tried to remove protesters. Instead, sheriffs and National Guard troops responded to the actions of some of the camp's more militant activists. Those people recently cut wire blocking access to a contested bridge and a fence along the Missouri River, and attempted to reach a drill pad for the Dakota Access pipeline located on private property, he said. The department arrested 21 people on various charges, including inciting a riot and resisting arrest. It reported firing bean bag and foam rubber rounds at protesters and using pepper spray and smoke canisters to disperse the crowd. The department wants to remove protesters from the camps because forecasts for flooding in the area in coming months make it critical to haul away abandoned cars and clean up the site, Keller said. Flooding could wash waste into the Missouri River after months of protests that at times attracted thousands, he added. Download the latest Flash player and try again. We want to hear from you.
