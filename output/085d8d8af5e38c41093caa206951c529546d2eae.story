I am from the Kiowa tribe of Oklahoma. I live in Lawton, Oklahoma. I was born and raised in Carnegie, Oklahoma. I graduated from high school but have no college degrees. I am 62 years old and retired. I am a daughter, a mother, a grandmother. I was fresh out of high school in 1972 and I was on the verge of being kicked out of junior college because my grades were failing. I was already turning into a full-fledged alcoholic, and I was in a bar crying in my beer. I was sipping on my beer and thinking how much of a fuck-up I was. So after that, in my mind, I was not good enough for anything or anybody. So I just started drinking to ease the pain. So I was sitting there that night in 1972, and I heard a door open in the bar and I saw a couple of guys come in. They had long braids, long ponytails, jeans jackets, and boots. Then more came in and started playing pool, and then they asked if they could sit at my table. So we started conversing and I asked where they were from. As a Native American I had been sheltered as a child. But growing up in Carnegie, I had faced racism, prejudice. So I got interested in his story. In tenth grade I had left Carnegie and graduated from Lawton McArthur. It was a governmental program to see how Native students would react and how they would succeed. So they chose students from different tribes, and we lived on campus. So that was my way of escaping from my perpetrator. But it was a governmental program, and we did live by the rules and regs of the boarding school. We got up at a certain time; we had chores; we attended activities. I got to see the diversity of different races, and I got to know a lot of children from other tribes and nations. And I wanted to know more about the world and about different places and different kinds of people. Even to this day, I still love all the colors. And when colonialism comes in you have to live by their rules. But as Native Americans we have our ways; we have our cultures; we have our traditions; we have our stories; we have our dances; we have our songs; we have our language. So that is what the takeover of the BIA was all about. He invited me to join them. They raised me in the church. So all I knew about was going to church almost every night. So I took that opportunity that night, and I chose AIM. AIM was founded in Minneapolis-St. Paul. The police there were like they are today. They were beating people in the streets. So AIM formed out of that, and it became a spiritual movement. We wanted our sovereignty; we wanted our rights back; we wanted what was taken from us. Yes, we are the First Nation, but we know our place because we are the People of the Land. We watch over and take care of what was given to us. So when I went with AIM that night I was trying to find myself. They were bodyguards. There were Creeks and Seminoles, Choctaws, and the leader from Oklahoma AIM back then, who I respect and honor. God bless him: It was Carter Camp of the Ponca Nation. He sat right by me. All the men in the group respected me as a sister; in return, I gave them the same respect. I got to meet Russell Means and Dennis Banks. I got to live with the Seattle AIM people, and that is where I met Leonard Peltier. In my spirit, I can feel things going on in the Native world. So when I got to meet all these people, we started traveling and ended up in Minneapolis. They were calling all the AIM chapters to come into Rapid City. There were things going on in Pine Ridge. There were murders. They had a takeover because ranchers had murdered a Lakota man. Then there was another one in Custer where two guys had murdered another Lakota man. And so we were called out. We hitched around. Back in the day we all just took care of each other. We jumped in with a guy who had a car and went to Rapid City. I saw all the Oklahoma AIM people there. We got to meet our old friends. There were just three of us Kiowas, so we were glad to see each other. We waited around there for about a week. We even had drills. So they called us militants. I had stopped. Our way comes from the herbs; our way comes from the ground; our way comes from the air. You have to have a balance in your life. You get alone somewhere; you go to the mountains. You go to your sacred places to pray. And this is where the misunderstanding comes from about why AIM was there. We got the call from the elders of the Pine Ridge Reservation; they wanted the people from AIM to help them. Copyright Kevin McKiernan When we arrived, there was a meeting and somebody brought the drum and there was singing and round dancing and just having a good time gathering outside. Then they had us stop and wait for the chiefs from the Lakota and the Dakota people. And the chiefs came in, and some of them had their war bonnets on. And you know, back in school, they always told us that the chiefs were dead and gone. They started singing songs for the chiefs, giving honor to the chiefs. Just to talk about it brings a lump to my throat. And I was in the front line. We caravanned into Pine Ridge. Copyright Kevin McKiernan The reason we were called into Pine Ridge was because of the reign of Dickey Wilson, who was the tribal leader. He was abusing his authority; he was abusing and misusing money. And he had men that were called goons, and they were terrorizing and murdering innocent people. And if you were considered an associate of AIM, you were a target for the goons. You were either beaten or found dead somewhere on the reservation. Anyone and everyone that was with AIM was a sitting duck. Those times were called the reign of terror. We wanted people to be able to live in peace, to be able to go out of their homes and go to the store and not have to look over their shoulder. And, yes, we ransacked the grocery store, and yes, we ransacked the museum, and yes, we ransacked the post office. When we took over that night, we took what we needed. We took all the objects that were in the museum because the trading post was used as a pawn shop. There was bead work and artwork that the people had pawned in order for them to feed their families. They gathered all those irreplaceable items up so they could give them back to the owners. People used to say that there were hostages. The business owners were given the option to stay or go and there were some that stayed because they believed in what we were there for. We were there about Dickey Wilson but also to let the government know that we were going to take a stand AGAIN. Because there was Alcatraz, the BIA, and Wounded Knee. The government wants the Black Hills because there is gold in them hills; there is minerals in them hills. What is happening in Standing Rock today is happening for a reason. We are the life-givers of this world. We are the ones that have to carry, bear, and raise the children. It made me strong; it made me proud of who I am. It gave me back my confidence, my boldness, and my courage. When they were going against the enemy, they used to count coup. You go and you hit once, and you count coup. You hit one time and you count coup. Well, instead of hitting one time, my namesake hit twice on his coup. I am a descendant of old Chief Lone Wolf who comes from Red Cloud of the Lakota people. So we have this new president coming into office, and you and I will be marching on the day after he gets inaugurated. And if it does not pertain to what he should be doing as a president, we the people have a right to impeach him. Some of the tribes have already sold out to the oil companies. And Trump has already sold out to the oil companies. To me, he is another dictator, like Dickey Wilson. As a Kiowa woman, I am very honored to use my last name. I had a close encounter with death and with two of the fatalities inside Wounded Knee. We arranged to speak again that night. Give Annie H Hartnett a round of applause. From a quick cheer to a standing ovation, clap to show how much you enjoyed this story.
