Protesters: Trump pipeline order violates law 02:28 Story highlights A handful of measures across the country would discourage disruptive protests Critics say the proposed laws would curb First Amendment freedoms (CNN)It may soon be legal to run over protesters with your car in North Dakota. But only if you do it accidentally. Lawmakers in that state are set to vote Friday on a bill that would legalize accidentally running over protesters in the road, one of several new measures across the country that aim to discourage disruptive protests. Kempenich said he was spurred to act after Dakota Access Pipeline protesters last year moved to block public roadways, scaring some of his constituents. Read More It's not just North Dakota that's cracking down on protesters. Other communities that have endured multiple or prolonged protests are fighting back by trying to put similar laws on the books.

Minnesota protest bill gets its own protest The North Dakota bill comes amid contentious protests related to the proposed construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, or DAPL. The pipeline, which would stretch south to Illinois, has largely been completed except for a hotly contested stretch near the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's reservation. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday to advance the stalled project. But roadway protests are a hot topic in Minnesota, too. There, a Republican-led House committee passed a measure Tuesday that would allow local governments to sue criminally convicted protesters for law enforcement costs. Shortly after the measure passed by a 9-6 vote, protests erupted as members of the public angrily shouted at lawmakers, according to CNN affiliate WCCO. One of those protesters was a friend of Philando Castile, the man shot and killed by a St. Anthony police officer during a traffic stop last summer. That shooting sparked a series of protests in Minnesota led by the Black Lives Matter movement, which advocates for social justice for African Americans. Rep. Nick Zerwas, a Republican who introduced that measure, said the public should not have to pay to cover law enforcement costs incurred dealing with illegal protests. The local governments are only able to recoup costs if the protester is convicted of a crime, he said. Zerwas is also behind a measure that would increase the criminal penalties in Minnesota for blocking traffic on a roadway. Effective protest movements, such as the Civil Rights-era boycott of buses in Montgomery, Alabama, are necessarily disruptive, he said. Black Lives Matter Minneapolis posted its opposition to the measure on Facebook. This is a warning to those trying to take away our freedom. We Ready. Other states are considering similar bills. Action on the bill was deferred until a later date. A lawmaker in Iowa, too, told the Des Moines Register of plans to propose a bill that would make it easier for law enforcement to push criminal charges on those who block roadways. But at least one rights group is dismayed by the flurry of proposed laws. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved. .d8888b.
