The environmental impact statement was wrongfully terminated. This pipeline was unfairly rerouted across our treaty lands. Attorneys for the Tribe say the easement cannot be granted legally at this time. The tribe says their next steps include: challenging any easement decision on the grounds that the EIS was wrongfully terminated; demanding an environmental impact statement to identify risks to treaty rights, including its water supply and sacred places; asking the court for DAPL to disclose its oil spill and risk assessment records; shutting pipeline operations down if the easement passes and hosting a Native Nations march on Washington March 10. Our fight is with Congress and the Trump administration. We call on the Native Nations of the United States to stand together, unite and fight back. Under this administration, all of our rights, everything that makes us who we are is at risk.
