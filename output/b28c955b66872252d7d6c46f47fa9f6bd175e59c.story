The mass of people arrested on January 20th were swept up in a police kettle which lasted for hours, and ended in the police sexually assaulting and raping arrestees as a sadistic form of group punishment. In lieu of evidence, the State argues that the wearing of masks, black clothing, and even chanting similar chants or smiling while witnessing property destruction all constitute evidence in this regard. If the State succeeds, most of the defendants face literally a life sentence, and the State will be given a dangerous new precedent for future repression. Across the US, we already are starting to see a similar J20 strategy be put into practice. Meanwhile, other states have passed new anti-masks laws, while others are attempting to further criminalize the blockading of roads and oil infrastructure. With the J20 trial, the government is seeking to create a legal precedent that would give them further tools to not only police dissent and protest, but attack social movements and struggles that have grown under the Trump administration. Furthermore, the State is also attempting to punish even journalists and live streamers that were out covering the protests, claiming that they were helping grow the demonstrations while informing would be participants. The government is attempting to use the language of terrorism to prosecute autonomous social movements that use tactics such as street marches, occupations, and blockades. In themselves, this tactics are based around taking over public space, stopping the flows of capital, and shutting down infrastructure. Clearly, these tactics are not aimed at injuring, harming, or killing members of the public. Even black bloc tactics, shutting down of pipelines, and antifascist defense against violent neo-Nazi and Alt-Right groups, while often confrontational, is likewise not aimed at injuring, killing, or harming members of the public. If anything, these tactics are powerful in that they are available to everyone and encourage public participation while create spaces that bring in everyday people and empower them. Clearly, it is because of this reality that the security State is looking to crush autonomous social movements, especially at a time when legitimacy in the State is falling, as is support for both Trump and the Democratic Party. Across the US, from Flint, Michigan to Puerto Rico, Americans are seeing that the government cares more about maintaining control through police force and providing for rich elites than it does with helping everyday people. Instead, the State is concerned with crushing potentially revolutionary movements that are seeking to build a base of support within the working-class and poor communities; the same communities which are under threat from both the State and the far-Right. In doing so, the State finds its interests aligning along with those of the auxiliary insurgent Right, as they both begin to parrot much of the same talking points and conspiracy theories. For the farther that the far-Right can beat the drum of open civil war with autonomous social movements, the more the State can justify cracking down on them. The J20 trial shows this reality to be in full swing, as the prosecution has openly worked with the far-Right and the Alt-Right in several instances, while also pulling from it in order to build its case. Chuck C. Johnson and Nazi Richard Spencer using Twitter to announce doxing their enemies. This release took place only two weeks after the protests, and three days after antifascist and anarchist protesters along with thousands of others, successfully shut down a talk by Milo Yiannopoulos at UC Berkeley, leading to condemnation from President Trump. This August, Spencer was also a key organizer in the disastrous Unite the Right rally, which brought together a variety of Alt-Right, neo-Nazi, and KKK groups. Richard Spencer with Charles C Johnson, the editor of GotNews, at the GOP convention in 2016. GotNews wrote: The list includes more than 200 people of all ages and parts of the country. The spreadsheet of the names released by the site still contains the metadata, which lists Schaerr as the author of the document and MPD as the company. Despite these self accolades, we doubt that Schaerr would have enjoyed being linked publically to aiding a group of neo-Nazi trolls, yet this sharing of information between the Alt-Right and the DC metro police is exactly that. Clearly, people within the police saw a friend within the Alt-Right, which includes open neo-Nazis and white nationalists, and second, they wanted to physically hurt Trump protesters without members of the public knowing about it. Lastly, this move should be seen as what it clearly was, a green light from the State to the auxiliary far-Right to attack enemies of the Trump regime. And at the same time, the Trump administration removed groups on the far-Right from the terrorism watch list, which drew praise from neo-Nazi and Alt-Right commenters. Our memes are all real life. But beyond attacking Trump protesters out of the gate and behind the scenes, moreover the prosecution has also built their case around the media generated by far-Right and Alt-Right groups and personalities. But while the Oath Keeper videos have yet to be shown in court, one video that has been played numerous times, again according to a representative of Defend J20 that has been in court throughout the trial, is that of Alt-Lite vblogger, Lauren Southern. and members of Generation Identity, a white nationalist group. Ironically, Lauren Southern was among those who were swept up and arrested during the J20 protests, however, unlike other journalists, was quickly released without charges. Instead, government attorneys appear to be trying to prosecute him because of his expressed opinions about the protest. Wood, who lives in San Antonio, Texas, was not the only member of the media who was rounded up by police. Unlike Wood, she was released after her arrest. Some of her footage from that day has been used in court against defendants. Today in DC Superior Court Judge Lynn Leibovitz ruled that a journalist can be held liable for property destruction that was captured on his livestream, because of the 'enthusiasm' of his commentary. This is ironic, being that DC Metro Police actively worked with members of the Alt-Right to doxx people that had been arrested on January 20th. The prosecution has also relied heavily on the testimony of Detective Gregg Pemberton of the seventh District. This is horrible and dangerous. Moreover, one police officer from the sevenths District made a comment in court that likened moving protesters in DC to dealing with poor black residents in the Barry Farm neighborhood. Howden said he did not. According to the State, the podcast shows evidence of planning and thus, conspiracy. Clearly we see police and prosecutors working openly with Alt-Right and far-Right players, while also depending on them for evidence and talking points, amid a sea of support for not only Trump and the far-Right fear of black struggle as a violent threat. In this context, we can see the J20 trial for what it is, not an attempt by the State to protect the public from violence, but a blunt tool of repression aimed against the public as a warning, that should anyone step out of line, the full force of the State will be used to smack them down. Drawing Conclusions 2017 will in part be remembered as the year that the far-Right went into the streets to attack, murder, and injure a much larger body of people who oppose white supremacy and fascism. But it should also be remembered as a year in which white nationalist and fascist ideas were mainstreamed by everyone from the President to those in the mass media. Correction: The article previously stated that numerous police officials were based in Maryland, this is incorrect. They are a part of the DC Metropolitan Police Department, or MPD.
