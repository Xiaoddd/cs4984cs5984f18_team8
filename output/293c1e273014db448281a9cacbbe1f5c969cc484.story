I don't need to do what he says because I am my own man. My parents are always trying to be up in my business because they are so bored with their own lives. I will just tell them I am going to a friend's house and then go to the party. These are a couple of the sayings or thoughts of employees and teens who have a strong probability of having a GPS tracker placed on their vehicle. This is because a bad employee can cost a business productivity, and a teen who is a poor driver can cost parents thousands of dollars in higher insurance rates or worse. They also wonder what are the most common locations vehicle trackers are placed on cars. Here is a brief summary of how tracking devices get on cars. GPS tracker units do not simply appear on cars, they are placed on vehicles by people. I know that this may sound like common sense, but you would be surprised how many people think the government or some extraterrestrial source is concerned with monitoring their day-to-day activities. In reality, many car dealerships may place a real-time monitoring device on a car and leave it on a vehicle until a loan is completely paid off, parents may use vehicle monitoring devices to make sure a teen is not speeding and companies will use live tracking systems to route and manage driver activity. However, where those people place tracking units on cars will almost always differ. Tracking Your Car With GPS Technology When a company, parent or police agency chooses to utilize vehicle monitoring technology they are left with only two options, 1) They can use a GPS tracker as a portable device, placing it pretty much any location in the cab they choose, but only for a limited time due to battery-life restrictions, and 2) Permanently hard wire a car tracker either under the dash or under the hood so the unit can run of the car battery. Those really are the only options. People who want to monitor business operations or an elderly driver will typically choose to go with a more permanent installation, while parents of teens and police agencies often go with a portable solution. By selecting the portable option, GPS users are let with a larger range of placement options. These location options include, in the glove box, under the seats, in speaker compartments, center console, in a plastic bumper and more.
