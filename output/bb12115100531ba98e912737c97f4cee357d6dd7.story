That was partly due to the upcoming completion of a big part of its major projects, but it also reflected the fact that the company didn't have as many compelling growth options as it had in the past. That said, the company appears poised to add a new expansion project to its backlog after launching an open season to build the Rodeo Pipeline in a scorching-hot portion of the Permian Basin. Sweeney Fractionator One, for example, entered service in late 2015. Meanwhile, the company finished up the Freeport LPG Export Terminal late last year, and oil is expected to start flowing through the Dakota Access Pipeline this week. Because Phillips 66 has now completed most of its major capital projects, its capital budget for 2017 will be the smallest in years. Image source: Getty Images. Opening up a new option However, the company appears to have found a new project that just might meet its return threshold: the Rodeo Project. Phillips 66 envisions a 130,000-barrel-per-day pipeline that would enter service in the second half of next year, with the potential to expand its capacity up to 450,000 barrels per day in the future. That said, the company does need to secure enough shippers for the project to justify the investment. However, given how quickly producers are ramping up production in that basin, it shouldn't have any problems in that regard. The pipeline would focus on production coming from Reeves, Loving, and Winkler counties in Texas. That's a region where drillers have spent billions of dollars over the past couple of years to lock up acreage. Overall, RSP Permian picked up more than 3,000 future drilling locations in the region, which gives it years of production growth potential. Given how much oil output is expected to grow in this area, it appears that Phillips 66 shouldn't have any problem finding takers for the capacity of the Rodeo Pipeline. In fact, this project could prove to be a springboard to more projects in the future, including additional pipeline-capacity expansions, more terminal additions, and other infrastructure projects. Investor takeaway While Phillips 66's growth prospects have contracted over the past few years as a result of several recent project completions, the company isn't without growth options. In fact, it could be on the cusp of another expansion wave given the growth projections coming out of the Permian Basin. Matt DiLallo owns shares of Phillips 66.
