Announcement Last updated on Nov 26, 2016 Welcome to my humble abode. I love to make your visions come to life, but I also love to make my visions come to life. Using stones as my focal; bringing out the natural and organic beauties of our Earth. Today she was the photographer, and lead decision maker. I take great pride in my work, in my materials and in my designs. I use only sterling silver and gold fill, because I'm allergic to copper, and pewter, and nickel, and brass sometimes makes me itchy.

Communication is key to make sure you get what you want and I am comfortable doing what you ask for.

I have my jewelry on consignment in a few other shops and would love to send you there to take a look at what they have if you're in the central Oregon area. I also offer wholesale if you would like to order or have my custom make a minimum of 12 items at one time.
