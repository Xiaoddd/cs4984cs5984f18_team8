'script', 'twitter-wjs'); Nov 18, 2016 Arctic drilling opponents got a victory with an Obama executive order stopping drilling leases for five years, an order that won't be easily changed by Donald Trump. Credit: Getty Images No new offshore oil and gas leases will be offered in the Alaskan Arctic through 2022, according to a new five-year plan for offshore drilling released Friday by the Obama administration. President-elect Donald Trump could overturn the ban, but that could take years and may not draw much industry interest if oil prices stay low. The Interior Department's five-year plan laid out all of the proposed auctions for drilling rights on the outer continental shelf of the United States. It allowed for no leases between 2017 and 2022 in the Beaufort or Chukchi seas, Arctic waters north and west of Alaska. A prior draft of the plan included the potential for offshore drilling in both the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas when it was released in March. The current plan limits potential leases in the next five years to the Gulf of Mexico and the Cook Inlet off south-central Alaska. Some Republicans voiced opposition to the plan before it was even published. Sullivan said the ban on Arctic drilling was another Obama administration policy that delays and disrupts energy development in America. He cited the unsuccessful attempt by Royal Dutch Shell to drill in the Arctic, which Shell abandoned last year. Shell left the Arctic after failing on multiple fronts. It encountered costly equipment malfunctions, including a major accident with its drilling rig the Kulluk in 2012. Its lease is one of nearly 40 existing leases in Arctic waters that are not affected by the new five-year plan. Those leases will all expire in the next few years. Trump could reverse the Obama administration's ban by drafting a new five-year leasing plan. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, an ardent drilling proponent, has been mentioned as a possible nominee for Interior Secretary, suggesting the new administration may pursue a new plan. Such a restart, however, would take time. The five-year leasing program announced Friday, for example, took two years to develop. New leases available in the Arctic might not draw the interest of the oil and gas industry.
