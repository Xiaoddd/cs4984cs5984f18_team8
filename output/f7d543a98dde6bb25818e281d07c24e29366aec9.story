Unfortunately, the fight is not over. The fight is not over, we did not win. In fact, the indigenous people need our support and help more than ever. Diverting your attention to something else is so obviously what they want you to do. This person also comes forth shedding light that many in the industry regard this CEO as Bloodsucking. An intimidating characteristic that further supports these vicious privately hired attack squads that made jokes as they harmed peaceful protesters relentlessly. The decision gets things to stand down ahead of what was likely to be an historic and contentious Dec. 5. The fight for the pipeline is NOT over. Instead the attention and desperately needed support that the militarized zone garnered will likely fade, and as the battle gets complicated there will be less to fund the fight. The peaceful acts of our brothers and sisters who were violently wounded in the fight cannot be forgotten, their memories still fresh on my brain as I see the misinformation disseminated. I will not let that happen. I nearly gagged in my office. To say the least, my desire to leave this firm has increased exponentially. My internal temperature boils over and I want to get out to the freezing conditions to stand with my people. I want to wave a wand that removes the veil of denial from the people and show them that injustice is everywhere. I can still imagine a world of love, where we can embrace change for the better. A world where our oceans are full of life, and the marine life sings their songs. Where the air is clean, the sky is blue, the trees are green, and we are sitting in the grass picking an abundance of wildflowers and watching their seeds float in the soft, warm wind as it cradles our good intentions.
