The bill was supported by the oil industry but opposed by landowners during a two-hour committee hearing. The House Energy and Natural Resources Committee made amendments to the bill in response to some of the concerns raised, Anderson said. One change was to require that all legacy oil sites continue to report spills of 1 barrel and above unless they upgrade the sites with modern containment berms and other safeguards. The Northwest Landowners Association, which represents 500 farmers, ranchers and property owners, plans to continue opposing the bill when it's under consideration by the Senate, said Chairman Troy Coons. The landowners would like to see the bill become law, but they prefer that oil companies report all spills that are above 1 barrel, or 42 gallons, regardless of the location of the spill, Coons said. Supporters of the bill say reporting small spills that are contained to sites designed to protect the environment is an administrative burden on the state. But there was no fiscal note with the bill so it's unclear what cost savings the bill would provide. Oil and gas field inspectors do not immediately respond to a spill of 10 barrels or less that is contained on site, Ritter said. During routine inspections, staff check on possible spills to ensure they have been cleaned up, she said. The North Dakota Department of Health would not be affected by the bill because the agency does not respond to spills contained to oilfield sites.
