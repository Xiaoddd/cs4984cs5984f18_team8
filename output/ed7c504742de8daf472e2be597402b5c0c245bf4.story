Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani is also facing mounting pressure from the government of Hassan Rouhani, which is demanding greater financial transparency. Larijani was appointed by the supreme leader, cannot be summoned by MPs for questioning and is not directly accountable to the public. This week Arash Sadeghi, a student activist serving a 15-year prison sentence, ended a 71-day hunger strike over the detention of his wife, Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, after she was released on bail. Iraee had been sentenced to six years for writing an unpublished fictional story about stoning to death in Iran. Amnesty said Sadeghi had lost 20kg (44lbs) while on hunger strike, and it called on Iran to provide him with urgent specialised medical care for a kidney malfunction. Other prisoners remain on hunger strike. Saeed Shirzad, who is in jail for protesting against child labour, and Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese citizen and IT expert accused of spying for the US, are also on hunger strikes. Tara Sepehri Far, of Human Rights Watch, echoed Ebadi in condemning Larijani. Larijani belongs to an influential family and he is seen as a potential candidate to succeed the supreme leader, Ayatollah Alli Khamenei. Recently Rouhani and Larijani have been at odds over financial transparency. In November an Iranian MP questioned a minister over allegations that Larijani possessed 63 personal bank accounts filled with public funds. The judiciary later attempted to arrest the MP but was unsuccessful. Larijani has denied the allegations.
