After months of denying requests for better mapping by public officials, the company will discuss their project and take questions from the audience. The project would install two 178 mile pipelines, connecting Albany, NY, and Linden, NJ, to transport Bakken crude oil and refined products. The proposal has raised major opposition from municipalities, community groups, and environmental organizations as the route would cross through environmentally sensitive areas critical for drinking water supply, including the NJ Highlands, and through densely populated communities, threatening public health and safety. The Coalition Against the Pilgrim Pipeline, which includes over 40 organizations, is urging concerned citizens to attend the meeting and learn more. While Pilgrim has been meeting behind closed doors with regulators, the public has virtually no information on this proposal. We deserve to know more as federal regulators report 280 significant pipeline incidents a year. The pipeline will cross through the New Jersey and New York Highlands regions. Of particular concern are potential impacts to the Ramapo River Watershed, which provides drinking water to Wayne, Mahwah, Ramsey, Oakland, Franklin Lakes, Allendale, Pompton Lakes and eight more towns in New York. In times of drought, surface water from the Ramapo River is pumped into the Wanaque Reservoir, which provides drinking water for nearly 3 million people. If an incident were to occur in this region it would be especially alarming as one gallon of oil can contaminate a million gallons of drinking water. The distance between shut off valves in oil pipelines is 20 to 30 miles, opening the potential for a significant amount of oil to enter watersheds. In the case of a leak from this pipeline, the impact to drinking water could affect millions of state residents. Also, once a right-of-way is established it may set a precedent for expansion in the future, further impacting our drinking water supply watersheds. asked Jo Sippie-Gora, Kinnelon resident and member of Kinnelon Conserves. Pipeline systems are more prone to leaks than other forms of oil transport. Old pipelines are more prone to leaks and explosions, and significant blasting would be required to trench through dense bedrock in the old pipeline right of way through the New Jersey Highlands. The federal agency charged with overseeing pipeline safety, the Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration, is underfunded and understaffed. PHMSA only has 135 inspectors to oversee 2.6 million miles of pipeline. The Pilgrim Pipeline would carry a particularly volatile form of oil produced in the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana. The oil is produced through hydraulic fracturing or fracking, resulting in significant environmental impacts. In February the Wall Street Journal compared oil from 86 locations around the world and found Bakken crude oil to be the most explosive. This type of oil is also highly corrosive, which could damage the pipeline during operations. Three pipeline companies, Enbridge, Tesoro, and True, won orders from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to reject oil with high hydrogen sulfide levels (Bakken crude) in their pipelines, however FERC did deny this request to a fourth pipeline operator, Trailblazer Pipeline Company. Therefore it is uncertain if Pilgrim can guarantee they will not transport this oil with high hydrogen sulfide levels in their pipeline. Municipal opposition to the project is growing. Earlier this month, Oakland passed a resolution opposing the project, joining Parsippany, Montville and Watchung. The communities are calling for a moratorium on surveying and project planning within their municipality and for a thorough environmental review to be conducted to assess the project's environmental impacts. This opposition is significant as New Jersey does not have a state level siting law for oil infrastructure so municipal zoning and ordinances should apply to the project. Municipal oversight is not pre-empted by federal regulations for oil pipelines as it is for natural gas lines. You're now signed up for local updates.
