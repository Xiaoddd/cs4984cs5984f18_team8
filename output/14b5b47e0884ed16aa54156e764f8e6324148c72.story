Fire, water, oil and ice: An update on Standing Rock Krystalline Kraus December 20, 2016 Indigenous Rights Environment Political Action Winter has descended on North Dakota, with biting snow and hard winds that buffet the Oceti Sakowin camp -- the main protest camp near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, where the Standing Rock Sioux band, their Indigenous allies and U.S. veterans have been protesting against the 1,885-kilometre Dakota Access Pipeline. The pipeline project had been complete but for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. There were reports that after the December 5, 2016 blizzard that nearly paralyzed the camp with iced-over roads and a snow storm so fierce that you could barely see, that the camp had shut down. And yet, activists remain. And remain still as the weather continues to get colder. And I believe it is the fire in these activists' hearts that will guide them through the winter. And I know a lot about winter. I am Saami, after all, and we have our own Reindeer Resistance to preserve the Arctic and our Indigenous land, Sapmi. Regarding the Oceti Sakowin camp, it was before the December 5 blizzard that confusion settled over the camp as the word of the Standing Rock chief was either manipulated or misinterpreted. In regards to the coming blizzard, Chief Dan George did not announce that the camp was shutting down completely and did not tell demonstrators to go home, he merely cautioned those who were not used to harsh winters to prepare accordingly -- which might mean leaving the camp if they were ill-prepared. There was no order to disband nor was there an edict that if you left the camp you could never come back. And yet that is the narrative that some right-leaning news outlets broadcast. When you don't control the media, this kind of thing happens. This is where the thousands of veterans -- a count that has fluctuated between 2,000 and 5,000 service personnel -- who came to the camp mattered most, as they had the logistical know-how to manage poor weather conditions, and it is their training linked with Indigenous knowledge of how to handle cold winters that has made all the difference and I am thankful for the support they are providing, just as I am thankful for those who shared their wisdom and oral history. Yes, celebration erupted at the camp where it was announced that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has turned down a permit for a controversial pipeline -- at least temporarily. This does not mean that some activists are prepared to leave as they do not trust the news that the Army Corps of Engineers had denied the final easement to drill below the Missouri River, or more correctly, they don't trust that Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline, will honour the Army Corps' decision. Water protection is going to be critical as pipelines continue to snake across North America. rabble is reader-supported journalism. Our only supporters are people and organizations -- like you.
