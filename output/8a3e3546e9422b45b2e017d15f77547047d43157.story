Protesters marched north from the Cannonball Bridge to the Back Water Bridge. Around 40 protesters took part in the march, chanting and singing along the way, and stopping at the entrance to the Oceti Sakowin Camp to pray. At the conclusion of the walk, protesters reflected on the emotional day. We also spoke with Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier about the prayer walk and also the possibility of any flare ups. He said he hopes there won't be any and even met with the organizers of the walk beforehand.
