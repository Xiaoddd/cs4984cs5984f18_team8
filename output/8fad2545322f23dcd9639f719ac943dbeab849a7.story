Photo: Oceti Sakowin Camp The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is responding quickly to the latest legal threat from the wealthy backers of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Ahead of a conference call in federal court, the tribe defended the formal publication of an important notice on Wednesday. The document initiates the process for a long-awaited environmental impact statement, or EIS, of the final portion of the controversial pipeline. The statement was accompanied by a court filing that said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers should be allowed to publish the notice in the Federal Register on Wednesday as planned. Judge James E. Boasberg has convened a a conference call at 4:30pm on Tuesday afternoon to discuss how to move forward with the latest legal maneuver. If he declines to take action, the notice would presumably be published on Wednesday.
