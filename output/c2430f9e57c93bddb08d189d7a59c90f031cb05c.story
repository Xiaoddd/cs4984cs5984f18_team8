Huff, staff writer Tags: North Dakota, oil spills, cover-up SocialBlock(); (NaturalNews) When it comes to the general public being kept in the loop about matters relating to major environmental hazards, the residents of North Dakota are perhaps the most slighted of all by their own state government. A major oil and natural gas region of the country, North Dakota has had hundreds of oil spill accidents over the years that have caused noteworthy environmental destruction, but none of them, save for one, was ever reported. North Dakotans: we need to know about the spillsKuster's livelihood depends on having access to clean water and healthy soils, two things that are seriously threatened by the prospect of oil spills. For the most part, Kuster says he's well-rounded in his knowledge about local happenings, except when it comes to the actions of oil companies. In this regard, everything is kept under lock and key. Kuster and his neighbors aren't convinced that oil spills like those that have occurred throughout North Dakota are harmless to the environment, either. They all say they observed at least one incident in which truckloads of what appeared to be oil-tainted dirt were being hauled off from a nearby property. The incident was believed to have involved a broken oil pipeline, but nobody knows for sure. In the interest of protecting not only local residents but the rest of the country that eats food grown in potentially tainted soils, it's critical that North Dakotans and people from other states where oil pipelines are present be kept in the loop about spills. It's unacceptable, say independent experts, for the government to withhold this information from the public. They continue to push for reforms that would force regulatory agencies to provide full disclosure on all issues involving oil and natural gas, for the benefit of everyone.
