Virginia Politics Virginia regulators consider revoking permits for two major gas pipelines, but settle for stricter enforcement There are many Many homemade signs line roads near Bent Mountain, Va., that protest against the Mountain Valley Pipeline Project. Activists nearly persuaded state officials to revoke permits for that project and another, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Capitol Police officers formed a line across the front of the chamber in a state office building to keep the angry crowd away from staff members. Members of the board had approved erosion and sediment control permits for one of the projects, the Mountain Valley Pipeline, in December, but agreed to reexamine the issue in light of reports that construction was causing extensive damage to the rugged mountain terrain. The other project, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, will cut a 600-mile path from West Virginia through the center of Virginia and into North Carolina. State regulators have yet to give final approval to the erosion and sediment control permits for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, and work there is not as far along. Both projects have faced setbacks this summer. Federal judges have ruled that federal agencies granted several permits without full review, and regulators have stopped all work on both pipelines until those issues are resolved. Gov. Ralph Northam (D) had said early in his campaign last year that the state should conduct its own review, but the state Department of Environmental Quality concluded that doing so would waste state resources and simply duplicate the federal process. The State Water Control Board is appointed by the governor to oversee policy decisions, while the DEQ carries them out. Staff members for the DEQ on Tuesday gave the seven-member board a step-by-step presentation on how the federal permitting standards echo state standards. Over the summer, the department received thousands of emails and letters from residents commenting on the water quality aspect of the pipeline projects. Board members seemed most concerned about several photographs and descriptions of places where construction on the Mountain Valley Pipeline had led to severe erosion, sometimes clogging streams with mud or burying surroundings under as many as 11 inches of sediment. During half an hour set aside for members of the public to address the board, a long line of property owners and environmental activists spelled out the predicament. Several board members seemed disturbed by the litany of complaints. Board member Robert H. Wayland III made a motion that the panel begin considering revoking the water quality certificates for both pipelines and starting over with a stream-by-stream analysis. But Hayes warned that legal counsel had said the board had limited authority to revoke its certification and that federal law may allow the pipeline work to continue anyway. That motion passed unanimously. Officials with the Mountain Valley Pipeline said they were pleased by the decision. Comments The story must be told. Your subscription supports journalism that matters.
