Judge James Boasberg denied a request to block construction on the last stretch of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Boasberg, sided with government lawyers, finding the construction of the pipeline does not immediately threaten the water of Lake Oahe on the Missouri River. Ducheneaux says the existence of oil in the pipeline would obstruct the tribe's religious practices. He set a hearing on the matter later this month. The Standing Rock Sioux are filing a separate legal challenge, asking the judge to declare the permit approved by the Trump administration illegal. Judge Boasberg is ordering the pipeline company to provide weekly updates that detail exactly when oil is expected to flow underneath Lake Oahe. This could leave open the possibility of further court intervention.
