More than 188,000 people were ordered to evacuate after a hole in the emergency spillway in the Oroville Dam threatened to flood the surrounding area. A co-worker of mine was forced out of his home for several days by the emergency evacuation, and another friend was visiting Lake Oroville and happened to leave 15 minutes before the evacuation order was issued. Like many extreme events, the Oroville emergency is a combination of natural weather likely intensified by climate change.

Peter Gleick of the Pacific Institute has been researching the impact of climate change on the water cycle since the 1986, when his dissertation was the first research to conclude that the Sierra snowpack would be at risk due to rising temperatures from global warming. We know the climate is changing and we need to be prepared. Research has shown that conditions that create both wet years and hot dry years in California are becoming more frequent. As Gleick recently wrote, extreme weather is battering California: We already see fundamental changes in storm frequency and intensity, increases in the size and duration of droughts and rainfall events, disappearing snow packs, growing agricultural water demands with rising temperatures, and more. Any investment in infrastructure must take climate change into account through smart flexible design, integration of better weather-forecasting and modeling tools, and adoption of new standards for facility construction and operation. The environmental groups were proven right. Facebook Twitter Pinterest William Brangham speaks with Jeffrey Mount of the Public Policy Institute of California about the Oroville Dam emergency on PBS News Hour. These are some of the many hidden costs of climate change. Intense droughts and floods exert extra stress on aging water management systems, farms, and other infrastructure. Such dangerous heatwaves are now twice as likely to occur because of human-caused global warming. Please choose your username under which you would like all your comments to show up.
