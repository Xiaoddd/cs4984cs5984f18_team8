Stretching over 1,000 miles, it crosses 4 states, invades Sioux territory, and threatens numerous bodies of water, forests, plains, and farmland. Alone, DAPL is a threat to entire ecosystems and an act of colonial aggression against the Sioux, but it is only one small part of something much larger. If completed, it will ship crude oil from the Bakken shale oilfields in North Dakota to a terminus near Patoka, Illinois. Together DAPL and ETCO are projected to create the nearly 2,000 mile long Bakken Pipeline Project. It will also cross Sioux Territory without the permission of the tribe as well as the Missouri, Mississippi, and Ohio River systems and tributaries. ETP also maintained managerial rights to oversee construction of the Project. Executive vice-president of EEP Guy Jarvis explained in an interview with Shawn McCarthy that he could not define the reasons why the purchase was postponed. In addition, ETP owns many other natural gas and crude oil companies. This, however, is just the beginning. Big Oil and the non-renewable energy industry continue to push fuel that is dangerous through pipelines just waiting to burst. We will explain how energy companies like ETP are legally allowed to escape corporate income tax while destroying the planet. Stay tuned for more.

It was based on the fact that WalMarts in Texas were being sold to the US government and turned into...something. Totally crazy. Certainly one could discount the entire thing as the ravings of the lunatic fringe. Except that the lunatic fringe wasn't as far out there as we thought. They got some of the details completely wrong (the former WalMarts are not housing US citizens), but it's true that these once retail stores are now warehousing humans. Allegedly. See, we don't even know for sure because we're not allowed into the facilities. He went to one of these detention centers in Brownsville, Texas, where the children of undocumented immigrants are supposedly being held. He'd made an appointment earlier in the week, but when he arrived to do a tour, no one would let him in. And then the police were called. Senator Merkley was asked to leave. There's a lot wrong here.

One of these conversations, which this journalist believes is necessary, is the increasing presence of military equipment at events such as the NSM rally which took place in Newnan on the 21st of April, 2018. The first thing I saw was a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle (MRAP) with what looked to be several military personnel standing in a perimeter around it. This was not an unfamiliar sight for me as I had seen this exact scene before. Everywhere I looked, there were militarized police adorned with the very same gear I carried and wore in Iraq in 2003. He nodded in agreement. I looked up to see not one, but three helicopters circling the area. Once again, I was taken back to my days in the military. Downtown Newnan more closely resembled a war torn village around Tikrit or Falluja in Iraq than a small town in America, sans the abject destruction. We decided to ditch the car and walk the rest of the way. It was at this point I noticed we had another kind of company. Hovering above us was a DJI Inspire 1 quadcopter (what some would call a drone) these drones are equipped with high resolution cameras and are often operated by two people, one piloting the craft and the other operating the camera. My telephoto however, was faster than the drone. I noticed at least 4 MRAP vehicles, 3 helicopters, and 2 drones following various groups of protesters. Pj said barely attempting to hide his elation as a smile crept onto his face. He added. As the day wore on, more and more officers began closing in on protesters. As NSM members preaching a message of genocide and hate were escorted out of the park, several activists were being arrested simply for stepping in the street or wearing a mask. I remember thinking to myself. Coming from a military background, my heritage includes men and women who were sent to foreign lands to fight fascism and oppression. They did not have body armor or M-4 rifles. They certainly did not have drones. These, the original antifascists, were heroes. The heavily armed men and women who protected the Nazis in Newnan are not. It was based on the fact that WalMarts in Texas were being sold to the US government and turned into...something.
