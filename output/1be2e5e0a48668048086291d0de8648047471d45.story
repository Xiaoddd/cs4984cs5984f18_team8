The pipeline, which protesters say could potentially harm the drinking water on sacred lands of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, would cross under a Missouri River reservoir from North Dakota to Illinois. Two potential candidates for the secretary of energy cabinet appointment could also benefit from construction of the pipeline. Harold Hamm, CEO of Continental Resources, could ship oil from his company; Texas Gov. Rick Perry is on the board of Energy Transfer Partners. In recent weeks, protests in North Dakota have resulted in violence and arrests, with at least 528 people arrested since August, AP reported. Police officers reportedly used water cannons on protesters, the Washington Post reported on Monday. Several people on Twitter have pleaded with President Barack Obama to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline construction before Trump takes office. Police have barb wire fences up now.
