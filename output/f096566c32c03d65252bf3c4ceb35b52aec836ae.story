I arrived last minute in the evening needing a place to sleep, and a friend said that there was space in a tipi. As I gladly accepted the offer to stay and a chance to sleep in a tipi for the first time, I had no idea I would meet two new wonderful friends. They were both so generous, offering blankets and pillows to me, the weary traveler. This particular night, they were housing six people, including myself. When I started to talk to them, I immediately realized they were from the South. I was curious to know more about the Cherokee, since I grew up so close to the tribe and know absolutely nothing about them. The sisters, Precise Lossie (pronounced Precious), 25, and Mona Lossiah (pronounced Monet), 27, were born and raised in Cherokee country. They were brought up by their grandmother. We lived with her in a small house on the mountain. She didn't trust the water from the pipes, because she thought that the government may put poison in it, so we had to carry water every day from the river. They both have a deep respect for the water and its value. Their grandmother only spoke Cherokee, and it was passed on from her grandmother. Precise and her sister are some of the few young people who speak Eastern Band Cherokee, which is getting lost and forgotten. Since the grandparents are the ones that pass on the traditions and wisdom, there is a major information-sharing gap in the tribe for the younger generations. Precise is a freelance writer currently working on a fictional memoir, but she hopes to also write down the language that she learned from her grandmother to share with the younger generation. They are practically attached at the hip. They make money on the Powwow Trail, which is basically going on the road as a vendor at Powwow shows selling peyote-stitch rope necklaces that they learned from a friend of the family. Precise also does some art work. They first came out to the Oceti Sakowin Camp in August for several weeks. When they had to return home, all they could think about was making it back out to camp. Mona says, laughing. She says it was all they could do, and they strongly feel that they need to be here at camp. We cannot leave. We have to see this through. We don't know how far capitalism is going to damage the environment and the earth to the point where it collapses in on itself, and we don't want that to happen, so we want to stop it. The girls plan to stay until the end, and they are working on starting a small kitchen for the campers. The knowledge, intelligence and beauty of spirit that these two girls possess is truly a gift in the Oceti Sakowin Camp. I can only hope that the Creator keeps them safe as this battle for Earth and future generations continues. Wage peace.
