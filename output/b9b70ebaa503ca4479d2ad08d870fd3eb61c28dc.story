The Dakota Access Pipeline project at that time appeared to be moving forward without a full analysis of the impacts on Native people, their cultural heritage, and the environment. I believed, then and now, that scientists should support the call for that full analysis because decisions on a matter that is so important should be made in light of the science, along with many other factors. The Obama Administration, in response to the coming together of tribes from all across the country, decided that indeed a deeper analysis of options was needed. On January 18, the Army Corps of Engineers announced their intent to prepare a full Environmental Impact Statement. That is the deeper analysis including consideration of alternatives as I discussed at length in my September blog. To date, the Army has not made a final decision on whether to grant the easement pursuant to the MLA. There are important science questions in at least the first two of these topics. So scientists with specific expertise might want to comment. And those scientists who are not necessarily specialists in this area or these topics still might want to comment on the importance of preparing a full analysis of the impacts of the proposed pipeline. Comments in response to the notice are in no way restricted to only these three concerns. Underscoring all of this is the fact that the tribes who have been fighting long and hard to protect their lands and water are also asking for our support. This call for support is all the more urgent given the Presidential Action this week by President Trump to expedite permitting for the pipeline. And it is unclear in fact what will happen under the new order. At the least there is likely to be a court battle. So it is more important than ever for scientists to speak up. Now is the time to be re-energized. Click here to email your comments to the Corps of Engineers before February 20, 2017. Or go directly to the request for comments page on the Federal Register.
