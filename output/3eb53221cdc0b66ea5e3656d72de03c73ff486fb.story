It is proposed to transport over 570,000 barrels per day. To date, more than 300 tribes and first nations officially stand with Standing Rock by way of tribal resolutions, letters of support, or tribal delegations joining the camp. Paul supporting us, and they aren't the only ones. There are millions of people the world over standing in solidarity as well. The local, global, national, and tribal communities all support our fight and we've got more coming in every day. We're also receiving an outcry of support from our allies, friends, and relations who aren't able to come to North Dakota but want to provide for, look after, and contribute to the cause up here. That's what this crowdfunding is for. Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has been providing a multitude of support services for the thousands of people resisting DAPL as we have seen the encampments grow and grow with each day. We have been supporting the camps by way of: Food and meals Porta-johns Trash Collection Hand Washing Stations Community Shelters and Tents Emergency Management Team Firewood and Hauling Community Wellness Initiatives And much, much more. We need your help however you can give it. Dakota Access Pipeline would contribute to 50 million tonnes CO2 per year. Every one of those tonnes of CO2 is a threat to all people on the planet. We can't all breathe poison air. The pipeline is a huge risk to prairie, farm lands and critical waterways as well, including the Missouri River. It is a massive pipeline that would transport crude oil. News report after news report continues to come out about oil spills across the continent. Thousands of gallons have already been spilled. None of that can ever be brought back. This pipeline is proposed to cross the Missouri River, less than one mile away from our community and less than 500 feet from our border. 18 million people downstream stand to be affected, too. This is Standing Rock's fight but it's not just a native issue. We have a saying here in Standing Rock: Mni Wiconi. You can't drink oil.
