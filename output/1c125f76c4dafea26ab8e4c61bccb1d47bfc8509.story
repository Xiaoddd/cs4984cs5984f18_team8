U.S. Army officials announced today that they had cleared the way for approval of the last easement needed -- a path under Lake Oahe in North Dakota, where protesters have gathered for months in an effort to stop the pipeline's completion. Tribe members have said they were concerned a pipeline spill could contaminate their drinking water and that pipeline would also disrupt sacred land. The decision is a victory for Energy Transfer Partners, the Dallas-based company that owns a majority of the pipeline. But by late afternoon, about 150 people were outside ETP's headquarters near Northwest Highway and the Dallas North Tollway. Dakota Access has become an international rallying cry for those concerned about American Indian, social justice and environmental causes. More than 100 protesters also marched 30 minutes to the Preston Hollow home of Kelcy Warren, CEO of ETP. The final go-ahead from the Army Corps of Engineers was expected as early as Wednesday, according to a court filing. One of Trump's first executive orders called for expediting that assessment. Officials with Energy Transfer Partners did not immediately respond to today's news. Dallas pipeline mogul Kelcy Warren sees brighter 2017 after 'toughest year of my career' Warren previously said Dakota Access could be completed as soon as May if approval arrived quickly. Representatives of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe said last month that they would sue again to stop the project. An earlier effort in federal court was unsuccessful. Protesters in Dallas said they were there to raise awareness and perhaps change a few minds. No. Others said these protests are the best they can do now. The White House and both houses of Congress are controlled by Republicans, who are mostly in favor of this project. At one point, protesters circled the ETP offices seven times, a nod to the Bible story of the Israelites circling Jericho before the walls fell. More pipeline battles ahead The news Tuesday was ETP's second win in the last week. The 1,172-mile Dakota Access project connects the oil fields of North Dakota to a distribution hub in Illinois. Another of Trump's initial executive orders seeks to restart the Keystone XL pipeline, which was rejected by Obama. That project start the movement opposing many oil and gas pipeline. Protesters in West Texas have tried to create a similar movement around the Trans Pecos pipeline, another ETP project. But that hasn't attracted the same level of attention. The Dakota Access news -- which had been anticipated for days -- arrived as the opposing sides continue their heated attacks. Dakota Access pipeline's long journey from application to approval Environmental groups posted on social media their concerns about spills from existing ETP pipelines. Meanwhile, pro-industry groups and conservative outlets, were circulating stories about the clean up of tons of debris at a Dakota Access protest site. The most sensational claims were that cleanup crews were looking for weapons and dead bodies, although no evidence was given that either would be present. All Rights Reserved. Publisher Platform (P3).
