Middletown Coalition for Community Safety is pleased to offer this substantial reward in support of obtaining an accurate narrative of who is doing the damage in our communities. Information regarding Sunoco-ordered or committed property damage may be submitted by contacting the telephone number or e-mail address listed above or provided to any law enforcement agency. All information received by Middletown Coalition for Community Safety will be held in strict confidence. job is to protect the environment. almost as if they are completely tone-deaf in that regard. And it seems to me that the very least DEP could do is dedicate a portion of that to obtaining an independent risk assessment of Mariner East II, or even support our effort do so. Our residents and their families deserve to know and thoroughly understand the risks and potential safety issues at stake. There is no reason why the administration cannot bridge that gap. Residents are concerned regarding the potential impact of a leak or explosion in places where the pipeline is recklessly sited next to schools, daycares, senior living facilities, and homes. The Governor has failed to keep the project halted, and has failed to address the potential risks this project poses. This enabled them to use eminent domain to coerce us and others throughout the state to sign easements for construction of Mariner East pipelines. These pipelines are scheduled to pass through our property, disrupting our lives, destroying our landscape, and posing chronic danger. NGLs are liquid only under very high pressure or extremely cold temperatures. Sunoco has violated regulations and agreements, damaged homes, created sinkholes, contaminated aquifers and wells, and disrupted wetlands. The danger of major explosions looms as millions of gallons of hazardous, highly volatile liquids flow near homes, businesses, schools, and recreation facilities on a daily basis. No county is more at risk than Chester County. Much of route through Chester and Delaware counties would be considered Class 4 High Consequence Areas by Natural Gas standards. This liquid state is a higher energy state containing more combustion energy than the ambient state these gases have in the natural environment. If leaked, highly condensed liquids rapidly convert back to a gas, expanding by hundreds of times in volume into a highly explosive gas cloud. These gases are naturally odorless, colorless, and heavier-than-air. The heavier-than-air characteristic allows these gases to migrate in unpredictable ways that are highly dependent on wind conditions and topography. The gases, being heavier-than-air, remain low to the ground, will settle in low lying areas, can enter sewer systems or porous rock and use them as conduit to migrate indeterminate distances from a leak site. The model focuses on the heavily populated segment between the pumping station in Derry Township, Dauphin County, PA and the pipeline terminus in Twin Oaks, Delaware County, PA. Methane Natural Gas hazards model is shown for reference and comparison throughout the modeling process. Quest ran several simulations of ME2 pipeline ruptures using liquefied Ethane as the piped material. This 25-acre area surrounding the leak would be inaccessible until the jet fire was extinguished. Because these materials are artificially liquefied within the pipe, any leak will continue even after valve stations close and isolate the leak site. Therefore, any jet fire will continue until the gas fully self-ventilates and there is not more fuel to burn. With 800 to 1,200 tons of material condensed within each 6-mile long segment between valve stations, the time to fully extinguish a jet fire an access people within the 25-acre jet fire affected area would likely be measured in hours, likely many hours. Data obtained from an independent hazards study performed by Quest Consultants using ethane at 2 local operating pressures was used to correlate the Instant Ignition model. These local pressures represent the operating pressure of the pipeline at the simulated location of rupture accounting for pressure dropping at a steady rate as the material gets farther from the pump. The large variance is apparent even at lower operating pressures, demonstrating that severity is more sensitive to the highly condensed liquid state than to pressure itself. While higher pressure does show increased severity, there is a sharp increase in severity at the operating pressure at which each material converts from gas to liquid. This sharp severity increase correlates well with the density vs. pressure curve for each material. However, the pipeline operator claims that they are not using the Berks County pumping station. Because of this uncertainty, the model was run both ways. This characteristic means that these materials, when converted back to a gaseous state outside the pipeline, will remain close to the ground and have the potential to migrate. Data from the Quest hazards study was also used to model a 3-minute delayed ignition leak scenario. local pressure trends were then input into the 3-Minute Delayed Ignition PIR model to obtain the Delayed Ignition PIR for Ethane along the entire ME2 segment, with Methane Natural Gas Instant Ignition PIR shown for reference. Another factor that contributes to the unpredictability of these gas migration patterns is the presence of sewers, ventilation, and other systems that can serve as conduit for the gas to spread out. The heavier-than-air nature of these gases means that it will flow downhill but also down into these open-air systems that are below grade (ground level). Karst, a highly porous rock formation, is prevalent in the Uwchlan area providing additional underground passageways that can allow released gas to spread randomly throughout the surrounding areas. This size radius has been used in remote locations where there likely are few underground open-air systems. In a densely populated area with a vast network of sewers (both storm water and septic), an equivalent evacuation would be far more complex. example is illustrated in the middle of Delaware County. This location is designated on the chart above with the red star. He excavated the backyard to make it perfectly flat and a picturesque scene for our someday family and the pool that we might someday build. I still laugh at the night that he blasted the stereo and while I was sending out invitations to our holiday party, he took a sledgehammer to the outdated brick fireplace, promising to have it complete in just 4 weeks for our party. There was no question, this was going to be our forever home. Our kids would go to school right up the street in one of the top districts in the state. They would play sports at the LYA fields right down the road. Because our government continues to fail at accountability and safety, John and I are being forced to change our conversations from planning for a pool and instead searching for where we can go to be safe from this fracking boom. best emergency preparedness plans are proactive plans that include interagency communication, transparency, risk assessment, adhering to sufficient setbacks in order to prevent potential catastrophic events. This isn't about politics but rather doing what is right. That issue was not raised or decided in the case cited by Judge Burr. Moreover, a recent landmark case decided by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania known as Robinson IV affirmed the right of townships like Middletown to adopt municipal ordinances in the interest of the health, safety and welfare of their residents. Coalition for Community Safety calls upon the PA-DEP to revoke the prematurely issued water obstruction and encroachment permits. The work is associate with the Mariner East pipeline but is not the actual pipeline location. They are directionally drilling the pipeline under Chester Creek. The operation includes the pumping of bentonite ( a slurry made of clay and water ) to fill any voids created by the drilling. The slurry apparently followed a fracture in the rock under the area and started to bubble out in the area of 5005 and 5007. The work is to clean up and remove the slurry. This is a non toxic substance as it is only clay and water. The duration of the work is unknown because they do not know the full extent of the errant slurry. walls of sandbags placed in center of Chester Creek. information about the impact to Chester Creek and area drinking water supplies, local residents have been on the scene monitoring and documenting the spill. Sunoco has a recent history of such spills for which it has paid penalties to the Commonwealth. (PADEP posted and then removed from its web site the documents from which the following information is extracted. The primary potential impact to groundwater is the migration of drilling fluid away from the HDD drill path. Specifically, drilling fluid expended downhole will flow in the path of least resistance. While the path of least resistance is typically the bore hole itself, it may instead be an existing fracture, fissure, or formation opening in the soil or rock substrate. Work with diesel run equipment is often carried out adjacent to, and within wetlands, waters, and floodways. If the fluid cannot be adequately contained, it can mix with surface water, dramatically increasing turbidity, and flow downstream. Despite its name, the Coalition stretches across our Commonwealth. My father once told me a story of his father coming home one night, tucking him into bed, covered in blood. The company had hired thugs to break up the picket lines of the striking workers, of which my grandfather was a part. To his dying day, my grandfather was union through and through. From all accounts, it is a difficult and demanding job. I suspect I would be lucky to last one day doing it. And we should not lose sight of that fact, whatever emotions may flare as we confront Sunoco Logistics. And I do not doubt their dedication, commitment, and quality of their work, not for a second. But the key here is, their work-as good as it is- cannot mitigate the risks posed to our community by Sunoco. The pipeline route through residential areas is insanely reckless. The United Auto Workers (UAW), has, for years, represented some of the most skilled auto workers in the world. Virtually nobody disputes this. And yet, for every Corvette or Mustang that has ever been produced by UAW workers, there has also been an Edsel, or a Corvair. The problem was in the design of the car and the cruel calculations done by management that allowed it to be produced in the first place. Rather, we take issue with the way Sunoco Logistics has stealthily and at times callously gone about securing the rights to the pipeline, as well as in its design and what looks like potentially fatal cost cutting measures. I support unions, stand by them at every turn, and will especially do so over the coming months and years as the current administration and state governments aim to dismantle union rights one by one.
