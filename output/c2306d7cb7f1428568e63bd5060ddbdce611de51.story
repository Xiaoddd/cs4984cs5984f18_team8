Three of the walkers, minors, had to drop out. They looked like war machines to us as civilians having not ever seen these machines before. Because when native people stand up to say 'no' to these development projects, whether it's in Canada with the Kinder Morgan project or here with the North Dakota Access Pipeline, if we are really following international standards of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People then these corporations and governments need the collective free, prior and informed consent of the Indigenous People, and they don't have it.

She said Tuesday afternoon she was cleared of all charges and free to go home. The sun was rising as the police began to make arrests, she said. It was a peaceful march, we were singing. They looked like war machines to us as civilians having not ever seen these machines before. Two weeks later, she plead not guilty to the charges against her.

In 2002 she was sentenced to three months in the Burnaby Women's Institute for protesting the construction of the Sun Peaks Resort in her home territory, citing threats to traditional hunting grounds. Manuel has also protested on the front lines against well-known development projects in B.C. like the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion and the Mount Polley tailings spill disaster by Imperial Metals. Based outside Edmonton, Morin has lent her talents to several news organizations, including Indian Country Today Media Network and the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network National News. She is now hard at work striving to tell the stories of Canada's Indigenous peoples to a broader audience.
