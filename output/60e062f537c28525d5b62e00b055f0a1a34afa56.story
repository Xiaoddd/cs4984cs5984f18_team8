The result is the inaugural MIT Solve Fellowship with the Oceti Sakowin (Oceti Sakowin is the proper name for people known commonly as the Sioux), which invites people living or working on the reservation to test out new projects related to renewable energy, food or water, and travel to MIT to broker partnerships and funding. Young challenged those at MIT to partner with Sioux tribes, and that resulted in follow-up meetings, a visit to Standing Rock for the first Oceti Sakowin Energy Summit, and ultimately the fellowship. So it could very likely result in investment or grant dollars. The fellowship is far from the only clean energy win for Native American communities in the Midwest. The six tribes of the Sioux Nation of North and South Dakota have also formed an independent, nonprofit, governmental entity called the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources. The consortium is working toward developing an immense wind farm, and has landed philanthropic support from the Clinton Global Initiative, Rockefeller Philanthropic Advisors, the Bush Foundation, and the Northwest Area Foundation. The announcement of the new fellowship is a good example of a philanthropic initiative making valuable connections that can go beyond a grant. A Bipartisan Climate Campaign Lands Another Big Gift.
