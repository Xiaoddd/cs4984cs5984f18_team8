Last year, Joshua Harris, founder of equity firm giant Apollo Global Management, advised the Trump administration on infrastructure policy and discussed a possible White House job that never materialized, the New York Times reported Wednesday. During that time, Harris also met several times with White House advisor Jared Kushner. Those ties were first revealed in a January 30 report published by the progressive think tank Democracy Forward. Advertisement Painter added that Kushner should leave the White House due to, among a host of other concerns, his financial conflicts. The Department of Transportation implemented a new gas pipeline safety rule in 2016 after Congress passed the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act in 2010, following a deadly gas pipeline explosion in California. DOT estimated the pipeline safety rule would prevent about 40 pipeline accidents per year. But last June, the Trump administration delayed for a year a gas pipeline safety rule that would implement new assessment, inspection, and repair requirements for existing and future gas transmission pipelines. Just days after the 2017 inauguration, the Trump administration also withheld the implementation of a similar safety monitoring rule for hazardous liquid pipelines that had been in the works for six years. And in December, the Department of the Interior delayed the implementation of a 2016 rule that implements new natural gas transportation and production safety requirements until 2019. Apollo also had previous investments with EP projects, according to the filings. Northwoods Energy LLC is a Denver-based portfolio company of funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management. Its CEO is prominent Denver-based oilman Tom Tyree, according to the Denver Business Journal. After it was revealed that federal officials were concerned that foreign governments were considering trying to influence the White House by conducting business with the company, Kushner had his top-secret security clearance removed.
