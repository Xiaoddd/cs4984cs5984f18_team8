On Jan. 27, Trump signed an executive order blocking citizens from seven predominantly Muslim nations from entering the U.S. The order largely affected citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It stopped people from these countries from entering the United States for 90 days. The order inspired widespread protests, and it quickly faced legal challenges, including one from the state of Washington.
