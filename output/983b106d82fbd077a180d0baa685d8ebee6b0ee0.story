Palmyra recently fell to the jihadists after the Syrian regime and its allies diverted forces to Aleppo, leaving the ancient city under-defended. This was a repeat of events last year when, on the advice of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, the regime deployed troops away from Palmyra to the strategically significant metropolis of Aleppo. While the US has its own reasons for battling Isis, in this case it was picking up the slack from the regime. Palmyra has only symbolic significance for Assad. Aleppo was the prize, and, with the world watching impotent, the regime was able to starve and bludgeon its population into surrender. Obama may be alone in this judgment. A year earlier, seemingly on a whim, he had set a red line on the use of chemical weapons at a time when none were being used. The red line was, in effect, a green light to conventional killing. No longer fearing punishment, the regime escalated its tactics. Nearly four times as many people were killed in the two years after the chemical attack as had died in the two years before. It helped Isis emerge from the shadows to establish itself as a major force. And as the overflow from this deluge started trickling into Europe, it sparked a xenophobic backlash that has empowered the far right across the west. The inaction also created a vacuum that was filled by Iran and Russia. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A man praying near the Umayyad mosque in the ruins of Aleppo. In January, when Obama leaves office, he will be leaving the world a lot less stable than even his predecessor. Inverting cause and consequence, he cited Russian and Iranian presence in Syria as his reason for not confronting Assad (neither was there in August 2013); he cited the disunion among rebels as the reason for not supporting them (they fragmented because they were denied meaningful support); and he cited the fear of deeper American involvement as his justification for restraint (even though a year later it would lead to a far bigger deployment across two states). The strongmen would protect the west against the twin threats of terror and migration. Syria was defined narrowly as a counterterrorism problem. But there was also another reason for tolerating Assad. Iranian leaders, however, understood that by investing his legacy in the deal, Obama had also made himself its hostage. Conscious of this, Iranian hardliners saw no cause for constraint. Flush with cash from the deal, they have embarked on a foreign policy far more intransigent than anything Iran has pursued in a century. Tehran has little need for nuclear weapons when it can conquer Aleppo without them. And, as a client of Iran, Assad has enjoyed impunity. It is Aleppo that the world will remember him by.
