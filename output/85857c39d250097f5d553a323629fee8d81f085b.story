The report claims that Dakota Access has contract deadlines with nine shippers and if those contract clauses aren't met, the shippers could back out and the project would have to be canceled. The pipeline company disputes those claims. Failure to meet that deadline could trigger a reset with shippers who can renegotiate contracts signed two years ago with the developer, Energy Transfer Partners. The contracts give shippers the right to determine their commitments if DAPL is not in full service per the contract deadline. Loss of shippers to the project could result in project cancellation. Clark Williams-Derry is one of the co-authors of the report. He says they project production in the Bakken to drop to 800,000 barrels a day by the end of 2017. Ron Ness with the North Dakota Petroleum Council disagrees. He says the pipeline is critical and that the council doesn't expect production to drop below 900,000 barrels a day. Kunkel and Williams- Derry says that Phillips 66, Hess, Tesoro and Oasis Midstream have signed contracts with Dakota Access.
