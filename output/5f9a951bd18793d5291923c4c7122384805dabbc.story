Glencore is controlled by the Rothschilds. The PetroNile joint venture will be 51 percent controlled by Nilepet and 49 percent by Glencore. It is therefore no coincidence that the currency of this newest Rothschild oil fiefdom is called the South Sudan Pound. In 1996 the Clinton Administration announced that military aid to Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda was to be used to arm the SPLA for an offensive on Khartoum. There was no mention of JEM in the ICC charges. With al-Bashir still sitting atop huge oil reserves, the Eight Families now cooked up a plan for South Sudan to cecede from Sudan. Reeling from the constant attacks on his people which had left two million dead, al-Bashir was forced into agreeing with the split. John Daly. Matt Richmond. 7-12-11. www.wireupdate.com. BNO News.

Consider that for years he pushed for reforms in Libya, and consider also that he commanded no military nor police units. Indeed he was not in a position to commit war crimes. He is now among his uncles and relatives in the eastern Libyan city of al-Bayda, according to local reports. Gaddafi was released late Saturday, according to the Abu Bakr al-Siddiq Battalion, a militia in control of Zintan, which lies in the hills southwest of the capital Tripoli. United States Marine Corp General Thomas Waldhauser, the commander of U.S. Africa Command, has accused Haftar of being backed by the Russian Federation. Saif al-Islam was captured by the Zintan rebels in November 2011 while attempting to flee to Nigeria after opposition forces captured Tripoli. While he was sentenced to death in July 2015 in a mass trial for officials in the toppled government founded by his father, he was later relieved of the sentence in the general amnesty that was subsequently passed. Gaddafi is wanted by the International Criminal Court for his alleged involvement in the killing of protesters. Ovvio il sonoro silenzio del sistema merdiatico italiano. If we assume that they are doing it for such figurative effect, some symbolism, then they certainly use those words. It is hard to imagine anything more barbaric than the US policy towards Iraq or the position and policy of some illegal coalitions within Libya. In the region it is difficult to do this. This is why everything we see is a show but apparently they are not able to play it till the end and this is why American diplomats go into hysterics. The only thing I want to tell our American colleagues: it is diplomacy. Having orchestrated the government coup, the Western coalition killed the Colonel and plunged the country into chaos. Today inter-ethnic conflict prevails and the country is in shambles. Hillary Clinton cackles wildly. The Colonel had warned that Libya is the only real gatekeeper between Africa and Europe. The Libyan government used to patrol its coasts, often dealing to traffickers harshly. Concetti declinati in tutte le maniere possibili e immaginabili, soprattutto riferendosi alle guerre combattute nel Vicino e Medio Oriente. Most Libyans just want a quiet life.
