Line 5, owned by Calgary-based Enbridge, transports 540,000 barrels of light crude, synthetic crude and natural gas per day between Michigan and Ontario and supplies more than 50 per cent of the state's propane demands. In this Sept. 23, 2015, file photo, the Mackinac Bridge is visible from a marker near Enbridge Line 5 on the northern shore of the Straits of Mackinac in Michigan. Enbridge confident in pipeline integrity Brad Shamla, the vice-president of U.S. operations at Enbridge, says the company is confident in the integrity of the pipeline and its fitness for service. The portion of the pipeline that runs through the Straits of Mackinac has never experienced a leak in its more than 60 years of operation. 'No leak is acceptable' Shalma says that leak, which dumped millions of litres of oil into a Kalamazoo River tributary, changed Enbridge for the better. Despite the opposition, Shamla says the company has no plans to alter the way it transports oil and gas through Michigan.
