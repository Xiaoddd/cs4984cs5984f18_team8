As the Trump administration yanks the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement, claiming it will hurt the American economy, Beijing is investing hundreds of billions of dollars and creating millions of jobs in clean power. China has built vast solar and wind farms, helping fuel the growth of major industries that sell their products around the world. More than 2.5 million people work in the solar power sector alone in China, compared with 260,000 people in the U.S., according to the most recent annual report from the International Renewable Energy Agency. While President Trump promises to put American coal miners back to work, China is moving in the opposite direction. Related: There is no boom in coal jobs Coal still makes up the largest part of China's energy consumption, but Beijing has been shutting coal mines and set out plans last year to cut roughly 1.3 million jobs in the industry. The Chinese government has also moved to restrict the construction of new coal power plants. For the first time ever, China's National Energy Administration in January established a mandatory target to reduce coal energy consumption. Analysts expect China to easily meet that target.

The investment will create about 10 million jobs in the sector, the National Energy Administration projects. China currently boasts 3.5 million jobs in clean energy, by far the most in the world, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. The country has already become a major manufacturer and exporter of renewable energy technology, supplying some two-thirds of the world's solar panels. China also has a strong grip on wind power. It produces nearly half of the world's wind turbines -- at a rate of about two every hour. Covering about 100 square miles, it is the largest floating panel facility in the world. It has the capacity to produce enough energy to power 15,000 homes, according to Sungrow Power Supply, the company behind the farm. Fittingly, the solar farm floats atop a flooded area once home to a coal mining factory. The idea to float solar panels is fast catching on in an industry that faces one persistent problem -- space.

But experts say floating solar panels can run more efficiently in the long run, because they are cooled by the water underneath. China's growing dominance in the sector has had a huge effect on the global market. Related: Trump and China could still fall out badly over trade The U.S. accused China of flooding the market and the Commerce Department started imposing steep tariffs on Chinese-made solar panels in 2012 in a bid to protect American producers. Just last month, the U.S. informed the World Trade Organization that it may impose tariffs on imports of solar panels from other countries as well, alleging that Chinese companies have opened production facilities in third countries to get around import restrictions.
