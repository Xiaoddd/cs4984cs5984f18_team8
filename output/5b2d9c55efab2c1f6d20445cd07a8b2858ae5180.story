The protesters fear pipeline construction disturbed sacred sites and that a leak could contaminate the Missouri River. They are scheduled for a joint misdemeanor trial at the Morton County Courthouse on Monday morning. An affidavit filed with the complaint accuses the defendants of pushing through law enforcement lines or police tape to access the work site. In an order responding to a defendant's requests to dismiss her case because she was exercising her First Amendment rights, Feland wrote that the defendant's alleged actions, crossing onto an access road to the work site against police orders, went beyond free speech. The trial is scheduled for one day, with extra tables and chairs to accommodate the 20 lawyers and defendants, but Dickson suggested it could take more than a day just to pick the jury. This is in response to a motion by Erickson, who indicated in court documents he will seek hearings on repayment of public defender fees after trial. Delaney said it's not uncommon for the state to try and recoup fees, but it's typically dependent on the person's funds, not their intentions. The defendants include Sara Jumping Eagle, a doctor and wife of former congressional candidate Chase Iron Eyes. For two of the 10 defendants, Monday will not be their last date in court, as they have additional open cases relating to pipeline arrests. The defendants are from 9 different states, including North Dakota, South Dakota, Oregon and Hawaii. They range in age from 23 to 57 years old. Monday's trial is just the first pipeline protest trial of the week. Sixteen more protesters are scheduled for trials on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, according to the court clerk's office. A total of 571 people have been arrested in connection with the pipeline protests, according to the Morton County Sheriff's Department. This can be removed when origin is fixed.
