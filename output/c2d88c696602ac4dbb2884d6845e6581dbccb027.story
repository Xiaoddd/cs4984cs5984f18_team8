All five members of the Public Utilities Commission backed the project, though some cited heavy trepidation. In open discussion before the vote, several cited the deteriorating condition of the existing line, which was built in the 1960s, as a major factor. Line 3 pipeline opponents, in tears, console each other after the decision Thursday. Some pipeline opponents reacted angrily when it became clear earlier Thursday how the vote would go. Article Continued Below Tribal and climate change activists have teamed up to fight the project, arguing in part that the pipeline risks spills in pristine areas in northern Minnesota where Indigenous people harvest wild rice. Ojibwe Indians, or Anishinaabe, consider wild rice sacred and central to their culture. Chairperson Nancy Lange choked up and took off her glasses to wipe her eyes as she described her reasoning. Commissioners did not discuss the route during morning deliberations. The current pipeline crosses two Indigenous reservations whose tribes strongly oppose the project. Article Continued Below Enbridge has proposed a route that bypasses those reservations, but the tribes and climate change activists oppose that route, too. Enbridge has said it would continue to run Line 3 if Minnesota regulators rejected its proposal, despite its accelerating maintenance needs. Much of the discussion at the Line 3 hearings over the past several days has focused on whether Minnesota and Midwest refineries need the extra oil. Enbridge currently runs Line 3 at about half its original capacity of 760,000 barrels per day for safety reasons, and currently uses it only to carry light crude. Opposition groups also argue that much of the additional oil would eventually flow from to overseas buyers. Enbridge and its customers strongly dispute the lack of need in the region. Business and labour groups support the proposal for the jobs and economic stimulus. Lange said earlier this year that the dispute was likely to end up in court, regardless of what the commission decides. Opponents, including the Indigenous-based environmental group Honor the Earth, have threatened a repeat of the protests on the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota against the Dakota Access pipeline, in which Enbridge owns a stake. Those protests drew thousands of opponents in 2016 and 2017, with sometimes violent skirmishes with law enforcement and more than 700 arrests. Similar concerns over the role of oilsands production in climate change, Indigenous rights and the risk of spills has fuelled opposition to other pipelines out of Alberta. Enbridge has already replaced the short segment of Line 3 in Wisconsin and put it into service. Construction is underway on the short segment that crosses northeastern North Dakota and on the longer section from Alberta to the U.S. border, and Enbridge plans to continue that work.
