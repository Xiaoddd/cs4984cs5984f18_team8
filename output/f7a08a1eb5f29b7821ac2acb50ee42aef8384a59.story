Imagine if you will an oil and gas pipeline company whose workers move into Army Corps of Engineers land in the middle of summer and establish an illegal campsite. Imagine next that said oil and gas pipeline company then sends out a nationwide call to action inviting non-employees from all parts of the country to join its employees at the campsite. Imagine that, over the next several months, thousands of such outsiders come and go to and from the illegal site, leaving behind piles of trash, large volumes of human waste, and dozens of abandoned cars, commercial vans, buses and trucks, many of which are broken down or out of gasoline. Next, imagine that said oil and gas pipeline company's management gets a little antsy about the situation around December, worried that the campsite in fact sits smack dab in the middle of a flood plain, a flood plain that drains into a nearby lake which serves as the drinking water supply for several Indian tribes and surrounding communities. Imagine that management understands that, when the spring thaws begin to come around the first of March, the resulting flood waters will carry whatever garbage, human waste and abandoned cars remain at the site right down into that nearby lake, thus polluting the drinking water for those surrounding communities. Now, imagine that several hundred of those outsiders choose to ignore the requests by management to leave, and instead stick around causing trouble and interfering with cleanup efforts until mid-February. Imagine that the oil and gas pipeline company refuses to clean up its own mess, and leaves that job to the Army Corps of Engineers. Imagine that, as the cleanup efforts finally begin, the weather suddenly becomes unseasonably warm, causing much of the snow and ice to begin to melt, turning the campsite into an ugly, muddy quagmire. Now, imagine the uproar that would be taking place in the national news media had an oil and gas pipeline company caused such a situation to exist. And imagine the legal hell that would rain down upon said oil and gas pipeline company in the form of fines, civil penalties and even criminal penalties from a multitude of local, state and federal government agencies in such a situation, especially if the site is not ultimately cleaned out before the spring floods begin in earnest. I am of course describing the current dire situation that exists at the protest site of the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the series of events that have led up to it. There is of course no national media uproar condemning the protesters who have created the current mess, or the conflict groups that helped to organize them, raised millions as a result of the conflict, but are contributing nothing to the cleanup. Nor is there any negative media mention of the dozens of celebrities who have visited the site to get a little free publicity over the last several months, or drawn attention to themselves by supporting the cause on social media, but who also are doing nothing to help with the clean up effort. Abandoned property used by people who temporarily occupied the Oceti Sakowin camp to protest the Dakota Access pipeline is piled in front of Dumpsters headed to the landfill. A massive cleanup is intended to prepare for possible spring flooding and prevent contamination. No mention of all the arrests of out-of-staters, or of the massive cost to Morton County. National media outlets have tended to portray these protesters - many of whom are professionals - as a peaceful and spiritual bunch. Local officials have been stunned by the hateful nature of the protesters and their supporters, who have deluged the county's phone lines with death threats. The local news media outlets - most notably the local Fox affiliate, KFYR, and Rob Port, a columnist for the Forum News Service who has done yeoman's work at the SayAnythingBlog - have been much more on top of the story, and willing to publish films and photos of the camp's real condition. February 2, 2017: Crews begin work to clean up the Oceti Sakowin camp. The state of North Dakota also manages a website - NDRESPONSE - that provides excellent documentation of the real status of the protest site. There are many more, but you get the point. As of this writing, the total contribution made by these celebrities to the cleanup effort is zero. If any of this surprises you, you haven't been paying attention.
