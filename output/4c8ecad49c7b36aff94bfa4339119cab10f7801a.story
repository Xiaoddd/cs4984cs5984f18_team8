Legis. Sess. (Jan. The Burleigh County District Court had jurisdiction under N.D. Const. art. Holkesvig's 2nd appeal is timely under N.D.R.App.P. 4. This court has jurisdiction under N.D. Const. art. On 8-20-15 Holkesvig filed his first appeal in this case and it was perfected by 8-27-15. On 8-20-15 Holkesvig also filed a Motion for Relief. On 9-3-15 Doug Bahr filed a Response To Motion For Relief after Holkesvig perfected his appeal. Feland canceled the scheduled hearing that was set for 10-15-15 at 1:30 PM. Feland's Order and cancelation was never sent to Holkesvig. No affidavit of service and no email notification was ever sent by the District Court Clerks to Holkesvig regarding Feland's Orders dated 10-2-15 and 10-15-15. N.D.R.Ct. 3.2(a)(1)(2)(3), (b) and (c) was knowingly and intentionally violated by Feland while Bahr did not file a reply which meant Holkesvig's motion had merit. On 9-23-15 Holkesvig filed a Motion for Oral Argument 2 and sent Notice of Hearing and Affidavit of Service to Bahr and the court. Bahr had 14 days to file a reply by 10-7-15. Feland erred and violated court rules by issuing her Order on 10-2-15. Feland conveniently and illegally canceled the 10-15-15 argument and phone hearing without allowing Bahr time to file a reply while the Clerks failed to properly notify Holkesvig of Feland's Order and subsequent hearing cancelation. Holkesvig is using N.D.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1), (3), (4), (5) and (6) for the 2nd appeal because the Order and judgment is so blatantly one-sided and unfair with due process violations that the district court could not and should not enforce it. The subsequent action taken by Judge Feland is filled with egregious errors and misconduct that is documented with facts and evidence in the 1st Appeal brief and Appendix, and Feland's retaliatory abuse is clearly confirmed and obviously illegal in the 2nd Appeal filed by Holkesvig. N.D.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(vi) provides the ultimate safety valve to avoid enforcement by vacating the judgment to accomplish justice. Holkesvig has previously stated and argued using N.D.R.Civ.P. 60(b) in various briefs and in prior motions. N.D.R.Civ.P. 60(d)(1) and (3) also offers additional protection to Holkesvig. It states; Other Powers to Grant Relief. This rule does not limit a court's power to: (1) entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding; (3) set aside a judgment for fraud on the court. N.D.R.Ct. 3.2 authorizes hearing of routine motions on briefs without an actual and formal hearing except when an attorney or the court requests one. Anton v. Anton, 442 N.W.2d 445 (N.D.1989). The party requesting oral argument must secure a time for the argument and serve notice upon all other parties. Matter of Adoption of J.S.P.L., 532 N.W.2d 653, 657 (N.D.1995). A request for oral argument is not complete until the requesting party has secured a time for oral argument. Bakes v. Bakes, 532 N.W.2d 4 666, 668 (N.D.1995). When a court erroneously fails to provide a required hearing, the remedy is to remand for a hearing on the matter. See J.S.P.L., 532 N.W.2d at 657. However, N.D.R.Ct. 3.2 does not supersede the civil rules nor entirely dispense with notice of a motion. Breyfogle v. Braun, 460 N.W.2d 689, 692-693 (N.D.1990). Breyfogle, 460 N.W.2d at 693, n.3. Holkesvig requested an oral hearing and argument and sent Notice with Affidavit to Bahr and the District Court. It must be held or otherwise it violated due process under the 5th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. By canceling the oral hearing and oral argument Feland put herself above the law by ignoring Holkesvig's right to be heard. A district court's arbitrary action or misapplication of the law is an abuse of discretion. Access to the court is protected by the 1st Amendment right to petition for redress of grievances. Wilson v. Thompson, 593 F.2d 1375, 1387 (5th Cir.1979). A person is denied due process when defects in the procedure employed might lead to a denial of justice. Holkesvig was forced to file a 2nd appeal because Feland abused her discretion by denying the Motion and canceling the hearing in violation of any and all relevant North 5 Dakota Code of Judicial Conduct Rules, Rules of Civil Procedure, Statutes, North Dakota Rules of Evidence, Procedural and Substantive Rules, North Dakota Rules of Professional Conduct, Rules of the Judicial Conduct Commission, due process and the right to be heard by an impartial and fair judiciary. Feland violated N.D. Code Jud. Conduct Canon 1, Rules 1.1, 1.2, Canon 2, Rules 2.2, 2.3, 2.4(C), 2.6(A), 2.7, 2.9(A), 2.9(B), 2.9(C), 2.9(D), 2.11(A), 2.11(C), 2.15(A), 2.15(C), and 2.16(B). Holkesvig filed a serious Judicial complaint against Feland on August 20, 2015. Feland obviously retaliated with her Memorandum and Order by denying Holkesvig's Motion on 10-2-15 and canceling the hearing on 10-15-15. Hearing on HB 1190 Before the House Judiciary Comm., 50th N.D. Legis. Sess. (Jan. Procedural due process requires notice and a meaningful opportunity for a hearing appropriate to the nature of the case. State v. One Black 1989 Cadillac, 522 N.W.2d 457, 463 (N.D.1994). Respect for law and human dignity can best be fostered by a process that is fair and just.Sandbeck v. Rockwell, 524 N.W.2d 846, 852 (N.D.1994). It was an error that is plain and obvious with Feland's ruling. She should have allowed Bahr to reply and Holkesvig to defend it and it was an error for the court to rule on the motion prior to the 14 day period expires. See 6 N.D.R.Ct. 3.2(a). Holkesvig considers Feland's ruling a final Order. Feland simply did not want any kind oral hearing to take place. N.D.R.Civ.P. 56 was never held or considered by Feland. It was clearly violated with the intent and purpose to silence Holkesvig. N.D.R.Ct. 3.2 applies to all motion practices unless a conflicting rule governs the matter. Discovery, interrogatories, evidentiary hearing, oral arguments and jury trial were conveniently denied or not addressed by Feland. The facts prove Feland abused her discretion by failing to recuse and failing to disqualify which nullifies her Orders. Feland obviously violated her judicial oath and numerous judicial canons. A judge who manifests bias or prejudice in a proceeding impairs the fairness of the proceeding and brings the judiciary into disrepute. N.D.R.Civ.P. 60(b) permits the district court to provide relief to a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding. Any questions that Feland raised in her most recent dismissal would obviously be answered in person at the oral argument and hearing that was scheduled for 10-15-15 at 1:30 PM. Feland denied it on 10-2-15 because she could not defend it using state law, rule or statute. Feland retaliated by denying discovery, interrogatories, evidentiary hearing, oral argument and jury trial which are all relevant issues for due process and constitutional violations. N.D.R.Civ.P 60(b) covers 6 instances in which relief can be granted. Schmalenberger never had jurisdiction to issue a ruling in Holkesvig v. Rost. He he should have, by law, statute and judicial canon, recused or disqualified himself from the proceeding. Schmalenberger never addressed his recusal or disqualification issues while the ND Supreme Court Justices ignored it with repugnancy on appeal. Holkesvig raised very serious issues and the denials of a Petition For Rehearing and Writ of Certiorari was highly illegal, immoral and unethical because Feland is using it in part for illegal purposes with abuse of power to dismiss this lawsuit against VandeWalle. Doug Bahr is defense counsel for VandeWalle who filed a responses that contains lies and misleading information. Holkesvig cannot file a Disciplinary complaint against Bahr or any other Attorney because the State already conspired in ND Supreme Court Case No. 20140101 to block and deny his right to file a Disciplinary complaint even when it is obvious the opposing attorney is violating and manipulating the record with lies and false information in order to mislead the presiding judge. Bahr knew that Doug Anderson was present in the ND Supreme Courtroom during oral argument in the Welte case on 5-30-12 when former Justice Maring made her illegal and prejudicial comments 8 regarding post-conviction relief which wasn't even filed or on appeal as it was still in District Court being argued on 5-30-12. Bahr clearly violated the N.D.R. Prof. Conduct, the Scope, the Preamble, and the following Rules: 1.0, 3.1, 3.3(a)(1), (2) and (3), 3.4(a), (b) and (d), 4.1, 5.1, 8.3(a) and (b) and 8.4(a-g). Fraud upon the court is covered rather well in every document that Holkesvig filed. There is jurisdiction, service of process, judicial corruption, collusion, conspiracy and a statewide cover up that occurred that now includes frivolous rulings by Feland without affording Holkesvig any kind of due process. An argument implicating a due process issue presents a question of law which is fully reviewable on appeal. Due process requires a person be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before the government deprives the person of property. Wahl v. Morton Co. Soc. Madison v. North Dakota Dep't of Transp., 503 N.W.2d 243, 246-47 (N.D.1993). Pfizer, Inc. v. International Rectifier Corp., 538 F.2d 180, 195 (8th Cir.1976). Stone v. Stone, 647 P.2d 582, 586 n. 7 (Alaska 1982). United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., 167 U.S. 224, 251 (1897); accord, Schnadig Corp. v. Gaines Manufacturing Co., 494 F.2d 383, 392 (6th Cir.1974). Kenner v. C.I.R., 387 F.3d 689, 691 (7th Cir.1968). The People of the State of Illinois v. Fred E. Sterling, 357 Ill. 354, 192 N.E. 229 (1934). v. United States, 438 F.2d 705, 709 (5th Cir.1971). People v. Ranson, 4 Ill. App. 3d 953, 956 (1972). Demjanjuk v. Petrovsky, 10 F.3d 338, 348 (6th Cir.1993). It is as odious and as fatal in a court of law as in a court of equity. It is a thing indefinable 10 by any fixed and arbitrary definition. In its multiform phases and subtle shapes, it baffles definition. It is said, indeed, that it is part of the equity doctrine of fraud not to define it, lest the craft of men should find ways of committing fraud which might evade such a definition. Shelby Elec. Co. v. Forbes, 205 S.W.3d 448, 455 (Tenn. Ct. App.2005). Verry v. Murphy, 163 N.W.2d 721, 731 (N.D.1968). People v. Sterling, 357 Ill. 354, 192 N.E. 229 (1934). Once fraud enters the case in any manner, the judgment must be vitiated without further inquiry as to the materiality or effect of the fraud on the judgment. See Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238 (1944). Fraud on the court requires showing of unconscionable plan or scheme designed to improperly influence court in its decision. See Wilson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 873 F.2d 869, 872 (5th Cir.1989). Schmalenberger was prevented from dishing out his retaliation but the ND Supreme Court dished it out with a meritless ruling. The retaliatory scheme carried over to the State v. Holkesvig where the District Court, Justices and Welte refused to address the state's abhorrent and egregious behavior regarding Brady violations and the illegal withholding of exculpatory evidence. Youngblood v. West Virginia, 547 U.S. 867, 869 (2006) (citing Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). The flawed and erroneous proceedings and rulings by Feland in district court were clear, obvious and fundamentally unfair. Due process was clearly violated in Holkesvig v. Rost and State v. Holkesvig while Feland uses flawed rulings with judicial abuse, prejudice and bias to systematically cover up her rulings that obviously has no merit in a court of law. In Holkesvig v. Rost the videotape was illegally destroyed by state officials and covered up by the ND Supreme Court Justices who purposely ignored it with repugnancy. Feland knowingly used and relied on the illegal Rost ruling to dismiss this lawsuit. Pumphrey v. K.W. Thompson Tool Co., 62 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir.1995). Alexander v. Robertson, 882 F.2d 421, 424 (9th Cir.1989). Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899 (1997); United States v. Maloney, 71 F.3d 645 (7th Cir.1995). Fraud, judicial corruption, collusion, conspiracy and cover up occurred with every Judge and the ND Supreme Court Justices that involved every Holkesvig appeal. Dan Gaustad clearly violated a misapplication of a trust account in Holkesvig v. Grove, 2014 ND 57, 844 N.W.2d 557. Gaustad corrupted and committed fraud upon the court with help and guidance from Judge Fontaine in Holkesvig v. Grove, 2012 ND 208, 823 N.W.2d 786. Jurisdiction problems occurred with illegal and retaliatory rulings that the ND Supreme Court Justices illegally covered up. Fraud and deceit points to corruption, collusion, conspiracy and cover up by the Judges, Justices and defense counsel. It implies abuse with intentional misconduct that was knowingly done against Holkesvig to complete the set up from 2008 with frivolous charges to get an involuntary plea to cover it up. The integrity and dignity of the court is totally repugnant to justice. It is not dedicated to state or federal law or statutes. There is no factual truth and the rulings and opinions issued obviously taints the record with a web of lies and deceit that indicates judicial retaliation with judicial abuse of discretion. Notice must be provided with specificity regarding the allegations against the defendant and indicate the circumstances surrounding the alleged violation. McGuire v. Warden of State Farm, 229 N.W.2d 211, 218-19 (N.D.1975). Notice must apprise the defendant of the time and place for hearing. State v. Hass, 264 N.W.2d 464, 467 (N.D.1978). These requirements ensure that all parties, defendant plaintiff and lawyers can adequately prepare for the hearing and argue their position. Bahr and the District Court were properly served with Notice of Hearing. Holkesvig did not waive any due process rights. A party who moves for relief under N.D.R.Civ.P. 60 14 has the burden of establishing sufficient grounds for disturbing the finality of the court's judgment or order. McComb v. Aboelessad, 535 N.W.2d 744, 747 (N.D.1995). A district court abuses its discretion if it acts in an unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable manner. North Shore, Inc. v. Wakefield, 542 N.W.2d 725, 727 (N.D.1996). Holkesvig is a witness to every VandeWalle complaint that was filed. Holkesvig filed this lawsuit and he is currently defending it. Holzer v. Jochim, 557 N.W.2d 57, 58-59 (N.D.1996). A deprivation of that right is a denial of due process because the Court never allowed Holkesvig to address the true facts in open court that is highly relevant to the decision and ruling issued by Feland. A finding of fact, whether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the court to judge the credibility of witnesses. N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a). If a judge has a direct, personal, substantial or pecuniary interest, due process is violated. Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899 at 905; Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie, 475 U.S. 813, 825 (1986); Ward v. Monroeville, 409 U.S. 57, 60 (1972); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510, 523 (1927). VandeWalle certainly had a personal agenda to retaliate against Randy Holkesvig as Feland does. A judge's disqualification decision is directed by the North Dakota Code of Judicial Conduct. Sargent County Bank v. Wentworth, 15 500 N.W.2d 862, 877 (N.D.1993). The Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution entitles parties in both criminal and civil matters to an impartial, neutral, and disinterested tribunal. State v. Anderson, 427 N.W.2d 316, 320 (N.D.1988). A recusal by every District Court Judge and every ND Supreme Court Justice is required under the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause when the judge is actually biased or there is a constitutionally intolerable probability of actual bias. (Emphasis added). What better way to cover up the factual truth than to issue illegal rulings in cited cases and then silence Holkesvig with blatant lies without any kind of legal or valid explanation. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 291 (1980). Old Wayne Mut. Life Ass'n v. McDonough, 204 U.S. 8, 15 (1907). A hearing before an unbiased and impartial decision maker is a basic requirement of due process. Gibson v Berryhill, 411 U.S. 564, 579 (1973). The Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment guarantees the right to adequate, effective and meaningful access to the courts along with equal protection. The 5th Amendment's Due Process Clause has two aspects: procedural and substantive. Procedural due process addresses the manner in which legal proceedings are conducted. A party must be given adequate notice and a fair opportunity to be heard. Every Justice and every Judge named who presided in Holkesvig's lawsuits has failed to abide by their solemn oath to uphold the dignity, integrity and honor of their profession and of the legal system. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177-179 (1803). Article 1 Section 9 of the ND Constitution was intentionally violated by Feland. Andrews v. O'Hearn, 387 N.W.2d 716, 723 (N.D.1986). In cases like Garrison Memorial Hosp. Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie, supra, at 821. Bulloch v. United States, 763 F.2d 1115, 1121 (10th Cir.1985). Hazel-Atlas Glass Co., 322 U.S. 238, at 244-45. The judgment issued by Feland must be vacated because if summary judgment was implied, it precluded Holkesvig from presenting his case on the merits to the district court. See Id. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986). To be material, the factual assertion must be capable of affecting the substantive outcome of the litigation; to be genuine, the issue must be supported by sufficient admissible evidence that a reasonable trier-of-fact could find for the nonmoving party. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242 at 251-52. It is a genuine issue of material fact. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, at 256-57; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-324 (1986). Feland conveniently denied oral argument, evidentiary hearing, interrogatories and discovery regarding the Rost assault video to silence Holkesvig. She knew what to say 18 and do. The state cannot prove a negative that violates her deceptive motive for issuing a summary judgment ruling. Bahr's silence regarding the Rost assault video is obvious. Feland's deceptive and deliberately worded judgment egregiously avoids Rost like the plague. This kind of judicial abuse, impropriety and retaliation is highly illegal, immoral and unethical. State officials illegally protected Grand Forks Sheriff Bob Rost by illegally dismissing his lawsuit. The Justices inserted their order to protect themselves from future lawsuits that resulted from their abhorrent and corruptive opinions found in every appeal filed by Holkesvig. The ND Supreme Court Justices issued it based on their retaliation to get revenge against Holkesvig for exposing the ongoing corruption, collusion, conspiracy and cover up by judges, law enforcement and selected 19 state officials that includes Governor Dalrymple and North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem. (Emphasis added), Nelson v. Charlesworth, 82 Conn. App. 710, 714-715, 846 A.2d 923 (2004). Freedom to criticize public officials and expose their wrongdoing is at the core of First Amendment values, even if the conduct is motivated by personal pique or resentment. Barrett v. Harrington, 130 F.3d 246, 264 (6th Cir.1997); Mezibov v. Allen, 411 F.3d 712, 726 (6th Cir.2005). Fraud upon the court has occurred in every appeal that Holkesvig filed. Based on the fact that every District Court Judge and all ND Supreme Court Justices ignored not only their own misconduct, they ignored the defense lawyers misconduct in clear and obvious violation of N.D. Code Jud. Conduct 2.15. Feland failed to report it. This appeal must be vacated and remanded back to District Court for further proceedings, or alternatively, set aside and remanded back to District Court. Randy Holkesvig P.O.
