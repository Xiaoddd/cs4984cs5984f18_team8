Many Native Americans who have fought the 1,172-mile pipeline for months remain wary that it will ultimately be defeated. The pipeline is mostly completed in Iowa, Illinois, South Dakota and North Dakota. The Missouri River crossing in North Dakota is the only portion of the pipeline still lacking the necessary authorization for construction. There were some mixed signals Monday from protest leaders on what the Corps announcement means for the encampment, a makeshift city of teepees, huts and tents housing thousands along North Dakota's snow-covered hills. And they will not take the company's word for it. The Dakota Access pipeline is set to cross the Missouri River about one-half of a mile away from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Tribal leaders worry that a pipeline breach there could threaten their drinking water, as well as that of millions downstream. Tribal members have been joined by people from across the country who wanted to be part of the movement to stop oil infrastructure development and protect indigenous rights. And many aren't ready to leave all that behind. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

But the company's spokeswoman has previously argued that the pipeline will transport crude oil in a cheaper and safer manner than is currently possible. As blizzard conditions set in Monday, Funk and others continued building wood framing for winterized shelters at the camp, which is home to an array of services: kitchens, portable toilets, medic tents, a volunteer security force, a school and tents overflowing with donated supplies of tents, blankets and clothes. During the warm months, many camped in small tents. Most teepees, tents and huts have wood stoves or propane heaters. Highs are expected to remain in the single digits here this week, with sub-zero temperatures expected by Thursday, the National Weather Service reports. Dawne of a New Day DuShane, a member of the Sisseton Wahpeton tribe who lives in Oklahoma, said she plans to stay at the camp for at least a few more weeks to be in ceremony and give thanks. At Monday's daily water ceremony, she bowed her head as she grasped an eagle's feather and smudged burning cedar and sage. She said the prophecies of many tribes and faiths have foretold of a time like this. Funk said a volunteer building crew, which works out of a handmade construction shed on site, will continue building homes and shelters as long as people continue showing up.
