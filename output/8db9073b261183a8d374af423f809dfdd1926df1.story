Van Jones Begs Obama To Take Action On Standing Rock Friday, December 2, 2016 The running gag in Washington DC is if you want President Obama to care about an issue, disguise it as gay, transgender or refugee-related. Police turned water cannons on Native Americans in freezing temperatures as they protest an oil pipeline on their sacred land. Jones urged Americans to send a message to President Obama, who has until January to take action. How can this oil company access land that is supposed to be sacred without any consequences. If the oil company is successful, this opens doors for other companies to run thru sacred land belonging to Indian tribes. Typical NOLA oyeyemi808 Sandra it must be lonely being you. hi-liter I bet if it were a black shooter who shot McKnight, he would be locked up without bond. CapricornIce Damn I hope when Obama leaves office he gives us a check like Bush did. Fendi aka Erin Blockabitch Hey there. Fendi aka Erin Blockabitch This. 88 Hamites (Africans) Hate so called Negroes, Latinos and Native Indians. Remember they sold us to the Arabs and Europeans. E-VannaRootsAllEvil Wow just wow but the guy the shot will smith a few months ago got off. The whole situation is sad. Petty Patty Cakes Obama shut down their last attempt at a pipeline. Native Americans should never trust the US Government. It has reneged on pretty much every treaty it has made with these poor people. I have always been sensitive to their plight. Junkanoo Most democrats are too pro big business for my comfort. Van knows how corrupt both parties are , not sure how but Washington needs massive amounts of reform Petty Patty Cakes Kudos to Sandra. Today has been a good news day from the blinds on down. It so did Clinton so go figure. Alicia.Ashe Stop lying clown. nucynu25 THAT IS NOT TRUE . Cordell is still in jail on a 1.7 million bond . nucynu25 They only perform for an audience. Alicia.Ashe True. PrettyBrown28 The gag is true. You cannot get in your pro black pedestal, then go home and lay with a white woman each night which is what Van Jones does. This was back in September. I was elated to see a black man in the WH, but I and many other black folk knew it would be politics as usual. But I understand they frustrated. Scromes1212 Look at you. Scromes1212 I been studying both cases and the one major factor, imo, is race. This case is going to play out for awhile. What the President CAN do is cut the prison time served by some imprisoned pols like Kwame Kirkpatrick and Gov. Blagovich. They were allowed back today. Folks running down the mountains as the fire chased them. This is the second disaster in the state of TN in a weeks time. Get there if you can. Auto correct. Folks here in NC fux with Gatlinburg hard. A disenfranchised thing. They got treated just like the poor ass mountain folks they are. Not important enough to damn evacuate in a natural disaster. hotntot95 Hello. My cousin getting married NYE. My mom was like they going to Florida for their honeymoon now. The resort they supposed to stay at closed til further notice. Refund. I had no clue it was that bad. Wtf. Authorities say the victim invited Jasmine to his home, and Jasmine showed up with another woman and asked if her friend could use the restroom. The man let the two women inside and went upstairs to get his phone. A man described as 5 feet, 11 inches tall with a stocky build had a shotgun, while the second man had a handgun. The two men sexually assaulted the victim, robbed him and left his home. Alicia.Ashe Oh wow hi-liter I know right. CapricornIce Gay thugs. hi-liter Apparently, crazy. We want to stand up for Native Americans. Van Jones and his Becky wife can go jump off a mountain. They have their casinos and payday loans. Fukk off my comment spewing your hate. For the whole fukkin state. For everyone in that state to use. You genius. The lottery dollars only go but so far. Depends on it. For roads. Education. Lower tax rate. Shyt that impacts yes even blacks. The black folks in Memphis, Nashville and Chatt need that money Einstein. Hmmm. Ah well. And MSMS aint nothing for ignoring it. But race issues overshadow this, and we never seem to be able to come together to seek resolution. nucynu25 I agree with you to a certain degree .. I always say that we are the very 1st to support others when others would spit on us . Its a reason why we are the chosen ppl ..I also said earlier toda,y in the end it will not be just abt race( a social construct any way , not to go too deep but they hate us BC we are creators). It will come down to classism . The haves vs the have nots . Incog-knee-gress Exactly what I said Incog-knee-gress also said earlier today in the end it will not be just abt race( a social construct any way , not to go too deep but they hate us BC we are creators). Which to me is a form Classism. Social or economic. Rich whites will always follow the money. If black folk were to REALLY band together and boycott and make them lose money. Chile, laws will be written. Cops will be prosecuted. Politicians will be outchea marching WITH BLM. Incog-knee-gress Money is green. These are people with the same human rights and needs as yours. And most black folk are Native. I have and if you do, you will be enlightened. The rich whites want our money ..we are the minority but we have the ability to control the economy BC we spend the most . And I definitely agree we need yo get serious abt action fuk all that marching & forgiving ..hit them where it hurts . But still the poorest white will still have that priveledge but I do believe eventually they will see . your mate is other. You hate your black skin. Your nappy headed grandmother. Your greasy ass cousins. I cant. nucynu25 I told Carolina if she get another non black Gf . Smdh. We will always be expected to prove our worth Araminta Glissade Chaines She said it nucynu25 WE the worst spenders .. Araminta Glissade Chaines This is true. They knew exactly what they were doing when they bombed it. They knew exactly what they were doing when they bombed it. Incog-knee-gress Really in this climate folks be best to spend on necessities only. Bank remainder. To each tho. Incog-knee-gress Really in this climate folks be best to spend on necessities only.

Araminta Glissade Chaines My aunt and uncle worked their way out of debt completely in 3 years. They started with a journal. Wrote down everything. Even if they bought gum. Said that was the single most significant thing that helped them. Also, they did the envelope system. It works, but you have to be willing to sacrifice some stuff. Roderick2011 This sounds like the boxer who was set up and ended up in a gay porn. He just got got. I am open to any ideas sis.. Incog-knee-gress All this knowledge and folks still ignorant. Here is caption to that pic: The Longest Walk, 1978 Solidarity between African Americans and Native Americans grew with the Black Power movement of the 1970s, whose goals were closer to the nationalism espoused by American Indian Movement activists. Pictured here (left to right) are Muhammad Ali, Buffy St. Marie, Floyd Red Crow Westerman, Harold Smith, Stevie Wonder, Marlon Brando, Max Gail, Dick Gregory, Richie Havens, and David Amram at a concert at the end of the Longest Walk, a 3,600-mile protest march from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., in the name of Native rights. Lovezoe Budget. Dave Ramsey. Am going to try what Zoe said ..immediately . Cuz I have no idea. And even like the Amish. Only when black folk are separated is it called that. Those are the communities that I use as an example they are self sufficient, they create jobs not look for them .They focus on their communities & Dont look outside. Araminta Glissade Chaines Thank you Araminta Glissade Chaines Exactly what Zoe explained. It works, but you have to be strict. Like, once my aunt ate out one too many times in a week and had to count out change for gas. She was not going into her savings because she made that bad choice. We need to change something because it seems like white folk had a mtg and decided to just kill a black person every day. And you know I love your counterarguments. Incog-knee-gress We been helping them. They been present. In us. With us. Foh. Lovezoe We just finished FPU, when I say it works. Two CCs paid off, one loan, savings. Recommend. I mean my aunt and uncle are debt free, live in Japan, have a church and no financial worries. Chile, going to Tahiti for their 25th. We need to get ahead. Had a preemie and we decided it was best for me to stay home. It was tight. Take his class or at least read his books. Set a budget stick to it. Budget meetings. Cut out unnecessary. His daughter and Dub11 are currently hushing in that room. nucynu25 You are loved dearly ..I luv ya & sint Neva seen ya so I know those around you kuv ya petty ass. I need to pick up some wine. Incog-knee-gress And on my final note. This Orange bastard here. Teehee. Ok, my eyes heavy. Dub21 had a taste. Yummers. Ion live in Fayetteville. Or NC. Or the USA. B.Sweet has e-white privilege You do. You were supposed to pick everything up. Araminta Glissade Chaines Oh, well Dubb, yo house it is then. nucynu25 You need that d ..Dont be modest Incog-knee-gress Gn. I had a free dinner tonight. Just like my budget likes it. Must be my sign to go ahead and splurge tomorrow. Or bottom bunk in DubGirls room. B.Sweet has e-white privilege Nah. B.Sweet has e-white privilege The blacks live in the inner city. I might steal her backpack. I keep myself a gym rat even when my buttons can barely hold it together. MystyBlu I was lurking earlier when you said you were getting that BBD. MystyBlu I had school lunch pizza yesterday at my internship. One thing I miss about Jersey is NYC pizza spots. Me and faux boo separated. The really good places are closed. I could pick up Dubb and head downtown though. B.Sweet has e-white privilege We both need some ack right. He needs more than me. B.Sweet has e-white privilege Damn the diet. I have Indian in my family. Look at my hurr. I took a good two years off after I ended my engagement. Backslid with him a few times but I knew it was for the best. B.Sweet has e-white privilege Absolutely we all do. Congrats to you and the new boo. Sometimes you have to stay and fight. Only you know that. I wish you well. B.Sweet has e-white privilege You help her out. My old supervisor took me out tonight. Absolutely incredible. MystyBlu It IS a bit nippy here tonight. MystyBlu I had a grilled chicken spud. Was interesting. Ni Ni Exactly, they make me sick with that mess. He got his white woman, leave the issues to someone who really cares. Ni Ni I enjoyed that check too. I was a struggling college student. I have no complaints with Bush. Im up hungover and in pain CaliVirgo Yew need to roll up chile.. Carolina Blue I did. Idk why im hungover. I didnt even drink that much. Fell down 2 damn steps. Carolina Blue Lmao it was kind of something like that . I got no love from bae. She too busy laughing jussaying LOL get emmmm jussaying Congress (read Trump supporters & the like) have been trying to pass a bill that would basically make it illegal for nonviolent protests to take place which affect the economy. I.E. organized boycotts. like wtfff fluffi3 oh n o, i hope u r ok . . Michelle So says the negro who is married to a WHITE woman. He needs to shut up. Chicagowise I felt the same way. eeo osc mspb doj all know. it will be a total embarrassment to all agencies invovled who ignored every complaint, sat on files, and continue to do so. the new world order has been introduced, and trump will do his part as well. As long as you marry a humanoid you are entitled to have opinions on human rights. They re- routed the pipe line away. They are now protection that the pipe will contaminate the ground water. The pipe line a basically done. They only need now to turn it on. I have joined petitions to stop it. No one listens, especially the President of the United States. Its all about the money. Its all about the corporate dedication. Its all the same old story, time for a change, out with the old blocks, in with compassion. STOP THIS PIPELINE . MyndYaNeck Neanderthals are only part human. But then again according to their own science. Typical response from that type of Democrat. I know its coming from those types. Okay I was done with this faux freedom fighter when he got all upset calling it a whitewash because Trump won.
