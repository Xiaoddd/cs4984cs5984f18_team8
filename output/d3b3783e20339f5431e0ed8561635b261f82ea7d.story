By Phil McKenna and Cassi Alexandra Dec 13, 2016 Vanessa Red Bull, a medical provider at Standing Rock, told InsideClimate News that she won't leave the Dakota access pipeline protest camp until the last person leaves. Standing Rock Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II pleaded that they go home after a powerful blizzard blasted the camp last Monday, sending temperatures plunging well below zero. About 2,000 people remain in the camp, down from the nearly 5,000 who were there when the Army Corps announcement came. They are determined to keep their voices heard and stand guard as the political winds shift even stronger against them. They spoke of a resolve to stick together, to take care of each other, to remain vigilant until the fight is truly won. Despite the Army Corps' order for an environmental impact statement that could take months and may end in a reroute of the pipeline, Donald Trump has said when he takes office, he will ensure the pipeline gets built. Tepees and yurts better equipped to handle the winter appeared undisturbed, their wood stoves puffing a steady stream of smoke as snow and strong gusts gave way to bone-chilling cold. The harsh conditions provided reprieve from helicopters and unmarked planes that had been circling low over camp for months, air traffic some fear is the source of cyber attacks on their phones and other electronic devices. As temperatures dipped to minus 20 and another storm threatened to shut down roads for as much as a week, the fragility of the camp became clear. Tepees rely on firewood to stay warm but forests are hundreds of miles away. Historically, plains Indians sought refuge in wooded lowlands along rivers with an ample supply of firewood and shelter from the wind. Many such lowlands, like those along the Missouri River, have been flooded by dams like the one that forms Lake Oahe. Lee Plenty Wolf, an Oglala Lakota elder who had been in camp for months and provided refuge in his tepee to this ill-prepared reporter, conceded on Thursday morning that his group within the camp only had enough wood to last two to three days.
