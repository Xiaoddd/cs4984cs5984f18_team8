Not one week into 2015, on January 6, a ruptured pipeline leaked 3 million gallons of brine into two creeks near Williston, North Dakota. Less than two weeks later, on January 17 another ruptured pipeline sent 31,000 gallons of crude oil into the Yellowstone River near Glendive, Montana. In fact, significant spills bookended the year. Since late October, a leak at a natural gas storage facility in the Los Angeles suburb of Porter Ranch has been spewing out thousands of pounds of methane each hour. Sadly, there were plenty more incidents in the intervening months. Throughout 2015, we combed the news for reports of spills. Clean up of a 2006 spill of one million gallons of brine near Alexander, North Dakota, is still ongoing. Brine, which is many times saltier than ocean water and can be laced with heavy metals and fracking chemicals, can contaminate soil, poison vegetation, and kill aquatic life. January 14: Jackson, Mississippi A section of the Gulf South natural gas pipeline ruptured and exploded. The fire burned for an hour and a half, leaving an acre of scorched forest in its wake. No one was injured, but the blast knocked out the gas supply to 25 nearby homes. January 17: Glendive, Montana The Poplar Pipeline running beneath the Yellowstone River ruptured, spilling some 31,000 gallons of crude oil into the water. The state said the release affected a nearby stock dam. January 26: Brooke County, West Virginia An ethane pipeline exploded, shooting flames hundreds of feet into the air. The section of pipe that ruptured is part of the 1,265-mile Appalachia-to-Texas Express pipeline, which runs from the Marcellus Shale in Washington County, Pennsylvania, to Mont Belvieu, Texas. Eleven cars carrying ethanol fuel hopped the tracks and three caught fire. There were no injuries, but the area around the accident was evacuated as a precaution. Via Rail cancelled all passenger train service between Toronto and Winnipeg while the crash was cleared. The train and the track it was traveling on had both been inspected earlier that day. Between 200 and 300 people needed to evacuate their homes. Residents temporarily relied on trucked-in bottled water after a treatment plant closed amid worries that oil had leaked into the nearby Kanawha River. The plant reopened the day after the incident, but it instructed its 2,000 customers to boil water before drinking it. March 1: Peace River, Alberta A Murphy Oil Company pipeline leaked up to 17,000 barrels of petroleum product into a type of North American bog habitat called muskeg. Initial reports put the spill at 94 barrels, but the company later realized the leak was much, much larger. March 5: Galena, Illinois A 105-car BNSF Railway train carrying Bakken crude from North Dakota derailed near the Mississippi River. Twenty-one cars came off the tracks, and five caught fire. Residents within a mile radius of the crash site were evacuated. The train had unjacketed cars, which lack an insulated steel shell that provides thermal protection after derailment. March 7: Gogama, Ontario A 94-car Canadian National Railway train carrying Alberta crude oil derailed and burst into flames two miles northwest of the town of Gogama. Five of the 38 cars that hopped the tracks went into the Makami River, part of the Mattagami River System. Residents of Gogama and the Mattagami First Nation were advised to stay indoors and avoid drinking the water. Later testing of air and water quality found no problems. Early reports said the North Dakota Department of Health was conducting water quality testing and working with the trucking company on a remediation plan. The company shut down the pipeline and began a cleanup operation immediately. No injuries were reported, but the small town of Heimdal and a number of farms near the crash site were evacuated. No injuries were reported, but a tugboat reported an explosion and sustained unspecified damages, and a two-mile stretch of the river was closed indefinitely. The company shut two pipelines to identify the cause of the leak, and the evacuation order was lifted later in the day. July 10: Highland, Illinois A spill at the Plains All American Pipeline Pocahontas pump station sent 4,200 gallons of crude oil into Silver Creek, which empties into Silver Lake, the water reservoir for the city of Highland. The company placed protective booms to keep the oil from reaching the lake, and the EPA found no impact on the public water supply. Still, days later a class action lawsuit was filed against the company. Plains All American was also responsible for the May 19 Santa Barbara oil spill. July 10: Barwick, Ontario Fourteen cars of a CN train derailed, and one car leaked an estimated 12,000 gallons of petroleum distillates. Containment booms were put in place, and no injuries were reported. About 60 homes were evacuated. August 11: Shelby County, Missouri Enbridge Inc. shut off two crude oil pipelines after officials noticed a small leak of about 20 gallons. Both the 193,000-barrel-per-day Spearhead pipeline and the 600,000-barrel-per-day Flanagan South pipeline, which run from Illinois to Oklahoma, were taken out of service while crews looked for the source of the leak. August 14: Chateh, Alberta A NuVista Energy pipeline leaked an estimated 100,000 liters of bitumen emulsion onto the Hay Lake Indian Reserve. A helicopter crew discovered the spill during a daily aerial surveillance flight. September 19: Scotland, South Dakota A 98-car BNSF tanker train carrying ethanol derailed in a rural area, leaking the volatile liquid into pastureland, where it caught fire. No one was injured, and officials are still investigating what caused seven cars to leave the tracks. As of today, January 8, the well is still spewing the potent greenhouse gas, and SoCalGas estimates it will be February or March before they can contain the leak. Nearby residents are reporting symptoms including headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Though the cars bore the CSX logo, the company says its employees were not involved in the incident. There were no injuries, and crews used a backhoe to remove the tons of coal from the overturned cars. November 7: Alma, Wisconsin Twenty-five cars of a BNSF train went off the tracks near the Mississippi River, the third derailment within the Upper Mississippi Wildlife Refuge in a span of nine months. Five of the derailed cars leaked as much as 20,000 gallons of ethanol into the water. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources concluded that the spill was not harmful to aquatic life. Thirteen cars jumped the tracks and one was punctured, leaking about 1,000 gallons of product. Officials contained and siphoned off the spill before it could reach waterways. No injuries were reported, but some 35 nearby homes were evacuated. The railway put the residents up in hotels for the night. November 9: Des Moines County, Iowa Two engines and 19 loaded coal cars derailed and overturned when a freight train struck a road grader on the tracks. The driver of the road grader was taken to the hospital. December 1: Watford City, North Dakota A pump leak at a disposal well owned by Wyoming-based True Oil LLC spilled 17,640 gallons of brine, an unwanted by-product of oil production. The company says the brine was contained and recovered at the site. onEarth provides reporting and analysis about environmental science, policy, and culture.
