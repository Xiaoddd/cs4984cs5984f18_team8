Today, at a press conference, Dayton was asked about the criticism and doubled down on his criticism of North Dakota. Chris Berg has the audio. I think it was unwise. They sent out a request of all 50 states just to try to pull other states into this and make it a broader political dispute than what they already had. First things first, North Dakota was not in any way asking the State of Minnesota to help pay for the protest response. All states who send personnel and resources have been or will be reimbursed in full. At the peak of the protests there were more than 10,000 activists in south central North Dakota. Over the course of months these protesters committed hundreds of crimes ranging from trespassing to property damage which can be measured in the millions of dollars. Our state simply did not have the resources to respond to the protests while continuing to provide route law enforcement services. Like it or not, the Dakota Access Pipeline was and is today a legal infrastructure project. It has been approved by the proper policymakers and regulators, and those decisions have been repeatedly upheld by the courts. Dayton has claimed that his handling of EMAC requests from North Dakota was not political. I hope that changes soon.
