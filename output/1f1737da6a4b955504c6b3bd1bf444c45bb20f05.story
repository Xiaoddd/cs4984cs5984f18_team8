Over the previous two years, the campaign had spiraled into violence. Honduran security forces shot and killed several demonstrators. Two major international backers pulled out of the project under worldwide pressure. The police had already removed her body by the time he arrived. At that moment, the attackers kicked their way inside and fired four shots at her at close range. One gunman then entered the guest bedroom and fired on Castro. The bullet tore through his hand and took off part of his ear. He fell to the ground and lay still, playing dead. Then the assassins left. Last year alone, 185 were slain in 16 countries, the highest annual death toll on record. Between 2010 and 2015, 109 Honduran activists were killed. Few of the murderers are ever caught, and their crimes are becoming more brazen. In August 2013, three indigenous activists in one small community, Locomapa, in northern Honduras, were mowed down at a roadblock as they protested illegal mining and logging. Matters have grown considerably worse, Kyte and others say, since a 2009 coup ousted President Manuel Zelaya, a left-leaning populist and wealthy businessman. The three right-wing governments that followed have rolled back land-reform initiatives and pushed hard for the expansion of mining, agribusiness, and large-scale energy projects. They have them scared to death. A motorcycle cop and a soldier guarded her concrete house and small garden, which was roped off with crime-scene tape marked POLICIA NACIONAL. I walked around to the rear and noticed a gaping frame where the back door had been; investigators had removed it to examine a muddy print made by a military boot. It was easy to imagine the killers creeping silently in the darkness across the open field behind her home. Three miles away, I found her older brother, Gustavo, at the family home in central La Esperanza, a single-story structure hidden from the street by a curtain of bamboo and palms and guarded by another motorcycle cop. As a girl, Berta had accompanied her mother, a midwife who later became a Honduran congresswoman, into impoverished Lenca villages, helping deliver babies by candlelight. He remembers sneaking with her past armed guards and occupying a lumber mill in the 1990s, then joining her on a three-month protest in front of the presidential palace in Tegucigalpa that ended only when police tear-gassed the demonstrators. Trouble began almost immediately. Then, in 2011, Sinohydro moved in heavy equipment and built an access road to the river through Lenca fields. But the environmental impact would be minimal, the backers insisted. There would be no reservoir. No flooding. Fish species would be protected. By 2012, tensions had escalated. According to complaints filed in local courts, DESA employees stampeded cattle through crop fields in a failed scheme to ruin them and force their owners to sell. The violence, however, continued. Santos Dominguez escaped with serious wounds to her hands and face. A few hours later she was dead. They call frequently to check up on each other, change their routines often, and rarely spend any time alone. Her supporters filled the streets of Tegucigalpa and La Esperanza. All four men are in prison awaiting trial. He, like the others, is in custody awaiting trial. The shores of Yojoa Lake are dotted with low-budget gringo resorts. Shirtless campesinos sweat in the heat as they nail together crude wooden frames. Children wander around broken-down cars eating maize porridge cooked on portable gas stoves. But the mayor allegedly claimed the land for himself. Then he returned home. At 11:30 a.m., he got into his truck to deliver a load of scrap to a nearby junkyard. His wife noticed a red pickup with two men in it parked across the street. Ordinarily, the killers would back off after taking down their chosen target, but this time the threats continued. But as with so many killings in Honduras, the true motive may never be known. Again, this was a version of events that the National Commission for Human Rights discounted. His wife will never come back here. She wants to leave the country, become a refugee. The paved highway, running southwest, took us back in the direction of La Esperanza and then veered off into Lenca backcountry. After an hour, the road disintegrated into a rough dirt track, and we switchbacked for two hours through hills thick with pine and oak. In the wide valley far below, a mosaic of maize, bean, and coffee plots, broken by clusters of houses and groves of palms, extended toward the pale blue silhouettes of distant mountains. The meeting was just starting when I arrived. A grizzled septuagenarian described how DESA had bulldozed roads through farms. An elderly woman in black accused the company of murder. A Lenca grandmother in her sixties advised me not to go by myself. During a February 2016 protest march along this road, she told me, DESA had sent up drones to monitor and photograph the participants. She pointed to a compound of green-roofed wooden huts in a meadow, the road-construction camp that the Chinese had abandoned. Farther down the hill, we clambered over the debris from a landslide unleashed by the road construction and heard the thundering of the river a hundred feet below. Another turn brought the Gualcarque River into view: a foaming green ribbon cutting through a chasm. I heard the shouts of kids splashing in the water and then reached the riverbank. A few dozen yards upstream, whitewater cascaded over a course of boulders, then squeezed through a channel formed by two jagged outcroppings and widened into a shallow pool. All through the past winter, two sharpshooters had stood watch from the top of the cliff with their rifles aimed at Lenca swimming in the river. Finally, COPINH activists stormed the plateau and set fire to the grass, driving out the snipers. Downstream I noticed a yellow hunk of machinery, six feet high by ten feet long, that resembled a giant oilcan. The activists had captured it during their assault of the sharpshooter post and rolled it down the slope. I dove into the pool and took in the jungled hills rising sharply above the river, the white gravel banks, and the olive green water frothing through the gorge. This sublime place surely deserved to remain untouched, I thought. And it appeared likely that it would. Shortly after the investigative commission visited San Francisco de Ojuera, the Dutch bank announced that its engagement with DESA was over. Pressure was now mounting on that institution as well, from international human rights organizations, the European Union, and other groups. But in her home country of Honduras, where more than 100 activists have been cut down in the past five years, it was business as usual. Over the previous two years, the campaign had spiraled into violence. Honduran security forces shot and killed several demonstrators. Two major international backers pulled out of the project under worldwide pressure. The police had already removed her body by the time he arrived. At that moment, the attackers kicked their way inside and fired four shots at her at close range. One gunman then entered the guest bedroom and fired on Castro. The bullet tore through his hand and took off part of his ear. He fell to the ground and lay still, playing dead. Then the assassins left. Castro went and cradled her in his arms. Moments later she died. At least 767 people died in conflicts against extractive industries and poachers between 2010 and 2015, according to the London watchdog group Global Witness. Last year alone, 185 were slain in 16 countries, the highest annual death toll on record. Almost a third of those 767 killings took place in Brazil, earning the vast South American nation a dubious distinction as the most lethal place on earth to be an environmentalist. Between 2010 and 2015, 109 Honduran activists were killed. Few of the murderers are ever caught, and their crimes are becoming more brazen. In August 2013, three indigenous activists in one small community, Locomapa, in northern Honduras, were mowed down at a roadblock as they protested illegal mining and logging. He also claims that 19 security guards have been killed since 2010 and that a Dinant field technician was tortured and assassinated. Mexican environmentalist Gustavo Castro Soto. Meanwhile, poorly funded, poorly trained, and corrupt public prosecutors fail to investigate the crimes. Matters have grown considerably worse, Kyte and others say, since a 2009 coup ousted President Manuel Zelaya, a left-leaning populist and wealthy businessman. The three right-wing governments that followed have rolled back land-reform initiatives and pushed hard for the expansion of mining, agribusiness, and large-scale energy projects. Not every clash in Honduras is clear-cut, however. They have them scared to death. A motorcycle cop and a soldier guarded her concrete house and small garden, which was roped off with crime-scene tape marked POLICIA NACIONAL. I walked around to the rear and noticed a gaping frame where the back door had been; investigators had removed it to examine a muddy print made by a military boot. It was easy to imagine the killers creeping silently in the darkness across the open field behind her home. The development had been virtually deserted and the house unguarded when the assassins arrived. Three miles away, I found her older brother, Gustavo, at the family home in central La Esperanza, a single-story structure hidden from the street by a curtain of bamboo and palms and guarded by another motorcycle cop. As a girl, Berta had accompanied her mother, a midwife who later became a Honduran congresswoman, into impoverished Lenca villages, helping deliver babies by candlelight. Together they organized resistance to timber companies harvesting trees from Lenca forests near La Esperanza. He remembers sneaking with her past armed guards and occupying a lumber mill in the 1990s, then joining her on a three-month protest in front of the presidential palace in Tegucigalpa that ended only when police tear-gassed the demonstrators. The project would be bankrolled by the Central American Bank for Economic Integration and constructed by the giant Chinese corporation Sinohydro. Trouble began almost immediately. Then, in 2011, Sinohydro moved in heavy equipment and built an access road to the river through Lenca fields. But the environmental impact would be minimal, the backers insisted. There would be no reservoir. No flooding. Fish species would be protected. Critics of the movement say that the anti-dam activists relied heavily on intimidation, branding anyone in favor a stooge. By 2012, tensions had escalated. According to complaints filed in local courts, DESA employees stampeded cattle through crop fields in a failed scheme to ruin them and force their owners to sell. They began prohibiting the Lenca from using the river along a several-mile stretch. After she spent eight hours in court, the charges against her were dismissed for insufficient evidence. Still, the campaign seemed to be working. In August 2013, Sinohydro pulled out of what had become a highly controversial project, stalling construction. The violence, however, continued. Santos Dominguez escaped with serious wounds to her hands and face. It was the second machete attack that her husband, Roque Dominguez, had survived in less than a year. Proposed site of the Agua Zarca dam. (Goldman Environmental Prize) At the same time, her situation at home became more precarious. A few hours later she was dead. They call frequently to check up on each other, change their routines often, and rarely spend any time alone. Her supporters filled the streets of Tegucigalpa and La Esperanza. All four men are in prison awaiting trial. It soon became apparent that the alleged conspiracy reached even higher. He, like the others, is in custody awaiting trial. Many thought that such a high-profile murder would drive other guns for hire to ground. For all its reputation as a homicidal hellhole, Honduras has long been a magnet for backpackers and other adventurers, drawn to natural treasures like Roatan Island, which sits on the second-longest barrier reef in the world, and archaeological sites like Copan, perhaps the greatest existing example of Maya civilization. The shores of Yojoa Lake are dotted with low-budget gringo resorts. Shirtless campesinos sweat in the heat as they nail together crude wooden frames. Children wander around broken-down cars eating maize porridge cooked on portable gas stoves. But the mayor allegedly claimed the land for himself. The 80 remaining Lenca families were now squatting on adjacent public land. Then he returned home. At 11:30 a.m., he got into his truck to deliver a load of scrap to a nearby junkyard. His wife noticed a red pickup with two men in it parked across the street. Ordinarily, the killers would back off after taking down their chosen target, but this time the threats continued. He too is awaiting trial. But as with so many killings in Honduras, the true motive may never be known. Again, this was a version of events that the National Commission for Human Rights discounted.

The paved highway, running southwest, took us back in the direction of La Esperanza and then veered off into Lenca backcountry. After an hour, the road disintegrated into a rough dirt track, and we switchbacked for two hours through hills thick with pine and oak. In the wide valley far below, a mosaic of maize, bean, and coffee plots, broken by clusters of houses and groves of palms, extended toward the pale blue silhouettes of distant mountains. I was traveling to the river for a long-anticipated meeting that seemed likely to determine the future of the dam. Now FMO was dispatching an investigative commission to San Francisco de Ojuera, the site of the access road to the river. The meeting was just starting when I arrived. A grizzled septuagenarian described how DESA had bulldozed roads through farms. An elderly woman in black accused the company of murder. When the meeting broke up, I set out down the gravel road to the Gualcarque River. A Lenca grandmother in her sixties advised me not to go by myself. During a February 2016 protest march along this road, she told me, DESA had sent up drones to monitor and photograph the participants. We walked downhill past pine groves and pastures. She pointed to a compound of green-roofed wooden huts in a meadow, the road-construction camp that the Chinese had abandoned. Farther down the hill, we clambered over the debris from a landslide unleashed by the road construction and heard the thundering of the river a hundred feet below. Another turn brought the Gualcarque River into view: a foaming green ribbon cutting through a chasm. I heard the shouts of kids splashing in the water and then reached the riverbank. A few dozen yards upstream, whitewater cascaded over a course of boulders, then squeezed through a channel formed by two jagged outcroppings and widened into a shallow pool. After the 2013 violence, DESA had retreated to the opposite side of the river; the company was waiting for tensions to ease so that it could resume construction. All through the past winter, two sharpshooters had stood watch from the top of the cliff with their rifles aimed at Lenca swimming in the river. Finally, COPINH activists stormed the plateau and set fire to the grass, driving out the snipers. Downstream I noticed a yellow hunk of machinery, six feet high by ten feet long, that resembled a giant oilcan. The activists had captured it during their assault of the sharpshooter post and rolled it down the slope. It now sat cockeyed in a pool of water, just before the river gained force again as it hurtled down a steep gradient. I dove into the pool and took in the jungled hills rising sharply above the river, the white gravel banks, and the olive green water frothing through the gorge. This sublime place surely deserved to remain untouched, I thought. And it appeared likely that it would. Shortly after the investigative commission visited San Francisco de Ojuera, the Dutch bank announced that its engagement with DESA was over. Pressure was now mounting on that institution as well, from international human rights organizations, the European Union, and other groups. I climbed out of the river, dried myself in the sun, and then, trying to tamp down my nervousness, began the long climb along the deserted, Chinese-built road to my car. That sentence has been restored.
