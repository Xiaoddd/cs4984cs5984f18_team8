Both were taken into custody immediately after being sentenced. I witnessed the judge find a 64 year old woman guilty when all she did was stand there. They handcuffed her while I cried thinking of all my Standing Rock families...and how all we wanted was clean water. Another young man was also sentenced to jail time. The courts had no shame in how they treated us. The outcome of most cases to date involve unsupervised probation and the erasure of charges after one year. Although the prosecution did not recommend jail time, Judge Merrick insisted on it. He also ordered Redway and Simon be taken into custody immediately, despite requests for a turn-in date which would allow them time to get their affairs in order. To date, the vast majority have been dismissed for lack of evidence. However, the defendants on trial this week were among those recharged by the State after their original charges were dismissed. Neither have prior convictions. They were doing the right thing. Freshet prioritizes Indigenous water protectors.
