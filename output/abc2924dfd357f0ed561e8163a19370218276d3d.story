Under the Obama administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said the project needed an environmental-impact review. Now, the Corps has reversed course. Robinson Meyer Feb 1, 2017 On January 2, 2017, protesters rally against the Dakota Access Pipeline in a march behind the 128th Rose Parade in Pasadena, California. Specifically, at the direction of the acting secretary of the army, the Corps will permit the pipeline to be built under Lake Oahe in North Dakota. It will not remove the last legal hurdle, however. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said Tuesday that it would sue to block the pipeline if the Corps follows through on their announcement. Some kind of environmental-impact review for the Dakota Access pipeline is required by the National Environmental Policy Act, a federal law passed under President Nixon. Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the pipeline, has not issued a statement. The apparent reversal continues the saga over the project, which has become a rallying point for Native civil rights and a deepening crisis for federal rule of law. He has never offered evidence he has divested himself of it. The Dakota Access pipeline is a proposed 1,100-mile conduit that will connect the oil fields of North Dakota to the ports and refineries of southern Illinois. But it also crosses Lake Oahe, a federal waterway and a major reservoir of the Missouri River. The Standing Rock Sioux reservation is west of Lake Oahe, and they depend on it as a water source. Since the spring, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has argued that neither Energy Transfer Partners nor the Army Corps of Engineers told the tribe about plans for the project, as the law requires. The Army Corps of Engineers used a national permit designed for wetland areas to approve the pipeline, meaning that the project never got a full environmental-impact review. The tribe and the Army Corps of Engineers tussled over whether this was legal throughout the summer. Three months later, in early December, the Army Corps of Engineers announced that it had made a mistake. The Dakota Access pipeline would get a two-year environmental-impact review after all. The army now appears to be fulfilling that command. The Army Corps appears to not yet have formally issued the easement allowing the construction. Instead, two different congressmen from the state said that the acting secretary for the army informed them that he will order the easement. Throughout the process, legal experts have stressed that if the president follows proper procedure, he has relatively little power to change the fate of the pipeline. After the Corps announced that the pipeline would get a full environmental review, they stressed this point. Now that seems to be exactly what has happened. Under President Obama, the Army Corps of Engineers decided it needed to give the pipeline an environmental-impact review; under President Trump, it immediately ruled the opposite. At some point, politics contravened legal responsibility in this case. Americans might want to know when that happened. We want to hear what you think about this article.
