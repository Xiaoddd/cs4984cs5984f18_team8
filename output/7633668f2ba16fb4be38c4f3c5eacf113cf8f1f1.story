It causes them to overrate performers that they can remember. Tatanka was recently added to the alumni section of WWE.com. Pretty soon, there will be a handful of fans who will bring up his name as a possible inductee into the hall of fame. Plus, it's a scripted accomplishment and not an actual competition. The North Carolina native also had a stint with the Million Dollar Corporation, but he was far from being a standout performer like how the Rock was with the Nation of Domination. At times, he was in the shadows of Ted DiBiase himself. During his second stint with WWE, Tatanka was of little significance. He was a lower-level performer who was not given steady time on television or pay-per-view events. In terms of championships, Tatanka has the USWA Heavyweight Championship and Stampede North American Heavyweight Championship on his resume. However, most fans are unaware of either of those reigns. Some may overrate him because of his real-life background as a Native American. His contributions to the industry don't come anywhere near what was accomplished by Wahoo McDaniel, a legitimate legend in the business. Tatanka had a good career. It was much better than most guys that step foot into the ring. However, that doesn't mean that he's a candidate for the WWE Hall of Fame. Good does not equal great.
