We need your help to achieve this goal. We plan to have various Water Protectors and Activists from various Organizations travel with us to help in the Fight to protect the Water, the Land and the People. Help us to protect the water protectors from them. They have been using rubber bullets, tear gas, water hoses in freezing temperatures and concussion grenades. A 13 year old child was shot in the face with a rubber bullet and a water protectors from New York City may end up losing her arm due to a concussion grenade that was thrown at her. Donate Today to help us get out to Standing Rock to help the Water Protectors and to bring much needed supplies and gear they need. Please try again. Sign in to track your impact.
