The four-state pipeline would cross the Missouri River about a half mile from the reservation and pass through Lake Oahe, an important water source for the community. Construction of the pipeline is continuing despite the tribe's concerns, and two viral tweets suggest a double standard in the fight over the pipeline. The Bismarck Tribune reported in August that an early proposal for the DAPL planned to cross the Missouri river north of Bismarck, North Dakota instead of near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The U.S. Corps of Army Engineers evaluated the plan and found that the route was too close to Bismarck's well water supply and the homes in the community. The route through Bismarck would have also been 11 miles longer, and passed through more roads and wetlands. In September of 2014 the plan was changed to put the pipeline near the reservation instead, and the Corps issued a permit for that plan, according to the Tribune. The Corps decided that the risk to reservation's water supply was low. But the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe says their water would be in danger. All Rights Reserved.
