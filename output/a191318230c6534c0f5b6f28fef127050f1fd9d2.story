The one scrap of good news was that the spill did not reach a body of water, and TransCanada claims to have contained the oil. However, Vice News has spoken with a local activist who claims to have worked alongside TransCanada. He points out that the spill contained spilled an especially dense type of crude oil. Because dilbit is so thick (akin to peanut butter), pipeline companies must dilute it in order to transport it. So, official numbers (whenever they arrive) could be so much than previously estimated. As of now, the portion of the Keystone pipeline that runs from Alberta to Oklahoma and Illinois remains closed while news of the spill jacked crude oil prices higher. An update on the permit is expected within the next week.
