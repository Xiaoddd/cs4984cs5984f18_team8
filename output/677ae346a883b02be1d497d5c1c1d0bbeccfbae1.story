See, Grumpy is actually from North Dakota. North Dakota was where GP learned to tie his shoes at age 6, about 7 months after everyone else had learned. Not even a beer can get them untangled. Having grown up in North Dakota, Grumpy Pastor learned something early on about the place. Many natives have a rough time whenever they are off the reservation, whether it is living or visiting. This is the reason why so much of the news and social media argument about the Dakota Access Pipeline and the protests of it are so off base. News reporting and Facebook comments care about facts of who is right and who is wrong, and which side is justified. Therein lies the problem. Yes. Yes. That is true too. And if you are one of the police officers who sprayed water at protestors in freezing temperatures, or one of the protestors who tossed a Molotov cocktail at the police, Grumpy Pastor feels sorry for you. Inflicting violence upon other human beings means your heart is in a very dark and lonely place. Mrs. GP earned her chops in North Dakota too and understands all of the subtext there. Law enforcement is in the same boat, and will inflict their winning on anyone to maintain a rule of law. Sometimes giving up and losing is the way to actually win. Losing your life can take up many different ways and forms. Unfortunately, neither side will give anything. And that will be their undoing. The only solution that can fix anything is that of the human heart. Couldn't have any better my self. Of course not, there are bad people everywhere but we have to remember there are more good people and sometimes that's hard to see. You only notice the toddler having a crying fit in the store what you don't notice is the 100 other people not having a fit. Unfortunately this is where our freedoms afforded by law clash with our human nature. Good stuff Lyle. It is a discouraging place, nearly as damaging to the human spirit as Middle Eastern refugee camps. The people there are hospitable and kind showing all of the human qualities we admire, and the same weaknesses we perceive in others while missing the logs in our own eyes. We also have a retirement investment in a North Dakota company (not in oil) very much tied to the ND economy. We are conflicted and are not making much public noise on the pipeline issue. Pastor, your homily here with direct reference to Jesus's word is spot on and cuts to the quick. Horse trading where everyone gets something beats the warpath. This should include replacing large numbers of substandard school facilities on reservations, and manning them with dedicated, teachers, preferably with Native roots. Even more meaningful would be a moonshot type expenditure tackling the roots of human addiction which ravages the Rez in Spades. The Church has a big role here as addiction has spiritual as well as medically accessible causes. Jesus's imperative is not symmetric. GP, your exegesis gets at this. We shouldn't expect full reciprocity for generous good-faith offers to those with whom we disagree. In the first place our offer might not be as fair as we think. Also being reasonable and flexible is almost never wrong; and it leads to the necessary balm of mutual respect from which friendship grows. -GP Reply Leave a Reply.
