That is all that remains of the White House's webpage on climate change, at least at the official White House page. The Obama team moved Information about climate change previously hosted on the White House site to www.obamawhitehouse.gov. The White House website was updated immediately after Donald Trump assumed the nation's highest office. The president has long said he doubts whether global climate change is real, and there now appears to be no reference to it on whitehouse.gov. Under former President Barack Obama, the website previously hosted sections that laid out plans for combating climate change and steps the Obama administration had already taken. The policy page touts Trump's plan to tap oil and gas reserves and to revive the coal industry, but does not mention renewable energy. We want to hear from you. All Rights Reserved.
