Learn more about this opportunity. The Dakota Access Pipeline is an underground oil pipeline from northwest North Dakota to southern Illinois. The Meskwaki, Standing Rock Sioux and the Cheyenne River Sioux tribes have opposed the project, saying it threatens their water supply and tribal burial grounds. While the Obama administration had withheld permission for the project, President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum advancing its approval. The Army Corps of Engineers has since granted Dakota Access the easement to cross federally-owned land, saying the project is safe and will not affect water quality.
