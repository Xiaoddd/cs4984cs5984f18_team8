Fossil fuels are in most everything we use each day. As the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association explain it, Fossil fuels are used to fuel cars and airplanes, power electricity plants, and heat our homes. As you can see, they are an intricate part of our economy, including coffee. And so this is where the rubber (also made from fossil fuels) hits the road. Everything from the production of the coffee container in the break room to the supply chain management system that is needed to move coffee product from one location to another requires energy, and that energy derives from fossil fuels, i.e., coffee production and the transportation system. Matter of fact, the coffee maker itself probably contains parts made from fossil fuels. He has also contributed to the Iowa State Daily and Our Black News. The reason why we now now want to divest from fossil fuels, is to tell the industry that we actually want a choice for alternatives that are not so destructive for the environment and communities. Yes, it is possible, but the grip of some very greedy companies are putting profit over the health and well-being of people and the environment. First, thanks for taking the time to read my article and comment. I appreciate it. Fossil fuels are possible because of science and engineering, i.e., chemistry and chemical engineering. I hope you take the time to reply to these questions. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and what you think we ought to expect from our policy makers. account.
