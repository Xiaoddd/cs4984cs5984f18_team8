If this book was designed to scare the holy shite out of people, it certainly has succeeded. Boom. We have just spent hundreds of thousands of tax-payer dollars trying to tear-gas them, harass them, arrest them, pepper-spray them and shoot rubber bullets at them. Or not. Thank goodness for the Standing Rock Sioux. Like it or not, they are protecting us. They are standing in place instead of us. They are bravely standing in front of a hurricane of climate-death and are doing it in our name. I propose another way to thank the Standing Rock Sioux. How about Thanksgiving dinner in front of the US Congress or the White House. We should honor these protestors instead of bombing them with tear gas and attacking them with dogs. Probably us.
