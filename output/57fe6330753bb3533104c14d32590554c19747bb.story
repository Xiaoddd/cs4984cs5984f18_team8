Last summer, members joined the Standing Rock Sioux in their battle to protect water, sacred burial grounds, and legal rights which were threatened by the Dakota Access Pipeline and the fossil fuel industry. Alongside the Chumash elders, members created a resolution, delivered speeches, and passed the resolution with the help of Councilmember Cathy Murillo and Mayor Helene Schneider on Nov. 1, 2016. Currently, Divest SB is trying to reach the next part of the process. They are asking the city to divest from banks that fund DAPL and want to create a Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) policy. This would provide for social and environmental criteria when bank contracts are considered. Divest SB uses Bank Exits to target companies like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, Union Bank, and other local banks because they are connected to the Dakota Access Pipeline. The organization is working hard to circulate an endorsement letter and signatures from other groups to back the city divestment. Further, they are working to schedule meetings with council members. Divest SB asks the public to write letters to individual city council members about the cruciality of divestment. Feldmann also believes that indigenous people have been actively and unfairly ignored and marginalized. In her opinion, there is insufficient consultation around the use of native land. This is why Divest SB supports that indigenous people need to be included in any decisions that impact their land, lives, and culture. Over the next summer, Divest SB hopes to have a website that provides easy access to upcoming resources and campaigns.
