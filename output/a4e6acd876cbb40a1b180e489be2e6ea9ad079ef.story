The spill, which was detected Monday, has sent an unknown volume of crude oil into the Ash Coulee Creek.

The pipeline had originally been slated to cross the Missouri River north of Bismarck; the water protectors at Standing Rock contend that the pipeline was rerouted due to concerns that a spill could taint the water supply of communities in and around Bismarck, which is predominantly white. The rerouted pipeline would instead cross the Missouri River under Lake Oahe, a reservoir and the primary supply of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux. It is equally unsafe for the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux. Proponents of pipeline projects often argue that pipelines are a safer way to transport oil than by rail.
