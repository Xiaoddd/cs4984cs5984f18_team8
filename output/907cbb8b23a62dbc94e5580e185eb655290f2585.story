But her impending defeat in the Electoral College comes with familiar signs that the election was stripped and flipped. Were this election held in any other country, the US State Department and independent monitors from around the world would denounce it as a fraud, and contemplate international intervention. The Electoral College Much is finally being said about the Electoral College, with new popular demands for its abolition. Clinton is about to become the sixth presidential candidate to win a traditional majority but lose the presidency. It also happened in 1800, 1824, 1876, 1888 and 2000. we joined the multitudes throughout our history in calling for the EC's abolition: It will take a Constitutional Amendment, and a hell of a lot of work, to abolish this corrupt anachronism. But unless we want to see an endless succession of George W. Bushes in the White House, something better be done -- and quick. The consequences of inaction are all too clear. Computerized Jim Crow Stripping of Voter Registration Rolls US history has been defined throughout by a divide-and-conquer strategy of racial manipulation. From the foundation of the Republic, this disenfranchisement has defined the balance of power. In recent years, the disenfranchisement has been most importantly done by the Republican Party, and by computer. The pretext was alleged felony convictions. As we have reported from Columbus, in 2004 more than 300,000 predominantly urban citizens were stripped from the voter registration rolls in an election the GOP won by 118,775. A quarter of all voters in heavily Democratic Cleveland were de-registered. Ohio's ill-got electoral votes gave George W. Bush a second term. This became the only time in US history an entire state's Electoral College delegation was challenged on the floor of the US Congress. This year, Palast has reported that a new program called Crosscheck has been used by some 30 GOP Secretaries of State to strip more than 1.1 million predominantly black, Hispanic, Islamic and Asian-American citizens from the voter rolls. Originating with far-right Republican Kris Kobach, Kansas's Secretary of State, Crosscheck eliminated more than enough minority voters in at least three swing states to flip the entire presidential election. Palast has reported Ohio's GOP Secretary of State Jon Husted also used Crosscheck to eliminate some 497,000 mostly black, Latino and African-American citizens from the voter rolls in Ohio, falsely accusing them of registering in more than one state. Such eliminations went on throughout the US and may have involved more than a million legitimate voters. According to Reuters, over the past five years Husted himself stripped some two million citizens from the voter rolls in Ohio without Crosscheck, with Democratic areas twice as likely to be striped as Republicans. Reuters points out that the neighborhoods that most heavily backed President Obama lost the most voters. (JUNE 2, 2016, USE IT OR LOSE IT; OCCASIONAL OHIO VOTERS MAY BE SHUT OUT IN NOVEMBER, Reuters, June 2, 2016). The mass disenfranchisement also impacted races for the US Senate. At least four Democrats would likely have won seats (in Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Missouri) that they officially lost (www.tdmsresearch.com. Similar results are evident from 2014 Senate races in North Carolina, Colorado and Alaska. Thus in the past two years, mass disenfranchisement and computerized vote stripping may well have stripped seven Upper House seats from the Democrats to the GOP. Thus the electronic race-based stripping of voter rolls in the GOP's favor has probably on its own taken to the far right the presidency, control of the US Senate and ultimately the US Supreme Court. In its 2013 Shelby County vs. Holder decision, the US Supreme Court gutted protections provided by the 1965 Voting Rights Act, opening the floodgates for Jim Crow abuse throughout the electoral system. Numerous reports indicate that citizens were often confronted with photo ID requirements even where they were voided by the courts. As in Ohio 2004, reports indicate many citizens were directed by official websites to polling places that did not actually exist. This year Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted failed to distribute more than 1,050,000 absentee ballot applications to citizens entitled to them. On Election Day, media throughout the US reported the kinds of mass delays and confusion that defined the elections of 2000 and 2004. Fourteen states put in new voting restrictions including some states that were never under federal supervision like Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin. But the forms are often impossibly complex, with poll workers often failing to count them at the sight of a single minor error, such as writing below a line, omitting a middle initial, failing to include a birthday and much more. Ohio Secretary of State Husted won the right from the US Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to not count prevision ballots that contain a minor mistake. Thus tens of thousands of provisional ballots are thus routinely left uncounted, unbeknownst to the voters. Polling Indicators In the lead-up to November 8, pre-election polls strongly indicated a Clinton victory. Post-Election exit polls showed her winning as well, most critically in the swing states whose Electoral College votes could give her the presidency. Exit polls are the accepted international standard for indications of election fraud and vote tampering. Their work, done under the auspices of Democracy International for the US Agency for International Development (USAID), outlines how exit polling is used to ensure free and fair elections. Here the 2016 exit polls were paid for by a major corporate media consortium, as has been standard practice for years. This makes fraudulent elections appear legitimate. During this year's Republican primaries, unadjusted exit polls confirmed official vote counts in all cases. In the Democratic primaries, unadjusted exit polls significantly varied from the official outcome in 12 of 26 primaries. All the errors went in Hillary Clinton's favor in her race against Bernie Sanders. This is a virtual statistical impossibility and suggests a rigged vote count. In the general election against Donald Trump, things went the other way. In 24 of 28 states, unadjusted exit polls also showed Clinton with vote counts significantly higher than the final official outcome. The likelihood of this happening in an election that is not rigged are in the realm of virtual statistical impossibility. This unexplained and unexpected 8.5 percent shift for Trump is mathematically impossible. (see chart below) The exit polls also showed Clinton winning in Florida. But an unaccounted for 2.5 percent shift to Trump gave him a statistical long-shot victory that might occur in one of every 167 presidential elections. In North Carolina, the odds that Trump won are one in 186,938,411. Given the prevalence of other Jim Crow tactics, it's likely the exit polls were impacted by non-white voters in all the key swing states who were given provisional ballots (or they voted electronically) leading them to believe their votes were being counted, even though they were not. In key Senate races in Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Missouri, exit polls also showed Democratic candidates winning by statistically significant margins, but then losing the official vote count. In 2014, Senate races in North Carolina, Colorado and Alaska ended with exit polls also showing Democratic Senate candidates winning the popular vote, while ultimately losing the official vote count. The odds against this happening in two consecutive elections that are not rigged are also astronomical. (see chart below) Electronic Flipping The vast majority of the popular votes in this election nationwide were cast on either computerized touch-screen electronic machines, or on scantron ballots that are counted by computer. In neither case are there public monitoring capabilities or legal recourse for vote counts that are flipped. In 2016, as in all previous US elections at least since 2000, the electronic vote count remains anyone's guess. In states with a governor and Secretary of State from the same party, the final tally can be whatever they want it to be. Such techniques were used in Florida 2000 and Ohio 2004 to strip voter rolls and flip George W. Bush into the White House. This caused a Fox News commentator John Ellis (who was Bush's first cousin) to call the election for George W. Bush. Then the electronic vote count ceased. All of this was done by private contractors working for the company SmarTech, based in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The key information technology specialist in charge of the vote count was Michael Connell, an Akron-based associate of the Bush family, who was hired by the Ohio Secretary of state with a no-bid contract to supervise the state's official vote count. Connell later died in a mysterious plane crash after being deposed in federal court. The fact that electronic voting machines cannot be monitored was voted a Most Censored story in 2016 with a key interview appearing on Amy Goodman's DEMOCRACY NOW. The manipulation could be done by Secretaries of State in conjunction with partisan for-profit corporations in ways that are virtually impossible to detect, and simply not open to legal challenge. In Ohio this year, a new generation of electronic vote scanning machines makes it possible to retrieve electronic images of ballots that have been cast on paper in the order that they were cast. These machines come with an audit log that would detect any illegitimate vote changes by central tabulators. Co-author Bob Fitrakis sued in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, to have the monitoring functions turned on. But Judge David Cain ruled on Election Day that the election officials need not turn on those security features. While in the US this year voter turnout dropped to a 20-year low of 55 percent, Wisconsin, which has Election Day registration, experienced an 82.74 percent statewide turnout. However, Dr. Richard Hayes Phillips found five municipalities in Wisconsin that had 100 percent voter turnout, or more. In 80 more municipalities in Wisconsin, voter turnout topped 90 percent or higher. Throughout the US, including the swing states that will decide the presidential outcome in the Electoral College, and in those that have increased the GOP margin in the US Senate, the entire vote count remains an electronic mystery. Millions of dollars would be required to do meaningful recounts in states like Wisconsin, which may well have legitimately gone for Clinton and chosen a Democratic US Senator. Let's count the ways: There is no doubt that Hillary Clinton won America's popular vote by more than a million votes. That popular vote victory will be reversed in an Electoral College originally designed to enhance the power of slaveowners, now being used for the sixth time to deny the White House to the rightful winner. There is no doubt that more than enough black, Hispanic, Islamic and Asian-Americans were electronically stripped from the voter registration rolls by Crosscheck and other means to have given Clinton victories in those swing states that would have swung the Electoral College in her favor. There is no doubt exit polls showed her winning in more than enough states to have given her a victory in the Electoral College. There is no doubt that the election was largely conducted on electronic machines, and with electronically counted scantron ballots, that are completely beyond public accountability. These voting machines are run on secret corporate proprietary software to which the public is not allowed access. As in 2000 and 2004, the actual final vote count once again resides in black box machines controlled by GOP governors and Secretaries of State whose easy ability to hack and flip the official outcome cannot be monitored or brought to accountability. There is also no doubt that had this election been conducted as it was in virtually any other country, the civilized world would have denounced it as completely unreliable and almost certainly false. He continually warned of innumerable non-whites and Muslims voting multiple times for Hillary Clinton. Of course the opposite happened. Hundreds of thousands of non-white citizens were systematically denied their right to vote. Since even that wasn't enough to elect Donald Trump, the Electoral College will once again deny democracy. And thanks to the dark magic of electronic voting machines, we will never really know 2016's true vote count. Today's most tangible tragedy is what may soon unfold in this country. But the underlying nightmare is that this has been done before. That we've known about stripped and flipped elections for at least sixteen years. And that nothing has been done. If anything, due to the spread of electronic voting machines, our electoral system is more corrupt and less accountable than it was in 2000, when the GOP first stripped and flipped George W. Bush into the White House. We advocate universal automatic voter registration, transparent voter rolls, a four-day national holiday for voting, universal hand-counted paper ballots, abolition of the Electoral College, an end to gerrymandering, a ban on corporate money in politics. There's much more. is our chance to survive on this planet. Bob's FITRAKIS FILES and Harvey's AMERICA AT THE BRINK OF REBIRTH also abide.

The charts are a preliminary draft subject to revision as the data comes in. They simply did not exercise their right to vote. They forfeited their voice. It's amazing that those who claim voter fraud does not exist in and appreciable numbers to argue against voter I.D., are now claiming rampant voter manipulation. The bottom line is that Hillary Clinton lost the election to Donald Trump because she got less electoral votes. They are the rules agreed upon before the election, and both candidates strategized and put resources in play accordingly. Ironically, electing a president by popular vote would open up the opportunities and motivation for fraud significantly, as polling stations heavily dominated by one party could be tough to properly patrol. Also, the rewards would be much greater for fraud. Polls are not votes. The candidates in this election were both so unappealing and polarizing that it is very likely voters gave inaccurate responses to the pollsters. So the leach states that received more federal money than contributed voted for Trump (exception was New Mexico) The states that sent out more tax money to the federal government than received from the federal voted for Hillary (exception was Kansas). Now if you were talk about leach (leech) people, as individuals, I think it would be a different story, in terms of voters. The fraud is the GOP. It seems pretty clear they can only win by cheating. I feel sorry for you Trump supporters. Even rats have enough sense to flee a sinking ship. Trump is out to destroy you and still you hang on to him like he's your only hope. The irony is, Clinton would have done FAR more for you to help you than Trump ever planned on doing. It's a shame none of you were smart enough to see that.
