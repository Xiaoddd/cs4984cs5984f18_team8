Now, if you are not prepared to do that, we do have an agenda that we must follow. Today, the City of Seattle took an unprecedented stand against unethical banking practices by unanimously passing the Socially Responsible Banking Ordinance. The move sends a clear and powerful message that the people of Seattle expect our money to reflect and uphold our values. They can absorb some losses and afford lengthy court proceedings that those with little or no capital cannot. Without access to the same level of funding, we must use many different strategies to even the playing field, like direct action and media pressure. But our most effective weapon against well-moneyed opposition is divestment. In other words, when businesses or institutions show that they do not speak for us, that they do not value us, or that they are willing to put profits ahead of people and the planet, then we do not give them one dime. We must make it painful for institutions that elect to harm Native communities in the interest of the Dakota Access Pipeline. There are 17 banks that directly finance the pipeline construction by Dakota Access LLC. Seven of them also provide significant lines of credit to parent companies Energy Transfer Partners, Energy Transfer Equity, and Sunoco Logistics. Divesting from these institutions is more important than ever now that Donald Trump has signed an Executive Action to continue construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. This Executive Action will be challenged in court, but that will be a costly, drawn-out process. And even then there are no guarantees that the courts will side with the will of the people. The financial backing of the Dakota Access pipeline is, of course, just one of the many reasons to cut financial ties with major institutions such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, US Bank, JP Morgan Chase and Citibank. These corporations have a history of predatory lending practices and fabrication of personal bank accounts. For many of us in Seattle, however, financing DAPL was the final straw. City and Municipality Divestment The Seattle City Council was only recently introduced to the notion of divestment by Matt Remle (Hunkpapa) of Last Real Indians and Seattle City Councilwoman Kshama Sawant. Aided by the urging of local organizers and amplified by national movements like the Injustice Boycott, the ordinance was passed within a matter of weeks. This was no small victory. It was proof that collective economic protests work, and that we should use them to hold big business and our public representatives accountable. For Native people and their allies, divesting from unethical institutions like Wells Fargo is only one step in our multi-faceted fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline, We must band together to be successful against such well-moneyed, politically connected opposition. Lobby your representatives to take taxpayer money out of the hands of those who value their profits over our communities. Money talks.
