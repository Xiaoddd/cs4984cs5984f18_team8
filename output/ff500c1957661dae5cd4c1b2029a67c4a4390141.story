Published here. Bill Gates has also crossed the threshold of picking his very own governor for North Dakota as of November 8th, 2016. Burgum's fortune was made when Microsoft purchased his software company for a little over a billion. -Yes. -But there is. That's your connection. Gates funded him more than the oil companies. At this point there's just no justification for retaining that sort of privilege, after all, you took the money. The Joshua Tree itself is dead, BTW, as are the Joshua Trees. The truth is fitting. May they join the ether as opposed to ending up buried alongside U2's ethics. The problem was that the humanitarian appeals were on results of human suffering and root causes for terrorism that were directly consequent of policy enactments of who they instructed you to vote for, making the whole process a very calculated disassociation of conscience from the perpetrator they tried to manipulate you into voting for. The problem is not that they told you how to vote. The problem is that they deliberately disassociated you from her direct policy results in doing so, because to vote for her is to act in complete conflict with their humanitarian statements (it is a state of cognitive dissonance to uncritically accept the humanitarian need of these situations and wish to solve them and yet endorse their architect, giving her the power to perpetuate more of the same). This issue has nothing to do with the present danger of the opposing candidate. So they've already created a cross-over situation in which they use their official band page for great utility raising money for RED using themselves, which is financial extraction designed to exploit the desire of the fan base. Quite honestly the band can be accused of flogging these contests as much or more than any other subject, season depending. (For this run I have seven different posts, and I didn't include all of them. This is the affliction you'll receive for being a fan. Nor were any of the many celebrities that put themselves up for the sake of the meet and greet contests for RED, December 2016. Here are all the truly sordid questions they blithely ignored and avoided with this arbitrage. They are not small matters. All of the questions are substantiated with the substantiation hyperlinked under the question. It is obvious due to the scant nature of the sourcing in places that some were of their nature genuine questions. Others must indicate the basis for their having to be asked. Those are also genuine. I did miss one Question, however. As for those Gates Foundation Questions, you might find yourself floored. As a result there were 24 questions this time 'round. As a separate query exercise, it also means some are a repetition and cross reference those prior substantiation pages, -but you'll be happy to know if you've been down this path before that I've added considerably to those. You will find something new, even in something so apparently innocuous as the name, Sacagawea. It may surprise you but beware, for opening each Question is akin to opening a nightmare.
