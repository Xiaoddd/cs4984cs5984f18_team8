Sitting Bull was a spiritual leader for the Lakota and called Standing Rock his home. Brenda is a courageous and humble leader just like her ancestor. On December 2nd Brenda, who has served 20 years in the military, walked across the Back Water Bridge near the Oceti Sakowin camp, and explained to North Dakota law enforcement and National Guard, that Water Protectors are just like those who served in the military: people who are protecting their families, human rights, and the land. We never knew that this was going happen in Hunkpapa Lakota Territory, and it happened for a reason because I believe that this was a place that our ancestors, Sitting Bull, Black Elk, spoke about.
