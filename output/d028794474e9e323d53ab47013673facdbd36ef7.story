Fallis is being held in custody due to the charge. A next court date was not set Monday. If convicted, she could face up to 10 years in prison. During the preliminary hearing, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Special Agent Derek Hill provided testimony based on reports from law enforcement involved in the arrest and a review of her criminal history. He was on scene that day but did not witness the arrest, he said. He said officers waited for her to separate from the group, then brought her behind the police line for arrest. It was during the arrest, as two officers tried to pin her down and force her into cuffs that she fired three shots from a gun in her left hand, Hill testified. He said the revolver removed from her hand had three spent casings and two live rounds in it. Officers also found two speed strips with six live rounds each in her pockets, he said. During the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney David Hagler also showed an online video of Fallis' arrest, which Hill said one of the arresting officers confirmed as taken of the incident. The video, which was shot from the protester side of the confrontation, shows a person being arrested behind the police line and three pops can be heard. Hill conceded that no gun is visible in the video. Fallis has a prior felony conviction for being an accessory to a crime in Colorado, Hill testified. He said the gun, which was at one point at a shop in Mobridge, S.D., is the product of interstate commerce. Both of those components, along with Fallis possessing the gun, would be necessary to prove the charge before a jury. Miller acknowledged that some of the evidence presented Monday was hearsay, which is allowed in a probable cause hearing but would not be allowed in a trial. He said he was able to make the finding even without the hearsay statements regarding what the defendant allegedly told officers. Joi asked. Fallis is being represented by Chris Bellmore, of the federal public defender's office. Miller said in court he was aware of fundraising for Fallis' defense and asked her to fill out a financial affidavit relating to funds she has, as she may need to hire her own attorney or contribute to the public defense costs. Fallis was previously charged in Morton County with attempted murder, but the charge was dropped when the federal case was filed in late November.
