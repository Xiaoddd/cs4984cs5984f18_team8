British Columbia is seeking control over increased levels of diluted bitumen coming into the province because of concerns of increased risk to the environment. Notley says her government will seek intervener status in the court proceedings and she expects B.C. will fail. She also says the legal move is illogical. She notes that B.C. wants control over more bitumen coming into the province via pipeline on environmental safety grounds, but is OK with current levels already coming in. In Calgary, United Conservative Leader Jason Kenney said the court reference is one more delay tactic in a pipeline project that is already on the edge of an abyss. The group said in a news release that the government of Canada now needs to exercise its Constitutional authority and move the project forward. Essentially, the BC gov't is asking for the power to unilaterally throttle our resources. McKenna released a letter that said the federal government will consider forming a joint scientific advisory panel with B.C. to take stock of the research available on oil spills, including current models of how to respond in the event of an incident involving a number of different petroleum products. In addition to asking the court to review proposed amendments to the Environmental Management Act that would give the province the authority to regulate the impacts of heavy oils, the province will also ask if federal legislation would override its changes to the law, he said. Eby said the reference case does not apply to oil tanker traffic, which the provincial government has said will increase seven-fold if the pipeline expansion is completed. Many environmental groups fear an increase in tanker traffic out of Burnaby along marine routes that are at times extremely narrow, compounds the risk of a major spill.
