Trouble will broadcast first-hand accounts and perspectives from organizers on the ground, with the aim of cutting through the fog of misinformation that often clouds our understanding of the world, and provoking people into taking bold, collective action. Statement from sub.Media: The emboldened right-wing is mobilizing to turn back collective gains won over years of struggle by the exploited and oppressed. Indigenous land defenders fighting to limit the ecological devastation of their territories by the energy industry are met with less-lethal bullets and mass arrests. Paranoia and confusion run rampant in an information landscape where facts are dismissed as fake news. Faced with a crisis of reality itself, millions have retreated into social media echo chambers, helping cement divisions between people with common cause and impeding the communication necessary to effect meaningful change. Against this prevailing pessimism and despair, anarchists and anti-fascists have burst back into the popular imagination. With capitalism in a profound state of crisis and transition, our alternative political visions and our consistent critiques of power are capturing the attention of disillusioned people all over the world. We hope this project can serve as a tool for provoking meaningful discussion and debate within our movements. Towards that end, Trouble is intended to be screened in group settings that foster affinity and collaboration, in hopes of helping to spark local and regional organizing initiatives.
