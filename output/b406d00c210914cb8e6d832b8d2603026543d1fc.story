(WJLA) - It was an emotional scene at Washington Dulles International Airport as a mother was reunited with her 5-year-old son after he had been detained Saturday night. The boy had been traveling with another family member on a flight and his mother, who is from Iran, had to wait for hours until he was released to her. At one point the mother was pleading with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe to get help to her son. Protests were held at airports nationwide in opposition to the travel ban.
