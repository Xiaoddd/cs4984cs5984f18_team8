The panels are one of 17 different green energy initiatives the SNGRDC is involved with. The Six Nations of the Grand River is already leading the country in renewable power projects, and is setting an example for its allies to follow. Solar panels at the Cayuga Grand Renewable Solar Project, a partnership between the Six Nations of the Grand River development Corporation and South Korean tech company Samsung. Seventy-seven wind turbines across Southwestern Ontario started turning out an estimated 230 megawatts of power. Article Continued Below The Six Nations development corporation owns half of it. Other alliance members are also following suit. That project went online in December. The Six Nations shift towards green energy projects started in 2009 when Ontario launched the Green Energy Act. The Grand Renewable Solar Farm in Haldimand County, outside of Hamilton, as seen from the air. But there was another challenge to overcome as well. To address that issue, the community also negotiated support to help it create a full-fledged development corporation so it could take a seat at the energy table, instead of sitting on the sidelines. Now, eight years on, one of the development corporations more modest projects, a 500-kilowatt rooftop solar installation at the Oneida Business Park in Ohsweken, Ontario, was just awarded Aboriginal Project of the year by the Ontario Sustainable Energy Association. The development corporation owns 90 per cent of it. The County of Brandt owns the other 10 per cent. For them, funding is the main constraint, Aleck said. The Tsleil-Waututh Nation is fundraising and taking donations for the solar project. It also owns a company that builds wind turbine equipment and is looking at projects like geothermal and harnessing the power of ocean tides. While the Grand Renewable solar and wind farm, and the other green projects that followed have been a boon for Six Nations, the political tide may be turning. In September 2016 Ontario Energy Minister Glenn Thibeault suspended plans for another round of solar, wind and hydro projects. For Jamieson, that highlights the importance of First Nations being prepared to take advantage of investment opportunities when the door is open.
