The Standing Rock Medic & Healer Council says 300 people were hurt in the attack, with the injuries including hypothermia from being sprayed by water cannons in subfreezing temperatures, seizures, loss of consciousness, and impaired vision as a result of being shot by a rubber bullet in the face. On Sunday night, Sophia Wilansky was evacuated and airlifted to a Minneapolis hospital after suffering a critical injury to her left arm. A warning to our TV audiences, these photos are graphic. This is Army veteran Brandi King of the Fort Belknap Reservation, who helped transport Sophia after she was injured. King served in the U.S. Army for eight years, including in a combat tour in Mosul, Iraq. She had shrapnel wounds. Her arm was split open. Her skin, her flesh was ripped off of her arm. Her bones were broke. WAYNE WILANSKY: She is resting. And she had a second surgery yesterday, so they could try to clean out the open wound. She still has an opening from her elbow to her wrist. My daughter is very clear about the fact that she was being shot at the time. And Instead of throwing them on the ground, they pulled the plug, held them for five seconds and threw them directly at her. So, yes, he pulled all the shrapnel out. At least one of the FBI agents was wearing a jacket from the Joint Terrorism Task Force. Eventually, I got to speak to a supervisor and learned that what they were looking for was her clothing. And I did eventually consent. I had taken her clothing back to my hotel room the night before, and I did consent to give them the clothing, eventually, after talking to the supervisors. They need to clear that bridge so that people can get to hospitals. The Army Corps of Engineers has asked them to stop. The Army Corps of Engineers has said that they were not going to issue a permit until after they did further environmental studies and spoke with the tribe, and yet they go ahead and set all the drills in place, and they continue. Number two is they have to demilitarize the police there. And this has to stop. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, I want to thank you very much for joining us from Minneapolis, Wayne Wilansky, father of 21-year-old activist Sophia Wilansky.
