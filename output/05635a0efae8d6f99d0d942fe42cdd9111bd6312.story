Environmental Society seeks public inquiry into Husky oil spill The Ministry of Economy said an early release of documents could result in media coverage and other public pressure for the government to impose penalties or make decisions before all of the information is considered. The ministry also indicated that release of records might interfere with a right to a fair trial if charges are ultimately laid. The government refused the request, which prompted the NDP to ask the privacy commissioner to weigh in. Kruzeniski said there would be nothing wrong with releasing factual information. He said good investigators would not be swayed by publicity and would base their conclusions on facts. The ministry also suggested that Husky might not co-operate with the investigation if the records are released. He said pipeline legislation requires license holders to provide information to the ministry upon request and the records existed before the investigation started on Aug. 15. Late Monday afternoon, the government said it will not release the information. Last month, Husky Energy (TSX:HSE) released its own report into the spill and said that shifting ground was to blame for the pipeline burst. The leak forced the cities of North Battleford, Prince Albert and Melfort to shut off their water intakes from the river and find other water sources for almost two months.
