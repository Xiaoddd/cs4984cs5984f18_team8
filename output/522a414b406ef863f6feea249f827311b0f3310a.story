To stay in power, he has reignited a dormant civil conflict, stoked ultranationalist violence, allowed extremist movements to flourish, orchestrated military incursions into two neighboring countries, and shredded the rule of law. Those of us who witnessed illiberal populist movements take hold in Turkey, Russia, Hungary, Poland, the Philippines, and elsewhere are watching the election of Donald Trump with a particularly acute sense of foreboding. With this difference: unlike the United States, none of these countries have ever stood out as a beacon of liberty. But this is exactly the wrong conclusion to draw. Below are some hard-earned lessons from countries that have been overrun by the contemporary wave of illiberal democracy. They could be essential for preserving the American republic in the dark years to come. Autocrats almost always turn out worse than they seem before coming to power. A presidential candidate who has uncontrollable fits of rage over perceived slights from a former beauty queen is likely to use every resource available to him to hound his enemies. In the United States, those powers are formidable indeed, ranging from a nuclear arsenal to the boundless surveillance powers of the NSA. Now that he controls the most powerful office in the land, expect them to be fully servile. If you trust in freedom of expression to expose the autocratic machinations of a Trump administration, think again. Autocrats understand that freedom of expression is fragile, and seek to stifle it by hook or by crook. It does not take much for the deleterious chilling effect of such measures to take hold. That, after all, is how he fueled the birther movement that in turn made him into a political force. Time to use the F-word Progressives err in assuming that the worst danger of a Trump presidency is the reversal of Obama legacy, including the Affordable Care Act, the vindication of the constitutional rights of LGBTQ people, the Iran deal, and progress on climate change. There will surely be an all-out assault on these achievements. But it would a grave mistake to see the obliteration of the progressive policy agenda as the chief danger of a Trump presidency. What we confront is not the usual dogfight between liberals and conservatives. It is a struggle between those who believe in preserving the imperfect but serviceable constitutional system of the republic, and those who will try to undermine it. For all his abhorrent policy positions, a President Cruz could have been counted on to observe the strictures of constitutional democracy, such as the peaceful alternation of power through free and fair elections. Trump gives us every reason to suspect that he will not. What we therefore have to prepare to resist is not policy change; it is regime change. A single cataclysmic event, such as a major terror attack, could hasten this slide. Americans from all across the political spectrum who believe in constitutional democracy must unite to resist it. Protest early and often The experience of Russia and Turkey suggest that the only democratic, nonviolent practice capable of deterring the autocrats is the sight of endless crowds marching: vociferous, tenacious, disciplined citizens claiming ownership over their constitutional liberties and defending the integrity of their political institutions. In the short term, both movements failed to defang the authoritarian regimes they challenged, not because mass protests were the wrong strategy but because the brutal force commanded by a consolidated authoritarian regime makes it very difficult for such movements to succeed. This is why it is essential to protest early and often. Citizens of consolidated democracies have absorbed a genteel lesson: if our side loses, we wait our turn until the next election. When those in power are poised to destroy constitutional safeguards, however, hanging on in quiet desperation until the next election can be fatal to democracy. Instead, Americans must tap into their rich and proud tradition of civic resistance, whose highlights are the twentieth-century civil rights movement and protests against the Vietnam War. Civic action needs to begin now. We must claim public squares before Trump takes office, marching in droves and communicating a clear message that his brand of autocracy shall not pass. Nationwide gatherings take time to organize, but rallies and vigils must become regular events in cities and university campuses across the land. As recent waves of popular mobilization, from Tahrir Square to Gezi Park, have shown, social media enables masses to converge on short notice. Millennials excel at this kind of thing. However, closed-circuit, feel-good moping on social media can never substitute for warm bodies on streets that refuse to be dispersed or intimidated. As concerned citizens, we must coordinate with our families, friends, colleagues, students, neighbors, and congregants, making couches available, giving rides, providing childcare, covering work shifts, and cooking meals for one another to amplify an effective civic presence. Find strange bedfellows Thanks in part to their control over the media, the Russian and Turkish governments persuaded the larger public that the protesters were godless vandals, foreign agents, and marginal types. To combat such a smear campaign, citizens and community leaders must be willing to look past the ideological differences that divide them. These differences have been rendered irrelevant, at least for the moment, by the overriding danger presented by the Trump presidency. The good news is that it is easier to unite around opposition to despotism than it is to set out an alternative vision of how government must be run. Be peaceful and resolute Trump will use the militarized force of U.S. law enforcement against protesters on the ground, and will seek to discredit them in the public eye. Above all, let us not forget that Trump rode to power on the back of public rallies fueled by protest against political power. The only thing that can arrest the lawless momentum of a Trump regime is the hair of the dog: wave after wave of loud, proud, and peaceful citizens rejecting the hate, vilification, lawlessness, and division for which he stands. Many Americans have still to discover that nothing boosts civic morale and solidarity like a massive public protest. The act of standing together in a public space and affirming our shared values and our respect for one another is a transformative experience, one that could release the still largely untapped political potential of millennials. In contrast to the Trump rallies in which racist, sexist, and Islamophobic obscenities were chanted by thousands, peaceful mass demonstrations are in order to enact the resilience of American democracy and the inclusive and affirmative ideals for which it stands. The vast majority of Americans who still affirm these ideals need just such an antidote, and they need it now. N. Turkuler Isiksel is James P.

Actually almost opposite to each other. After World War I, their lands were divided up between Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey. The situation is worse in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey, where the Kurds are a minority people subjected to ethnically targeted violations of human rights. After the first Gulf War, the UN sought to establish a safe haven in parts of Kurdistan, and the United States and UK set up a no-fly zone. In 2003, the Kurdish peshmerga sided with the U.S.-led coalition against Saddam Hussein. In 2005, after a long struggle with Baghdad, the Iraqi Kurds won constitutional recognition of their autonomous region, and the Kurdistan Regional Government has since signed oil contracts with a number of Western oil companies as well as with Turkey. Iraqi Kurdistan has two main political parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), both clan-based and patriarchal. The policy has included forced population transfers; a ban on use of the Kurdish language, costume, music, festivals, and names; and extreme repression of any attempt at resistance. Large revolts were suppressed in 1925, 1930, and 1938, and the repression escalated with the formation of the PKK as a national liberation party, resulting in civil war in the Kurdish region from 1984 to 1999. Syria: Kurds make up perhaps 15 percent of the population and live mostly in the northeastern part of Syria. In 1962, after Syria was declared an Arab republic, a large number of Kurds were stripped of their citizenship and declared aliens, which made it impossible for them to get an education, jobs, or any public benefits. Their land was given to Arabs. The PYD was founded in 2003 and immediately banned; its members were jailed and murdered, and a Kurdish uprising in Qamishli was met with severe military violence by the regime. When the uprising against Bashar al Assad began as part of the Arab Spring, Kurds participated, but after 2012, when they captured Kobani from the Syrian army, they withdrew most of their energy from the war against Assad in order to set up a liberated area. The Kurds in turn cite examples of discrimination against them within the opposition. We recommend moving this block and the preceding CSS link to the HEAD of your HTML file.
