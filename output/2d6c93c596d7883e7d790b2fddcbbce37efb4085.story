Mayor Gregor Robertson says Ottawa can expect more protests if the expansion is approved. Kinder Morgan protest draws huge crowd in Vancouver Kinder Morgan opposition from Liberal MP applauded Ahead of Trans Mountain pipeline ruling, Canada says it wants Asia exports Listen to The House Speaking to reporters on Tuesday about the impact of a Trump presidency on Canada's pipeline plans, Carr said the Keystone XL project is no longer a priority for the federal government. From there, it can be exported to China and other oil-thirsty markets in Asia. The federal cabinet has until Dec. 19 to decide whether to approve the expansion, which would triple the pipeline's existing capacity to 890,000 barrels per day. In November 2014, more than 100 people were arrested on Burnaby Mountain after they prevented crews from carrying out drilling and survey work related to the project. - Ian Anderson, Kinder Morgan Canada president Both Kinder Morgan and local law enforcement officials are already gearing up for another round of protests. Pipeline approval process criticized as a 'sham' Robertson maintains that a wholesale review of the project is required. Robertson believes the board failed to consider scientific evidence highlighting the project's risks, as well as the consequences a potential oil spill could have on the region's ecology and economy. The panel released its report earlier this month, raising questions as to how the expansion would square with other federal commitments on climate change and Canada's relationship with Indigenous people.
