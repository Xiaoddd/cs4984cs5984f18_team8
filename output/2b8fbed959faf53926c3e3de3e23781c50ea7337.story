We realize that these conversations can be difficult as there are many perspectives, privileges, and needs we all possess. At the same time, the organizers believe that it is imperative to have these conversations (in as many places as possible) to begin the transformational process of individual understanding, growth, and our ability to create change. Organizers acknowledge the complexity and multitude of diversity issues and that we do not have all the answers. To guide us along our journey, we invited four well-known speakers from the region that offer unique perspectives on diversity.

Speakers will be facilitating post keynote dialogues on creating an action plan. A keynote designed specifically on developing a diversity action plan for you as an individual. The entire conference structure is based on speakers and attendees sharing their own personal stories and not just lecture. Breakout dialogue sessions on issues concerning the current political arena, Black Lives Matter, as well as issues concerning GLBTQ. To reduce costs, attendees can request a Host Family to stay with for free. In addition to hearing from our expert panel of speakers, participants will have a structured dialogue facilitated by the speakers. Afterwards, participants will have the opportunity to create an action plan to take back to their respective campus or organization.

During the simulation, participants role-play the lives of low-income families, from single parents caring for their children to senior citizens trying to maintain self-sufficiency on Social Security. The task of each family is to provide food, shelter, and other basic necessities while interacting with various community resources such as a pawn shop, Community Action Agency, community health agency, and much more. The goal of the simulation is to enable participants to view poverty from different angles in an experiential setting. Participants will begin to understand what life is like with a shortage of money and an abundance of stress and become motivated to be part of the solution to ending poverty in the United States. I only had to experience this for about two hours and by the second week, I was ready to give up. This is a first come first serve basis for the first 80 registrants. Cost is included in the conference registration. The Memorial Union has continually been remodeled to keep up with the growth of the student body, and services change to meet students'needs. Operational funding is provided in part by student activity fees. Beginning in 2005, the Memorial Union underwent a large construction project. The building was re-dedicated on Tuesday, October 2, 2007. Due to the nature of the Critical Conversations Conference and the hope that more stories can be told and voices to be heard, several student affairs staff have volunteered to serve as host families. There is no cost to stay with a host family during the conference. It started as a normal college football game in Neyland Stadium. If anything, the event was an afterthought, dropped into the schedule at the last minute. For Inky Johnson, though, the game changed everything. A routine tackle turned into a life-threatening injury, and nothing has been normal for Inky ever since. Not with a paralyzed right arm. Not with daily pain. Not with constant physical challenges. His dream had always been to play professional sports. You might think his injury would have destroyed his motivation and crushed his spirit. He could be described as the survivor of an underprivileged past. He could be described as a refugee of poverty and violence. He could be described as a success story stained by tragedy. In contrast, inspiration affects people from within, giving them the ability to accomplish what would otherwise be impossible. Through his walk and his talk, Inky embodies and imparts a truly inspirational message. He devotes much of his time to mentoring athletes and underprivileged youth. He joined the NDSU faculty in the fall of 2014. He is Professor and Director of the Tribal Indigenous Studies program at North Dakota State University. Strand lectures and leads workshops extensively with engagements all over the globe. In 2014, Strand was awarded a two-year Bush Foundation Fellowship. With this award he will focus on the potential of functional design to facilitate cross-cultural communication and understanding in political and social spheres extending from his home state of North Dakota to international locations such as Brazil, China, South Africa and Europe. In 2013, Strand was awarded the Alumni Achievement Award for the Hixon-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts at his graduate school alma mater, The University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Currently, Aida serves as the Director of the Lealtad-Suzuki Center at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Her scholarly work focuses on academic bullying, Latina identity, and doctoral education. As a community activist, organizer and mother, Aida is a member of the Saint Paul Integration Task Force that is critically looking at the role of public education in our Democracy, interrogating the idea of what makes an educated person, and centering the experiences of black, brown and low income children. In addition, she is deeply involved with the Saint Paul Federation of Teachers and their fight for equity and wealth re-distribution. Because freedom is a constant struggle, Aida is deeply committed to critical dialogues, community empowerment and complicated solutions.
