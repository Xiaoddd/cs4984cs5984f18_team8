Baltimore company proposes another pipeline to Eastern Shore By Delaware Business Now - February 23, 2018 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Image from Delmarva Pipeline. A Baltimore company is proposing a pipeline that would run near the Maryland-Delaware line and serve customers on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia. The pipeline would start in Rising Sun, MD. Delmarva Pipeline Company is developing the project, which aims to provide service to areas and residents, who have been without access to natural gas. Completion of the project is targeted for delivery in late 2020 or early 2021. The company made no mention of service to Delaware. Advertisement Proposed delivery points may include but not limited to Cecil, Kent, Queen Anne, Caroline, Dorchester, Wicomico, Somerset, and Worchester counties in Maryland, and Accomack County in Virginia. The Eastern Shore has been traditionally served by Dover-based Chesapeake Utilities, which has been beefing up its pipeline system to handle increased demand for natural gas. Chesapeake now has service in Cecil County and a private gas utility has long operated in Elkton under various owners. A Chesapeake subsidiary operates a pipeline system, primarily on the Delaware side of the state line Gas production has been increasing in the Marcellus fields in Pennsylvania through the process of hydraulic fracturing or fracking. Gas costs have fallen, leading companies and residents to convert to the fuel. The area is also seeing new natural gas-fired power plants near Rising Sun and near Dover, DE.
