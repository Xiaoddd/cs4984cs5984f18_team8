The stretch is the final big chunk of work on the 1,200-mile pipeline that would carry North Dakota oil through the Dakotas and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. Tribal members urged the Seattle council to send a broader message to oppose the pipeline and stand with indigenous people. Environmental activists across the country have called on a number of banks to stop financing the construction of the oil pipeline as well as on individuals to pull their money out of those banks. Wells Fargo has said it is one of 17 involved in financing the pipeline and that it is obligated by carry out its credit agreement.

In the wake of that scandal, California and Illinois announced they would suspend some business relationships with the bank. All Rights Reserved.
