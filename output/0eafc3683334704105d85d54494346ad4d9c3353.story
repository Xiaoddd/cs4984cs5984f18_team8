The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) is a United States independent federal regulatory agency within the Department of the Interior. The commission is the only federal agency focused solely on the regulation of gambling, though it has many counterpart state and tribal regulatory agencies. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior also have responsibilities related to gaming and Indian gaming, respectively. The commission is an independent regulatory agency, but works closely with the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior on matters of game classification and Indian lands questions. Thus, its independence has some practical limits related to cooperation with Executive Branch agencies. The chair is appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate. The Secretary of the Interior appoints the other two commissioners. Under the act, at least two of the three commissioners must be enrolled members of a federally recognized Indian tribe, and no more than two members may be of the same political party. The first chairman of the NIGC was Tony Hope. President Barack Obama appointed the first woman to chair the commission, Tracie L. Stevens, a member of the Tulalip Tribes of Washington. Chaudhuri is a member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. The commission also has a general counsel, who supervises the legal staff and advises the commission on its work. The first general counsel was Michael Cox. The second general counsel was Barry W. Brandon. The third was Kevin K. Washburn, who later served as Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs at the Department of the Interior. The fourth general counsel was Lawrence Roberts, who left the commission to become a deputy assistant secretary at the Department of the Interior. The act provides a regulatory framework to shield Indian gaming from corruption, and to ensure that the games offered are fair and honest and that tribes are the primary beneficiaries of gaming operations. The act created the commission to protect tribal gaming as a means of generating revenue for tribal communities. IGRA placed the commission within the Department of the Interior (DOI), but also provided it with independent federal regulatory authority. The commission monitors tribal gaming activity, inspects gaming premises, conducts background investigations and audits of Class II gaming operations (and Class III gaming operations, upon request or as provided by applicable law, such as tribal gaming ordinances and tribal-state compacts). The commission also provides technical assistance and training to tribal gaming commissions and operations and, when appropriate, undertakes enforcement actions. The commission maintains its headquarters in Washington, D.C., and has seven regional offices and two satellite offices. The commission is divided into four separate divisions. Approximately half of the commission staff is assigned to headquarters in Washington, D.C., with the remaining staff assigned to regional offices located in Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California; Phoenix, Arizona; St. Paul, Minnesota; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Washington, D.C.; and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and satellite offices in Rapid City, South Dakota and Temecula, California. The field offices are vital to carrying out the statutory responsibilities of the commission. By having auditors and compliance officers close to tribal gaming facilities, the commission seeks to facilitate compliance with the act and better relationships with tribal leaders, officials and regulatory personnel. In addition to auditing and investigative activities, the field staff provides technical assistance and training to promote a better understanding of gaming controls within the regulated industry, and to enhance cooperation and compliance to ensure the integrity of gaming operations.
