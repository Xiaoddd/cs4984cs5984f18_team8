By Phil McKenna Construction workers work on a section of pipeline on July 25, 2013, outside Watford City, North Dakota. Oil began flowing through the controversial Dakota Access pipeline starting Thursday, but there is still no oil spill response plan in place for the section of pipe that crosses the Missouri River just upstream from the Standing Rock reservation. Advertisement The lack of rigorous safety measures for the crude oil pipeline is raising concerns from lawyers and pipeline consultants for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, whose protests and legal fight against the Dakota Access pipeline became a flashpoint for environmental justice and indigenous rights last year. Despite the prolonged resistance, the pipeline began operating Thursday, after President Donald Trump issued an order expediting its approval. Dakota Access LLC, the company building the pipeline, is required by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to submit a general emergency plan for the entire half-million-barrel-a-day project before oil shipments begin. But no deadline has been set for it to submit a more detailed plan for the controversial Missouri River crossing as required by the Army Corps of Engineers. Without a complete emergency response plan and no requirement to have response equipment in place for another year, a spill in the months ahead could cause tremendous environmental damage, pipeline safety experts say. asked Richard Kuprewicz, president of Accufacts Inc., a consulting firm that provides pipeline expertise for industry and other parties. The pipeline company filed a motion in federal court to keep the documents sealed, claiming they contained security-sensitive information. The pipeline crosses Lake Oahe half a mile upstream of the reservation. The plans were released as part of an ongoing lawsuit by the tribe against the company and the Army Corps seeking a more thorough environmental analysis of the pipeline. In addition to the lack of plans and equipment, Kuprewicz and other pipeline safety specialists said they are concerned that the company has underestimated the time it would take to respond to a spill and that it therefore has underestimated the volume of a worst-case scenario. Dakota Access has said its pipeline will be equipped with state-of-the-art leak detection sensors that would easily identify spills. It claims it could spot a leak within nine minutes and could shut down the leaking section of pipe within 12.9 minutes. Federal data has shown that leak detection systems do not provide as much protection as the public is led to believe. The company has underestimated the time it would take to respond to a spill, and it therefore has underestimated the volume of a worst-case scenario. Advertisement As the company begins shipping oil, other parts of the pipeline have already leaked. An above-ground station and a feeder line leaked more than 100 gallons of oil in North Dakota in March. The pipeline also leaked 84 gallons of oil at a pump station in South Dakota on April 4. Lisa Dillinger, a spokeswoman for Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of Dakota Access LLC, declined to respond to the specific concerns raised by Kuprewicz and others. While Dakota Access is not required to have its own emergency response equipment in place near the Missouri River until one year after operations begin, the company has listed contractors that it would work with to provide emergency response equipment and personnel in the event of a spill. So far, Dakota Access has produced two drafts of a detailed emergency response plan for the Lake Oahe crossing. A revised draft from March 2016 said the oil would be diverted to the opposite shore. Dakota Access would not say if it intends to produce a final plan. PHMSA officials would not say if it has been filed. The Army Corps did not set a deadline for the company to file the final version of the more detailed response plans for the Missouri River crossing as part of its granting of an easement. The U.S. Coast Guard, which regulates oil tankers and oil tanker loading facilities, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates oil refineries, require more detailed, site-specific emergency response plans than those required by PHMSA, said Paul Blackburn, a pipeline safety expert and attorney with Honor the Earth, a Native American environmental advocacy group. The sharpest contrast to the lax emergency response requirements for the oil pipeline perhaps are the oil spill response measures required for a small wind farm off Rhode Island that came online in December. The turbines require small amounts of lubrication grease and oil to keep the turbine blades spinning and generators producing electricity. Mineral oil is also used to insulate an electrical transformer within each turbine. The plan had to be approved before construction began by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the same agency overseeing the Dakota Access pipeline. The company also had to demonstrate that it had spill response equipment in place before the project began sending electricity to the mainland via a subsea cable. Pipeline companies routinely claim they can detect and isolate a spill within minutes, but the reality is often much different, Kuprewicz said. Approximately 1 million gallons of tar sands crude oil spilled during the leak, making it one of the worst inland spills in U.S. history. In just under 13 minutes, the pipeline would leak hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil. That worst-case figure was redacted in the spill model for Lake Oahe that was released by the court. But Blackburn estimated that a spill that took just 13 minutes to detect and shut off would leak approximately 630,000 to 903,000 gallons of oil. The 1-million-gallon Kalamazoo spill required 157,000 feet of boom, 43 boats and 79 vacuum trucks to divert and clean up the oil during the peak of cleanup operations. Top Comment Weird how everyone you quoted is either working for or aligned with the tribe on this issue. Almost like they might have an incentive to overstate risks. PHMSA has said it reviews and approves oil spill response plans in accordance with federal laws, and the agency is not involved in reviewing or approving the detailed response plan for the Lake Oahe crossing.
