There's a driving rainstorm at my end, so it's hard to hear him. We keep getting cut off: I assume the weather is affecting our cell connection, but Clark tells me all his phones are tapped. He may be right. Clark was raised around the military and loved his upbringing, but he says he and his famous and dad are diametrically opposed when it comes to his involvement with the cause of the Standing Rock Sioux. I always thought I was going to serve in the military. First, I was a lieutenant, and then I became a second lieutenant. I had a great experience. I loved the men I worked with. It is not until you are an officer that things become gray. I watched it all happen from 6th Avenue and 14th Street, and everyone I worked with died. I took that big long walk home north with everyone else that day. I had just gotten out of the service, and they could have called me back. If you go, you will see your friends die, and you may lose a limb yourself; maybe you will end up killing somebody. When you come home, you will realize you got used, and you will be angry and bitter. I listened, and I watched my friends go back in and get hurt and worse. My dad was right. He and I don't agree about my going to Standing Rock, but I'm going. We put up an event on Facebook with Michael Wood Jr., and we put out an order for veterans to join us at Standing Rock. I have been on the left and the right in this country; neither party is acting in the interest of the people of the United States. We have about eight years. When the Oglala Aquifer runs out of water, it's gone. If you bought a house in Florida or own any property at sea level, 25 feet or lower, by the time you're done paying off the mortgage, no one will insure the property. We will have a ceremony with the Sioux tribe on the morning of Dec. 5. Some members of Congress will be there, like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Then we'll have a press conference, and the rest of us will mobilize to execute the multiple contingency plans we have come up with. There is a waiting list of veterans who want to join the peacekeeping activities. We are out there to help, to do good and to put our bodies on the line to try and help save this country. My sons are worried about my safety. No one is being paid a dime to stand out there and get beaten up. We will follow the example of Gandhi or Martin Luther King and turn the other cheek. People join the military, police and fire departments because they want to help people. We all take an oath when we join up to protect the Constitution of the United States from enemies foreign and domestic. This government has run roughshod over constitutional law, especially in the last 16 years. We are doing what the actual terrorists want. We are breaking our own values, disobeying the Constitution, spying on people's emails and phone calls, putting people on no-fly lists and restricting their travel. We have officers who can confiscate cash from people that they pull over. I want to create a future for my children. I just want a job that pays the bills. I tried meditation, I tried to pursue religion. I'm no Jesus: I've been a sinner. The most important things in life are kindness, compassion, honesty, caring for neighbors. Most important is forgiveness. I want forgiveness. We are raised in America to be spectators. Life is about living not watching other people do it. Everyone is going to Standing Rock with the same idea. We will not stop until this country gets it right, until we live by our proposed ideals.
