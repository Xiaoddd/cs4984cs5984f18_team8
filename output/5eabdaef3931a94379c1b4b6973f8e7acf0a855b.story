The media are clearing out, packing up satellite trucks and heading home. White allies who showed up in solidarity are breathing a sigh of relief. But for the indigenous people they are leaving behind, the fight will rage on, harder than ever before. The Lakota Sioux people and their guests from around the globe built a veritable small city at Oceti Sakowin Camp in order to hold ground at Standing Rock, and now that the harsh North Dakota winter is settling in, they could be left with a bigger fight and fewer resources to fight it if the battle continues. The Army Corp of Engineers declined to grant Energy Transfer Partners, the corporation building the pipeline, the easement necessary to cross under Lake Oahe, and they called for environmental impact studies for alternative routes. This is big-government decision-making at its worst. I look forward to putting this anti-energy presidency behind us. The short-term victory against the pipeline effort was won by putting bodies on the line to occupy territory. The unintended consequence of celebration could be that those bodies become a scarce resource. When the North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple announced, falsely, that Standing Rock would be forced to evacuate, reinforcements still came. Now, many of the Lakota Sioux and the Standing Rock resistance allies believe that all of the fanfare around the declared victory will just be another attempted deterrent, but this time using the illusion of success to convince the Sioux that their job is done, and that they can head home.

You need to get as many people to Standing Rock as possible. My father said to call on the dead to help. My heart and soul are with you and your people. LikeLike Comments are closed.
