Deceleration Climate Change: Mitigation. Adaptation. Justice. Giving remembrance on December 29, 2016, to those massacred at Wounded Knee Creek 1890. Strength to the Chief Big Foot memorial riders. The approval is a massive blow to DAPL opponents, who have waged a months-long resistance to the pipeline on the grounds that it violates Indigenous treaty rights and threatens access to clean water. It comes shortly after the Obama administration ordered the corps to conduct a full environmental review of the 1,172-mile pipeline before allowing construction to continue. The corps said it would terminate its plans to release the environmental impact statement. Army Corps has given the US Senate only 24 hour notice on DAPL easement, instead of required 14-day notice. Chase Iron Eyes, Native American attorney and activist of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, called for water protectors to return to the camps to reengage in peaceful mass civil disobedience to stop the pipeline. Iron Eyes assumed a leadership position at camps after the tribal chairman, Dave Archambault II, called for their dissolution after the Army Corps agreed to a full environmental assessment of the project. See the full statement below. The environmental impact statement was wrongfully terminated. This pipeline was unfairly rerouted across our treaty lands. Attorneys for the Tribe emphasize that the easement cannot be granted legally at this time. The Earth Justice release continues: The Tribe will challenge any easement decision on the grounds that the EIS was wrongfully terminated. The Tribe will demand a fair, accurate and lawful environmental impact statement to identify true risks to its treaty rights, including its water supply and sacred places. The Tribe has asked the court for DAPL to disclose its oil spill and risk assessment records for full transparency and review by the public. If DAPL is successful in constructing and operating the pipeline, the Tribe will seek to shut the pipeline operations down. A Native Nations march on Washington is scheduled for March 10. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and tribes across the country invite allies in America and from around theworld to join the march. Our fight is with Congress and the Trump administration. We call on the Native Nations of the United States to stand together, unite and fight back. Under this administration, all of our rights, everything that makes us who we are is at risk.
