A line was crossed the night they cut loose with water cannons up at Standing Rock drenching unarmed protesters in below freezing wind chill. You are. He can just order the National Guard away, order law enforcement away (because he is also in control of the Department of Justice). He can order DAPL off Army Corps of Engineers land. But he calculates politically. Al Franken had no problem releasing his condemnation statement, but this president, he has so many super important considerations to consider that rube Minnesota Senator Franken could never understand, that we could never understand. The weight and responsibility of office seems to have boxed him up tight. Were that the case then we should apologize to him for his indifference. The Oceti Sakowin is talking to the wrong guy. The new plan must be to talk to his masters. Nope. Still, it at least identifies the real enemy. These people have no problem with the water cannon in principle. Oh, forgot to mention they also control the national media. The plan is a simple one; just keep this thing on the back burner.
