He did not specifically name the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes, who are opposing the pipeline in North Dakota. It came as an executive at the company building the Dakota Access Pipeline compared opponents to terrorists. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Protests have held up the building of the controversial pipeline for months Thousands of people have been descending on the area, setting up camps along the final stretch of the planned 1,172 mile (1,886km) pipeline. Opponents argue the project would contaminate drinking water and damage sacred burial sites. Barack Obama's administration denied the company a land permit to build the pipeline.
