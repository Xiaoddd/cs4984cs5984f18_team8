The Bismarck Police Department reported that officers pulled Thompson's vehicle over around 6 p.m. after multiple witnesses reported he was hitting a 21-year-old woman in the car. Police searched the vehicle and found a handgun tucked between the driver's seat and the center console, as well as a rifle in the backseat. He told the judge that he has been having issues with his girlfriend since his sister died in a car accident two weeks ago. After listening to Thompson's story, Romanick also ordered him to seek addiction treatment evaluation and make contact with Veteran's Affairs for potential counseling. Thompson is the security worker who got into a conflict with protesters as he drove down N.D. Highway 1806 towards the Dakota Access Pipeline protest camps on Oct. 27 to take photos of burning equipment. Two protesters allegedly rammed their cars into Thompson's to get him off the road, where the protesters said he was endangering people. There was also a confrontation in the water, during which Thompson held an AR-15 rifle and some protesters allegedly threatened him with knives. Police determined Thompson was the victim in the protest-related case. The men maintain their innocence.
