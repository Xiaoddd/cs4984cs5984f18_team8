'This painting shows the black narin (snake). It represents the pipeline killing Bininj (Indigenous) people, and the land out there. The Bininj people are stopping it, throwing monkolli (spears). Bininj are fighting that black narin to stop it before it goes more further and kills everything. In my painting Ngaliod (Rainbow Serpent) is helping to save their land and water and the people.

Their approach focuses on long-term change, working with each child, each family and each community, so that children learn, grow and thrive in communities that celebrate cultural, social and economic wellbeing. Thousands of Indigenous Australians have joined a global social media movement to show solidarity with those protesting against the Dakota Access Pipeline at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in the United States. The project is called the Northern Gas Pipeline, a 622-kilometre pipeline that would run from the Northern Territory town of Tennant Creek to Mt Isa in Queensland, where the gas would then be exported. Recently, several traditional owners stormed out of a presentation by the Singaporean and Chinese company Jemena, which would manage the project if it goes ahead. The Wakaya are calling on more Australians to join their protest.
