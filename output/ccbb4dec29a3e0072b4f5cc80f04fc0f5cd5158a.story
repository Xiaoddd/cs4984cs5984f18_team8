Commissioners, who supported the project unanimously, said Sacagawea Pipeline Co. is taking several steps to minimize potential impacts to the lake, including boring at least 100 feet under the lakebed. The 70-mile pipeline will transport oil from south of Keene in McKenzie County to a rail terminal near Palermo in Mountrail County. Commission Chairwoman Julie Fedorchak said the company has hired one of the top contractors in the country to do the underground boring. In addition, the pipeline will be continuously monitored from a control center in Oklahoma and the operator will have personnel and equipment stationed nearby for emergency spill response. The Three Affiliated Tribes consented to an easement for the portion of the project that crosses tribal land, Fedorchak said. The commission is considering another proposal from Sacagawea Pipeline Co. for an eight-mile pipeline that would transport oil from the Palermo rail terminal to the Enbridge oil terminal in Stanley. A public hearing is set for 10 a.m. Jan. 12 in Stanley for that proposal. Vacation photographs often capture perfect moments in favorite places.
