For the sixth time, environmental regulators have cited Mountain Valley Pipeline for failing to contain muddy water flowing from construction sites. A notice of violation was recently issued against the Pittsburgh company by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, according to a filing Thursday with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Four similar actions have been taken in West Virginia since early April; a single notice of violation that addresses problems in six Southwest Virginia counties was filed July 9 by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. With most of the reported violations, Mountain Valley officials have said they took corrective actions. As the paperwork continues to pile up, Virginia Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, is asking Gov. Ralph Northam to order a stop to construction. The buried pipeline will traverse 199 steep slopes with grades in excess of 35 percent of a 45-degree angle, Edwards wrote. The grade will be greater than 70 percent along 12 segments. Sediment-laden runoff poses a risk of contamination to private wells and public water supplies and can cause headaches for local governments. When it issued a notice of violation on July 9, DEQ gave Mountain Valley officials 10 days to respond. Cox could not be reached Monday for comment on the most recently reported notice of violation in West Virginia. Similar problems are described in the other five notices of violations. Precision Pipeline, one of the contractors hired by Mountain Valley to build the pipeline in West Virginia and Virginia, is listed in the most recent report as the site operator. In April, the panel of governor-appointed citizens decided to ask for public comments on the adequacy of stream-crossing permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for Mountain Valley and a second pipeline that will cut through Central Virginia, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. More than 13,000 written statements were submitted during a public comment period that ended June 15. They plan to publish them online with a summary later this week.
