He has a record as a strong supporter of the Israeli government and a fierce critic of the Iran nuclear deal. While serving in Congress, Pompeo was among the most outspoken Republican critics of President Barack Obama's foreign policy in the Middle East. Tillerson, meanwhile, was one of the most prominent members of Trump's administration who called not to withdraw from the deal, but instead to remain committed to it and make sure it is rigorously enforced. During his brief tenure at the CIA, Pompeo enjoyed good relations with his counterparts in the Israeli Intelligence community. He played a role in maintaining ties between the Trump administration and the Palestinian Authority's security and intelligence forces. Last February, Pompeo was the first senior official in the Trump administration to visit Ramallah and meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, as part of the administration's early attempts to build a relationship with the Palestinian leadership. Tillerson never confirmed the report, but Trump soon after challenged Tillerson to an IQ test. Word of the White House plan will significantly complicate Tillersons ability to conduct diplomacy and run the State Department for as long as he stays, given that foreign governments may now consider him a lame duck. Foreign leaders had anticipated Tillerson was likely to attend a scheduled gathering of NATO foreign ministers next week in Brussels, though the State Department hadnt confirmed that. Tillerson had been scheduled to speak Thursday at an event about global efforts to fight AIDS. Late Wednesday, the State Department said he would be represented by his deputy instead.
