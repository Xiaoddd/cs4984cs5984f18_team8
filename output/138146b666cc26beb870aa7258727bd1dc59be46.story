Welcome to tar sands philanthropy. Bono serenades Billionaire Philanthropist: I End up a Little more Ill, -Ill enough to vent. It's hard to love the PR stooges of the apocalypse. Not to mention there's THIS sordid history, and THIS.... Yes, this is Bono's secondary billionaire sponsor for ONE Campaign. I realize the source reference is very far down, but it's worth getting there. It is not like Bill Gates is unaware of this as he sits on Berkshire Hathaway's board of directors. That means Bono's ONE Campaign is financially dependent on the brutality being carried out at Standing Rock right now. (Not that they disclose how significantly. Welcome to consumer philanthropy. PS: Bono already knows it. Actually Grist's editorial coyness is explained by Bill McKibben being on their board fo directors, since 350.org is funded by Tides Foundation, which receives funding from Warren Buffet's Novo Foundation. Then it became an essay (to him) on tumblr just three days before Lac-Megantic was blown up by one out of Bakken (which caused a twitter assault on the subject many, many times, -like every subsequent explosion). It's all wonderful, until you look into where the profits are coming from, et cetera, and how much power to change the world they really possess, which is purely a reflection on the most extreme global inequity the world has ever known. Welcome to how neoliberals run the resources. Canada's government spies on and harasses citizens who peacefully question petro-corporate aims. - Bono - The Guardian removed this article, but it had a review. NYT would make no mention that the photo they depicted of the burnt shell of an engine from a train that exploded outside of Casselton, ND was a BNSF train, just to avoid the implications of what was happening while Buffett owned it. Yes. Way Back in NB. CN refused to disclose to the public where this train originated or whether its contents sourced from the tar sands or Bakken, right after 47 dead. This was Gogoma, after a tally of 5 CN accidents in Ontario alone from the turn of the new year to March 7, 2015. The Gates love their investment, a' course. Oil shipments went up 28,000 percent post investment. Let the fun begin. I.E. the corporate mandate of profitability above all else (its inherent amorality) prevents and stymies progress, even in the face of potential planetary destruction. Its glaring fallacy is obvious. It's an attempt to justify the killer profiteers' forms of attainment. She sits on ONE's Board of Directors. An article on U2's tax evasion. Can't say I was. There were new developments in this essay, ranging from Ireland shady to questionably criminal in the very top ranks of BC political rule. The Globe and Mail zeroed in on the inordinate federal powers still held by formerly nationalized rail companies used to abuse Canadians whilst simultaneously abusing the entitlements of privatization (i.e., Gates' CN investment, which rang in the New Year with a bang (and tipple)), whilst getting whistleblown for corruption while failing its mandate. Warren apparently got ugly, and then even uglier (he diversified of course, -and then went on as the world's richest individual to seek to protect himself from potential liability if his railway happened to blow any town sky high, as it was only a mile out from doing to Casselton, ND in January, 2013). Horrid connect the dots were made. There appeared to be notice. -Forbes sunk even lower. Oh, and Bill Gates biggest profit milk cow for 2013 apart from Microsoft was CN, apparently. Welcome to the profit mill that begets tar sands philanthropy. -A final caveat, -this essay was first posted in June, 2013, before the train explosion that engulfed Lac-Megantic, Quebec, killing forty-seven people. Since then, Bono has completely divested Elevation Partners of Forbes. -Boom, Boom). -Neo-liberalism at its finest. Your linkages in high places just love these sorts of angles. They sound nice. The consequences, however, range in the hundreds of years. The President Who Wasn't There - Jeffrey St. Your management added insult to injury by robbing the wait staff even of their tips; (they had this excuse of an annual party they claimed was the use of the tip disbursement, -that would have been pennies to the dollar). They are there because Ireland exploits its youth in the service industry. They don't live with this toxic time bomb. These people do. As per usual, the bastards did it by force. This is just beginning to come home to roost. -As for how neo-liberals even get re-elected, -never mind. It would be illegal stateside. The reigning neo-liberal premier, Campbell, who offloaded BC Rail did so after it was a plank in his election campaign to not privatize it; -it was direct betrayal of his constituents. Despite all, we remain a healthy backwater for dissent, though our nation is now unrecognizable to us. Imperial Metals has not even blocked the breach, it's still flowing. Yer CEO is a dilbit billionaire, the fourteenth richest Canadian in fact (his ranking by Forbes). He made the bulk of his wealth on tar sands open mines (for which the tailings ponds were so vast as to comprise 176 square km three years ago). The demand isn't small; nor are the consequences. It was already clear whose bread was going to be buttered, based on the funding. And oh yes, it turns out our illegally polluting billionaire tar babies and your, er, philanthropists are thick as thieves. The tailings pond was known by the BC Ministry of Environment to be holding more toxic water than legally permitted, yet the BC Liberals allowed Imperial Metals to ramp up production, merely writing them warning letters on the subject. Imperial Metals was warned by the provincial government five times leading up to this breach of precisely this danger. They were also warned by an independent study over three years ago. This amounts to being warned from all possible fronts. Imperial Mines did nothing but escalate the danger, and the reigning government let them. The only assertiveness the neoliberal provincial government proved capable of worked in the way of classic enablers of the deadliest form of debilitating psychosis. They are not enablers of an individual death, say by drug addiction. This is not an inherent price of doing business. It is a matter of gross mismanagement. As such they are Orwellian unreality at its lethal best, possessed of one agenda. We have our last dirge of the plutocrats set upon preventing humanity ever reforming, directing or even saving itself, who are set on the self-reinforcing belief that financial elites are still more fit to run us (in the face of opposite results) than actual governance, impartiality, egalitarianism, democracy, sustainability and meritocracy. The immense nature of their dispensation only arose through the untrammeled exploitation of their uninsured workers, monopolization, the divestment of governments and customers (as taxpayers, -both ways), wholesale divestiture of the planet and the flagrant exploitation of (deliberately) collapsed economies. I understand corporate disbursement actually works. seeing as there was already some considered scrutiny. The results are mixed, and successful when not ruled by the market. In a nutshell, it is precisely the context he sets about defending where protections are needed; that is where this becomes a matter of lives. The argument is also utter hogwash, as if no discretion or dispensation rests in the ability of the courts, where these issues actually are determined. But it provides a ready indicator of the internalized biases of you and your friends. This is the modern nature of propaganda in a realm of relative diminishing returns, media outlet depending, (but when the likes of Kristof does this twice over in the NYT, he provides an even better service than outlets such as yours). Forbes however did get this one right: Canada sells the crude at (what is naturally) a fire sale price in order to buy back the product at much greater expense as gas. They had to say this to counter Greg Palast. Examination is needful when the foundations of the astronomically wealthy are the only cash cow left (why), and this is how the game is played. Moreover this is how the game has always been played, as it kills two birds with one stone, providing the saintly garb of charity to cloak their actions, -while the Gates Foundation in itself is considered a form of tax evasion. Such funding is inherently contaminated if not defined by rewarding those whose policies best serve those running the foundations, when there is the hope of neutrality vested in governance and the neutral dispensation of these monies if they were actually taxed. You ought to consider, then, what level of denial Canada has to enforce at home by the suppression of science to maintain its existing unreality as some sort of status quo. This is the most resplendent indicator of totalitarian fascism running the global gong show; such realization is contingent on total inequity. As for your vaunted concern about Africa, it's curious you make practically no reference to the causalities or currency of continental warfare, the preeminent factor in its destruction; your silence on the destabilization of North Africa in terms of implication is stunning. Nor do I find you capable of opining on your latest endorsement in interviews, the public-private partnerships designed to put Big Ag in Africa (your AGRA endorsement). No one wants to talk about it, especially you. -Ask US farmers about their legacy. -Oh, Canada. My personal experience of the RCMP in reality disturbingly dovetails with a number of (really disturbing) ancillary facts -like this one. -Loverly. That indicates a lot of power, read complicity, which had to have been based on consumer demand in high (enough) places (to pay, say, a quarter mil a pop); certainly law enforcement dragged their feet on this one for quite some time. (Incidentally, as per Betty, the UN did respond. The ruling government squelched. We are offered the blithe pretense that there are no vestiges of colonialism when these murders were not stopped (when officialdom blamed racial bias for this) and the last residential school closed in 1996. Those are the crucibles where denial must be ironclad. Speaking of which, the Yahoo article on the Truth and Reconciliation March looks like it has an ulterior motive, basically to disseminate a deceptively low established death toll as if it were the total (-deaths were not reported after 1917 for example, and the figures were systematically suppressed), for a school system that existed for over one hundred years; schools where forced mandatory attendance was ratified separating children from their families (RCMP enforced). Corruption is nigh predictable in Canada; it is so omnipresent nothing is beyond implausibility any more. It is institutionalized in the RCMP. The song remains the same, apparently. The attendant information arm (CSEC) specializes in information control as oppression (categorizing environmental activism as terrorism), and is sophisticated enough to furnish the NSA (including, apparently, the spying on Brazil, -ha-ha. In addition thanks to the fact that the NSA implicitly provided CSEC with marching orders in the case of spying on the Energy and Mines Ministry of Brazil, Canada is also the fulcrum for corporate espionage by federal agencies for the sake of US energy and resource extraction corporate sectors internationally as well as providing this service to their own corporations. Canada provides an excellent case study in such dynamics, the price being its very nationhood. Not redacted in the sense that Conrad defended Flanagan personally. The need for centralization and amalgamation into a singular Vancouver police force (inter-force communication) simply doesn't account for it all; certainly not the lack of a just outcome thanks to lack of investigation, which renders the whole matter damningly suspect. No inquiry there; and look whose attorneys got funded. Oh, but it does get worse. The RCMP have actually been accused of raping and battering indigenous women themselves by Human Rights Watch, and again appear to have closed ranks. (This has gone to the UN as well. As such it is the ultimate inversion of procreation, i.e., life itself, for the expression that it defines as the ultimate form of power is based on cataclysmic reduction rather than creation. I blame the misplaced utter fallacy that a mere economic mechanism got substituted for ideology and thereby actually considered a form of regulating or developing society, when this is impossible. Again, distrust is rooted in the fact the all GM research is incentivized and directed by market dictates, the existing track record. Because it is a system designed to ultimately empower them to the ultimate power, it is how they choose to define society, for it is naturally to their optimum benefit. I bet that was something the Center for Food Safety was going on about, in fact I feel assured, as I remember reading precisely these sorts of arguments accompanying petitions (in Canada, on how it could easily wipe out the ability for an organic market in alfalfa to even exist at all). Thanks to transgenic pollution this issue is now permanent. They spend waaay too much money and energy on that aspect to be perceived as even remotely trustworthy. -It got way too cozy a long time ago. They are subject to standards in the US, which they attack and abuse regularly. In other words, corporations only behave decently where sufficiently regulated by government, where governments are sufficiently empowered by active democracy and regulation to possess a spine, and not supine to the oligarchy. Otherwise the end result is just a bunch of enabling of the self -same variants on deviation in bodies of reigning authority and power at the institutional level maintained in the interest of repression, buttressed by denial. They reflect on humanity and act as humans individually do. Therein lies the danger. Monarchy by Divine right was equally capable of full, very effective benevolence; that has never validated the structure of choice for governance. Falling for it is a fallacy, even though charitable philanthropy is a tremendous virtue which absolutely should exist. Technology, while very defining of culture is the commodification of our lives, it is absent of governance. AGRA merely boils down to a campaign that seeks the total corporatization of African agriculture, part and parcel of the last conquest of mankind to render fascism complete: control the food, you control the people. Resource rape is the only form of extraction this economy is capable of. One only has to look back at the lethal efficacy of the printing press, how its invention effectively worked to disseminate witch burning theology, resulting in one of the most barbarous episodes in western history against innocents. -Nothing has in fact changed except that female sexual abuse and mutilation has been transformed into a socially acceptable spectator sport the town doesn't gather to watch in the middle of the square, sanctioned by the founding fathers and the Church. They don't have to anymore, and they don't need institutionalized patriarchy to justify it any more. It already has a manifest death toll in young girls, with the untold price tag of sex trafficking. -Nice work. Facebook should be active with authorities. A square this vast needs security (at the very least). Malls are smart enough to protect their investment with security, but not Facebook. It's not like this oil is for the Canadian market. He was then rewarded with the helmsmanship of CP after that. Congratulations. The same spine-snapping state of illogic is reflected in their individual efforts at philanthropy, which only exists at their dispensation through their enforced maintenance of this level of inequity. It is all neoliberalism is capable of, more or less a fast track to hell. This is what philanthropy is inherently reduced to by the nature of the ideology engaged in it. Isolated by a different environment, your business acumen is indeed showing. This failure is manifest in the social divestiture of the charter school system, while the systemic failure of the railways is swept under the carpet, -unless thrown into stark relief by the body count (the attendant environmental and infrastructure damages are downplayed and ignored). It has no identifiers with democracy whatsoever. We can only wish, somewhat sentimentally, for when such ruthlessness remained in the virtual boardroom. We can hardly imagine how this can actually viably translate into genuine philanthropy. Were they examined with any intellectual rigour they would utterly collapse, just as they collapse in engaging reality, -if not for the money behind it. Anyone exemplary in business could eradicate polio in subjecting themselves to the hire of the right phalanx of (adequately paid) expertise while fully financing their effort, i.e., with the money behind it. And unfortunately, even with the best among you, your capital gains (your means) are showing as being as predatory as ever. In the end, Bill Gates is the rational argument for the viability of plutocracy, which is what social divestiture by avoiding taxation and (when it is one of your prime means of doing so) is diverting it to your personal philanthropic dispensation (never mind just by protracted exercise of this the displacement alone); Microsoft is among the top ten performers at tax avoidance in the US. By existing as a practical and very effective philanthropist, Gates exists as this living, walking, talking argument at its lethal, rational best. His philanthropy is arising purely out of the divestment of social and earthly capital elsewhere, robbery as opposed to capital development of any sort. But you can always attempt to qualify any level of luridness in capital gain by generating a commensurate level of philanthropy, -even (which is actually especially to) -yourself. It could never reach commensurate, not even remotely. In the game of sums, what ultimately gets thrown into relief is the immeasurability of personal conceit. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, the inherent bias of philanthropy is replete in their individual choice and operation of dispensing their own money, it cannot but win in terms of the weight of operating personal bias. In their hands it is inherently weighted towards who rules in terms of wealth distribution, never whomever it happens to serve. The weight of their own wealth accumulated by their own ideological tendency inherently will preclude this, Gates notwithstanding. In actual fact, every Christian alive today should be recognizing the prevailing ideology they currently serve as their western beacon to the world as the absolute antithesis of their existing faith. Um yes, because this capitalist ideology refuses to accept it is simply a market structure; it has gone out and morally vested itself, so it is an utterly pretentious, and utterly stultifying, attempt at substitution for religion. You should consider now what great effort every inverted fallacious ideology has made to qualify its existence, be it patriarchy or slavery, as the commensurate effort in qualifying themselves has always been inversely and directly related to their barbarity. When we are arriving at the finitudes of being capable of existing on Earth, this is about to get fully literal. It is clung to for its sheer power of dispossession and redistribution of wealth it allows to be codified. What we are wrestling with now is planetary in scale, not just a matter of human interest. Grow up, boys. It is the climate of preference that just blew sky high in Quebec. We'll go from there. It's all too easy really to keep counting the bodies. Again disgust could not be more absolute. Besides being a conquest without limit that can attack anywhere on the globe, it is the device of internal oppression employed on nations throughout the western world. It just goes to show how all things remain the same; they just shift continents of conquest in corporate servicing as evisceration (via foundation funding). This is full-fledged denial, equivalent to the belief of obtaining exoneration through the purchase of papal indulgences. This in itself is attenuation of the well meaning desires of the public, the castration of action. Call me the canary, but you have begun reaping the death of your awareness campaign, since awareness only exists to the extent it actually is aware. You must install Adobe Flash to view this content. And then some. -Buffet. But that's a little beside the point. The military-industrial complex is ready. - Yes, and they spell it Ca-na-da. ha. - solved very quickly, it should be added. responsible funded BC Liberals (neoliberals) retaining power in last election and also gave Bill Gates and Warren Buffet their tar sands tour before they sunk their assets into bitumen (tar sands) and Bakken oil transport, i.e., NA railways. Oh and, with NDP coming to power in AB for the first time in over 40 years, instantly engages in tax flight. This is the fastest ascent of a political party to the reigns of our government in all of our political history. all. time. They are their bottom line in exploitation.
