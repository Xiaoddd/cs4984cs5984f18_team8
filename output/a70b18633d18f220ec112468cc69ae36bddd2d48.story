'script', 'twitter-wjs'); Mar 6, 2017 Protesters sing during a march against the Dakota Access oil pipeline near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. A confidential environmental justice analysis comparing the original proposed route north of Bismarck and the final one upstream of the Standing Rock reservation was sent by Dakota Access LLC employees to senior officials at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Its counterintuitive findings appear to have been largely incorporated into the Corps' final environmental assessment of the Standing Rock route last July, but weren't given to the tribe or made public. Those communities surrounding Bismarck are 96 percent white and only 2 percent of residents live below the poverty line. The project will run just over a half-mile upstream of the reservation under Lake Oahe, a Missouri River reservoir used by the tribe for drinking water, irrigation and fish. Three-quarters of its population is Native American and 40 percent of its 8,200 people live in poverty. The organization is suing the Army Corps and Dakota Access on behalf of the Standing Rock tribe. The main complaint is that the company excluded the reservation from the analysis as a result of how it chose census tract data. The memo is dated April 12, 2016, less than one month after the Environmental Protection Agency and other federal agencies raised serious environmental justice and other objections to the Standing Rock route. Under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), agencies must consider environmental justice implications of major infrastructure projects. The Interior Department's top lawyer, solicitor Hilary Tompkins, issued a legal opinion in early December opposing the use of the memo in the analysis. The Trump administration suspended that opinion in February as it prepared to approve the pipeline and halt additional review. Dakota Access LLC and the Army Corps declined to comment. Geography as Destiny While there is no universal methodology for carrying out demographic analyses for infrastructure projects, the company's approach is controversial. It considered census tract data within a half-mile radius of where the pipeline's boreholes are being drilled to cross the Missouri River. When applying that distance to the Lake Oahe route, two census tracts fell into consideration. The Standing Rock reservation was not one of them because it falls just outside that half-mile circle, but it's just another 80 yards, or 0.05 miles, further from the construction. The EPA had warned that a spill could especially affect water supplies of Standing Rock and other communities downstream, and that the environmental justice analysis should reflect that. Bullard said there was no justification for using the half-mile radius for the Lake Oahe crossing. In its analysis of the original pipeline route, which would have been constructed under the Missouri River 10 miles north of Bismarck, the pipeline company considered data from census tracts that pass through the construction site and extend 10 miles or more downstream to communities surrounding the city of Bismarck. Dakota Access has said it rejected the Bismarck route for a number of factors, including more road and wetland crossings, a longer pipeline, higher costs and close proximity to wellheads providing Bismarck's drinking water supply. Attorneys for the tribe have said that in comparison the environmental justice assessment of the Keystone XL pipeline used a distance of 14 miles downstream from where it crossed waterways. That way, outside experts, including those from other federal agencies and affected communities, could weigh in to help shape the final analysis, she said. Chase, who had not seen the confidential assessment prior to her resignation from the EPA on Jan. 20, said it raises questions about the permitting process. Hasselman told ICN the tribe didn't receive a copy of the document until November, when it was entered into the administrative record by the Army Corps in the tribe's lawsuit against the agency and the pipeline company. It said it should be confidential because information it contained, including water intake locations and plume travel times, are not information that is made public. In the final weeks of President Obama's tenure, the administration halted construction of the crossing beneath Lake Oahe to carry out a more rigorous environmental review, including considering an alternative route away from Standing Rock. President Trump's Army Corps approved the final easement on Feb. 7, however, ending that review. Construction is running ahead of schedule. The pipeline, which will pump crude oil 1,200 miles from North Dakota to Illinois, could begin operations as early as this month. Standing Rock and other Native American opponents continue to try to block the project's completion. There are four ongoing lawsuits including one by landowners in Iowa, all seen as longshots.
