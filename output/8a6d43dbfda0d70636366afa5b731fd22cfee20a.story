She is also a supporter of Keystone XL, and has said she supports an all-of-the-above energy strategy that leads to American energy independence. Coal did occupy a large portion of the time they spent talking, Heitkamp said. The topic of carbon credits also came up. North Dakota is uniquely positioned for carbon sequestration. Liquid carbon is being tested here for enhanced oil recovery by the Energy and Environmental Research Center, but at the same time, spent oil wells here would provide large reservoirs for future carbon sequestration. Marrying them with carbon credits could make the process financially attractive for coal companies, giving them a viable way to take their emissions out of the atmosphere while continuing to operate.
