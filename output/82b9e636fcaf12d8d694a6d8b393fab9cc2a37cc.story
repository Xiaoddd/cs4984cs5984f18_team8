This may vary depending on your circumstances and charges. TRANSPORT TO JAIL Most arrestees are transported to Morton County to be held and have their cases heard. Sometimes others have transferred to any of a number of other jails across the state. We track arrests and find you. Remember, you always have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will likely be used against you. Depending on you charges, bond may be set at the jail. Otherwise you will have to go before a judge to have your bond set. If you do not have access to resources to bond yourself out of jail, the Freshet Collective may pay your bond. If you accept these funds, you must show up for your court appearances or you will forfeit the movement's money to North Dakota law enforcement. You must also agree to return any bond money remaining upon conclusion of the case back to the Freshet Collective, to be redeposited in the Sacred Stone Legal Defense Fund. In situations of mass arrest, we are often forced to make choices about who to bond out of jail first. In those situations, we use this bail policy to guide our decisions. ARRAIgnMENT AND PRE-TRIAL You may attend a bond hearing before being released from jail, and if so, you will likely be arraigned at that hearing. But if you were bonded directly out of jail before appearing before a judge at a bond hearing, then will be arraigned at your initial appearance. After that, the second court date is typically a pre-trial conference. You can apply for a public defender- but many or most applications that are returned because the form was not entirely filled out. If you cannot get a public defender, we may be able to find a lawyer to take your case. Your lawyer will be the best places you may find answers to many of your questions. These different types of hearings are explained in detail in our Wiki Page, which is a good place to start learning basic legal info. In most cases, the most important thing is to show up. Search the North Dakota Courts Records Inquiry to find the date, time, and location for your next court date. If you cannot find what you are looking for or if you have any questions, call the Morton County Clerk at 701-667-3358. SEARCH CALENDAR TRIAL Your attorney will do everything they can to get your case dismissed. In many cases this will happen before it ever goes to trial. In the event that you and your attorney do decide to go to trial, you have a right to have your case heard before a jury. Your attorney will explain everything you need to know. It is essential that we continue to support them to remind them that they are loved. Prisoner Letter Info Writing to prisoners is one of the most important aspects of support. Letters from relatives, comrades and new friends is a lifeline for those inside and provides connection to the outside world. Prison and jail are designed to be isolating, but communication from the outside can cut through isolation and remind those inside that they are never alone. In many cases, contact from the outside lets the prison authorities know that there are people on the outside who care and are monitoring the situation. For example, religious freedoms and special dietary requirements (halal, kosher, vegan, etc) are more likely to be adhered to if a prisoner is obviously not forgotten. Do not write about illegal activities, happenings at the resistance camps, etc. The rule of thumb here is don't put anything in a letter that you wouldn't say to directly to the police. Remember that these prisoners are all pre-trial, which means that beyond their mail be generally monitored, it can be entered into evidence against them. These are political prisoners and you should obviously let them know you support their politics, but don't start praising them as heroes. Human connection is more important than heroism. Don't EVER promise things you can't deliver. Whether you're promising books, commissary money, et cetera- breaking promises to someone inside is not in line with supporting them. Unless the prisoner asks for it, avoid sending any overly contentious political material in as it can potentially cause them issues with the prison. Addresses of Those in Custody Red Fawn Fallis is currently incarcerated in Burleigh County Jail in Bismarck, ND. She is currently awaiting to be transferred to prison where she will serve her time. Starting your first letter can feel difficult, especially if you are writing to someone you don't already have a relationship with. You may be worried that what you write might sound stupid, or make the prisoner feel worse, or you simply can't think of anything. You can simply start by telling them about yourself, what you do, what you're into, where you got their address and so on. This breaks the ice and also make a reply easier. The point being that these folks are dynamic humans with varied interests and parts of themselves they'd probably like to share while in a place that is designed to strip them of their humanity. A quick message of support on a postcard can still really brighten up someone's day. Make sure to write the prisoner's full name and prisoner ID number on the envelope. Put your name and address at the top of the letter and on the top left corner. You can use a pen name if you've got any reservations, but bear in mind this is what the prisoner will see if they're going to write you a reply. Some prisons have rules forbidding certain imagery (e.g. gang symbols being banned from US prisons) and this may encompass political symbols as well. Different facilities have different rules, so call the prison or jail if you aren't sure if something can be mailed in. Typically you cannot send pictures drawn with anything other than markers, polaroid photos, or cards that have glue or glitter on them. You may not get a reply for several reasons: obviously the prisoner might not have received your letter or they might be getting a lot of mail (if they're fortunate enough), so they may not have time to reply to everyone. They may be limited in the number of letters they can write by the prison authorities and prefer to prioritize relatives and close friends. They may not have access to sufficient writing materials or stamps, they may have been moved, or they may simply not be very good at writing letters. Regardless, don't be put out if there's no reply and don't let this deter you from continuing to write. The golden rule here is to ask the prisoner if you've got any doubts. You can always try contacting the prison, asking to speak to the mailroom or an administrator about what items are approved by the facility. If you feel that the prison or jail staff is not being truthful or is misleading you, a common tactic of repression by the institution, ask if they have a copy of their inmate handbook or mail regulations for you to review. These are often available online, but not always. The rules vary widely between different prisons and are sometimes baffling or non-sensical. If you send anything in, clearly write at the top of your letter what you've enclosed as this lessens the chances of guards taking items without the prisoners knowledge. Many prisoners have Amazon book wish lists that have been set up from which you can mail something directly. Guards may withhold some literature on the grounds of content, it all depends on which guard is looking through the mail any given day. Sometimes books or zines get through just fine, other times a prisoner never receives them.
