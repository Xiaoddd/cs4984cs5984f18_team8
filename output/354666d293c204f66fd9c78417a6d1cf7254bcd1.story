I recall one day around this time of year in 1987 loading Barley with a three inch ogre poked under the sheet in order to stop the load failing the moisture content test and loose the small tenant farmer the export premium price, him shovelling to foot and me under the sheet inside the box. Sheer bloody luxury compare to just as shit up plus pissed wet through and bathed in barley whiskers evry bit as good as best quality itching powder from't Joke Shop at Blackburn who incidentally sale Poo Poo Cushions, and Legal High Joker killed anyone who switched to it from Black Mamba first good Dollar Suckey. I use to get on quite well with the boss of Davis Pet Food, his son was a spoild brat though, gridlocked the original Whitebirk knacker yard with his seats chewed up by his dog, and when summoned back to shift it, and to avoid contamination with offal on his overalls put a big pallet on the stacker truck and moved it with that probably bending the prop shaft due to his stupidity. There best Glasgow customer traded under the name of Saluki, and one day I delivered a old fridge container for him to to store extra on the waste land next to his other one on waste ground crane allegedly booked to lift the lot in one lift, arrived on sit but nowhere to be seen. Only a couple of his unlawfully working on benefits turned up so i was knackered after hand balling the lot into his other, the owner of the small greyhound kennels let me watch TV in their old cottage while they were out that night until midnight. As a bonus I got to stroke their retired winning Persian Grey and food, and was told Ian Michie was selling bags of five pairs of tiights for a fiver, but when you opened them out they were all stupid colours and too embarrassing to wear by most. I was also told how he had paid his driver only a tenner even though they had gone down to London and back via Cambridge without stopping to sleep in a proper bed, I ended up having to ring Blackburn by phone to remove the van at the nearby Container Base amd Davis had to pay for its storage also. After an accident when one of his best men got his leg minced of Davis sold out to a compettitor over West Yorkshire and perhaps all the dog lovers could end up feeding choice cuts of fat people they bump off via the NHS to their Pets At Home, and it turns out that the Dakota Pipeline protest is all about royalties for it to pass through their tribal land. It seems that the proposed 250ml cans emulate the alleged bomb which brought down the Russian charter from Shar Mel Shek and contain real cocaine like the original Aussie Gold Rush version preserved glass adverts I saw out there, and not to offend other cartel members Heroin in Iron Brew to commemorate the film Trainspotting. And who knows the full extent of Cop22 Eco-Nazi promoting celebrity depravity, but then failed chicken farmer Himmler a Vegan Oliver Twist diet to build Good Blood and Bone for his Master Race. This morning the Silly Moo health minister used similar terms live on camera to justify accepted by consensus UK Obesity Strategy. And then Tony Blair has the gall to go on TV and say the debate isn't over on Brexit, and ho the electorate didn't get a say on the terms negotiated on Article 50 and there will have to have another referendum. I heard something similar to that before on Climate Change. The debate over they said, and at the 29015 General election all three main parties ppleged to sign the Cop21 Paris Agreement, whist Farage pagurised Adolf Hitler's Operation Barbarossa Speech at Hartlepool even though the UKP manifesto included a a commitment to repeal The 2008 Climate change Act. Their cattle were emaciated so no point killing any of them to eat so they shot five Prime Tuskers and ate them, and perhaps if any of the tourists who went on Safari on the pretext of taking photos of Elephants. and perhaps the cheap skates had used the exact same rate cail springs both front and rear, Accy Tech 2nd year stuff, and then attempted to coverup their engineering sins with electronics. The Anti-Roll technology was also suspect, I asked if it was still under warranty, he said yes so I instructed him to take it back to the dealer and demand his money back. Whilst waiting to tip one day at Dagenham Engine Plant the inspector rejected an entire load of flywheel castings because the condensation under the sheet has dripped into the H bins and they were just a few spots of rust on a few. Reason being that it blunted the tools and they would have to sharpen them, in a few odd corners there were old castings which traditionally were left out to weather. There are plenty of worthwhile jobs out there waiting to be created, but unless they cost billions in imports to set up, nobody seems to be interested, and perhaps local authorities should have a clear out of officers unwilling to look at problems from a more cost effective local job friendly angle. Perhaps the prospect of becoming directors of privatised council services, and then instant millionaires, is preventing progress towards job creation and value for money, but if the politicians could kill any further move towards privatisation of services, things may begin to improve for the better.
