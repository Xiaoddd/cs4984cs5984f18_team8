The changes, later criticized by scientists for lacking evidence, played down the risk of pollution that can result from the well-drilling technique known as fracking. Earlier draft versions emphasized more directly that fracking has contaminated drinking water in some places. The documents also show that the news release accompanying the scientific study was changed on June 3, 2015, the day before it was made public. In fact, scientists had found evidence in some places that fracking activity had polluted drinking water supplies. In all, the agency identified more than two dozen instances in which hydraulic fracturing had an impact on water resources. The agency also identified hundreds of other spills, many of which reached soil and water. Industry representatives cheered the findings, touting them as validation that fracking is safe. Media organizations big and small highlighted the conclusion in headlines and sound bites. In a 140-character information ecosystem, suddenly the industry had the benefit of government assurance that fracked wells did not pose a significant threat to water supplies. Those reports won the day, dominating the news cycle despite the EPA report noting that fracking activities, including chemical spills and faulty well construction, did have an impact on drinking water resources. When research is mischaracterized by policy-makers, however, it raises concerns about the politicization of government science. The oil and gas industry, along with Republican allies in Congress, has regularly criticized the EPA for investigations into fracking, arguing that state regulators have primary responsibility over the oil and gas sector. Even as it was conducting the broad study, in three instances the EPA withdrew abruptly from investigations into landowner complaints over water contamination related to fracking. The revelations come as Republican President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office on a pledge to abolish the EPA and eliminate regulations on oil and gas activities to boost energy exploration. It might be difficult for Trump to eliminate the agency, but even slight reductions could have a major effect on an agency that already has been hit by budget cuts. Areas where hydraulic fracturing is being used to extract oil or natural gas. There are also 1,902 fewer EPA employees than in 2010. Congress called for study The oil and gas industry has used hydraulic fracturing for decades. The process sends a mix of water, chemicals and sand into the subsurface at high pressure. In the past 20 years, its use has dramatically increased as technology has combined with horizontal drilling techniques to produce vast amounts of affordable fossil energy from shale rock formations. Gas, thought to have fewer greenhouse-gas emissions than coal, has been replacing coal steadily for U.S. electricity generation for more than a decade. As natural gas production has grown over that decade, the portion that is coming from fracked wells has grown to two-thirds. Natural gas is also seen by many, including the Obama administration, as a cleaner-than-coal bridge to a time when most electricity will come from renewable sources. In addition to making the U.S. less dependent on foreign sources of oil and natural gas, fracking has delivered an economic boost to many parts of the country. But like many industries relying on natural resources, the prospect of jobs has collided with environmentalists and residents worried about clean air and clean water. Landowners in many states, including Texas, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Alabama and Wyoming, have complained that their drinking water was contaminated after fracking activity occurred near them. Supporters of the congressional action cited a 2004 EPA study that said fracking was safe; they claimed the study politicized the science and played down negative findings. So EPA scientists spent years evaluating scientific reports from academics, industry, non-governmental organizations and government agencies. They took their own water samples, conducted laboratory analysis, did computer modeling of potential contamination, interviewed residents reporting water quality changes and negotiated with oil and gas companies to acquire proprietary well drilling data. The study was highly anticipated and in the months before its release in June 2015, a draft assessment was shared with top policymaking and public information officials, according to internal emails. A gas well pad in Dimock, PA. - Amanda Hrycyna for APM Reports Meetings involved White House advisers Candace Vahlsing and Dan Utech and officials from the Energy and Interior departments. Vahlsing and Utech declined to comment, a White House spokesman said. The findings included a 2010 chemical spill in Kentucky that killed threatened fish, a well blowout in North Dakota that resulted in chemicals potentially reaching a nearby aquifer and direct drilling into drinking water resources in Wyoming. The report concluded that 9.4 million people lived within a mile of a hydraulically fractured well between 2000 and 2013. The agency also reported 457 spills related to fracking in 11 states between 2006 and 2012. In 324 of those cases, the EPA said spills reached soil, surface water or ground water. A spreadsheet of those spills was included in the study. On the day of the release, when asked to quantify the risks of fracking, Burke demurred. The examples of documented contamination were overshadowed by the last-minute changes that shifted the tenor of the report. Some experts in hydraulic fracturing say the late edit exonerated the practice in the public eye. The agency had earlier abandoned its research into problems at Pavillion and turned the investigation over to the state. It was one of the three instances in which the EPA withdrew from investigating suspected contamination incidents in the past four years. The others were in Dimock, Pa., and Parker County, Texas. The agency did not include water testing data from those cases in its national study on drinking water. Near Dimock, Pa. - Amanda Hrycyna for APM Reports Study took pressure off industry McCarthy, the head of the EPA, said at the National Press Club last week that the agency will soon release the final study. During her remarks, McCarthy noted that the four board members with oil and gas ties dissented from the criticism of the phrase. The EPA has the authority to manage drinking water impacts to water resources and to oversee drinking water impacts through several federal laws, including the Clean Water Act and the Safe Water Drinking Act. But states largely oversee oil and gas development. The industry, heavily invested in continuing the practice, has steadily battled the EPA. The companies and their industry groups have also repeatedly said there have been no confirmed cases of groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing. If the study had emphasized major problems with the practice, it could have meant increased oversight by state regulators, a call for banning fracking in certain communities and even calls for additional federal oversight. Instead, the draft study took pressure off the industry. Nowhere did the draft state that there was no widespread, systemic impact on water. A version circulated internally in early June featured a headline emphasizing vulnerabilities to drinking water. Within a day, the Marcellus Shale Coalition from Pennsylvania put together a collection of TV news reports, all emphasizing the lack of impact and largely ignoring the vulnerabilities. Industry has battled EPA Today the oil and gas industry continues to use the study to advance drilling around the world. The Maryland Petroleum Council is highlighting the research as it pushes to allow fracking in that state. And earlier this month, the American Petroleum Institute, a lobbying group, urged the EPA to keep the language in the study. The American Petroleum Institute released its own industry-backed study confirming that hydraulic fracturing has led to no widespread, systemic impact to drinking water. Board member Thomas Young, a professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California-Davis, said he believes the phrase is misleading because the federal agency may not have found a widespread impact, but impacts could still be occurring. Young said he was unaware that the EPA had made last-minute changes to the study or the news release. He said he would have chosen different wording but understood the push to put a conclusion on a multiyear study that cost millions. Congress, the oil and gas industry and environmental groups would not have settled for a report simply calling for additional research, Young said. The study ran into a number of difficulties when it began five years ago. The EPA, for example, tried to work with oil and gas companies to conduct testing on sites before, during and after a fractured well is drilled. Despite pledges of cooperation from the industry, the EPA could never reach agreement with any company to conduct the tests. Puls said he left his position at the EPA in 2011 partly because he was frustrated with resistance by oil and gas companies to work with the EPA on the study. Many landowners who believe their water was harmed by hydraulic fracturing say the EPA let them down by minimizing the impact. Bill Ely is one of several dozen landowners in Dimock who noticed water was changing color once drilling started in their community in 2009. - Amanda Hrycyna for APM Reports A spokesman for Cabot did not return messages. Company officials have said that any problems with the water in Dimock occurred long before the company drilled in the area. Ely is one of several dozen landowners in Dimock who noticed water was changing color once drilling started in their community in 2009. The complaints from landowners placed Dimock at the center of the fight over the environmental safety of fracking. Movie stars and environmentalists visited the small, northeastern Pennsylvania town and called for the practice to be banned. Industry groups countered with analysis that the practice is safe and brings money and jobs to an economically depressed area. Since the first incident occurred in 2009, state and federal regulators became heavily involved in Dimock. More than a dozen other families settled with the company for an undisclosed sum. Cabot has not disclosed terms of its settlement with landowners. Attorneys for Cabot said in court that the methane leaking from the wells was occurring naturally and was a problem before the company drilled in the area. In 2012, the EPA conducted a study of private water wells of 64 homes in Dimock. But another federal agency, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, looked at the same data and concluded in June 2016 that chemicals in the water wells in 27 of the 64 homes were high enough to affect human health. Some landowners are still pushing for the government to do more. Every few weeks, Ray Kemble, who said he has one of those 27 homes, has to fill two 325-gallon tanks with water. The tanks, which sit in a shed outside his home, ensure he has clean water. His property, which sits across the street from a well pad, is covered with anti-fracking signs. Ray Kemble has to fill two 325-gallon tanks with water every few weeks to ensure he has a constant supply of clean water. His home is one of the 27 in Dimock that have a high concentration of harmful chemicals in their water wells. Drilling provides economic boost Though some landowners in the Dimock area are unhappy with fracking in the community, it has provided an economic boost. Cabot trucks can be seen regularly throughout the rural community and the company has a new corporate office in nearby Montrose. Cabot is among many companies to tap into the energy rich Marcellus Shale Formation that lies under parts of New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. Landowners are paid monthly, and drilling has increased employment in rural parts of the country. Jobs in the oil and gas extraction sector grew nationally by 33,600 between 2006 and 2016, government figures show. Bill Aileo, a homeowner in Dimock, said the natural gas boom has helped the community. He acknowledges that the fracking process, along with transporting and storing oil and gas, could release methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. The outgoing administration this month issued rules to prevent methane leaks on federal lands. Last Monday, Trump issued a video statement saying that energy issues, including fracking, will be a top priority when he takes office. Trump has appointed Myron Ebell, a climate change skeptic, to lead the transition at the EPA. The president-elect also has pledged to further deregulate the oil and gas industry, but his position on fracking has been contradictory. In September, he vowed to expand natural gas production from fracking and coal production, two competing energy resources. The disagreement over the environmental impact of fracking will continue in the Trump administration. The study is focused on an area that includes Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. They have grown suspicious about how the EPA handles fracking issues. It has been corrected.
