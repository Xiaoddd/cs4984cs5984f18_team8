Vela notes in the letter that he agreed with Trump on some policies, like improving veterans' care, addressing Mexican drug cartels and deporting criminal felons who are in the country illegally. But he also savages Trump for his rhetoric on those of Mexican descent and his promise to build a wall on the southern U.S. border. Vela then defended U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, the judge overseeing litigation related to Trump's education enterprise, Trump University. Trump has questioned Curiel's capacity for fairness based on his Mexican heritage. Curiel was born in Indiana. Vela then pointed out that his own family lineage in the United States goes back farther than Trump's paternal grandfather. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Vela further said on MSNBC that Trump is likely to lose Republican Hispanics in Texas. A request for comment from the Trump campaign was not immediately returned Monday. Because this is your Texas.
