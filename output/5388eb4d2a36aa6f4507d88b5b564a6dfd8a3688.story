The leak occurred Wednesday morning on the Magellan Midstream Partners pipeline in Worth County, Iowa, just outside Hanlontown, according to local news station KIMT. Worth County Sheriff Dan Fank said that the road has been closed so local and state authorities can deal with the damage, but there is no current danger to public health, KIMT reported. On the same day, the US Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced they had settled federal charges against Magellan related to three previous pipeline spills in Texas, Kansas and Nebraska. Magellan was formerly known as Williams Pipe Line Co. LLC. The complaint and consent decree filed on January 19 in the US District Court for Northern Oklahoma held the company responsible for a total of 5,177 barrels of petroleum products spilling into watercourses and thus violating the Clean Water Act. In February 2011, a Magellan-owned pipeline leaked 482 barrels of gasoline north of Texas City, Texas, contaminating the nearby Pierre Bayou. The consent decree mandated the company to aid in the cleanup of Jarvis Creek, which has still not been completed. The third incident happened in El Dorado, Kansas in May 2015, leaking 1,861 barrels of diesel fuel and affecting the nearby Constant Creek. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.
