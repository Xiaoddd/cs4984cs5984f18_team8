Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Petition to Declare Standing Rock a National Monument to Stop the Dakota Access Pipeline 0 have signed. The Political Revolution started this petition to President Barack Obama It is your duty as President of the United States to protect your people. You must protect the safety of Native Americans and their supporters who have gathered peacefully to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline. We stand up for the sovereign rights of Indigenous people to land. The Dakota Access Pipeline threatens to damage land held sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux and other Indigenous nations. We stand against violence and repression. Indigenous people have been facing cruel treatment from the United States Government and its leaders for centuries. We demand protection of our environment on which we rely on for life. The DAPL symbolizes our tendency to value crude corporate greed over environmental sustainability. Damage to the environment is felt globally. Water shortages, extreme weather, and temperature rises are problems we are all currently facing, and the devastation will continue to increase. The DAPL will release more carbon into the air, and risks endangering a source of fresh water for the Standing Rock Sioux and 8 million people living downstream. Forests are the lungs of our land, purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our people. Start a petition Start a petition of your own This petition starter stood up and took action.
