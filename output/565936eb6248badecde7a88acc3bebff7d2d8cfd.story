They are among 17 plaintiffs in a federal suit. She suspected he worked as a contractor for the private company that hopes to route a large natural gas pipeline through the region. Fern Shupe Echols, a daughter of a Tazewell County coal miner, is 76 years old. She can be alternately formidable, feisty and congenial. Her husband, Estial Earl Echols Jr., was a farm boy in Craig County who grew up to serve in the U.S. Army and manage service stations. Earl is 80 years old and frail. A flagpole in their yard displays an American flag and the banner of the U.S. Marine Corps, in which a grandson serves. Fern referenced a parable from the Old Testament when trying to explain how it feels to imagine losing her home to a pipeline company. The rich man owned many cattle and sheep. The poor man owned but one ewe lamb. He loved the precious lamb like a daughter. But when the rich man hosted a guest he was reluctant to kill any of his own cattle or sheep to feed the visitor. It would travel through rural Giles County and Newport. Perry Martin, a life-long resident, said Newport has launched a comeback in recent years, a rebound he said the pipeline would reverse. The Cumberland Gap Turnpike once passed through. Today, says Doug Martin, Newport itself faces a crossroads. As an interstate pipeline, the Mountain Valley project needs a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission certificate of public convenience and necessity before construction can begin. Olivet United Methodist Church, the Methodist Parsonage and the C.A. Hardwick house, both circa 1909. The recreation center, preschool and rescue squad building still would be within the zone as well. Sara Gosman, an assistant professor at the University of Arkansas School of Law who serves on the board for the Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit watchdog organization, said that even though the probability of serious ruptures of natural gas transmission pipelines is low, when failures do occur they tend to have high consequences. According to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, in 2014 there were more than 301,000 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines in the United States. There have been 1,315 significant incidents with pipelines from 1996 to 2015 and 46 associated fatalities. Eight of those deaths occurred in September 2010 after the rupture of a 30-inch diameter pipeline. The resulting fire destroyed 38 homes. The rupture was attributed to a poorly welded section of pipe. A unifying force During a Sunday morning service at the church on Nov. 13, Pastor Morris Fleischer briefly referenced the Mountain Valley Pipeline when he talked to the congregation about how faith can be an antidote to fear. During a separate interview, Fleischer said Mountain Valley might have underestimated both the resolve and sophistication of the rural community of Newport when it proposed a pipeline route through the village. They are methodical. The Greater Newport Rural Historic District Committee and its Ohio-based attorney, Matt Fellerhoff, contend that Mountain Valley and its contractors have not adequately inventoried the historic and cultural resources of the rural historic district or the Newport Historic District. As a result, the pipeline company has failed to fully identify the impacts of the project on these resources, the committee contends. FERC recommended that Mountain Valley not begin pipeline construction until after the completion of additional surveys and consultations. Fellerhoff said FERC should not approve the project before these issues are resolved. Natalie Cox, a spokeswoman for Mountain Valley Pipeline, responded. Perry Martin said historic preservation is vital, especially given that tourism helps drive the regional economy. Those projects have included a renovation of the Village Green and new arts programs, he said, along with a weekend food program for needy children and sports camps that invite children to participate without cost. The perceived threat of the Mountain Valley Pipeline has proved to be a unifying force, said Jean Porterfield, who lives on a farm near Newport that she said has been in her family for more than 200 years. Perry Martin, like Fleischer, said Mountain Valley might learn that routing the pipeline through Newport would be a mistake. The Echolses also have eight grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Fern Echols began by sharing her fears about having to leave the family home. She said a contractor working for Mountain Valley had told her she and Earl would likely have to move. Fern Echols then worried aloud about living within 65 feet of the 42-inch diameter pipeline transporting natural gas at high pressure. After the meeting that night, during the drive home, Cisek called Rick Elmore, a right-of-way agent for Coates Field Service, a contractor working for Mountain Valley Pipeline. Cisek, whose property could be affected by a pipeline access road, said Elmore told her that Friedman was wrong. Contacted this week, Elmore referred questions to Matt Clark of Coates Field Service, who did not return a phone call. Cox did not reply directly to a question about whether Mountain Valley has a policy about acquiring an entire property or just an easement in situations where the pipeline route comes close to a home. If FERC approves the Mountain Valley project, the company will have access to federal eminent domain to acquire easements across private property. Fern Echols worked 32 years at the Celanese plant in nearby Narrows, spinning yarn. She retired about 18 years ago. She still works part time at a daycare center at a Baptist church. The couple said they feel both powerless and perplexed about how a private pipeline company can take their property or acquire an easement across it without their consent. Their son Lloyd, 57, acknowledged he gets upset just contemplating the prospect of his parents losing their home. The Echolses also understand that another shift in the pipeline route could just bring heartache to someone else. Fern Echols said her faith sustains her. She references scripture from Exodus in which Moses tells the Israelites that the Lord will deliver them from the pursuing Egyptians. She said she hopes that someday soon the pipeline people will leave and let them live in peace.
