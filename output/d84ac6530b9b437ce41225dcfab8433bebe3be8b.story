Everything you need to know from the authority on music, entertainment, politics and pop culture. Donald Trump defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to become the 45th president of the United States. Yes, this is a poll, and polls are part of the reason we got into this mess in the first place. But polls still have some meaning, and the new one The Post cites should tell us a lot. Another recent poll, this one conducted by ABC News along with The Post, shows the Democratic advantage for the 2018 midterms narrowing to a dead heat among the most likely voters. As awful as Trump has been, and as near-total the chaos has been surrounding the Republican Party, the opposition has not been able to capitalize. In a divided country, Donald Trump makes perfect sense as a president. He does a fantastic job at keeping the civil war going, and the interest in ending that war for some time now has seemed limited to one or the other side hoping to capture the flag for a while. All we talk about is how much we hate Trump. If you want a million-ton dose of either, turn on MSNBC sometime. A Himalayan range of predictable messaging. And smart people watch it. All thought has been denuded in the past year. Despising Trump and his followers is easy. This country is broken. It is devastated by hate and distrust. What is needed is a massive effort at national reconciliation. It will have to be inspired, delicate and ingenious to work. Someone needs to come up with a positive vision for the entire country, one that is more about love and community than blame. That will probably mean abandoning the impulse to continually litigate the question of who is worse, Republicans or Democrats. As a progressive, this has never seemed to be a terribly difficult question for me to answer for myself. For some reason, though, people keep insisting that both the question and the answer must be included in any effort at punditry or any public political discussion, almost like a disclaimer, as if audiences might forget. It has become our version of a loyalty oath. When people are scared enough and full enough of hate, they will surrender their rights more quickly. This was made easier first because conservatives were convinced liberals were in league with terrorists, and more lately because progressives have been told Trump and his like are in league with Russians. Mutual hatred and fear has made us much more easily disenfranchised. We are on the brink of a kind of civil war, but even suggesting that this is an eventuality to be avoided is becoming almost treasonous in both camps. The people running the Democratic Party are opportunists and hacks, and for as long as the despicable and easily hated Trump is president, that is what these dopes will focus on, not realizing that most of the country is crying out for something different. Even making the country more funny would be a start. T-Day was exactly one year ago. It was an awful day, one of the worst ever for a lot of people. Sign up for our newsletter.
