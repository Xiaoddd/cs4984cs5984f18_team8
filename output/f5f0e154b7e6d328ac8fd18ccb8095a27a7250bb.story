This is a plan to end government as we know it. When Trump released his budget last spring, all reasonable people across the country declared in unison that it could not possibly be serious. The major cuts to the popular and important programs across the political spectrum would never be politically feasible. While Republicans dream about rolling back environmental protections, the truth is the GOP has never had the votes or public support to dismantle the bedrock achievements of the environmental movement. A push to return the country to the days before the Clean Air Act would almost certainly fail. The work that agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency do is popular and the effect of their work impacts communities across the country. SPONSORED Surely these cuts to programs that help protect the environment and public health would never survive Congress. But the seriousness of Trump's tax giveaway plan should reverse any notion that his budget was a farce. Republicans' ambitions to force Trump's extreme budget cuts on the American people runs through the new tax plan, which was passed by the Senate on Friday. There are plenty of reasons for people who value the environment to be horrified by Trump's tax plan, which is set to pump more carbon into the atmosphere and more profits into the wallets of polluters. The rule change would be a major reward for an industry that parked money overseas allowing them to avoid paying taxes on these profits. Middle-class families will never get such luxuries nor will they benefit from the giveaway. It's no lack of contrast that this bill would also gut the wind energy renewable energy tax credit, cutting it by 40 percent. Finally, this plan lets Big Oil keeps its most egregious tax giveaways and hands it a hefty cut to the corporate tax rate, guaranteeing that it will keep its place the most undertaxed and subsidized segments of our economy. Without enough votes to dismantle widely popular environmental protection laws, Republicans have set their sights on the next best thing: dismantling the widely popular agencies charged with enforcing them. As these cuts have taken place, we've seen the rich grow richer, the essential functions of government wear and break, the divide between the two parties grow and the overpowering political voice of corporations expand.
