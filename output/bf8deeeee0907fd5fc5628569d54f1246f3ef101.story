Judge Joel Medd signed the orders Tuesday for Michael Fasig and Israel Hernandez, who were charged with another co-defendant, Brennon Nastacio, after the October 2016 incident during protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Fasig and Hernandez each faced Class C felony charges of reckless endangerment and criminal mischief related to ramming the security guard's truck. They pleaded innocent and were set for trial earlier this month. Under their agreements, their charges were lessened to Class A misdemeanor counts of menacing and criminal mischief. He must also commit no crimes within the next year of suspended prosecution. If successful, the men's charges will be dismissed. Robert Bolinske, Hernandez's attorney, said the security guard's deposition affected the cases. Morton County Assistant State's Attorney Gabrielle Goter did not immediately return messages Thursday for comments. In July, Medd dismissed felony terrorizing against Nastacio due to doubtful statements from the security guard.
