Updated January 26, 2017 at 10:22 AM; Posted January 25, 2017 at 11:52 AM Donald Trump signs Keystone order President Donald Trump shows his signature on an executive order on the Keystone XL pipeline, one of several orders he says will help American workers and industry. WASHINGTON -- The Keystone XL pipeline stole the show Tuesday with President Donald Trump's executive order to proceed with the project that will pipe Canadian tar sands oil through the United States to Gulf of Mexico refineries. Trump's green light on that and the Dakota Access pipeline, which will pipe oil from the shale fields of North Dakota to Illinois, meant little directly for Ohio. He ordered the commerce secretary to develop a policy requiring U.S.-made steel for new and retrofitted pipelines. A potential long-term beneficiary is the Vallourec Star steel pipe plant in Youngstown, says Philip Bell, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Steel Manufacturers Association. The plant is owned by a French company, but the Youngstown workers are American. Here are some answers. Trump has nominated Wilbur Ross, a wealthy investor who used to scoop up distressed companies and restructure them, for commerce secretary. It is unclear what, exactly Ross will do in terms of this order. But Ross knows the steel industry. Ross bought the bankrupt Cleveland-based LTV Steel and several other companies and ultimately sold them to ArcelorMittal, extracting worker concessions but keeping steel mills running. That's to be seen. The Commerce Department, working with other government agencies, has up to 180 days to develop the plan and submit it to the president. Yes and no. Consider pledges made earlier for steel used in the Keystone XL pipeline. The builder, TransCanada Corp., said in 2012 that half of the pipe for the United States portions, or 332,800 tons, would come from a company in Arkansas, and the rest would come from Canada, Italy and India. The raw steel for the pipe, in other words, could have been melted and poured -- a labor- and financially intensive process -- anywhere in the world before being shipped to the United States for fabrication. That happens a lot, according to authorities on manufacturing. Nevertheless, the finished pipe still would have counted toward that old 50 percent pledge by TransCanada. That's why the Alliance for American Manufacturing says it hopes the Commerce Department will require that every step of the process occurs in the United States, supporting many more American workers. Yes. Miles of pipe was already laid for the Dakota Access project before it stalled amid Native American protests over environmental safety and proximity to sacred burial lands. As USA Today reported, 90 percent of the project is already completed across its four-state route. And only 57 percent of that steel is American-made, short of Trump's 100-percent goal. That's unlikely. Ohio ranks second in the country in steel production, behind Indiana, according to the Ohio Steel Council. It made 12 percent of the steel in the United States in 2011. The industry -- both raw steel and steel product manufacturing -- employed 115,000 Americans in 2011. Coming less than a week into Trump's presidency, the order signals that the president is serious about his campaign commitment to put American workers first. Brown has pushed to require that all government-funded projects use American materials if possible, but has failed to get the Republican majority in Congress to go along. Hold on. The order concerns pipes, so it is not an edict covering everything the government oversees. Republicans in Congress have gone along with exceptions from time to time, so this is not novel. A bigger debate could come when Trump presents a plan to rebuild the nation's roads and bridges, as he says he will. He has not released details. Some conservatives, and some businesses, say builders should have access to the best materials at the best price, period. It's why appliance manufacturers, for example, tend to fight trade decisions that could limit access to cheaper foreign steel. Not by itself. First, remember, most of the Dakota Access pipeline is complete. There also happens to be a surplus of cheap foreign pipe already sitting in warehouses and on docks, Bell said. These are all details the industry has not had time to assess. There could always be other pipeline construction, of course. But that will depend on energy prices -- and right now, low energy prices have suppressed demand for new pipelines and the necessary steel, authorities from steel and manufacturing interests say.
