Story highlights Kelcy Warren will host a music festival bearing a Native American Tribe's name Former festival performers have spoken out against the CEO (CNN)The billionaire CEO building the Dakota Access Pipeline will continue to hold a music festival bearing the name Cherokee, a Native American tribe. But there's a problem: Some artists are refusing to perform. Kelcy Warren, the founder and CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, the company trying to build the Dakota Access Pipeline, will continue to host the annual Cherokee Creek Music Festival at his Los Valles Ranch near Cherokee, Texas. The money raised by the festival will benefit Warren's nonprofit organization, Cherokee Crossroads, which raises money for children's charities through the annual festivals. In the past, it has supported charities such as St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and Ronald McDonald House of Texas. Former festival performers condemn Warren Artists who have played the festival in past years are now speaking out against Warren and have removed themselves from future lineups. The Indigo Girls, comprised of Amy Ray and Emily Saliers, played at the festival in 2013 and 2014. They wrote an open letter to Warren on their Facebook page to protest the pipeline. A number of past performers co-signed the letter along with the Indigo Girls, including Jackson Browne, Joan Osbourne, Todd Snider, Glen Phillips and Dean Dinning of Toad the Wet Sproket, Keb' Mo', Shawn Mullins, Shawn Colvin, Jess Klein, and Parker Millsap. Ray and Saliers are active supporters of Honor the Earth, a non-profit organization that raises awareness and financial support for Native environmental issues. They traveled to North Dakota in October to play a show and speak with members of the International Indigenous Youth Council. When they began posting their support online, a follower messaged them to bring their attention to Warren's involvement. Ray was disappointed by Warren's response, but hopes that their input can eventually change his mind. Warren fights back Warren wrote a response letter to the musicians, in which he says the artists are spreading misinformation about the pipeline. The letter goes on to counteract the protesters' arguments that the pipeline will intersect with sacred lands. In response to environmental concerns, Warren wrote that he is committed to protecting the environment throughout the pipeline's construction. Read the entire letter here. Musicians stand with Standing Rock On November 27, Jackson Browne, along with Bonnie Raitt, Jason Mraz, Joel Rafael, and John Tridell's Bad Dog, held a benefit concert in Fort Yates, North Dakota, which was free for Water Protectors. Proceeds from the concert will go to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe members protesting the pipeline through the winter. The album was produced by Music Road Records, a recording studio and record label founded by Warren. Scott Beasley, the festival manager, told the Dallas Observer that the festival will not be affected by recent events. We're almost their entire annual budget. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.
