I especially think of this quote after I watch the news to learn of story after story about unarmed black persons killed by cops . I watched the videos of their deaths circulate across social media without a thought of their families or the PTSD that would likely occur from watching one of your loved ones die or be beaten into submission. When I watched those videos I felt physically ill. I thought that despite the psychological pain that the videos caused me, it was my duty to be informed. This all changed when I woke up one week and learned of a new black death three days in a row. I turn to it when everything feels bleak, exhausting, and I feel scared. The truth is that I am petrified by the thought of living in an America that has chosen time and time again to not love me or the people who look like me. An America that favors whiteness and anything in proximity to it. An America that favors capitalism and the idea of the American Dream above the lives of People of Color, of a school to prison pipeline that keeps money in the hands of white elites and black men behind bars at alarming rates. We live in an America that is continually allowing the ugliest parts of history to repeat themselves. The burden is often on us to fight for our own communities and focus on the issues specific to us. And while I absolutely understand the importance of fighting for your own communities and working toward solutions that will help your individual communities prosper, I believe that as marginalized communities we are stronger when we stand together. An oil pipeline that the protectors say threatens their public health, welfare, and cultural resources. After the events of Sunday, November 21st, the protectors faced increased violence from police. There were water cannons used on them in freezing temperatures and tear gas. However, I know that just because I am in full support of the protectors that their story is not mine to tell. In fact, my only job is to share the voices and work of Native people and I work hard to do so. Keene was recently on the BuzzFeed podcast Another Round where they spoke of the conditions and the way it feels to watch live streams of the people they know and love being pepper sprayed and harmed. I know that my body is not strong enough to attend the protests and that I am not mentally and emotionally strong enough to attend these protests. I feel like I am not doing enough by tweeting and writing words about the way I feel in this current climate. I try my best to remind myself that quelling my voice helps no one. We cannot let this fall to the wayside and treat it as if it is a passing occurrence. It took courage to push back against the aforementioned violence and unequal rights put upon the leaders involved in the Civil Rights Movement. I stand with the protectors and the Black Lives Matter activists because we are simply stronger together. All rights reserved. When I watched those videos I felt physically ill.
