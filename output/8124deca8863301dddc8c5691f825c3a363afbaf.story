What's happening at Standing Rock is about protecting our water and the climate. Pipeline guards are assaulting the native Sioux Tribe and their allies with attack dogs and pepper spray and local police are trying to jail journalists. Thousands have peacefully gathered to stop a 570,000 barrel-per-day pipeline that would endanger the ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux. Demand that Wells Fargo divests from the Dakota Access Pipeline now. The DAPL was supposed to route near Bismarck -- but was rejected because of its proximity to municipal water sources. Without that capital, quite simply, there is no pipeline. Stop the money, stop a pipeline. Tell Wells Fargo to divest now. What we are bearing witness to at Standing Rock is a moment of history. Thousands are literally putting their bodies on the line to keep our world, our water, our soil and our air safe. We could feel that power when tens of thousands of SumOfUs members raised their voice and stopped the Keystone XL pipeline cold. Food & Water Watch. 6 September 2016. 13 September 2016.
