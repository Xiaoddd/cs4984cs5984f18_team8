ANF HANNOVER Thursday, 23 Aug 2018, 11:45 The local court in Hannover, Germany has issued a scandalous verdict with the reward-like sentence to Celal A., who had attacked the Kurds passing by a demonstration held by Turkish fascists in Hannover on September 12, 2015. The prosecution demanded 6 to 10 years in prison for Celal A. for the attempted murder of four people, but he had been walking free for the last 3 years despite the serious investigation and the indictment that had been prepared. One of the attendees of the demonstration was a fascist named Celal A., who worked as a taxi driver. A young Rojavan man named Mazlum Omer was stabbed at his neck and wounded seriously. Celal A. went to the police after the attack and turned himself in. He was released some time later to be tried without remand. Following the hearing that started on August 13, the Hannover court issued a verdict yesterday. Omer spoke to the ANF about the verdict the court issued regarding Celal A. and said it is absolutely unacceptable, and that they will continue to seek their rights. 29-year-old Omer lost a lot of blood at the scene and the medical intervention was delayed, so the wound caused a great deal of damage to his body.
