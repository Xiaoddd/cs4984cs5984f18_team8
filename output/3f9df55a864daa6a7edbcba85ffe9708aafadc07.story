Roshan Nebhrajani What began as a legal battle between the Sioux Tribe and the company building the Dakota Access Pipeline has turned into a movement that suggests something bigger is brewing. The police attack on an estimated 400 people included a barrage of rubber bullets, tear gas, concussion grenades, and pelts of icy water despite the freezing temperatures. At least 16 people were arrested on Monday after continued demonstrations. Pls share this. For months, the North Dakota Access Pipeline has been protested by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and members of nearly 100 other tribes from across the United States. Many non-Native activists have joined as allies, including environmentalist and founder of 350.org Bill McKibben, who is urging the American public to pay attention by reporting through his personal twitter page. The refrain of the protest is simple: clean water is not a political issue. From the contaminated drinking water in Flint, Michigan to the escalated urgency of the North Dakota Access Pipeline protests, this reality means problems surrounding clean water access are not likely to fade away quietly. The outcome of this battle, and the way it gets told, may set the stage for similar environmental and humanitarian disputes yet to come. For members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the pipeline is a major environmental and cultural threat. It has everything to do with language. The conflict for them rests firmly on the notion that this is yet another trespass sanctioned by the state against the Native American way of life. Tribes coming from the Brazilian Amazon seeking an American audience, too, are asking the public to do more to protect their way of life. For many of the members, it was their first time out of Brazil. They performed music to a crowd of over a hundred at the Tibet House. Their musical performance told the story of their disappearing ecosystem and language which belongs to the Panoan language family. Linguists estimate that approximately 1250 people speak it fluently. But younger generations are losing connection to the ancestral land and culture, opting to adapt to city life in hopes of greater economic gain. In the case of the North Dakota Access Pipeline, sacred ancestral land and clean drinking water is at stake. Both tribes are at odds with the dominant economic system. There is a documented correlation between the number of human languages present in an ecosystem, and the number of thriving animal and plant species. According to National Geographic, one language dies every 14 days. What is transpiring at the North Dakota Access pipeline is a battle of mindsets. A battle of narratives. Their conflict is urgent.
