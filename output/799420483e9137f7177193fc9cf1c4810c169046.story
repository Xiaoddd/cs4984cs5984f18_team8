An aerial view shows the darkened ground of an oil spill which shut down the Keystone pipeline between Canada and the United States, located in an agricultural area near Amherst, South Dakota. Chris Nelson, another commissioner, agreed. TransCanada did not immediately respond to a call for comment. Its website said it has cleaned up around 380 barrels of oil so far and that repair plans will be confirmed once it can safely excavate the pipe section that leaked. No restart date has been set. The South Dakota PUC issued the Keystone permit in 2007 with 57 conditions, ranging from construction standards to environmental requirements. It can revoke or suspend it if the company is found to have made misstatements in its application or does not comply with the conditions. The PUC expects a preliminary report about the spill from federal and state technical experts within the next 10 days. A more comprehensive analysis could take several months.
