More than 50 Dakota Access pipeline protesters sang their own versions of holiday classics outside the stadium where U.S. Bancorp Chief Executive Richard Davis, his clients and other bank executives were expected to attend. A U.S. Bank spokesperson declined to comment. The lyrics continued to list oil spills, sounds of grenades, water cannons and broken treaties, said Kathy Hollander, who revised lyrics to other traditional Christmas songs. Earlier in December, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers halted the multibillion-dollar project and told the company building the North Dakota pipeline that it cannot extend the project beneath a reservoir. They were met with mostly stares. Very few partygoers interacted with protesters; most rolled up their windows as those outside tried to hand them fliers. welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.
