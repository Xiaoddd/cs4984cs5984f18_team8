Dakota Access Pipeline Court Challenge Denied, Oil Could Flow As Soon As Next Week The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR America Dakota Access Pipeline Court Challenge Denied, Oil Could Flow As Soon As Next Week Facebook Twitter Flipboard Email March 7, 20174:37 PM ET Rebecca Hersher Twitter Enlarge this image A protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline on March 4 in New York City. In a decision on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg denied the tribe's motion for a preliminary injunction against the pipeline company. The tribes are arguing that the completion of the pipeline construction just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation endangers their drinking water source, part of the Missouri River called Lake Oahe, and that the pipeline has damaged cultural sites. The Two-Way Key Moments In The Dakota Access Pipeline Fight The pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners, has been drilling under Lake Oahe for weeks, and said oil could start flowing through that section of the pipeline as early as next week. Explaining he believed the tribes were unlikely to prevail in their lawsuit at this point, Boasberg denied their request to halt construction on the pipeline, or stop oil from flowing through it once it is complete. The plaintiffs have not announced any change to their legal approach to the case. In late February, North Dakota's governor ordered people camped near the construction site, some of whom had been demonstrating against the pipeline for months, to leave the largest encampment, citing flooding concerns as snow melted. The Two-Way Protesters Leave Dakota Access Pipeline Area; Some Stay And Are Arrested Others opposed to the pipeline have continued to protest elsewhere in the country. Over the weekend, a group of people gathered outside Trump Tower in New York City, some carrying signs advocating for the rights of indigenous Americans, and others expressing anger about President Trump's decision to allow the pipeline to go forward. On March 10, a coalition of groups is planning a demonstration in Washington, D.C., known as the Native Nations March.
