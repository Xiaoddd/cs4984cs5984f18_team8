The event was organized and hosted by Crow DogWidow. Perhaps the biggest surprise was the appearance of Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza, who asked permission to attend and speak. Elorza went on to list some of the plans he has for Providence to stand against Climate Change. And when they do, its ecological disaster. The event concluded with music from the Drum and the Eastern Medicine Singers. The views expressed are his own and not necessarily those of any organization of which he is a member.
