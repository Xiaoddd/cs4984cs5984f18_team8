Former Climate Hawks Vote ED, Campaign Manager for Forecast the Facts, ThinkProgress Green Editor at the Center for American Progress. Climate Hawks Vote, the California League of Conservation Voters, Fossil Free California, Courage Campaign, Daily Kos, Friends of the Earth, Green For All, Idle No More, Indigenous Environmental Network, Oakland Citywide Councilmember Rebecca Kaplan, People Demanding Action, and other allies organized a rally and public comment in support of divestment. Over 52,000 signatures in support of divestment from DAPL were delivered to the CalPERS board: 32,887 from Climate Hawks Vote members, 15,632 from California League of Conservation Voters members, 4,030 from Fossil Free California members, and 396 collected by Oakland City Councillor Rebecca Kaplan. In the days before the meeting, hundreds of Climate Hawks Vote members phoned and emailed the board members and CalPERS staff, asking them to support divestment. Sitting before a packed room of activists, the committee tabled a planned vote on whether to support divestment from the Trump-approved Dakota Access Pipeline. The staff recommendation had been to oppose divestment. Instead the committee decided continue discussions with Ash Kalra, the state legislator who has written AB 20, legislation which would mandate CalPERS divest from Energy Transfer Partners and companies involved in the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. CalPERS holds over 1.1 million shares of Energy Transfer Partners, the company constructing the pipeline. I personally traveled to Standing Rock in November to support the water protectors. And one of the ways we do it is with our money. California is leading the nation and the world in the fight against climate change and for a clean energy economy. The Trump-backed Dakota Access Pipeline is the exact opposite of everything that California stands for. A full transcript of the DAPL agenda item discussion and testimony can be seen here.
