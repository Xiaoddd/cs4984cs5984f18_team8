Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. The War and Peace Report. Their resistance has been met by increasing repression by hundreds of police officers from North Dakota and surrounding states, as well as by unlicensed pipeline security guards, who unleashed dogs and pepper spray against Native American protectors on September 3rd. The original charge against me was criminal trespass. Police have begun deploying military-grade equipment, including armored personnel carriers, surveillance helicopters, planes and drones. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple activated the National Guard in late September. Roughly 140 people have been arrested. This is Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle, a pediatrician on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: When I was taken to the jail, first I was taken by a corrections officer, transported from the protest site to the Morton County jail. And then, when they took me in there, you know, they had to take some basic information. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: No, not a cavity search, but I had to squat and cough. I had to squat and cough and then put the orange suit on. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: Yeah, I was put in an orange jumpsuit. And then I was held there for several hours. But I was in there for several hours. DR. She was charged with disorderly conduct. LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, who founded the first resistance camp, the Sacred Stone Camp, on her own land April 1st, says her daughter was recently arrested, taken into custody at the Morton County jail, strip-searched in front of multiple male officers, then left for hours in her cell, naked and freezing, before the guards finally gave her clothes to wear. Cody Hall from Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota says he was also strip-searched after he was arrested Friday, September 9th, held for three days without bail or bond, and then charged with two misdemeanors. CODY HALL: As I exited out of the vehicles and entered Morton County, I came up an elevator, and as the elevator opened up, I was met with state police. You know, they had my arms. They, you know, kind of like extend your arms out. And they have you, you know, lift up your genitals and bend over, you know, cough. CODY HALL: Yes, yes, I sat in the court office in my orange jumpsuit, locked, you know, still handcuffed, exited out of the courtroom. And then they literally had a line from the courtroom to the door that connects you to the county jail. And my mother walked out with me. And as we got to the door, they were opening the door up. And as I looked behind me, my mother and I, all of the cops then proceeded to kind of swarm, you know, like make, you know, that big wall as I entered in, which was, again, an overkill, you know, but that, too, though, to show a dominant force. AMY GOODMAN: That was Cody Hall, who was arrested on two misdemeanors, held for four days, strip-searched here at the Morton County jail just behind us. Winona LaDuke, Native American activist, executive director of the group Honor the Earth, she lives and works on the White Earth Reservation in northern Minnesota. She is Ojibwe from the Couchiching First Nation. We have spoken to you intermittently through this resistance. Right now there is about 900,000 barrels per day of oil coming out of this state, and they project that into 2019. AMY GOODMAN: The Dakota Excess. WINONA LADUKE: Dakota Excess pipeline. This is really about spites. Total misuse of the law, you know, and the president really needs to intervene and uphold the law. AMY GOODMAN: Tara Houska, you have been following these protests and the level of militarization in response to the protests. You were there on Saturday. We spoke to you at one of these peaceful marches of hundreds of Native Americans. These are women and children that are out there. They had Native Americans out there praying for the land. They put a tipi up in front of the actual pipeline route, and they called that a riot. AMY GOODMAN: Well, all for this pipeline. And Enbridge and Marathon Oil just bought a third of this pipeline. WINONA LADUKE: We fought them in northern Minnesota. We defeated that pipeline, and they came out here and moved out here. This is pretty much the Deep North. And in the meantime, Indian arrests have been consistent. Native people are treated like, you know, third-class citizens. And, you know, the governor is acting like this is Mississippi up here, and you can just do that. And now people are finally noticing. AMY GOODMAN: You know, after Ferguson, the whole country saw the level of militarization of local police departments. TARA HOUSKA: We did. You know, indigenous women went up there, and we offered the police water, sage and sweet grass, and, you know, trying to show that we are peaceful, that we are doing this for not only our children, but their children, too. This is a people issue. Water is a people issue. AMY GOODMAN: I want to talk about this issue of strip-searching, Winona. It is astounding to hear that even people, like the pediatrician for Standing Rock, Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle, was strip-searched for disorderly conduct. WINONA LADUKE: I would say that, generally, North Dakota is not good to Native people and is really behind the times in terms of constitutional and civil rights. You know, I mean, for many, many years, our people have had an undue burden of the legal system against them, and nobody has really paid attention. But it is wrong. TARA HOUSKA: I think that this state is reading the law as broadly as it can when it comes to violating the constitutional rights to free speech of these people. That matters more than any, you know, criminal trespass or these, you know, attempts to suppress and keep our voices down. These are U.S. citizens that are all here standing together. TARA HOUSKA: And seeing, I mean, local schools doing, you know, lockdowns when these protests are happening. AMY GOODMAN: This has just started happening. And the fact is, is that the people that are out here, you know, are trying to protect the water. And this is a chance to protect that water. AMY GOODMAN: There are a lot of people concerned that this is escalating to a very bad situation. WINONA LADUKE: Yes, I am concerned that they escalating it. Our people have consistently been praying. Our people have been consistently engaged in nonviolent direct action. And, you know, we had a forum in Bismarck this last week, and it was very well attended, because I think people in Bismarck want to know why all these cops are out there, what is going on, you know, why these people are coming in here. You know, it affects all of us. So, you know, it is time to say our civil rights, our constitutional rights are all being violated. WINONA LADUKE: That is right. I also have to say hello to my grandchildren and my children. Hearings are starting on that. So, I have to face that. And they are not going to get Line 3. And so they should move on. Do something real. I mean, North Dakota is a very rural state. And the police are a scary presence. And we see a Congress that deregulates the oil industry again and again and again. AMY GOODMAN: That was Tara Houska, national campaigns director for Honor the Earth. She is Ojibwe from the Couchiching First Nation. And before that, Anishinaabe activist Winona LaDuke, co-founder of Honor the Earth. Well, only hours after that broadcast, I learned Judge John Grinsteiner had refused to sign off on the riot charges against me, a major victory for press freedom. But since that victory, protectors and journalists have continued to get arrested in North Dakota. More than 400 people have been arrested. Stay with us.
