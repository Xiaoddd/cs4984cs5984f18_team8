MIKE MCCLEARY, TRIBUNE Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Nearly 40 years ago, a young journalist just out of Stanford University traveled to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North and South Dakota and started a newspaper. That reporter, Bill Grueskin, would run the Dakota Sun for two years, the first step in a news career that would lead him to The Miami Herald, The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News. That was in 1977. Bill Grueskin, a professor of professional practice at Columbia Journalism School, and Caroline, whose mother, Rosalind Resnick, is also a former Miami Herald journalist, sat down recently with Kyle Pope, the editor and publisher of Columbia Journalism Review, to talk about the synchronicity of their careers. Bill Grueskin: I graduated from Stanford with a degree in classics. A couple of months later, I got in my Jeep and drove to Standing Rock. One time I was in the local grocery store and I felt someone hit me in the back. I felt terrible. It taught me, you know, you have to sweat the small stuff as well as the big stuff. BG: Yeah, I thought it was. I still have those pictures of dozens of frozen cattle corpses with their hooves up in the air. It was an interesting story because it got at a well-intentioned government program going nowhere, leading to a lot of disappointment among both the tribe and the government. Caroline Grueskin: I just think it had this drab color and a lot of snow. I guess being kind of cold and bitter was the picture I had in my mind. CG: Some combination of Brooklyn, Manhattan, Westchester, N.J. Definitely a city girl. I went to a city prep school, ran around with friends in Manhattan. Pretty different from North Dakota. CJR: So you graduated from Stanford with a degree in philosophy in 2014. CG: I was interested in working on criminal justice reform. And that was how I ended up at the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news site that covers criminal justice. They hired me to be on the business side of the organization. While I was there, I thought that what everyone else was doing seemed way more fun. I wanted to be doing what they were doing. CG: My co-workers let me, on the side, do some reporting, develop a few clips so I could try to find a daily newspaper job. After several months, I decided I should start applying for jobs and found myself out here in North Dakota. CG: JournalismJobs.com. Literally, I was just scrolling through. I preferred a cops job or a courts job. I felt kind of vulnerable in telling him that. This was going to be, in some ways, kind of a fight for me to get that job. I start the day at the police station. I cover a lot of local crime. Even just today I was covering a house explosion and visiting with neighbors. CG: Oh, God. I have the Internet equivalent. People take the punch in the back on Facebook, writing about me when they think that I have not been sensitive enough. BG: I see the way Caroline gets trolled online. Part of it is because the Standing Rock protests are so divisive. CG: It is a little bit of a safety net knowing that my dad is going to read it.
