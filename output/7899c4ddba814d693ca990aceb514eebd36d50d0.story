The discovery of the pipeline spill in western North Dakota has drawn heightened attention because of the battle over the Dakota Access oil pipeline being built across the state. A portion of the proceeds will support the Coalition Against Pilgrim Pipelines NY, which is fighting plans for two side-by-side oil pipelines through six counties, including Greene, Ulster and Orange, from Albany to Linden, N.J. The concert will open with drumming and chanting by a local council of Native Americans. Although work on the Dakota Access Pipeline has been postponed, organizers are raising funds to support protesters at Oceti Sakowin Camp. Opponents, including the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, say the project threatens water and cultural sites. For testing on dev sites, you may need to turn it off with -1.
