The rally in Red Deer was originally planned as a protest before being changed at the last minute. Klym adds the issue is much broader than people realize. From a youth perspective, the University of Calgary student says a healthy future is on the line with what ultimately happens at Standing Rock. She also points out the Dakota Access Pipeline was originally supposed to go through a non-Indigenous community, which was changed due to the environmental hazards for that community.
