By then, national interest in Standing Rock had waned, and three Unicorn Riot reporters had already been arrested covering the protests. However, police didn't enter Oceti that day. Bismarck's Fox affiliate, embedded with law enforcement, was able to film in areas where other journalists faced arrest. But the bulk of the February 23 footage came from citizen journalists with cellphones and the ever-present Unicorn Riot. During a four-hour livestream that's been viewed 2.5 million times, Unicorn Riot filmed 200 officers with automatic weapons flanking Oceti, so that activists were forced to crowd dangerously onto a frozen river or risk arrest.

The camp, dubbed Sacred Stone, was already home to a few dozen activists, there to protest the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL) that they consider a threat to their water supply. Though the camp and its ensuing conflict with authorities became major news months later, at the time the caravan was covered by just two media outlets, the local Bismarck Tribune and a volunteer collective out of Minneapolis called Unicorn Riot. For almost a year, as water protectors held prayer ceremonies, established a school, and occasionally clashed with police, Unicorn Riot was on the ground, documenting it all. In October and November, when Standing Rock activists faced mass arrests and harsh police tactics, the mainstream media had little to no presence there, but outlets such as MSNBC, Reuters, VICE, Mother Jones, and RT featured footage from Unicorn Riot, as well as from personal livestreamers and drone pilots, who documented law enforcement macing activists and spraying them with water canons in subfreezing temperatures. Unicorn Riot remained in the camps when thousands of veterans showed up one chaotic week in December, when the Army Corps of Engineers denied the company behind the DAPL the easement it needed to finish construction, when the Standing Rock Sioux tribe asked the water protectors to leave, when the decision on the easement was reversed under the Trump administration, and finally, when the camps were cleared in February. By then, national interest in Standing Rock had waned, and three Unicorn Riot reporters had already been arrested covering the protests. On February 22, the official eviction date, large outlets like CNN, BuzzFeed, and ABC News were around to collect dramatic footage of Oceti, the main camp, burning, as activists destroyed structures before authorities could. However, police didn't enter Oceti that day. They primarily arrested journalists and legal observers standing on a state highway rather than the activists remaining in camp. The true clearing didn't begin until the following day. Bismarck's Fox affiliate, embedded with law enforcement, was able to film in areas where other journalists faced arrest. But the bulk of the February 23 footage came from citizen journalists with cellphones and the ever-present Unicorn Riot. During a four-hour livestream that's been viewed 2.5 million times, Unicorn Riot filmed 200 officers with automatic weapons flanking Oceti, so that activists were forced to crowd dangerously onto a frozen river or risk arrest. Unicorn Riot footage from the eviction: Unicorn Riot is part of an emerging movement of leftist, largely self-trained media outlets and voices. And as Standing Rock illustrates, there are times when groups like Unicorn Riot can be more effective than the larger, less nimble, Establishment outlets whose narrative they compete against. Other people who covered Standing Rock are indigenous themselves, like Myron Dewey, a 44-year-old member of the Paiute and Shoshone nations. He's been charged with stalking for tracking DAPL security by drone; he's also mentored another group of water protectors who, in December, formed Women's Indigenous Media. Mark Trahant, a journalism professor at the University of North Dakota, believes that as resources for traditional newsrooms dwindle, Americans may have to rely on more passion-driven coverage. Trahant remembers 1973, when the American Indian Movement occupied the town of Wounded Knee for 71 days. They set up small newsrooms. Big papers no longer have the staff to thoroughly cover every important protest, and local outlets have their own budgetary woes. That means the people covering these movements are often those who are sympathetic to them. Members of the collective don't organize or participate in demonstrations, even if they did in the past, said producer Niko Georgiades, who has made a conscious effort to separate himself from demonstrators. They are. A Unicorn Riot clip from Standing Rock: Unicorn Riot formed in early 2015. It was a dozen friends and friends of friends based in Denver, Minneapolis, Boston, and New York, who had documented Occupy, Ferguson, and other movements for other outlets and were frustrated at their lack of autonomy. More structured work, such as document-based articles and video packages, must be approved by two members before it goes online. Members volunteer their time and cover what they want, from community gardening to criminal justice. Unicorn Riot gained a local audience reporting the 18-day occupation of a Minneapolis police precinct following the killing of unarmed black man Jamar Clark. Their DAPL-related posts regularly receive hundreds of thousands of views. It's just the bias that's central to how society operates, and a lot of people don't examine it. Even the idea that an outfit like the Morton County Sheriff's Department should have legitimacy is up for debate. They're on land that treaties show is stolen. I saw them personally in action. Others have suffered physical injuries. Eric Poemz sustained a broken pelvic bone when he was tackled by officers while livestreaming the Oceti eviction. He believes police tried to shoot his camera out of his hand. Video Ziegler filmed while being shot in the hand: Other media outlets with a prominent place at Standing Rock included Indigenous Rising, created under the umbrella of the more established Indigenous Environmental Network, and the informal Renegade Media Collective, which operated out of a tent in Sacred Stone and posted a combination of straightforward documentaries and heavily edited (slow motion, emotional music) pieces that proselytized as much as they informed. Unlike Unicorn Riot, many livestreamers do consider themselves activists. But several of these independent outlets have filmed clips that mainstream media has broadcast repeatedly (and sometimes without credit or permission). When news breaks unexpectedly, often it's the independent livestreamers who are there to capture it. On November 20, the night cops used water cannons on Standing Rock protesters, both Renegade Media and Unicorn Riot came out with raw videos of the clashes between water protectors and the authorities. Trahant admits that he was glued to livestreams that night. A documentary from Renegade Media: Unicorn Riot plans to continue telling stories on social media, but it also has more ambitious goals. The collective is cutting together a documentary about Standing Rock, and producers are tackling investigative pieces, such as a 15,000 word series on the trial of Allen Scarsella, the white supremacist who shot five people during the Jamar Clark demonstration. This means members will be paid, but they don't plan to change their horizontal structure or make more editorial decisions in a more traditional way. The founders of Women's Indigenous Media hope it will mature into an educational nonprofit, teaching women to fly drones and become content creators. Core members of Renegade Media just moved into a shared living space and are focusing on making a documentary about government infringement on constitutional rights. They are also recruiting Renegade contributors in different cities. Other livestreamers, particularly those who cut their teeth on Occupy and later covered demonstrations against police brutality, will go home and work day jobs and wait for the next mass movement. For all of them, the goal is to create a truly independent media, with or without financial backers.
