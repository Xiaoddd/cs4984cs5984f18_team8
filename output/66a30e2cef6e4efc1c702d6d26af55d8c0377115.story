Of course Trump his fair share of investments, but there is (at least) one in particular that is problematic given current events. According to The Hill, it seems the new President of the United States owns quite a bit of stock in Energy Transfer Partners. Big deal, you say. Yes, that is the project that is on hold because of the Standing Rock protests where Native Americans are being tear gassed, shot at with rubber bullet and sprayed with water in freezing weather for their efforts in fighting climate change and defending their land and the water of the Missouri River. Sharon Buccino of the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental group tells AP that there is no way that he can. One person is counting on Trump to be completely biased when it comes to the pipeline. That person is the CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, Kelcy Warren. Of course. Some of those issues could be minimized by putting his assets in a blind trust which is something that Trump seems to be resisting.
