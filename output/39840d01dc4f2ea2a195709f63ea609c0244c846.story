Sanders bears some responsibility for attracting this invective. This point is both accurate and necessary. This context is critical for understanding the post-election, intra-left debate over identity politics. In recent days, liberal Democrats have rightly rejected calls for the party to abandon its advocacy for the identity-based concerns of marginalized groups. As a candidate, he took steps to repudiate the black left. As president, he reinforced the trend toward mass incarceration and enshrined discrimination against LGBT Americans within federal law. Rather, he and his sympathizers are concerned with a strain of corporate-friendly liberalism that deploys identity-based critiques of class politics as tools for obscuring the divergent material interests of rich and poor Democrats. For the left to overcome its infighting and realize the promise of the rainbow coalition, it will need to be on guard against this particular brand of liberalism; because an identity politics that disdains class solidarity is one that will fail the most vulnerable members of the marginalized groups it claims to represent. A tale of two parties. In his race against Mitt Romney, Obama won 45 percent of all ballots cast by Americans with six-figure salaries. Democrats still do better with the working class than with the rich; but this is becoming less and less true. In other words: The class divide within the Democratic Party is growing at the same time that the divide between classes in the United States is doing the same. racism), to obfuscate the divergent material interests of rich and poor Republicans. To the extent that the Clinton-Sanders race was a debate about domestic policy (as opposed to personal competence), it was a debate about whether the government should drastically increase taxes in order to fund a massive increase in social spending. Sanders argued in the affirmative, contending that the government has a moral responsibility to guarantee health care to every citizen and access to higher education for every adolescent with the intellectual aptitude to pursue it. After all, the Democratic primary is not a referendum on federal policy, but a means of selecting a candidate to send into a high-stakes general election. Clinton asked a crowd in Nevada this past February. Of course, there are literally no policies that could satisfy these criteria. This ambiguity reflected the fact that the characterization was transparently false. To take just one example, Sanders campaigned in support of the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, a Senate bill with 21 Democratic co-sponsors that guarantees 12 weeks of paid family leave to full-time employees, funded by a slight increase in the payroll tax. It was an objection to the politics of class solidarity. Policies aside, Sanders was rarely eloquent in connecting his economic message to the lived experience of black voters. The problem with class-blind identity politics. At a debate in February, Sanders was asked if he thought race relations would improve under his administration. She still ended up dead. But her specific critique is unsatisfying for a few reasons. (To take just one example, the uninsured rate among African-Americans is roughly twice that of whites, while the rate for Latinos is nearly four times as high. Those ratios have declined significantly since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but they could be all but eliminated by a truly universal, Medicare-for-all system). Certainly, reforms that directly combat police violence are urgently needed. In fact, African-Americans who are given opportunities for economic advancement have a far lower (while still far too high) risk of being victimized by our (profoundly racist) criminal-justice system. Black men who lack high-school diplomas are roughly ten times more likely to be incarcerated than those who complete college. And African-American men with college degrees have a lower risk of being incarcerated by the time they reach their mid-30s than do white men who lack high-school diplomas. But Blow is entitled to an idiosyncratic worldview. His response to those who encouraged him to see our current tax rates in historical context, however, was more troubling. You can feel free to return to the 1930s. No writer should be judged by his or her weakest tweets, and Blow is an incisive commentator who would likely frame his argument more cogently given more time and characters. Any discourse that encourages working-class voters to see social democratic policies as irrelevant to their struggles does more to protect economic privilege than to promote social justice.
