Myers, U.S. Attorney for the District of North Dakota Goal: Investigate alleged police brutality against Dakota Access Pipeline protestors, particularly the case of Sophia Wilansky, who may have been injured by a concussion grenade. Sophia Wilansky, a 21-year-old protestor at the site of the Dakota Access Pipeline, may lose her arm after suffering severe injuries during a police standoff. Wilansky had been in North Dakota for three weeks protesting the pipeline, before her injuries required her to be evacuated to a hospital in Minneapolis. According to her father, Wayne Wilansky, the best-case scenario now is that she will regain 10-20 percent functionality of her arm, though amputation is still a possibility. Although her case is particularly heartbreaking, Sophia Wilansky is only one of hundreds of protestors who were injured in the latest showdown with the police, and one of at least 26 who had to be hospitalized. This young woman deserves justice, as do the hundreds of others who have been terrorized for exercising free speech. Sign the petition to demand that the District Attorney investigate police brutality against protestors at Standing Rock, and seek justice for Sophia Wilansky. PETITION LETTER: Dear Mr. District Attorney, I am writing on behalf of Sophia Wilansky, one of the protestors at Standing Rock who is now suffering from severe injuries sustained during a police standoff. Furthermore, sources close to Wilansky believe that her evacuation to a hospital may have been delayed due to the barricade on the bridge just north of the encampment, which is where the skirmish took place. I urge you to get to the bottom of this case, and to fully investigate police brutality and excessive force used against protestors at Standing Rock. Sophia Wilansky deserves justice, as do the countless other activists in North Dakota exercising their constitutionally protected right of free speech and standing up for what is right.
