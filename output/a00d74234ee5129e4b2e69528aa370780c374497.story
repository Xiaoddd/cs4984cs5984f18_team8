Though the project has been given the president's seal of approval, there is still a substantial amount of red tape for TransCanada to cut through before the pipeline can be completed. The Canadian company still needs state permits from Nebraska, Montana and South Dakota through which the pipeline will run. They now also have to contend with this legal challenge filed Thursday. Environmental groups that have opposed the project from the beginning are now sticking to their guns. A plethora of environmental groups filed the legal challenge in Montana claiming that more environmental scrutiny is needed. They are concerned that the pipeline could potentially contaminate ground and surface water. The groups include the Center for Biological Diversity, Bold Alliance, Friends of the Earth, Northern Plains Resource Council, Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club. The coalition say that an environmental review of the pipeline, completed in 2014, is inadequate and outdated and that it minimizes or ignores significant environmental impacts of the project.
