They would like a chance to show otherwise, and one of them, Cindy Capwell, wrote my office to extend the invitation. My colleague Thomas Feyer, who oversees the letters to the editor, says the influx from readers is one of the largest since Sept. 11. Readers are also taking to the comments section of Times articles to talk about it, says the community editor, Bassey Etim. Others are calling into customer care at multiple times the usual rate. They have a variety of concerns, including the election coverage. Last week, President-elect Donald J. Trump jumped in, tweeting that The Times had lost thousands of subscribers since the election. The paper says quite the opposite is the case: It reports having the largest one-week subscription increase since the first week of the digital pay model, in 2011. I assume that The Times has more accurate data than Trump. Because from my conversations with readers, and from the emails that have come into my office, I can tell you there is a searing level of dissatisfaction out there with many aspects of the coverage. Readers complain heatedly and repeatedly about the forecasting odometer from The Upshot that was anchored on the home page and predicted that Hillary Clinton had an 80 percent chance or better of winning. And they complain about the liberal tint The Times applies to its coverage, without awareness that it does. But the media is at fault too, for turning his remarks into a grim caricature that it applied to those who backed him. What struck me is how many liberal voters I spoke with felt so, too. They were Clinton backers, but, they want a news source that fairly covers people across the spectrum. The national desk of The Times has correspondents around the country, and they filed a steady stream of compelling stories from voters between coastal America. And yet between the horse race and the campaign drama, much of their work was simply drowned out. That left many of the readers I spoke with feeling like The Times was a swirl of like-mindedness. Still, too many of the voices, of both the regular columnists and even guest writers, are from people with similar views. Judy Barlas of Silver Spring, Md., raises a different issue. She supported Bernie Sanders in the primary. But she told me she saw evidence early on that The Times believed Clinton would win the nomination and kept pushing that scenario. It anticipated an outcome, and it stuck with it. I suspect that gesture soothed some readers, but many others were expecting more of an apology. And some were repelled by what they described as a self-congratulatory tone and what several viewed as a lack of sincerity. Chavi Eve Karkowsky, an obstetrician in New York City, saw the letter through the lens of her own profession. Karkowsky would have preferred a real apology, she said, and some sense that The Times was looking inward. WHAT struck me most as I spoke with readers is how much, to a person, they had something to say that was smart and reasonable. I found myself wishing someone from the newsroom was on the line with me, especially to hear how many of the more liberal voters wanted more balanced coverage. Not an echo chamber of liberal intellectualism, but an honest reflection of reality. I also hope someone will pay a visit to Cindy Capwell and her friends in North Carolina.
