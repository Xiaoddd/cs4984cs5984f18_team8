This specific pipeline is managed by Sunoco logistics (Sunoco logistics is a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners Limited) and burst last month after heavy rainfall in Pennsylvania. due to a significant pressure drop of the pipeline itself. Sunoco had to then shut the pipeline down. Customers have since been warned and discouraged from using water from the river just in case. This could be much worse than imagined as the Susquehanna was previously declared the third most endangered river in the United States by the NGO American Rivers. If it becomes contaminated it will surely move up on the list. Fracking is said to pose one of the greatest risks our rivers here in the US has faced in decades. While heavy rains are the write off reason behind this spill it is apparent that Sunoco does a poor job of managing pipelines as pipelines managed by them have been known to spill much more frequently than other. These pipelines are a serious issue. Officials are now saying that sampling is showing no sign of contamination near the area. Statements have been made speculating that the flood waters at the time of the leak were so heavy that the leaked fuel was diluted as it flowed downstream. Jeff Shields, Sunoco spokesperson says that investigations will continue in order to determine an exact amount of gasoline released.
