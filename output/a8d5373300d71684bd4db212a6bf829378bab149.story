Jump to Navigation Sign a Petition Sign Sign In We the people ask the federal government to Call on Congress to act on an issue: Demand Trump provide his tax returns alongside his birth certificate Created by B.M. on February 26, 2017 Signature Count 1 signed 100,000 goal As someone who whined about a ridiculous rumor and demand a legitimate President provide his birth certificate on top of his already provided tax returns, Trump could at the very least do as nearly every modern day President has and release his tax returns. He should then provide his birth certificate for good measure along with an apology to President Obama as well as the American people.
