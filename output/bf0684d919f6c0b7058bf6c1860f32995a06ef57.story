Just having walked down a nearby hill, the 23-year-old maintained some distance from the frontline protesters gathered near two burnt vehicles and razor wire barricades separating them from police. Protesters tried moving one of the burnt vehicles earlier on Backwater Bridge to have a quicker route to a nearby hospital, according to Badger. Recording a Facebook Live stream, Badger moved away from the canister, but law enforcement officials began launching more. She grabbed her goggles, but there was still enough time for the smoke make it to her eyes. It was just a small example of what protesters of the Dakota Access Pipeline were experiencing at the Oceti Sakowin Camp. Badger describes how during that night, Nov. 20, protesters like Sophia Wilansky had her arm severely wounded from a concussion grenade spewing out several rubber bullets. Badger has been relatively new to the protest scene. She got her start during the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. As a delegate ready to cast her vote for Bernie Sanders, Badger, along with other Sanders supporters, protested speeches supporting the eventual Democratic Nominee Hillary Clinton and organized a walkout from the convention center. One of those issues that Badger has become consumed with was her pre-existing interest in preserving the environment. Local native American tribes argue the pipeline could contaminate water supplies and interfere with religious practices. Her attendance at a Los Angeles protest against the pipeline is where the idea emerged for traveling over a thousand miles to support the protesters in person. Photo by Robert Spallone. Staying at a nearby casino as a way not to take resources from the camp, Badger quickly became involved in the cause. The morning after the tear gas incident, Badger was back to protesting. She had already signed up for an undisclosed direct action. Water protectors offered seminars on how to be respectful of camp grounds and there were opportunities for protesters to help prepare the camp for the upcoming winter. Badger decided to seek training on how to safely engage in nonviolent forms of resistance at the camp. She was shuffled into a car with other protesters who drove for an hour without having any idea where she was headed. With a phone number written on her arm for a legal tent located inside the Oceti Sakowin Camp in case of her own arrest, Badger began recording officers zip tying protesters hands and bringing them into the building. On Feb. 23 the campsite had been cleared out after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to move ahead with pipeline the month of his inauguration. At least 46 people were arrested at the camp during its evacuation, according to authorities. Now her efforts have begun to focus on urging people to divest from banks funding the pipeline.
