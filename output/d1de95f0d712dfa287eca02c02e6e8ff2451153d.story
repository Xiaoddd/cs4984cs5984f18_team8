Emanuel and his parents, Noel Zayas and Melvis Vizaino, arrived in Miami from their native Villa Clara in central Cuba about three weeks ago on a medical visa. The family has been staying at the Ronald McDonald House near Jackson Memorial, where Melvis Vizaino said the staff has made them feel welcome. But Marx knew, because he has operated on patients with large facial tumors in the past, including Marlie Casseus, a Haitian woman who had a 16-pound tumor removed from her face at Jackson Memorial more than a decade ago. Emanuel was born in Cuba with a rare disorder called polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, which causes his body to develop scar-like tissue instead of bone. The disorder often causes fractures and deformities of the arms, legs and skull. Noel Zayas said Emanuel was diagnosed with the disorder at age 2, when the bone in his hips began to fragment, causing his left leg to deform as he grew. He said that an American missionary had met Emanuel in Cuba and asked his parents for permission to help. The surgical team must be careful to remove the entire tumor so it does not return, Marx said. Afterward, Emanuel will need more surgeries to reconstruct his cheek, jaw and other facial features, and to implant prosthetic teeth. Marx said doctors are volunteering their time and expertise. Marx said first thing Emanuel will notice after doctors remove the tumor is that his vision will improve. Vizaino said Emanuel gets along well with his friends, and that he was very active before the tumor, though he needed crutches to walk. Emanuel now uses a wheelchair. C.M. GUERRERO.
