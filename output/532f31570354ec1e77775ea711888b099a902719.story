I saw these words in bold letterpressed signs, t-shirts, and bright graffiti along roadsides. Such strong reactions were in response to Senate bill S.2109, also known as the Navajo-Hopi Little Colorado River Water Rights Settlement Act of 2012. This bill proposed that the Navajo and Hopi Nations would waive rights to the Little Colorado River in exchange for the Bureau of Reclamation piping clean drinking water into tribal homes. I wondered. The corporate interest in the water was not new or surprising, yet it heightened community outrage and protest. Fortunately, the bill was never enacted. Yet they continue to be beleaguered by threats of contamination, waste, and legislative robbery of what little water they have. The people of Standing Rock Reservation and their allies have stood solid in prayer to face lines of armed police who used attack dogs, tasers, tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons, and sonic weaponry to silence this undeniable truth: Mni Wiconi. I have heard these words many times. Without water, there is no life. Simple. True. Resonant, down to our very cells. It hurts to watch outright violence by law enforcement and, equally so, the casual dismissal of urgent community voices by onlookers and passers-by. But I drank in these videos with amazement. Fire. In concentric circles around them, I see our women. Our men. Elders. Allies. I have considered why I feel devastated by our losses as much as I feel bolstered and empowered. A gathering of artists, all of whom are Native women, presented written and musical pieces in honor of this land, its water, and the people working to protect it. Artists included Natalie Diaz, Heid Erdrich, Louise Erdrich, Jennifer Elise Foerster, Joy Harjo, Toni Jensen, Deborah A. Miranda, Laura Ortman, and myself. Here, we offer a selection of works shared that night to a room tossed by waves of emotions and questions. except to say that I know, we all know, it will take more. And toward this, our work continues. Every acorn, every hickory nut, a tobacco tie hung in the trees; they call out to us come harvest your prayers. This planet is a prayer. Each icy night under floodlights and water cannons she offers up moon and stars, a holiness of cold. Then redefine prayer: it is clothing frozen to the bodies of warriors who do not carry any other weapon against water cannons; it is eyes swollen shut with tear gas, a relative holding a bottle of saline solution; it is the ferocious flower left behind by a rubber bullet blossoming on the face of a woman who is, in the end, made wholly of prayer, her spirit an impenetrable vessel carrying prayer out to the edges of camp where armed officers try to hold prayer at bay, as if prayer were a rabid bear or a pack of wolves that must be isolated, beaten, eradicated because prayer is contagious prayer is that dangerous prayer rages like a bonfire no fire hose can quench. Every acorn, every hickory nut, a tobacco tie swaying in the trees; they cry out to us come harvest your prayers come pound them into meal come mix them with river water come cook them on this blazing rock: oh people, come feast on this prayer so righteous it burns your tongues; wash it down with a sip from the river whose songs will always call you Beloved. Sharp blue sky over green and yellow tall grass that rises and falls like water in the North Dakota wind. Magpie Road holds no magpies, only robins and partridge and crows. A group of magpies is called a tiding, a gulp, a murder, a charm. When the men in the pickup make their first pass, there on the road, you are photographing the grass against sky, an ordinary bird blurring over a lone rock formation. They wear camouflage, and their mouths move in animation or argument. They have their windows down, as you have left those in your own car down the road. Magpie Road lies in the middle of the 1,028,051 acres that make up the Little Missouri National Grasslands in western North Dakota. Magpie Road is part of the Bakken, a shale formation lying deep under the birds, the men in the truck, you, this road. There, just off Magpie Road, robins sit on branches or peck the ground. A group of robins is called a riot. This seems wrong at every level except the taxonomic. Robins are ordinary, everyday, general-public sorts of birds. They seem the least likely of all birds to riot. In the Bakken at the height of the oil and gas boom, violent crime, for example, increased by 125 percent. When the men in the truck make their second pass, there on the road, the partridge sit in their nests, and the robins are not in formation. They are singular. No one riots but the colors. The truck revs and slows and revs and slows beside you. You have taken your last photograph of the grass, have moved yourself back to your car. The truck pulls itself close to your car, revving parallel. You are keeping your face still, starting the car. You have mislabeled your imaginary photograph. These men, they are not father and son. At close range, you can see there is not enough distance in age. One does sport camouflage, but the other, a button-down shirt, complete with pipeline logo over the breast pocket. They are not bird hunters. The one in the button-down motions to you out the window with his handgun, and he smiles and says things that are incongruous with his smiling face. II. In the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, a floorhand shuts the door to his hotel room, puts his body between the door and a woman holding fresh towels. A floorhand is responsible for the overall maintenance of a rig. He says it over and over, into her ear, her hair, while he holds her down. She says it to you, your ear, your hair. She hates that word now, she says, company. A floorhand is responsible for the overall maintenance of a rig. A floorhand is responsible. In a hotel in Texas, in the Permian Basin, you call the front desk and report on the roughneck in the room upstairs. You dial zero while he throws her and picks her up and starts again. Or at least, one floor down, this is the soundtrack. Upon his departure, the man uses his fist on every door down your hall. Sound, like so many things, operates mostly through a downward trajectory. At a hotel where South Dakota and Wyoming meet, you are sure you have driven out of the Bakken, past its edge, far enough. That highway that night belongs to the deer, and all forty or fifty of them stay roadside as you pass. You arrive at the hotel on caffeine and luck. Two roughnecks stagger into your line of sight, one drunk, the other holding up the first while he zips his fly. As in, Stake down your tent fly against the winter snow, against the rubber bullets, against the sight of the riot gear. You cannot risk more roadside deer, and so despite all your wishes, you stay the night. A group of deer is called a herd; a group of roe deer, a bevy. There is a bevy of roe deer in the Red Forest near Chernobyl. The Bakken is not Chernobyl because this is America. The Bakken is not Chernobyl because the Bakken is not the site of an accident. The Bakken is not Chernobyl because the Bakken is no accident. III. On Magpie Road, the ditch is shallow but full of tall grass. With one hand, the button-down man steers his truck closer to your car, and with the other, he waves the handgun. He continues talking, talking, talking. Once on a gravel road, your father taught you to drive your way out of a worse ditch. By then you can see the highway, and the truck is beside you on the dirt road, and the truck turns right, sharp across your path. So you brake then veer left. You veer out, onto the highway, fast, in the opposite direction. Left is the direction to Williston. So you drive to Williston, and no one follows. You have heard about this, how girls are traded here. You spend those thirty-eight minutes driving around the question of violence, of proximity and approximation. IV. At Standing Rock, the days pass in rhythm. You sort box upon box of donation blankets and clothes. You walk a group of children from one camp to another so they can attend school. The night before the first walk, it has rained hard and the dirt of the road has shifted to mud. The dirt or mud road runs alongside a field, which sits alongside the Cannonball River, which sits alongside and empties itself into the Missouri. Over the field, a hawk rides a thermal, practicing efficiency. After school but before the return walk, the children and you gather with hundreds to listen to the tribal chairman, to sit with elders to pray, to talk of peace. That afternoon, you walk the children home from school, there on the road. You cross the highway, the bridge, which lies due south of the Backwater Bridge of the water cannons or hoses. But this bridge, this day, holds a better view. The canoes have arrived from the Northwest tribes, the Salish tribes. They gather below the bridge on the water, and cars slow alongside you to honk and wave. Through their windows, people offer real smiles. That night, under the stars, firelit, the women from the Salish tribes dance and sing. Watching the sunrise rake across stones I think about stories superimposed, all these bodies passing through each other. Fresh hay for horse feed; tipi poles; propane. Hours like dull gold blow across the prairie. Oatmeal, canned beans. Garlic salt, hominy. White, brown, or wild rice. A queen travels to the inner reaches alone, by foot, lanterns clicking through grass. I carry a river. This is not metaphor. We are telling a story of our existence. The river runs through the middle of my body. So far, I have said the word river in every stanza. I must preserve the river in my body. In future stanzas, I will try to be more conservative. Colorado, the name they gave our river because it was silt-red-thick. Natives have been called red forever. I have never met a red native, not even on my reservation, not even at the National Museum of the American Indian, not even at the largest powwow in Parker, Arizona. I live in the desert along a dammed blue river. This is a poor translation, like all translations. I have never been true in America. America is my myth. When Mojaves say the word for tears, we return to our word for river, as if our river were flowing from our eyes. A great weeping, is how you might translate it. Or, a river of grief. The word for drought is different across many languages and lands. No matter what language you speak, no matter the color of your skin. I do not mean to imply a visual relationship. We carry the river, its body of water, in our body. I do not mean to invoke the Droste effect. I mean river as a verb. A happening. It is moving within me right now. This knowing comes from acknowledging the human body has more than six senses. The body is beyond six senses. Is sensual. Is always an ecstatic state of energy, is always on the verge of praying, or entering any river of movement. Energy is a moving like a river moving my moving body. In conversation, we often use a shortened form for each: mat-. Unless you know the context of a conversation, you might not know if we are speaking about our body or our land. You might not know which has been injured, which is remembering, which is alive, which was dreamed, which needs care, which has vanished. The third point of the triangle being what lay behind the words of the original text before it was written. True translation demands a return to the pre-verbal. We must go to the point of the lance our creator stabbed into the earth, and the first river bursting from that clay body into mine. Berger called it the pre-verbal. Pre-verbal as in the body when the body was more than body. Pre-verbal was when the body was more than a body and possible. One of its possibilities was to hold a river within it. It has a foot, an elbow, a mouth. It runs. It lies in a bed. It can make you good. It remembers everything. It is true. Where I come from we cleanse ourselves in the river. Not like a bath with soap. I mean: the water makes us strong and able to move forward into what is set before us to do with good energy. We cannot live good, we cannot live at all, without water. To thirst and then not drink is . . . The Whanganui River in New Zealand now has the same legal rights of a human being. In India, the Ganges and Yamuna rivers now have the same legal status of a human being. While in the US, we are tear-gassing and rubber-bulleting and kenneling natives who are trying to protect their water from pollution and contamination at Standing Rock in North Dakota. We have yet to discover what the effects of lead-contaminated water will be on the children of Flint, Michigan, who have been drinking it for years. This thinking helps us disrespect water, air, land, one another. But water is not external from our body, our self. My Elder says: Cut off your ear, and you will live. Cut off your hand, you will live. Cut off your leg, you can still live. Cut off our water: we will not live more than a week. The water we drink, like the air we breathe, is not a part of our body but is our body. Back to the body of earth, of flesh, back to the mouth, the throat, back to the womb, back to the heart, to its blood, back to our grief, back back back to when we were more than we have lately become. The water. Resist the thought that you are alone. Resist your disappearance into sentimental monikers, into the violent pattern of corporate logos, into the mouth of the unholy flower of consumerism. Resist being consumed. Resist your disappearance into anything except the face you had before you walked up to the podium. Resist all funding sources but accept all money. Cut the strings and dismantle the web that needing money throws over you. Resist the distractions of excess. Wear old clothes and avoid chain restaurants. Resist your genius and your own significance as declared by others. Resist all hint of glory but accept the accolade as tributes to your double. Walk away in your unpurchased skin. Resist the millionth purchase and go backward. Get rid of everything. If you exist, then you are loved by existence. Resist the need to worry, robbing everything of immediacy and peace. Resist traveling except where you want to go. Resist seeing yourself in others or them in you. Nothing, everything, is personal. Resist all pressure to have children unless you crave the torment of joy. If you give in to irrationality, then resist cleaning up the messes your children make. You are robbing them of small despairs they can fix. Resist cleaning up after your husband. It will soon replace having sex with him. Resist outrageous charts spelling doom. However you can, rely on sun and wind. Resist loss of the miraculous by lowering your standards for what constitutes a miracle. It is all a fucking miracle. Your gift will begin to watch you having your emotions, so that it can use them in an interesting paragraph, or to get a laugh. Resist the blue chair of dreams, the red chair of science, the black chair of the humanities, and just be human. Resist all chairs. Be the one sitting on the ground or perching on the beam overhead or sleeping beneath the podium. Resist disappearing from the stage, unless you can walk straight into the bathroom and resume the face, the desolate face, the radiant face, the weary face, the face that has become your own, though all your life you have resisted it. An enemy must be worthy of engagement. I turn in the direction of the sun and keep walking. The heart is the smaller cousin of the sun. It sees and knows everything. It hears the gnashing even as it hears the blessing. The door to the mind should only open from the heart. An enemy who gets in, risks the danger of becoming a friend.

Comments marian crow on December 28, 2017 amazing and relevant. i will save this and read it again, and again. Sandy Dvarishkis on January 5, 2018 Profound Sandy Dvarishkis on January 5, 2018 So profound Kathy Baker on January 5, 2018 So beautiful, righteous, tragic. Thank you. I live in Ft.Worth, Tx. God Bless our water,and our land.Amen. Barbara Imboden on January 7, 2018 I am not indigenous, although I grew up and spent my early adulthood with the Kiowa. I learned so much; I learned history from a different perspective. My greatest hope is that the non-indigenous ones will learn from the first peoples here in time to turn life here a better way, a way that honors what we have been given in the world we have, and will restore the damage the later people coming here have done. I have another side that hopes they will learn early enough. Two years ago my students were asking me for topics for their required presentations, and I ask them if they knew about Standing Rock. I had five students, in different classes, learning about it and becoming more interested to learn more. It was a small beginning, but a beginning. It has a foot, an elbow, a mouth. It runs. It lies in a bed. It can make you good. This is anthropocentric arrogance and sentimentality. Rivers are inanimate natural phenomena. One might also note that the idea that this is ancestral Sioux land is rather shallow. Only a few hundred years ago the Missouri Valley there was dominated by large towns of Mandan and Arikara earth lodges. Maggie Tatum on January 21, 2018 I intend to pass this on to as many people as possible Carl Axelsen on January 23, 2018 To Wallace Kaufman Natalie Diaz does not suggest rivers are like people (anthropocentric arrogance) but rather people are like rivers or each like each other. Stephen Byrne on February 2, 2018 Amazing piece and inspiring selection of writers. Thank you for this. gary ong on February 6, 2018 From Empedocles, to reference a book title, quoted by Edelman, Gerald By earth, we see earth; by water, water; by air, bright air, by fire, brilliant fire. Jason Hogge on February 21, 2018 I want to be a river. ruby on April 22, 2018 True indeed. When water is lost, indeed life is lost.
