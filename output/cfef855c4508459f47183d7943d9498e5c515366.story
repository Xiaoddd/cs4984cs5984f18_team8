U.S. President Donald Trump holds up a signed memorandum after he delivered a statement on Jerusalem from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House in Washington, DC on December 6, 2017. Netanyahu said that any peace agreement with the Palestinians must include Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and added that there will be no change in the status of the city's holy sites. In exclusive comments to Haaretz, Saeb Erekat, chief Palestinian peace negotiator responded to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Earlier, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas rejected Trump's speech on Jerusalem, saying it encourages the occupation and construction of Israeli settlements. Abbas said that the move drives the U.S. further away from its role as a mediator and sponsor in peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians and undermines any attempt to achieve a two-state solution. He said Trump's decision violates international law and encourages the occupation and construction of Israeli settlements. On Wednesday, Muslims across the Middle East warned of disastrous consequences as a result of Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Israel's security services are on high alert Thursday morning, with possible scenarios including mass protests as well as rock and firebomb throwing in familiar flashpoints such as army checkpoints and on roads. Trump's speech was met with mixed reactions in the U.S. Congress and by the Jewish community in the U.S. While members of the Republican Party overwhelmingly expressed support for the move, Democrats were split between those who congratulated Trump and those who called it a dangerous and irresponsible action.
