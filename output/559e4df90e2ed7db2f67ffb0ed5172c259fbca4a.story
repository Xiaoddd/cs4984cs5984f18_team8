Mahmoud also lambasted the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation lies near the pipeline's route and who say the pipeline threatens their water supply and tribal artifacts. Law enforcement has used tactics such as rubber bullets, tear gas and water sprays against protesters during clashes in southern North Dakota near the pipeline route, Frazier said, adding that he personally has been hit by rubber bullets and tear gas. Clearing up North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum said on Wednesday the state will help clean up the camp. Officials said they fear the camp will soon flood and wash tons of debris into nearby waterways. The Standing Rock Sioux began coordinating a cleanup in late January, but state officials say it isn't going fast enough. Burgum says the state could start lining up additional contractors as early as Thursday. He says a decision on who would pay the cleanup cost can be made later. The Army Corps of Engineers also plans to help with cleanup and will shut down the camp on February 22. Capt. Ryan Hignight says Corps officials and a contractor will travel to the site this week to assess the situation. Actual cleanup work won't happen until the area is deemed safe.
