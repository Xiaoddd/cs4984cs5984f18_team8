The congressman from Indiana spoke as Muslim communities across the US voice fears of a growing climate of Islamophobia under the US president. Carson made the comments as Guardian Films publishes a film examining community relations in Dearborn, Michigan, which is home to the biggest mosque in North America. The film features five citizens from different backgrounds, from Muslims to Christians, citizen militias and young university graduates, and explores how they see American identity, and grapple with questions of religion, race and class. While there is not comprehensive data to provide a number of Muslims who currently hold elected office in local and state bodies around the US, religious discrimination and an increase in hate crimes has spurred more Muslims to explore politics, according to some groups that focus on representing Muslims in the government. Informal surveys indicate New Jersey leading the way, with at least 14 Muslim Americans currently in public office. After Trump signed an executive order seeking to ban immigrants from certain Muslim-majority countries, one advocacy group, Jetpac, launched a formal campaign designed to encourage more Muslims to run for local office and adopt a more active role in community organizing. American Muslims in Michigan have gained significant success in running for elected office, and Abdul El-Sayed, the former Detroit health commissioner, recently announced a run for governor in 2018. It was a vote of fear and cynicism. Clearly, it is more important than ever that we confront the insidiousness that is Islamophobia. While Muslims pride themselves on being up to date on national politics, as well as being well versed in world events, when it comes to local politics Muslims are mostly absent. Many Muslims only vote in the presidential elections, if they vote at all. We all have families and responsibilities that need our attention. But the time for sitting back and letting others take the lead and do the heavy lifting is over. We have to stop looking around for the perfect leader, and start standing up and being leaders. We must engage. We must reach out and help others who are struggling, even when we are struggling too. We must form real relationships where we each know we can depend on each other in times of need. Supporting local causes outside of our Muslim communities. United, we rise above the hate. It may seem like Islamophobia is everywhere, but the solution is local.

This is where I was born and where I was raised. I love Michigan. Our politicians seem to have forgotten that government should be for people, by people. Part of that is because corporate politicians like our current president are too busy dividing us rather than uniting us around our common goals. We can unlock our economy, fix our failing public schools, break our dependence on oil, save our Great Lakes and provide everyone with quality healthcare. The vote for the current president was not a vote of inspiration. It was a vote of fear and cynicism. I was rebuilding a health department in Detroit after the city shuttered its 185-year old health department when it was facing state takeover. I realized that, in that moment, our state needed real leadership. But I still think it comes with responsibility to motivate and encourage other Muslims to participate in the political process. And even though the Muslim community is not a monolith, there is a mutual interest, even though there are different schools of thought. We have just as much a right to it as any other citizen in the United States.
