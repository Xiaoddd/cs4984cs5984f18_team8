By sundown, organizers at the veteran encampments estimated that approximately 500 veterans showed up at the camp. By the end of the weekend, over 2,000 veterans are expected to arrive to stand with the water protectors at the front lines against the police and the Dakota Access Pipeline company. Cars lines up at sundown, bringing in hundreds of veterans. Besides just standing with the indigenous water protectors during protest actions, the veterans are fanning through the camp to take on responsibilities. The Oceti Sakowin Camp is now a small city that runs on donations and volunteer labor, and as the harsh North Dakota winter sets in on the plains, the camp is busy winterizing structures, building floors, putting up longhouses and trying to keep the wood stoves burning. No weapons are allowed at camp, and nearly everyone sent to the front lines goes through hours of training held daily at a camp maintained by the Indigenous Peoples Protection Project. In return, police have used concussion grenades, water hoses and tear gas on protesters. But the veterans say they've been through much worse, and are ready to stand between the Lakota Sioux people and whatever the police lob at them. All rights reserved.
