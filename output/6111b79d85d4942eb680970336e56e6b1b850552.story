And for good reason. The answer is critical. Cost increases from the Atlantic Coast Pipeline would not only kill jobs but also stifle the kind of clean-energy growth Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and others are working hard to get moving in Virginia. Here are some numbers to help us decide: More than 75,000 Virginians now work in energy-efficiency-related jobs. Most of these workers help make buildings more efficient by improving heating and cooling systems and upgrading lighting and appliances. An additional 5,500 Virginians are employed in the solar and wind industries, which also reduce demand for polluting fossil-fuel power. The commonwealth has recently made concerted efforts to expand that clean-energy economy further, including the recent energy legislation signed into law by Northam. That means the growth potential in Virginia for clean-energy jobs is massive. This is three times greater than the estimated employment impacts that the pipeline projects over the same period. Duke Energy is doing the same with its own operations across the border in North Carolina. The story must be told. Your subscription supports journalism that matters.
