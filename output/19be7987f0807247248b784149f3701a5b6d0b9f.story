Just minutes earlier, she and the rest of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe learned that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers won't grant an easement that would have allowed construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) to cross under Lake Oahe on the Missouri River. Her joy is tangible, her infectious laugh punctuating every sentence. Klein asks her how she feels about the news. Then, she breaks down in tears. It's a short video, just over a minute long. Now, young Native American activists are looking ahead, focused on the very future Iron Eyes mentioned. While Sunday's victory is historic and certainly cause for celebration, Indigenous people have quickly called for continued vigilance, especially from young activists on social media. She says there's been an atmosphere of celebration as well as apprehension over the past few days, especially because they don't know what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Sunday's decision was made by the Obama administration, which will transition power to an administration that supports the completion of the pipeline project. But we must remain cautious, Trump is right next in line. And many activists and water protectors say the good news won't erase the reported human rights abuses that have taken place. While Reuters reported that Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, asked those who are not Sioux to leave the area for the winter on Tuesday, water protectors aren't planning to leave anytime soon. In March, when they heard about plans to reroute the Dakota Access Pipeline away from Bismarck and through sacred land, they took action. As part of the Standing Rock Youth, a group of about 30 young people from the Standing Rock Sioux community, they decided to go online, and make their issue known. By now, it has more than 460,000 signatures, including endorsements from celebrities and influencers like Leonardo DiCaprio, Shailene Woodley, Bill McKibben and Ndaba Mandela. And those are the very people they wanted to galvanize. Native American Kids Standing Up Against Big Oil Company. READ, SIGN & SHARE our petition. On July 15, the group also organized a 2,000-mile relay race to Washington, D.C. to deliver their petition. That same day, the camp received notice that construction on the pipeline would begin. Like the young people before her, Ladonna Brave Bull Allard grabbed her iPhone, made a video and posted it to Facebook. While Native-led news outlets, such as The Last Real Indians and Indian Country Today, have covered the pipeline and its threat of sacred land since the beginning, most mainstream news outlets didn't give the story attention until August. That's when thousands of water protectors and allies assembled to physically block construction, and when the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia heard the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's lawsuit. Since then, the movement's grown exponentially. When the situation at Standing Rock became especially tense in September, as North Dakota law enforcement unleashed dogs and pepper spray on water protectors, those at Standing Rock uploaded videos to Facebook and Twitter to show the rest of the world what was happening. In October, Native American activists and allies started using Facebook Live and other videos on the social network to further broadcast standoffs with police. She witnessed, in real-time, a police officer macing her little sister in the Youth Council with a large canister for an extended period of time. And they seemed pretty shaken by that. The tool, Wise says, has allowed large numbers of people to understand what's actually happening on the ground. Later that month, thousands of allies started checking in to the Standing Rock Reservation on Facebook, in an attempt to confuse police after rumors that they were monitoring the social network to keep track of water protectors. However, local law enforcement denied this, which meant the effort, while well-intentioned, didn't achieve what allies hoped. Dallas Goldtooth (Mdewakanton Dakota and Dine), an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, told Mashable in October that he felt the Facebook check-ins actually helped generate support. Beyond media attention, the impact of these social media campaigns is felt within Indigenous communities, too. Wise says the movement has very much been about the youth reclaiming their own power, especially since many elders may not live to see the true impact of their decisions. But it's also about showing the incredible solidarity across various Indigenous communities that have converged on Standing Rock, and the powerful moments they share. The wide sentiment among activists is that it's a temporary victory, especially as a Trump administration looms. That includes further honing their social media skills. Wise says one thing Indigenous youth and other water protectors have learned is to make hard copies of everything they post online. They've encountered instances in which Facebook has removed posts, or technical issues randomly shorten or delete posts. They're also learning how best to navigate Facebook's algorithm, working to make sure people can see what's happening in real-time and remain educated. The fight is NOT OVER. Let's kill the Black Snake.

For now, water protectors at Standing Rock are standing firm, showing no signs of going anywhere and making sure their allies know the fight isn't over. I don't know.
