Read document. Read analysis. A federal judge declared the DAPL permits to be illegal, and ordered the Corps to take a fresh look at the risks of an oil spill and the impacts to the Tribe and its Treaty rights. That is not what the Army Corps did. The Tribe has worked in good faith every step of the way to develop technical and cultural information to help the Corps fully understand the consequences of permitting this pipeline. They took our hard work and threw it in the trash. The Tribe will be reviewing this decision closely, and determine how best to proceed in close consultation with our membership, staff, and advisors. Previous Updates: Dec. 4, 2017 Court Opinion on Conditions Today, Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, citing the recent Keystone oil spill in South Dakota, imposed several interim measures over the ongoing operation of the Dakota Access pipeline. The Court ordered three different measures, all of which were requested by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. First, the Court ordered the Corps and DAPL to work with the Tribes to complete oil spill response plans at Lake Oahe. Up to now, the Tribe has been kept in the dark about spill response planning and was not involved in the process of developing plans to address spills at Lake Oahe. The Tribe has to be involved in the selection of an auditor. Finally, DAPL must file regular reports on any incidents or repairs on the pipeline. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sued the Corps in July 2016, arguing that the pipeline destroyed sacred sites and threatens the water quality of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation that sits downstream of the site where the pipeline crosses the Missouri River in North Dakota. From the very beginning of our lawsuit, what we have wanted is for the threat this pipeline poses to the people of Standing Rock Indian reservation to be acknowledged. In a 28-page opinion, the court weighed two factors to determine whether or not the pipeline should be shut down. The court answered that question in the affirmative. Second, it assessed the disruptive consequences if the pipeline were shut down. However, the court found that the first factor was sufficient to rule against shutting down the pipeline. In its legal briefs, the Tribe had asked that if the pipeline were not shut down, then the court should impose additional measures to reduce the risk of oil spills to protect the Tribe. Because the district court case remains live, and the remand process is underway, this is not an appealable decision at this time. The Tribe intends to focus on the remand process and has a technical team of experts assisting it in providing input. The Corps has invited the Tribe to provide input into the remand, and that process is currently underway. The Corps has stated that process should be complete by April of next year. When Energy Transfer Partners proposed a new 1,200-mile oil pipeline from the Bakken oil fields to the Midwest, it chose a route crossing the Missouri River just yards upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Within days of his inauguration, however, Donald Trump ordered the permits granted. The Tribe filed a lawsuit to challenge this decision, but construction was completed while the case was proceeding. In June, just weeks after pipeline operations had begun, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled for the Tribe that the Army Corps had not complied with environmental review laws before issuing permits for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River. The court ordered separate briefing to assess whether the pipeline should be shut down while the remand process is going on. The decision on Oct. 11 addresses that question. Even Earlier Updates: Tribes Ask Court to Shut Down Pipeline The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, joined by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, filed an extensive legal brief on August 7, 2017, explaining why the pipeline must be shut down during the new environmental review process. The Tribes were supported by several amicus parties, including a group of Tribes and Tribal organizations, including the National Congress of American Indians, and a group of law professors and experts on the National Environmental Policy Act. Proposed amicus briefs were also filed by the North Dakota Petroleum Council and a coalition of industry groups. Additional resources: What the June 14 court ruling means and in-depth background on this litigation. In a 91-page decision, Judge James Boasberg ruled that the federal permits authorizing the pipeline to cross the Missouri River just upstream of the Standing Rock reservation, which were hastily issued by the Trump administration just days after the inauguration, violated the law in certain critical respects. Normally, when a federal agency violates the law by not looking at environmental risks well enough, the appropriate remedy is to invalidate the underlying permit. Without a permit, the pipeline cannot operate. Over the course of the summer, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe will be making our best arguments to the Court that the Judge should shut down the pipeline pending the completion of a lawful environmental review. Oil is expected to start flowing through the Dakota Access Pipeline today. The Judge still has the power to halt the pipeline. On behalf of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Earthjustice filed a motion for summary judgment on Feb. 14 on the major legal claims in the lawsuit filed against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to prevent the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe near tribal lands. All of the briefs in this case have now been filed. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is deeply concerned about the construction of the major crude-oil pipeline that passes through its ancestral lands. Our lawsuit raises three critical claims, and asks the court to throw out the federal approvals. These environmental reviews have been prepared for decisions as mundane as off-leash dog areas and allowing jet skis in parks. No one disputes that the Tribe has important Treaty rights that guarantee the integrity of its reservation. This means that the federal government and its agencies cannot take any federal action that harms the Standing Rock reservation or the water in the Missouri River on which the people of Standing Rock depend. The Obama administration made a carefully considered decision that these Treaty rights needed to be respected in connection with an oil pipeline immediately upstream of the reservation. The Trump administration ignored that advice, and acted as if the Tribe does not exist. And finally, there are limits on the extent to which one administration can reverse the decisions of its predecessor. While federal agencies can change their minds about matters of policy, the courts will set aside reversals that are not fully justified and explained. Additional details on the key merits of this case. Read an account from Earthjustice attorney Jan Hasselman on seeking the preliminary injunction, the Court's ruling on the request, and the remarkable announcement issued by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Justice and Interior. See: Standing With Standing Rock. In the key documents section of this FAQ. From The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Setting The Record Straight. The Tribe participated fully in the NEPA process. The Tribe sought to protect its rights when no one else would. In December 2016, the Corps correctly found that those issues needed further consideration through an EIS process. On his second full day in office, the Trump administration overruled the Corps and ordered the permits to be granted. See full document. Timeline of Events: July 27, 2016 The Tribe files a lawsuit in federal district court in Washington, D.C., where it was assigned to U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg. August 4, 2016 The Tribe asks the Court for a preliminary injunction since the pipeline is already under construction and would be finished before the case could be formally decided. August 24, 2016 Judge Boasberg holds a hearing on the motion in Washington, D.C. Over 500 people participated in an action outside the federal courthouse in support of the Tribe. The Judge indicated that he would rule in roughly two weeks. On Sept. 4, the Tribe files an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order to block the construction until a decision is reached on the injunction motion. Sept. 6, 2016 Judge Boasberg holds a hearing on the emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. The Judge issues a temporary restraining order for the pipeline corridor nearest the Missouri River but declines to halt construction on the portion of the pipeline route that had recently been identified as sacred tribal burial ground. Oct. 5, 2016 Oral arguments on the emergency motion for injunction are held at the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. A ruling was not issued, keeping the temporary halt to construction in place until the Court issues a decision. Both the appeal and the district court litigation will proceed, but the injunction covering work in the pipeline corridor has ceased. In the interim, the Army will not authorize constructing the Dakota Access Pipeline on Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe. Oct. 20, 2016 The Army Corps conducts a site visit to the area bulldozed over Labor Day to determine whether Dakota Access violated federal law by knowingly damaging a tribal sacred site. Under federal law, if Dakota Access is found to have knowingly damaged a historic or cultural resource with the intent of sidestepping the National Historic Preservation Act, the Corps cannot issue the easement. No determination has been finalized.
