Unicorn Riot was live covering the action as Super Bowl 52 protests continued in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Over one hundred Water Protectors marched and rallied on US bank headquarters in downtown Minneapolis during Super Bowl LII festivities. The speakers were flanked by banners calling attention to Missing and Murder Indigenous Women and the escalation of trafficking near man-camps that are built along fossil fuel projects routes. The rally and speeches continued for over an hour as Super Bowl volunteers funneled attendees around the wall of clearly marked protest marshals. They lied. This is water. Water is life. This water brings us life. Joye Braun also reminded people of the ongoing legal battles involving Standing Rock and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. Let me be the one to remind you to also break the cycle. Starting with our youth, to teach them, like this one right here. On the behalf of our very first medicine, which is water. Crowds moved around the rally as people spoke more on the connections of man-camps and sex traffic that affect Indigenous communities along pipeline routes. The rally eventually ended with a march south on 10th Street behind a giant anti-pipeline banner that spanned the whole street. Notify me of new posts by email.
