The sun was setting on a late March evening as Mr. Perry listened to the voice on the other end of the line. Then came an extended pause, followed by a well-practiced recital of sympathies and condolences. Time to plan another funeral. An elder of the Ramapough Lenape Nation had just died, and Mr. Perry, as chief of the tribe, was charged with leading a prayer on behalf of the community. He has grown woefully accustomed to this ritual. This was the second elder to die that month and the third in a year. In the image, decades old, he is guiding a prayer ceremony, surrounded by more than three dozen tribal elders. Now only six elders remain. Crowding the desk before him was a vast assortment of documents, piled in unruly stacks. This is what the work of the chief had become: grant applications, local petitions, fund-raising letters, legal fees. Indeed, for the Ramapoughs, a group of indigenous people native to the highlands around Mahwah, N.J., life has often been a series of excruciating struggles over rights and resources. The tribe has an embattled history marked by colonial occupation, environmental degradation, discrimination, and clashes with politicians and real estate developers. Over the years, they have been left greatly diminished, a proud tribe working to stave off eradication and invisibility. But the Ramapoughs have experienced something of an awakening in recent months. Now this small and beleaguered community is preparing for battle with forces both local and national. For Mr. Perry, the stakes are nothing short of the existence of the Ramapoughs. The Ramapough Indians are descended from a Munsee-speaking subset of the Lenape, an aboriginal people of the Mid-Atlantic Region. They were once a vast and thriving tribe fanned across the area, but after European invasion many Ramapoughs dispersed across the West. Today, the tribe estimates, there are between 1,000 and 3,000 Ramapoughs in the area and as many as 4,000 nationally. Image Dwaine Perry, the chief of the Ramapough tribe, is determined to stave off the eradication of his people. The issue arises in part from a census classification system in New Jersey. This is hardly the stuff of colonial history. As a result of such prejudice, many Ramapoughs end up bridging two worlds. In private, they freely embrace tribal culture and customs, speaking Munsee and dressing in traditional garb. But outside of the home, many say, they assume a more assimilated lifestyle. Mr. Perry rarely uses his tribal moniker, Iron Bear, in public. It can be difficult, he said, to get a bank loan with such a name. Though their native region, only 30 miles from New York City, has become a relatively wealthy suburb, many Ramapoughs still straddle the poverty line. The unemployment rate is high, they say, and those who are employed mostly work modest jobs, such as plumbing or construction. Much of the Ramapough pass has been paved into highway. Gas stations, he said, stand atop tribal burial grounds. It can seem as if only vestiges of tribal life remain. CreditChristopher Occhicone for The New York Times Since he became chief in 2006, Mr. Perry has often found it challenging to mobilize the tribe in times of need. But recently he has fastened on to an issue that has alarmed his people. In 2014, Pilgrim Pipeline Holdings released plans to construct a pair of oil pipelines that would pass through Ramapough territory. According to the proposal, the pipelines would each stretch 178 miles underground, running from Albany to Linden, N.J. Heading south, the channel would carry 200,000 barrels each day of crude Bakken shale, a volatile variety of oil from Montana and North Dakota. Gasoline and aviation fuel would flow north. But many environmental experts caution that the pipeline poses a risk of widespread safety hazards and pollution, with the possibility for a spill that could taint several critical sources of drinking water for New York and New Jersey. In the heart of the affected zone would be the Ramapoughs, who say their sacred sites could be violated, along with the risk to their river. At that time, the earlier elders always advised, the Ramapoughs would have to band together to pray in the night and protect the earth. This is not the first time the tribe has faced environmental peril. Between 1967 and 1971, the Ford Motor Company dumped industrial waste from its nearby factory in the woods of Upper Ringwood, where many Ramapough families lived. Large swaths of the community had asthma, cancer, diabetes, miscarriages, skin conditions. To this day, the Environmental Protection Agency is overseeing a remediation of the site. The Pilgrim pipeline faces months of reviews before approval can be granted, but the Ramapoughs are already leading a forceful resistance. Soon after the pipeline was proposed, Mr. Perry marshaled the tribe to action, organizing rallies, lobbying local politicians and packing a series of raucous public meetings. Their efforts intensified last fall. Inspired by protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline that drew thousands of indigenous people and their allies to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota last year, the tribe began holding demonstrations at Split Rock Sweetwater Prayer Camp, the main ceremonial grounds of its 14-acre territory. They have also erected several tepees that serve as a popular hub for prayer and organizing, and a small number of people have been staying in tents on the property.

CreditChristopher Occhicone for The New York Times The pipeline protest has united the Ramapoughs unlike any moment many elders can recall. Some lapsed Ramapoughs have even been inspired to connect with tribal life once again. Muriyd Williams, 24, who goes by the tribal name Two Clouds, is descended from the tribe through his Ramapough grandmother. But after years of intolerance from people in the area, his grandmother began telling people she was Sicilian and encouraged him to hide his heritage. Around the time the pipeline was proposed, though, he dived back into the Ramapough community. Now, he is one of around a half-dozen tribal members occupying the prayer camp. He is also learning Munsee and educating nearby college students about the tribe. While the tribe and allied environmental groups intend to block approval of the pipeline at the state level, they worry that conservative leaders in Washington could upend the entire regulatory process. For many Ramapoughs, that fear is rooted in a rancorous history with Mr. Trump. In 1993, the tribe was already recognized by New Jersey and was under consideration for federal status when he began a crusade to thwart the application. Fearing competition for his casinos in Atlantic City, Mr. Trump filed a federal lawsuit claiming that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which allows for gambling on tribal land, discriminated against him. The suit was accompanied by an aggressive media campaign. Image Jamie Rose of Hilburn, N.Y., lights a fire at an anti-pipeline rally. Without federal designation, the Ramapoughs are excluded from a variety of rights and services, such as financial loans, health care access, allotted land and tribal governance. But before they can take on Mr. Trump, the Ramapoughs must contend with their neighbors. Ever since the tribe began demonstrations on its campground, residents and local officials from Mahwah have been at loggerheads with the Ramapoughs. A week later, neighbors again called, now claiming excessive noise. Around the same time, Ramapoughs reported to the police that they found their property had been defaced with bigoted messages, including a swastika. The graffiti allegations followed episodes earlier that year, in which the tribe reported that several of its religious items had been stolen or vandalized. They say that similar sanctions are not imposed upon nonindigenous residents who, for example, camp in their yards or erect canopies for parties. Image Mr. Perry directs Mr. Williams and Don Wiese as they hang a tarp on the food shed; structures erected at the camp have drawn complaints from Mahwah, N.J., residents. The town, he said, is simply enforcing zoning laws for safety purposes. Even amid the simmering tensions, the pipeline protests have continued. On a Sunday afternoon during the winter, more than 100 people converged on the prayer camp for a religious ceremony and teach-in. The gathering, which included drum circles and solemn worship, was filled with a sense of mission. As they packed into a tepee, faces aglow around a raging fire, the protesters seemed ready for wherever that dispute may take them. One man said he would sleep out there every night if he had to, and another said he would go so far as to chain himself to an excavator. But that fervor has been tricky to sustain. Only two days after the rally, Mr. Trump signed executive orders reviving both the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. For the tribe, the losses were demoralizing and depleting. With countless other crises to manage under the new administration, many local activists seem to have diverted their attention elsewhere. It was an overcast morning in March, and Mr. Perry was sitting inside the tepee on his designated tree stump. The survival of the Ramapoughs, he knew, was in the hands of the tribe alone, and there was something both empowering and grim about that fact. That morning, a storm appeared to be looming over the mountain, so his goal was simply to maintain a fire inside the tent. Gusts of wind whipped against the tepee, and the fire began to flicker. Soon the blaze was down to embers. Then a flap lifted and in walked Two Clouds, a bundle of logs in each arm. The chief lowered himself back onto his stump and watched as the young man arranged the wood in a careful stack atop the embers. The fire was soon burning and it was beginning to feel warm inside.
