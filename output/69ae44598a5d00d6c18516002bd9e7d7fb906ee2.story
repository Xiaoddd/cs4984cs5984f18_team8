Her visit has the intention to support and promote the unity among organizations and movements which protect water, land and life itself all over the Planet, through the fearless love embodied by the leadership of our women. Now she has been part of the nonviolent resistance at the Standing Rock camp since April 2016 to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) --a project of the Texas based corporation Energy Transfer Partners. As of now, the pipeline has disrespected sacred Lakota burial grounds and is drilling under the Missouri river to pass under the Oahe lake, all land part of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. This project of death was temporarily halted --last December-- by the administration of Barack Obama, and it has as one of its investors in Donald Trump. The caravan also includes students from different rural teacher training centers and representatives of various communities defending land and water. They will be leaving Mexico City next Friday February 17th for Cuetzalan, Puebla, to attend the 18th Land Defense Assembly of the Macehual People, on the next day, Saturday February 18th. The purpose of this caravan is to gather social movements that defend life and the land to reflect on their struggle to collectively create Peace and Nonviolence. The press conference will be held in front of the Tlaloc monolith at the Anthropology and History National Museum. This cleanup is done as a way to stress the importance of having a clear-clean mind and to encourage spiritual people to become active and activists to become spiritual --a fundamental way to regenerate in the struggle of our collective liberation. And what better heart-voices to demonstrate this, than those of our mothers. Angel has the intention to be back to Standing Rock on Tuesday February 21st given the executive memorandums signed by Donald Trump a couple of weeks ago, allowing to finish the pipeline on Lakota treaty land. While some politicians are talking about the construction of walls, we are building bridges to transcend borders. While these men try to impose projects of death to exploit Mother Earth, we build projects of life coming from the true sovereignty of the peoples.
