Monkeywrenching Security Zines Read. Distribute. Fallen Warriors Obituaries to fallen warriors. Journal. This an update and thank-you message for those who have supported our friend Vic Lancia. Almost one year after Vic shut down a Wells Fargo branch in Middletown, CT in April 2017, Vic was arrested in February 2018 and fined in March 2018. Meanwhile, 9 Wesleyan University students blocked the drive-through ATM. Police were unable to extract Vic from the barrels and made no arrests. We, the people, will not continue to ignore this to the peril of the young, our planet, and its inhabitants. I am here to say no to profiting from climate destruction. The demonstration was organized by Wesleyan Coalition for Divestment and Transparency, Students Against the Fossil Fuel Industry, and Dragonfly Climate Collective. The arrest warrant found probable cause for four violations of Connecticut General Statutes: Breach of Peace in the Second Degree, Disorderly Conduct: Obstructing Free Passage, Trespass in the Second Degree, and Interfering with a Police Officer. Ultimately, the state attorney chose to charge Vic with the first three of these violations. Vic has raised just enough to be able to cover his fines. Anyone who was looking to contribute might instead donate to a number of ongoing sites of resistance against fossil fuel infrastructure. Journal Collective. Please consider subscribing today.
