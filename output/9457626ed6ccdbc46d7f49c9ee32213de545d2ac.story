A screen grab on the comment Fargo city worker Enos Lien posted about pipeline protesters. A city investigation found Lien was not at work at the time he made the comments, and during his 17 years of working for the city he had no prior performance or disciplinary issues, according to a statement released by a city spokesman Tuesday, Feb. 28. Lien was put on a now-completed period of unpaid suspension, though the city's statement didn't say how long the suspension was. The city also put in place conditions Lien must meet to continue to be employed, though the statement didn't say what the conditions are. The statement did note that Lien acknowledged similar behavior in the future could lead to him being fired. Lien's comments drew national criticism, as the story about his investigation was shared on a prominent writer and human rights activist's Facebook page. Lien's Facebook account has been removed since the incident, but shortly after the city issued a statement last Thursday about conducting an investigation, he was found commenting on the same local news station's Facebook page. It may have not been the best choice of words. I was just frustrated at all that is going on out there with tax payers dollar and law enforcement resources.
