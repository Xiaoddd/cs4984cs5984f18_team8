Science, culture, and community in the movement for true diversity in STEM. Moreover, SACNAS has been recognized by the National Science Foundation as the preeminent minority serving scientific society in the country and was awarded the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring because of our commitment to truly diversify the STEM workforce. An important role for SACNAS is to integrate traditional indigenous knowledge with modern technology and science; thus, SACNAS urgently requests your leadership to intervene and halt construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). This pipeline is of great concern to SACNAS because it presents a clear and present danger to water sources for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Nation and countless communities along the entire path of the pipeline. Needless to say, this pipeline will cause great harm to the environment for current and future generations. We, as Native Americans, have been subjected to this type of aggression for over 500 years so we are once again taking a stand to prevent further exploitation. We continually fight to protect land and water from unnecessary development and potential harm, and now is the time for the United States government to stand with us. We are the descendants of tribal chiefs who signed original treaties with the United States promising that the land and water would be safe and protected for future generations. Furthermore, we are opposed to the use of government-funded police and military that appear to be protecting the corporate fossil fuel industry and not the people protecting water and land. We are concerned about the future of our country and Mother Earth so we ask you to stand with us as we are encouraged by your recent comments on the DAPL. We respectfully request that you take the following actions: 1. Make an official public statement regarding potential harm of the DAPL. 2. Direct your agencies to protect, in absolute terms, the water and other resources on and near tribal lands now and for generations to come. 3. Halt construction of the DAPL, especially through indigenous territories, until suitable alternatives are explored and identified. 4. Ensure that those who are peacefully protesting be treated with dignity, respect, and remain unharmed, as this is a constitutional human right. Support instead our work to include diverse STEM leaders in policy decisions, particularly those that effect the land and lives of underrepresented minorities. We ask that you protect water sources and seek alternatives to this pipeline that will not desecrate indigenous territories. Give SACNAS a round of applause. From a quick cheer to a standing ovation, clap to show how much you enjoyed this story.
