The site has been a congregating point for roughly 5,000 activists and members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe who are trying to prevent completion of the pipeline, which risks poisoning water supplies and desecrating nearby indigenous sacred sites. It has also been a location of violent clashes between local authorities and pipeline security officers. Peaceful activists have been sprayed with chemical agents, assaulted with rubber bullets, hosed in sub-freezing temperatures, and had attack dogs sicced on them during their demonstrations. The agency has temporarily halted construction of the project around Lake Oahe, pending further review.
