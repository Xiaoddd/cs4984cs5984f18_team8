But here at home, that conflict of interest is a lot more than potential. It turns out that both he and his energy adviser have intimate financial ties to the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). The bottom line: if the DAPL is allowed to go through, Trump and his fossil fuel industry buddies stand to make a whole lot of money. In fact, the profits are already rolling in. The news was welcomed by the entire fossil fuel industry, as Trump has already declared that he will push for policies that would allow for expansion of drilling, fracking and mining across the country. At the heart of the resistance against this most recent example of oil company imperialism (beyond its very existence) is concerns over its route through sacred lands belonging to the Standing Rock Tribe of the Sioux Indian Nation. Of course, Trump and his cronies refuse to acknowledge the existence of global climate change. President Obama requested that ETE stop work while the administration takes a second look at the permits and recommended that the pipeline be re-routed. But that would be at best, a temporary reprieve; Trump, seeing his profits at stake, would reinstate them in a second. Not coincidentally, prospective Secretary of Energy Harold Hamm was a founder the lobbying group Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, which did a great deal of work on behalf of TransCanada, the company behind Keystone XL. Hamm gave up on that in 2014 when it appeared the project was dead. Now that the project will most certainly be revived, TransCanada has declared that it will work closely with the Trump Administration. While protesters in North Dakota have vowed to keep up the fight, the odds are against them. The fact that our president is heavily invested in the very thing the NoDAPL protesters are fighting against is dangerous. Facebook Twitter Linkedin Email KJ McElrath K.J.
