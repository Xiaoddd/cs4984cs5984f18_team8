Participants could also make prayer ties and participate in a drum circle facilitated by members of a group of native and non-native people who meet regularly to drum. The repeated rounds of drumming throughout the event echoed the role that spirituality has played at Standing Rock. Gabe Neville, who performed a music and poetry set at the event, had been to Standing Rock over the summer and helped to plan the event in Evansville. Another protester, Vanessa Dundon, was struck in the face with a teargas cannister shot by police during a protest at Standing Rock, an injury that may lead to loss of vision in her right eye. One organizer mentioned that the information on government surveillance and violence could help attendees stay safer in struggles in Evansville or elsewhere and that exposure to protest tactics could give event attendees ideas and increased comfort in applying those tactics in their own lives. Attendees were invited to write letters to indigenous water protector Red Fawn Fallis, who is currently in jail facing felony charges after being arrested at Standing Rock. Political prisoners Oso Blanco, Leonard Peltier and Bill Dunne were also featured. There was also a display in memory of Clark Fitzgerald, who died in a car wreck en route to Standing Rock. The event concluded with performances by Tight Space, NAGAS, and Boneclaw. To view more photos from the event, see our gallery page.
