From the Nile to the Amazon, climate change threatens hydropower Read more On a global scale, one of the main causes of climate change is land-use change, and particularly changing land from forest to agriculture. Stopping deforestation is the most economically efficient way of preventing carbon emissions because, in simple terms, all it amounts to is not flooding forests for dams or cutting down and burning them for agriculture. The efficiency of not cutting down trees as a climate change mitigation strategy is fairly well-established. The UN is pushing the international community to cooperate on an agreed plan to stop deforestation and its associated emissions, which add up to about the same level as road transport and haulage emissions. But this is where a beautifully simple idea becomes complicated. Or the value of an Amazonian valley flooded for a hydroelectric dam. Its value as a carbon sink, its value as a biodiversity reservoir, its value as a weather maker and regulator, its value as a source of oxygen and air purifier. All the things that are invisible to accountants but vital to humans. And forests also have a value that even environmental scientists can miss, but is very, very real to forest peoples. They see and understand the value that enlightened, developed cultures are blind to, and which modern science is only beginning to rediscover. Major Amazon dam opposed by tribes fails to get environmental licence Read more Translating that value into the hard currency we value is difficult. The World Resources Institute has taken a step in that direction, with a study of the environmental and economic costs and benefits of governments granting indigenous land rights in Brazil, Bolivia and Colombia. It reports that giving indigenous people land rights leads to the preservation of forests as carbon sinks. And, as a means of storing carbon, it is between five and 42 times more cost-efficient than fitting carbon capture and storage systems to fossil-fuel power stations. They live in the Tapajos basin, an area in the heart of the Amazon being eyed up for the construction of more than 40 hugely destructive mega-dams. The Munduruku have been campaigning for their rights for decades. The Brazilian constitution says they should be given them.
