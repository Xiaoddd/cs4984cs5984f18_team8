Customers will be able to make NFC withdrawals with Apple Pay, Wells Fargo Wallet, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay through a simple NFC-enabled tap and PIN authentication when the feature launches sometime in 2017. Launching today, however, is Wells Fargo's new One-Time Access Code feature, which lets customers authenticate at an ATM by entering an 8-digit code along with their debit or ATM card PIN, all without needing their physical card. After entering the code and their PIN, the company said that the ATM transaction process is the same as when using a physical card. When this feature is live, a customer will be able to initiate a transaction by signing into a leading mobile wallet (Wells Fargo Wallet, Apple Pay, Android Pay or Samsung Pay), and holding the phone near an NFC-enabled ATM terminal. Once authenticated, the customer will input their debit or ATM card PIN and complete their transaction. Apple Pay support at Wells Fargo and Bank of America ATMs has been reported on for well over a year, with Bank of America adding in NFC Apple Pay withdrawals to around 2,400 of its ATMs last summer. Wells Fargo today didn't mention a specific launch date for the debut of Apple Pay at its ATMs, but it did hint that the feature could launch on more than 5,000 of its machines in the U.S., which represent the number of its ATMs that are already NFC-enabled. Top Rated Comments (View all) avanpelt 19 months ago Pretty slick. One step closer to not carrying plastic at all and it's also a great solution for circumventing card skimmers on the ATM.

Rating: 3 Votes Mac 128 19 months ago If I ever used cash I would seriously think about switching banks. I wouldn't. Closed my Wells Fargo account shortly after they were found to be illegally opening accounts without customer's permission. Can't do business with an unethical bank engaged in fraudulent activity -- especially when caught they throw their employees under the bus. I won't ever go back. Rating: 2 Votes timborama 19 months ago An interesting idea though... Although needing a PIN is annoying. Make it 10 digits and no PIN. Then you could at least email it to someone to use in a pinch. Rating: 1 Votes ignatius345 19 months ago Who cares if they do see it, it's one time use only. Although needing a PIN is annoying. Make it 10 digits and no PIN. Then you could at least email it to someone to use in a pinch. Exactly. Rating: 1 Votes kdarling 19 months ago Exactly. Of course, it'd be a lot easier to use a fake fingerprint at an ATM in the middle of the night, than to try to pass it off at Trader Joe's in front of everyone and then get stuck paying for groceries if it didn't work. Heck, it'd also be easier to use a real stolen finger, for that matter :eek:. If ATMs took thumbprints instead of PINs, thieves in parts of the world would have a lot more incentive to take thumbs and maybe lives.
