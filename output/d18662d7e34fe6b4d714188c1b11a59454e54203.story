A young woman was shot in the head with a rubber bullet, suffering from what could be permanent damage. One gentleman had a grand mal seizure and some were vomiting blood after taking rubber bullets to the stomach. We heard these rumours during our stay there, although we were never actually in the camp overnight, so we did not experience it ourselves. they are using this space illegally. . . . Last night . . . there was an aircraft flying over camp from approximately 1:40am until about 2:20am this morning. Free Franco DeNicola Screening: The Shift In Consciousness We interviewed Franco DeNicola about what is happening with the shift in consciousness. It turned out to be one of the deepest and most important information we pulled out within an interview. We explored why things are moving a little more slowly with the shift at times, what is stopping certain solutions from coming forward and the important role we all play. Watch the interview here. As Robert David Steele explains, it deals with torture, ritual abuse, organ harvesting and much more. It's a big issue that needs more awareness, and the ITNJ is taking action. Processing our emotions is key. Robert David Steele is a former Marine, CIA case officer and the co-founder of the US Marine Corps Intelligence Activity. These are the people we have to start listening to for truth. Only now are we seeing it creep up into the mainstream narrative, despite the fact that they continually try and shut it down. Because the owners and shareholders of these networks have been implicated in the activity discussed in this article. Beyond Simple Abuse In the video below, Robert gives a very brief outline of the issue, and how child trafficking goes far beyond the abuse of children. It goes into organ harvesting, children being bred for ritual abuse, born without a birth certificate, tortured, enslaved, mind-controlled and a much more. He claims that they are filled with 90 percent good people, with good hearts and good intentions, and that the 10 percent that controls these areas are wrapped up in in-humane activity, like child trafficking. Give the video below a listen to learn more, and you can check out more testimony from the International Tribunal on Natural Justice from others like Robert, police officers, MK Ultra survivors and many more who have knowledge of such activity. When this happens, action starts to take place, like what we are seeing at the ITNJ. Process any emotions that come from learning this information. This is how we will move through the states of consciousness that project a world that keeps this type of stuff occurring. Evolving beyond the need for it, is often about switching our perspective about it and processing the emotions.

Reflect On: Bigelow is just one person, but he is joined by hundreds of others with impressive credentials. These people have been telling the world that we are not alone for years, in a very serious manner. All of us have been engulfed in our own lives when the world is calling for us to be concerned about others. One big revelation hitting the mainstream right now is the fact that we are not alone, and that intelligent extraterrestrial life-forms have been visiting our planet for a long time, and still do. As unbelievable as this may sound, it comes from the highest ranking military personnel, academicians, intelligence agents, politicians, and private contractors from within the military industrial complex. No matter how much evidence for a given phenomenon, and no matter how obvious its reality, if it goes against the human mind and what we are willing to accept, it is usually ignored or greeted with ridicule. Bigelow has done work for multiple international space agencies and is currently in agreements with multiple nations to build space habitats and space stations. CEO Tom Delonge, along with several other people, including a recently retired director of Lockheed Aerospace, Steve Justice, a Department of Defense Scientist, Hal Puthoff, a senior intelligence officer from the CIA, Jim Semivan, a Director of National Intelligence, Louis Elizondo, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in the Clinton and Bush Administrations, Christopher Mellon, and many more are all releasing official video footage and electro-optical data (radar trackings, returns) and letting the world know that these things (UFOs) are real. You can view the entire team and their credentials here. Perhaps hundreds, maybe even thousands of races have been catalogued by our governments worldwide.

The mainstream is finally picking up on mind-body connection. Open-Label Placebo Experiment Time magazine recently published an article about a woman (now a 71-year old medical assistant) and her struggle with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). She tried everything, from drugs to changing her diet. It was a horrible way to live, she told the Times, as she was often huddled in a corner and keeled over in pain. She had never gone so long without an attack. This has been documented for centuries. The interesting thing about the study the woman decided to participate in, is the fact that patients taking the placebo pill were well aware that they were taking a placebo. Nearly twice as many people in the trial who knowingly received placebo pills reported experiencing adequate symptom relief, compared with the people who received no treatment. Not only that but the men and women taking the placebo also doubled their rates of improvement to a point that was about equal to the effects of two IBS medications that were commonly used at the time. So far, researchers have treated 270 patients and intend to treat approximately 100 more with IBV via their ongoing clinical trial. Some people argue that that the human body does not respond to treatment, but instead, the ritual of treatment. Other Examples Of The Placebo Effect Another example comes from a study published in 2002 by the New England Journal of Medicine which looked at surgery for patients with severe debilitating knee pain. This study divided people into three groups, for one group the surgeons saved the damaged cartilage in the knee. For another, they flushed out the knee joint by removing all of the material believed to be causing inflammation. The third group received a fake surgery, the patients were simply sedated and tricked into thinking that they actually had the surgery. All three groups went through the same rehab process, and the results were astonishing. The placebo group improved just as much as the other two groups who had the surgery. The placebo effect should be the subject of major, funded research efforts. If medical researchers could figure out how to leverage the placebo effect, they would hand doctors an efficient, energy-based, side effect-free tool to treat disease.
