By Charles Davis Wells Fargo is one of the top five largest banks in America, a fact that on its own is damning enough, basic human decency not exactly being conducive to success in the financial industry. As Wells Fargo has grown over the years, using its bailout funds to gobble up rival Wachovia and expand to the East Coast, so has the U.S. prison population. Overall, more than 2.3 million people are currently behind bars, up 50 percent in the last 15 years, the land of the free now accounting for a full quarter of the world's prisoners. These developments are not unrelated. A driving force behind the push for ever-tougher sentences is the for-profit prison industry, in which Wells Fargo is a major investor. Flush with billions in bailout money and an economic system designed to siphon wealth from the working class to the idle rich, Wells Fargo has been busy expanding its stake in the GEO Group, the second largest private jailer in America. Unfortunately, it's a safe investment. These findings, shocking though they may seem, are not surprising. With an eye on maximizing quarterly profits, privately run facilities are even less inclined than state-run prisons to treat their involuntary customers humanely, skimping on health care and anything else that could hurt their bottom line, particularly programs aimed at reducing recidivism. That's basically what GEO founder and CEO George Zoley told shareholders in his company's 2011 annual report. Indeed, even as President Obama talks of potentially cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits, his administration is proposing an increase in federal prison spending. As Michelle Alexander notes in her book, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, three out of every four black men in Washington, DC, will at some point serve time in prison, not because they use drugs more than the white population, but because they are targets of law enforcement. And fittingly, many of them will be sent to a GEO-run facility built on the grounds of what once was one of North Carolina's largest slave plantations. Don't expect politicians to address this injustice, though, at least not without a popular struggle. One way to start: Quit giving your cash to those like Wells Fargo who make money by imprisoning your neighbors. And quit enabling the politicians from both major parties who make that possible.
