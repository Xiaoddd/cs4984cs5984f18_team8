Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Today, I want to tell you about another equally dangerous pipeline that is threatening our water and animal life in Florida and neighboring states. Please sign my petition to ask the Army Corps of Engineers to stop the Sabal Trail Transmission Pipeline. Since then we launched Progress For All, a community action group committed to protecting our environment. Projects like the Sabal Trail Pipeline. This pipeline will span more than 500 miles across Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. It will run right by the Crystal River, a crucial sanctuary for endangered manatees, and the Suwannee River, also home to several endangered species. But I know for a fact that Floridians are ready for a move away from these destructive industries. More and more cities and counties across Florida have passed resolutions to ban fracking. Voters recently passed a statewide referendum for solar energy and voted to protect state support for solar energy power. This is unacceptable. Please sign our petition and take action against this dangerous pipeline. Join M and 111,601 supporters today. Join M and 111,601 supporters today.
