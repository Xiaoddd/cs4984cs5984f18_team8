In a fast moving chess game over Dakota Access, the President just issued a Presidential Memo to the Army Corps of Engineers telling it to fast track Dakota Access and 1) to review and approve the construction and operation of DAPL; 2) consider whether to withdraw the intent to do an Environmental Impact Statement and 3) consider prior reviews as meeting the National Environmental Policy Act. AT mail DOT mil Sample language: The Army has committed to doing an Environmental Impact Statement for Dakota Access at Lake Oahe. The permitting process failed to consider: that this pipeline covers wider traditional and treaty territories of the Sioux in South Dakota and Iowa. Sioux land is not limited to Standing Rock or even that tiny corner of North Dakota. injustices built into the crude oil siting process are suffered by rural people as well as indigenous peoples; the long-term and cumulative impacts of the pipeline on water and climate. In June of 2016 a Sioux sacred site in an Iowa Wildlife Management Area was identified by Sioux Tribal Historic Preservation Officers. An EIS must take into account these inadequate protections for rural communities. 3) The cumulative impacts and long-term threats to drinking water and climate must be fully accounted for in the EIS. Those threats are not limited to Lake Oahe. The impact of this pipeline is so great, the failure to require a full environmental impact statement for all the states is nothing short of irresponsible.
