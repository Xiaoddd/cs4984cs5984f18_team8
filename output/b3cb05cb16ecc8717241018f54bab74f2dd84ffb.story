Here solidarity is identified as a virtue that follows a commitment to interdependence, a moral and social attitude that is not a feeling of vague compassion or shallow distress at the misfortunes of so many people, both near and far. Today, we might understand solidarity as an inclusive loyalty: a loyalty that crosses boundaries and tries to forge unity across difference. Solidarity is more than personal; it also is a commitment to build the kinds of beliefs, values, practices, relationships, policies, and structures that build a more inclusive, diverse, and just ordering of society. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and other services can help raise awareness about various issues and connect us with others who care. Trending hashtags represent opportunities to spread the word and grow the movement. But critics point to the small number of individuals who actually donated to the cause and question the use of these funds.

Some Native Americans have said they appreciated the gesture and the fact that the Facebook check-in raised more awareness for the protestors, but they also add that solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux requires much more than a single click, as their website outlines. A main problem with slacktivism is that too many people equate awareness with action or social awareness with responsibility. Awareness does not mean activism; it is neither true that once people become aware of a cause they automatically are committed to that cause. Awareness is just the first step of a long process of growing in solidarity and building more just practices, relationships, and policies. Moreover, slacktivism operates from a position of power and privilege. It does not demand much from the slacktivist (as the term implies) and does not necessarily lead to learning more about what justice requires, making sacrifices to benefit those in need, or building more inclusive or mutual relationships (as solidarity requires). As part of a commitment to justice and the common good, solidarity must involve transparency, mutuality, and accountability, all areas where slacktivism falls short. In fact, slacktivism operates more like a digital form of toxic charity that disempowers others in need and trains them to be dependent on the good will of others. Solidarity implies that we change our social location in the concrete (and not just digitally) and stand with those who are marginalized, vulnerable, and oppressed. Admittedly, not many of us can break away from our commitments and make the journey to North Dakota to stand with the Water Protectors. Without friendship there is neither authentic solidarity nor true sharing. As Fr. Solidarity is about a loyalty that moves us closer to the poor; by sharing life with those who are suffering and struggling, we come to not just recognize the dignity of those in need or care about the problems they face, but because we care so deeply about them, their problems become our problems. And as friendship grows, so, transparency, mutuality, and accountability increase. Slacktivism might raise awareness and it might be a first step to advocacy that calls on those in positions of power to respond to the needs of those most in need among us. In other words, solidarity is about building the kinds of attitudes, habits, relationships, practices, and policies that enhance the dignity of all, foster inclusive belonging, and create the conditions under which people can participate in a just society. That is the vision for human flourishing to which we are called. And it requires so much more than a click. account. Notify me of new posts via email.
