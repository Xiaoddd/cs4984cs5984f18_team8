When congress passed that law, there was an objection that said you have to get a federal permit to put a new piling on a dock. So congress and subsequently the EPA created a special permit called nationwide permit 17 , nationwide permit 12 is the ones these guys are using. What they are trying to get away with is illegal under the act and the way they did is segmented the pipe they made it into lots of little pipes instead of one long pipe and said we are just going to get nationwide permit 12 for each of these little sections. Just this year alone there have been 220 significant pipeline spills that have caused irreversible damage to the environment and the water supply. The NSA and pentagon issued a joint statement calling climate change the biggest danger we face so why then are two of the most polluting carbon based projects not being stopped when they threaten our very existence i.e. our national security. And oh yeah that UN climate conference discussing implementing a plan to reduce carbon emissions these pipelines would more then double carbon emissions creating a mere 40-50 jobs at the consequence of utter environmental destruction. If Trump wants to make America great again he can start by devesting in a project that is going to kill us all and stopping it. OH YEAH, since we are not corporate or government owned help us out here. PreviousTruly Make America Great Again On Thanksgiving NextBreaking: WikiLeaks releases The Yemen Files.
