'The authorities think that we are aggressive and violent. That's not how it is. 'We are not here to become famous or to become rich. She plans to protest against the pipeline until the end. 'This pipeline is not going to go through. Temperatures are expected to drop to 4F in the area next week. 'We might have very little to survive on if we get stuck down here,' she said. 'Money is real tight but I've lived this life and I can survive. I'm not going anywhere. 'We'll find out who is going to go and who is going to stay come the blizzard. My family know I'm part of the movement and there's nowhere else I can be right now. Pictured above is the entrance to Sacred Stone Camp Two Native Americans were killed, a US Marshall was shot and paralyzed and a dozen people were injured during the 71-day protest. She added: 'We are here as one family and one community to pray and stay strong. I tell people who come to the camp, we don't want your drugs or your alcohol, come to be focused and stay humble. The 1,172-mile oil pipeline, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), is in its final stages of construction apart from a section tunneling under Lake Oahe, a half-mile from the reservation. The pipeline will allow half a million barrels of oil to flow from North Dakota to Illinois each day. A snowstorm and 45mph winds have pounded the nearby Standing Rock Indian reservation this week They also contend that millions of people who live downstream from the pipeline are at risk of crude oil leaks and spills. This week, North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple said it was 'probably not feasible' to reroute the pipeline - which was originally intended to run north of the city of Bismarck, around 50 miles from the Sioux tribe's land. There are other smaller, offshoot camps - Sacred Stone, Rosebud and Red Warrior. The camp was founded by a Sioux family in April but now non-native activists outweigh Native Americans. Hundreds of tribes are represented at the camp and their flags line the perimeter and fly from individual dwellings. At one point, numbers were believed to have swelled to around 8,000 but snowstorms and freezing conditions have driven out many who were ill-equipped to withstand the conditions. Rosemary A Schiano a wildlife field biologist is volunteering at Standing Rock. She said that there is a concerted effort going on to make sure people are prepared Schiano, pictured above, said volunteers are working toward winterizing the camp and preparing the elders for the cold Myron Dewey is part of the indigenous effort to tell the story of Standing Rock and defend the sacred burial sites he says the pipeline will disturb Faith Spotted Eagle from the Ihanktonwan Dakota Territory and South Dakota, has been staying at the camp Lana Jack, of the Celilowy'am tribe in Oregon, is in charge of coordinating the donations. She sounded a note of warning after the blizzard this week left many on the camp in dire situations The campsite is littered with flimsy summer tents which have collapsed beneath piles of snow, while stoves and portable heaters are being moved in by those who remain. Tent and teepee walls are being lined with blankets and sleeping bags to retain warmth. People are being drawn to the sacred fires burning at the camp both as a constant source of heat and to listen to drumming, prayers and Native American songs. Vats of free, hot tea are positioned outside a number of tents as an aid to the 'camp cough' which many activists have developed after months in the cold. Around seven free kitchens dish out plates of pasta and stews, cooked and served by volunteers. Entire families are living at the camp including dozens of children, and three babies have been born there. This coming Monday, an eviction notice from the Obama administration will 'close' all lands where the camps have been established. The camps are located on US Army Corps of Engineers land. State officials ordered activists to leave the camp on Monday, due to 'state of emergency weather conditions'. Mary Zeiser is helping the Creative Resistance at the art camp located at Scared Rock Designs by indigenous artists are printed by volunteers on to jackets, T-shirts and patches for those on the frontlines The designs are also shared for free online in the hope that the environmental message spreads beyond Standing Rock Mary said that no matter what happens when the eviction notice comes into effect, she will be standing her ground Many at the camp say they are being misrepresented and claim authorities have engaged in bullying tactics. The Standing Rock tribe filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming that the US Army Corps of Engineers failed to properly consult them. The lawsuit alleged that the Corps were in breach of the Clean Water Act by allowing the pipe to go so close to their reservation. 'The pipeline has destroyed 86 documented burial sites but they are treating us like domestic terrorists. 'We are the original environmental activists. We have been protecting water and the land for generations and now in the 21st century, we are doing the same. At the camp, preparations are underway to bed in for the rest of the winter amid calls by tribal elders for protesters to remain calm. On Thursday, Faith Spotted Eagle, from the Ihanktonwan Dakota Territory in South Dakota, urged activists not to engage in direct actions against the pipeline workers or authorities which could risk the Treaties of Native American tribes. She asked that those at the camp follow the advice of the Oceti Sakowin leadership and remain in ceremonial prayer. But a violent flare-up last month has left many activists feeling the need to be prepared. Water cannons were sprayed on demonstrators in freezing conditions. Smokey, a member of the Sioux Native American tribe, rides the horse Prophecy, a descendant of the horse belonging to war chief Crazy Horse, at the Oceti Sakowin camp Dan Nanamkin of the Colville tribe in Nespelem, Washington waits for the arrival of other Colville tribe members who were traveling from the headwaters of the Missouri River in a dugout canoe to Oceti Sakowin Camp A 21-year-old protester, Sophie Wilansky, was left with an injury which might cause her to lose her arm. Protesters say she was struck by a police flash grenade, while police have suggested that protesters may have caused the explosion. According to the Morton County Sheriff's Department, more than 500 people have been arrested in the last month. One woman has been charged with attempted murder for allegedly trying to shoot dead a cop as one of the camps was cleared. According to the Morton County State Attorney, Red Fawn Falls, 37, fired three shots at police officers and had to have her gun wrestled out of her arm by cops as she was arrested. Falls allegedly hit one officer in the knee which caused it to 'explode' before she was wrestled to the ground. She has now been charged with attempted murder among other offences and faces 20 years in jail. On Thursday, the Morton County Sheriff's Department released video of two female deputies describing how protesters attempted to use ropes and grappling hooks to break the wiring set up to stop trespassing on private property. According to the sheriff's department, the protestors, who identified themselves as veterans, threatened the female deputies saying law enforcement officers 'should be ready for what's coming'. Lana Jack, of the Celilowy'am tribe in Oregon, is in charge of coordinating the donations. She sounded a note of warning after the blizzard this week left many on the camp in dire situations. 'For three days we didn't have any donations, we were completely cut off. We have not been able to keep people warm. I had a 78-year-old man who came in desperate for help after lying out in the cold. 'We had no propane gas tanks to provide heating for elders and families who were collapsing in the snow. She added: 'We were totally lacking but our people have come together. But we don't have the capacity to take care of more people. We need heavy tents, lumber and propane.' Lana claimed that three trucks had been confiscated by police while bringing supplies to Standing Rock from Bismarck. On Tuesday, state officials said anyone bringing prohibited items into the main protest camp would be fined. There had been threats of a physical blockade on the way to the camp but authorities seem to have retreated from that plan. Instead officers will stop vehicles which appear to be heading to Standing Rock with building supplies and food. that there is a concerted effort going on to make sure people are prepared. Kyle Machulski a volunteer builder from Washington State has come to Standing Rock to lend a helping hand in building shelters and residences at Standing Rock She said: 'The winterization crew is working with elders and Lakota people and guests here at Standing Rock. They have put up kitchens, you name it. Everyone is pitching in and doing good work here at Standing Rock. She said that she didn't believe that the harsh weather or the eviction notice would cause many to leave. So nobody's leaving. Small homes, constructed from plywood and padded with insulation, are popping up around the camp. He has spent the past two weeks volunteering projects around the camp approved by elders in order to help winterize living conditions. Flags border the area surrounding the camp, which sits just on the edge of the Standing Rock reservation 'We are working with donated materials that have been delegated for this project in order to help winterize living conditions,' he said. 'Each house is approved by the tribe's elders. Art coordinator Mary Zeiser arrived at the camp two months ago as part of creative direct action group, Ruckus Society. 'Our message is this is a safe space for people to come and heal. Everyone is welcome. We work through a creative resistance.' Designs by indigenous artists are printed by volunteers on to jackets, T-shirts and patches for those on the frontlines. The designs are also shared for free online in the hope that the environmental message spreads beyond Standing Rock. Mary said that no matter what happens when the eviction notice comes into effect, she will be standing her ground. 'No matter what happens on the 5th, I'm staying to defend our art space,' she said. 'This is a sanctuary for expression. I'm staying until the last piece of trash is collected.
