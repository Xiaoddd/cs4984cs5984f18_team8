They don't understand this country. The remarks from Bannon, a right-wing populist and former executive at the aggressively anti-mainstream media website Breitbart, come as tensions between Trump's White House and the media are running high. Many members of the media believe the Trump White House is untruthful and disingenuous, pointing to its baseless claims about the size of his inauguration crowd and millions of illegal votes in the 2016 election. Meanwhile, members of Trump's White House charge the media with being unfair to the new president, citing one inaccurate report -- falsely stating that Trump had removed Martin Luther King's bust from the Oval Office -- as evidence of unfair treatment. They're not saying the bust is taken out, what they're saying is I'm a racist... The Trump White House also appears to resent the media for what it sees as biased coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign, and for its failure to anticipate his victory. A WarnerMedia Company.
