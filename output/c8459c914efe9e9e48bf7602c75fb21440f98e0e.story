He conducted an experiment focusing on the conflict between obedience to authority and personal conscience. Milgram (1963) examined justifications for acts of genocide offered by those accused at the World War II, Nuremberg War Criminal trials. The experiments began in July 1961, a year after the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem. (Milgram, 1974). Milgram selected participants for his experiment by newspaper advertising for male participants to take part in a study of learning at Yale University. The learner (a confederate called Mr. Wallace) was taken into a room and had electrodes attached to his arms, and the teacher and researcher went into a room next door that contained an electric shock generator and a row of switches marked from 15 volts (Slight Shock) to 375 volts (Danger: Severe Shock) to 450 volts (XXX). Milgram's Experiment Aim: Milgram (1963) was interested in researching how far people would go in obeying an instruction if it involved harming another person. Stanley Milgram was interested in how easily ordinary people could be influenced into committing atrocities, for example, Germans in WWII. Participants were 40 males, aged between 20 and 50, whose jobs ranged from unskilled to professional, from the New Haven area. At the beginning of the experiment, they were introduced to another participant, who was a confederate of the experimenter (Milgram). Two rooms in the Yale Interaction Laboratory were used - one for the learner (with an electric chair) and another for the teacher and experimenter with an electric shock generator. The learner gave mainly wrong answers (on purpose), and for each of these, the teacher gave him an electric shock. There were four prods and if one was not obeyed, then the experimenter (Mr. Williams) read out the next prod, and so on. Prod 1: Please continue. Prod 2: The experiment requires you to continue. Prod 3: It is absolutely essential that you continue. Prod 4: You have no other choice but to continue. All the participants continued to 300 volts. All he did was alter the situation (IV) to see how this affected obedience (DV). Obedience to authority is ingrained in us all from the way we are brought up. This response to legitimate authority is learned in a variety of situations, for example in the family, school, and workplace. I set up a simple experiment at Yale University to test how much pain an ordinary citizen would inflict on another person simply because he was ordered to by an experimental scientist. That is, they are seen as legitimate. The person being ordered about is able to believe that the authority will accept responsibility for what happens. Agency theory says that people will obey an authority when they believe that the authority will take responsibility for the consequences of their actions. For example, when participants were reminded that they had responsibility for their own actions, almost none of them were prepared to obey. In contrast, many participants who were refusing to go on did so if the experimenter said that he would take responsibility. Milgram Experiment Variations The Milgram experiment was carried out many times whereby Milgram (1965) varied the basic procedure (changed the IV). By doing this Milgram could identify which factors affected obedience (the DV). In total 636 participants have been tested in 18 different variation studies. Milgram carried out a variation in which the experimenter was called away because of a phone call right at the start of the procedure. Change of Location The experiment was moved to a set of run down offices rather than the impressive Yale University. This suggests that status of location effects obedience. When there is less personal responsibility obedience increases. This relates to Milgram's Agency Theory. Touch Proximity Condition The teacher had to force the learner's hand down onto a shock plate when they refuse to participate after 150 volts. Social Support Condition Two other participants (confederates) were also teachers but refused to obey. Confederate 1 stopped at 150 volts, and confederate 2 stopped at 210 volts. Absent Experimenter Condition It is easier to resist the orders from an authority figure if they are not close by. Many participants cheated and missed out shocks or gave less voltage than ordered to by the experimenter. The proximity of authority figure affects obedience. We obey in a variety of real-life situations that are far more subtle than instructions to give people electric shocks, and it would be interesting to see what factors operate in everyday obedience. The sort of situation Milgram investigated would be more suited to a military context. Milgram's sample was biased: The participants in Milgram's study were all male. This is because they became participants only by electing to respond to a newspaper advertisement (selecting themselves). Yet a total of 636 participants were tested in 18 separate experiments across the New Haven area, which was seen as being reasonably representative of a typical American town. However, Smith & Bond (1998) point out that with the exception of Jordan (Shanab & Yahya, 1978), the majority of these studies have been conducted in industrialized Western cultures and we should be cautious before we conclude that a universal trait of social behavior has been identified. Milgram also interviewed participants afterward to find out the effect of the deception. Protection of participants - Participants were exposed to extremely stressful situations that may have the potential to cause psychological harm. Many of the participants were visibly distressed. Signs of tension included trembling, sweating, stuttering, laughing nervously, biting lips and digging fingernails into palms of hands. Three participants had uncontrollable seizures, and many pleaded to be allowed to stop the experiment. In his defense, Milgram argued that these effects were only short-term. Once the participants were debriefed (and could see the confederate was OK) their stress levels decreased. Milgram also interviewed the participants one year after the event and concluded that most were happy that they had taken part. However, Milgram did debrief the participants fully after the experiment and also followed up after a period of time to ensure that they came to no harm. Milgram debriefed all his participants straight after the experiment and disclosed the true nature of the experiment. Participants were assured that their behavior was common and Milgram also followed the sample up a year later and found that there were no signs of any long-term psychological harm. Right to Withdrawal - The BPS states that researchers should make it plain to participants that they are free to withdraw at any time (regardless of payment). The experimenter gave four verbal prods which mostly discouraged withdrawal from the experiment: Please continue. The experiment requires that you continue. It is absolutely essential that you continue. You have no other choice, you must go on. Milgram argued that they are justified as the study was about obedience so orders were necessary.
