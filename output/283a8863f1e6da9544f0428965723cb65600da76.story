The following day, Franken penned a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, urging the Justice Department to intervene on behalf of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other peaceful demonstrators. As a citizen of Minnesota, which also faces harsh winters, Franken understands the danger of water cannons in 20-degree weather. Many of his fellow senators (with the exception of Sen. Bernie Sanders) have little to say about the Dakota Access pipeline and its opposition. One of the reasons for this silence is financial, according to Sainato. Franken, a longtime advocate of Wall Street reform, has publicly argued against tax loopholes and has opposed tax cuts for millionaires. He also has a history of fighting for Native American communities in Minnesota. And in 2013, he fought for Native American students by repeatedly opposing funding cuts to schools on reservations. In fact, in 2008, when Franken was first running for the Senate, he voiced concerns about the treatment of Native Americans. In an interview with Chris Weigant for The Huffington Post, Franken noted that, if elected, he hoped to be on the Committee on Indian Affairs (he is currently a member of the committee, and has been since 2011). And, as he notes in his letter, constitutional freedoms are at risk. The support of Congress is more crucial than ever as water protectors seek to overturn the proposed pipeline route. Franken does not fall into this timid category of politicians. For his bold, timely statement to the Department of Justice, as well as for his years of support for Native American rights, we name Sen. Al Franken our Truthdigger of the Week.
