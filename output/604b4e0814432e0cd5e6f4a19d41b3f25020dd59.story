For the hundreds of people camping near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, opposing the development of the Dakota Access pipeline, winter has arrived in full force. For the hundreds of people camping near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in opposition of the Dakota Access pipeline, winter has arrived in full force. The view from a nearby hill, looking down on the Oceti Sakowin camp in North Dakota, shows a blanket of snow with teepees, tents, RVs and refurbished buses peeking out. Children toboggan down the hill. A snowman holds an anti-pipeline flag. Volunteers stack firewood. Diana Barker plans to eventually rebuild her makeshift tent home at the Oceti Sakowin Camp near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. But she has been here for three weeks, helping to provide food, coffee and warm clothes to others staying in the camp. Yes. Not a chance. Theresa Burns, originally from Pine Ridge, S.D., has been here off and on since September. She has an RV that she is planning to insulate with bales of straw and isn't planning on leaving any time soon. Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners is behind the 1,885-kilometre Dakota Access pipeline, which, if completed, will cross four American states, carrying Bakken oil from North Dakota to Illinois. The largest of the anti-pipeline protest camps is the Oceti Sakowin Camp, located just north of the Cannonball River. Others say the pipeline is safer than moving oil by other modes of transportation, such as rail. For months, thousands of people have descended upon a handful of camps in the area to voice opposition to the pipeline. The largest is the Oceti Sakowin Camp, north of the Cannonball River. Standing Rock pipeline protesters repelled by force at bridge crossing TD scholarship recipient calls on bank to stop funding Dakota Access In the past week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the federal land on which the Oceti Sakowin Camp sits, and North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple have both issued evacuation orders. They point to the onslaught of a harsh winter, the need to protect the public from violent confrontations between law enforcement and protesters, and a lack of ability to effectively provide proper emergency services in the area. asked Barker, questioning the public safety rationale. She is referring to a recent confrontation where protesters were hosed down with water in freezing temperatures by law enforcement. Protesters say they've also been hit with rubber bullets and tear gas. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier says officers only use reasonable force. There have been 563 arrests since Aug. 10, Kirchmeier said, mostly of people from outside North Dakota, including some Canadians. Authorities say they won't be stopping vehicles heading to the prohibited camps, nor will they block supplies of food, water and clothing. What we don't want is confrontation.

Neither will Morton County police. Kirchmeier says it is up to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to figure out how to remove people from the area. Still, some say they are staying until the end.
