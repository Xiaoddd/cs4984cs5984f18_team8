BREAKING NEWS Water Protectors under attack by police now Wed. Morton County dumping eagle feathers and sacred items from Treaty Camp on the ground. Grandmas, nieces and nephews being hit with batons -- that is what we are afraid of. Eighteen year old horseback riders are being shot at. Grandpas are dragged out of ceremonies. I'm never going to stop fighting. And I'm the weakest of them all. Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest 54 comments: Richard Saunders said...

You have veterans there who can come and pick those sacred items up for you. You have knowledge that those who did this atrocity continues to anger those powers that protect you. Take heart in the knowledge that you are doing right and because you are doing right evil men will try to break you down to nothing. But you are true warriors and true warriors can never be broken. Take heart young warrior, you make us all proud. November 2, 2016 at 11:24 AM Anonymous said... I'm not sure if they should go through that stuff that has been dumped. The CREEPY COPS most likely contaminated the gear and sacred items. November 2, 2016 at 11:31 AM Anonymous said... I'm not sure if they should go through that stuff that has been dumped.

We know how important being sacred is and they do not know how to treat their fellow humans the way that they need to be treated, other wise they would not treat the situation so disrespectfully :( We must pray for them, like we pray for each other.

Law enforcement has an obligation to ensure the safekeeping of any items in its possession and an obligation to return items to the rightful owners in a timely and appropriate manner. Here are the guidelines. The state and the federal government, the pipe company, the billionaire who is backing this pipeline to move the oil to Texas (he is selling it to Japan BTW) Hire Lawyers. I am sure there are lawyers who would love to take these cases. November 2, 2016 at 11:55 AM Native Kauai said... Burn it and send it up with prayers and ceremony. They have desecrated and disrespected the people and the items that they hold as personal and sacred. Hold up your pride. Send up your prayers. Keep praying and hold your position. We send you our love and support. November 2, 2016 at 12:08 PM Brenda Spear said... im so sorry this is happening to yall. my heart is breaking November 2, 2016 at 12:10 PM Anonymous said... My name is Shelly Mastaw of the Sault Sainte Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians in Michigan. I will continue to pray and support ALL of our People and all who stand beside the protectors of our water, land & wildlife. This is such a disgrace. My thoughts and energy are for all of you.

Let the tears we shed carry the grief we feel for the loss of those things we held in esteem, those tears also are the Water of the Spirit, the message of the Black Snake of no respect lies for all to see it does not reflect on us, it does not touch us.

I continue to pray strong strength and healing prayers for you, everyday. I'm sharing tears of pain, anger, and sadness with you. And I'm sharing your post with every news group on my facebook. I can't be there but my heart is. I pray to see the day when the Entire Government is put in their place by our Ingenious People and Anonymous. November 2, 2016 at 1:11 PM Rebecca Pico said...

I will be walking in the prayer walk this Saturday here in New York. I am Cherokee mix and proud . It does not matter what race you are. This is shameful. Water is for all life. All life dies without water. I Stand with Standing Rock. Please be safe all of you. I will keep praying. Know I cry with you . My Heart is with you. My prayers are with you . Be strong people are starting to be aware because of your sacrifice . I was interviewed when i was walking in the parade . they want to know about the election. I told them I will only speak if I could speak about Standing Rock. I told them about what is happening to our people and how useless Hillary and trump is being . How you stand in prayers in peace has been brutalized . Innocent peaceful people being arrested, shot at. Horses being shot at. I share and watch everything I find . I will continue from afar to bring awareness . Much love to all of you . Thank You for your Sacrifices . November 2, 2016 at 2:26 PM Anonymous said... They do this to cause emotional harm. This is ment to cause a sense of desperation and hurt. Do not let them win. There are people everywhere who stand with you. This is being shared and talked about more and more. They are afraid and because of that fear they are lashing out. If they were in the right they would just wait for a verdict. They know they are wrong. November 2, 2016 at 2:28 PM Anonymous said... I can't be with you in body but I'm with you in spirit. What is happening to you is a crime and will not go unpunished even if its not on this earth. Filled Within satiable desires, full of hypocrisy, pride and arrogance, holding evil ideas through delusion, they work with impure resolves. Giving themselves over to immeasurable cares ending only with death, regarding gratification of lust as their highest aim and feeling sure that that is all. Bound by a hundred ties of hope, given over to lust and anger, they strive to obtain by unlawful means hoards of wealth for sensual enjoyments. This has been gained by me today; this desire I shall obtain; this is mine and this wealth also shall be mine in future. That enemy has been slain by me; and others I shall also slay. I am the lord. I enjoy. I am perfect, powerful and happy, I am rich and born in a noble family. I will sacrifice. I will give charity. I will rejoice,- thus deluded by ignorance. Bewildered by many a fancy, entangled in the snare of delusion, addicted to the gratification of lust, they fall into a foul hell. Self-conceited, stubborn, filled with the pride and intoxication of wealth, they perform sacrifices in (or for) name out of ostentation, contrary to scriptural ordinances. Given over to egoism, power, haughtiness, lust and anger, these malicious People hate Me in their own bodies and those of others. These cruel haters, worst among men in the world, I hurl these evil doers into the womb of demons only. Entering into the demoniacal womb and deluded, birth after birth, not attaining Me, they thus fall, into a condition lower than that. November 2, 2016 at 2:30 PM Anonymous said... Burn it, burn it now November 2, 2016 at 2:57 PM Joanna Freitag said... My heart aches to know that peaceful people with only good intentions are being persecuted and mistreated. I am deeply saddened by all of it. Thank you for continued dedication to such a worthy cause. I pray for all of the water protector's safety. November 2, 2016 at 2:58 PM katygrrl said... It IS their land as part of the SOVEREIGN Sioux Nation through the Ft. Laramie Treaty of 1851 and others. The land was stolen from them and this desecration is designed to break the Spirit of these fellow Americans. November 2, 2016 at 3:34 PM Anonymous said... We will rise above the petty things Morton county and dapl is doing....tunkasila sees all and it will fall back in a full circle...we will rise and stay united as one. They will have to answer to the great creator for all the wrong g doings and yes it will be full circle.... Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you..... The buffalo was just the beginning of warnings. Prayers with you... as a white woman I'm so ashamed that this is happening. Prayers for you all. Thank you for your courage. November 2, 2016 at 4:21 PM Mysi said... So sorry....prayers for all of those standing strong for the people...for the water...for the sacred.You are all warriors and I am so proud of all of you. November 2, 2016 at 4:32 PM June Hansen said... Thank you so much for your touching video and for letting us know what is happening. Very sad to hear how the water protectors are being treated including the young and the old. It is unbelievable everything that is going on and yet we hear very little in the news. I am sorry about all the belongings and sacred items that have been just dumped like trash. It's disgusting. I am praying for all of you brave people who are out there in the elements. I am making calls and signing petitions and donating. Stay strong you beautiful water protectors. Sending lots of love and prayers for you. I am not Native, but instant strong on your side. My home town is Mandan, and I wish I could manage to come home and stand with you physically. I'm tryi,g to,find a way. November 2, 2016 at 4:59 PM Barb Alloy said... BELIEVE victory will be yours, your prayers aren't being wasted. November 2, 2016 at 5:18 PM Kerani Marie Lomonaco said... Bless your life dear one. My prayers and heart are with you and all of our relatives. Thank you for your prayer and heart and tears. some type of chemicals may have been mixed with the items , which could be harmful to breath if burned . safe my brothers and sisters.

Those police, attackers, any of ones doing that wrong, its very bad for them to do that violence. Whether its from greed, hatred, ignorance, disrespect..surely that will come back on them. Its the law of the universe, karma, or whatever, but best not to be a person like that. November 2, 2016 at 7:01 PM Anonymous said... Thank you for sharing so openly- you have my prayers and love. Keep on standing- I would love to stand with you, but am in CT and can't take the time off. This situation is so out of control. There is no need for the militaristic approach towards the protesters. While the political BS gets front page, front story coverage- this should be covered intensely. All of us- who are peaceful people must band together and pray. Pray for an end to this - pray for a change in those directing the abuse- pray for the people who are doing this to earn a paycheck to feed their families. WHY they can't do this without violating the rights of the protesters is so puzzling. November 2, 2016 at 10:09 PM Lisa Lee said... I hurt for you. Thru my grandmother I am proud to have some first nations lineage and wish I could be there. This has been so horrible, and I am ashamed of the way your are treated. Please know there are so many hoping for your success. November 2, 2016 at 10:18 PM Anonymous said... Another false policy, loss of credibility. Time & again abuses occur. Everything that is happening now to land & water defenders has happened before. Voices of the earth & voices of the poor are crying out, even when they are silent their spirits are crying out for the violence to end, for beauty to be restored. Alone in a cement block cell, Imprisoned in a shack or a high rise hotel for sex slaves; Moved around from city to city to work cheap; In foreign countries exploded by land bombs; At home in America being spied upon, your beliefs spit upon; Living & working at home on the farm where poison from oil wells seeps in all around; In abandoned houses & expensive homes every age, sex, & race going insane from meth, prescription, or any substance to distort the pain; The 'good' people in church compromising their souls to try to hold onto the lies of war that they have been sold; Hundreds of thousands of Youth beaten down, gunned down, left dead in the street, hanging in trees, to frighten and numb the people from seeking justice; Children who face hunger, cruelty, violence, neglect, daily confusion; Oblivious youths with computers, Wii Fii , games, facebook, who are detached & disconnected & living in altered reality not having or being a friend; The disappeared, the missing, the dead, the drug captives, All crying out for healing and justice and kindness, a way to live in peace.
