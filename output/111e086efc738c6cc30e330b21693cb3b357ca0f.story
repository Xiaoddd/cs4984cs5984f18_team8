(CBC) A Calgary engineer thinks an invention he stumbled upon in the laboratory could transform the way Alberta gets its heavy oil to market. A Calgary engineer thinks an invention he stumbled upon in the laboratory could transform the way Alberta gets its heavy oil to market. I don't think it will replace pipelines. Gates and his team of researchers have developed the technology to the point where they can make pellets of various sizes right at the wellhead, using about the same amount of energy as it takes to add diluent to the bitumen to liquefy it for shipping via pipelines. Because of a gas bubble injected inside each pellet, they are also buoyant, Gates says. He says there are several companies interested in moving the newly patented invention forward.
