The Standing Rock Sioux Reservation says the oil pipeline threatens its sacred lands and its water supply, the Missouri River. Water protectors: Over 8,000 protesters have gathered at Standing Rock. Hundreds have been injured, hundreds have been arrested (Amy Goodman of Democracy Now among them). Environmental racism: The pipeline was to cross the Missouri River just north of White-majority Bismarck. Bismarck raised concerns that the pipeline would poison their water supply. But the courts approved it anyway. Thus the protests. (Standing Rock was the reservation of Sitting Bull and Vine Deloria, Jr) The pipeline crosses four states: North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. Just the bit near Standing Rock is left. That bit is to cross land and water claimed by both Standing Rock and the US Army. On December 4th 2016, on the eve of what promised to be an ugly showdown between protesters and state police, the US Army Corps of Engineers said it would not approve the pipeline crossing, that the matter needed further study to determine the safest river crossing. That could take months to years. Enter Donald Trump: Trump, soon to become the US president, has come out in favour of the pipeline. In 2015 he had money in ETP and in Phillips 66, which owns a fourth of the pipeline. Kelcy Warren, the head of ETP, gave Trump money to run for president. This win appears to be for the individuals who are protesting. What will the Donald do with this project. Most comments I have read are against this project based on fear and a play on Corporate greed against the little man. It all depends on whose land you think it is and whether you believe Native people should have any say over what happens to their sacred sites and burial grounds.

I suppose U believe what U believe; however it does not make it so. What is the position U take on the thousands of other laws that have been passed. Are they all illegal or just those that U think are illegal. By the way, I have enjoyed the ranting and raging that has been taking place on this site over the last few weeks as every one struggles to realize that Mr. Trump is going to be President. Every type of comment except the disaster that has fallen upon all of us. Bismarck raised concerns that the pipeline would poison their water supply. Read it again. What the federal and corporate entities did by rerouting the pipeline without obtaining agreement is illegal. Not illegal in my opinion, but illegal according to the rule of law established in and by this nation.

In this case it is a private Oil company not a public service company that is claiming eminate domain over private properties in the area. In this pay for play senerio the government is granting eminate domain privilages to a private company that wants to ship oil to Mexico. Additionally, when Native American women became pregnant, white settlers violently hurled them against the rocks. This was just another demonic method of population control. (smh) Unsurprisingly, the Bible says a certain group of people never was apportioned any land to begin with and therefore, would be somewhat of a homeless wanderer. Fast forward to December 2016. And now, approximately 400 years after a certain group of people took this land through force and chicanery, are at it again. This time, with militarized police units, Pepper spray, Pit Bulls, German Shepherds and tear gas canisters and the framing of cartoonish laws to commit further theft of land in order to build an oil pipeline for economic purposes and benefit a few greedy, cigar smoking, tobacco chewing white settlers. They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. The land was removed from the Reservation in 1944 by law. The public has no say, I have no say and you have no say. The current President must believe he wants to stop it and the new President says he wants it. Before they arrived in the Americas they have slaughters millions and millions of people and they have continued through out history up until the mass slaughter taking place in the Middle East currently. Idealism is what caused the election of the current President Elect. There is a federal law, the National Historic Preservation Act, which makes it illegal to knowingly destroy a tribal sacred site. The federal government and the corporations know there are tribal sacred sites on the land in question. This is a violation of federal law. You only know what you are reading and what you choose to believe. If this were your business you would want people to stay out of it, yet you express your thoughts as though you are the wises of the sages. Let the courts handle this matter. My suggestion is let he courts handle the matter, as I stated in my last comment. Unless you have studied a lot of law yourself you are repeating what some one said. If the law was as clear as you think it is there would be no dispute. Do not bother to respond with another negative comment as I will be out of here. I did not see a single insult or negative comment. Actually, all quite positive. Only this one seemed a bit sarcastic: Pie in the Sky and the Big Rock Candy Mountain And I would love to see some posts on that. Allen, I understand your level of frustration. There was a Bismark route that was considered initially but it presented more risks than the current route in terms of crossing multiple tributaries and wetlands, crossing multiple roads, passing nearby to many residences, etc. As currently routed, the DAPL will cross the Missouri River twice. The first crossing is upstream from Bismark. There is no protest taking place with respect to that crossing. It would have been possible to route it westward, around the Missouri, avoiding any crossing at all, but that would have added many miles to the pipeline and increased its cost by a large number. It would also have routed the line through an area of many lakes, tributaries and wetlands, increasing by many times the risk of polluting the ecosystem. The controversial stretch of the DAPL follows an existing natural gas pipeline that already runs through the same area and was built decades ago. It is not uncommon to route pipelines through the same corridor because the right of way is already owned. Moving oil by pipeline is way safer from an ecological perspective than other alternatives, mainly moving it overland by truck or rail. The volume of spills and number of accidents via overland transportation is a lot higher than via pipeline. The regulatory framework and process that gives rise to this dispute is complicated, on purpose. The concept of regulatory capture is at play here. Regulatory capture is where a regulated industry learns to manipulate the regulatory process for its own benefit. The oil bizz is a master of this. The planning for this pipeline has been going on for years, but the protests are cropping up only now, after all of the dirty backroom stuff has been done. The oil industry is famous for routing oil lines through waterways that put populations at risk. A rupture of that line, which is a real risk, would affect the largest clean freshwater supply in the world, a source of drinking water for millions of people ranging from Chicago to Milwaukee to Detroit. Anybody commenting on this issue on a computer, using the internet, is complicit in this process. The oil biz is rich and powerful because humans consume lots of oil. We are greedy and we want to keep on buying huge quantities of the stuff, so they work hard to comply, laughing all the way to the bank. A big user is electrical generating. A big user of electricity is the internet and other electronic devices. In the last few decades the per capita use of electricity in the developed western world has increased, mainly due to computers and the internet. The oil being harvested in North Dakota is fueling that thirst. Ironically, due to the influx of oil and other fuels from other areas, the North Dakota oil bizz has seen a significant downturn in the last year or so. Former boomtowns are turning into ghost towns. Once the pipeline is completed, the volume of oil it will transport will be a trickle compared to the volume that was in play when this pipeline was in the planning stages. In the meantime, that oil has been transported overland, resulting in multiple accidents and spills along the way, most of which would not have occurred had the pipeline been in place all along.

So the Native Americans and the poor people in Flint Michigan are suffering because of the evil establishment. I also feel that their sacred ground should be respected and not disturbed. The oil biz is rich and powerful because humans consume lots of oil. Yes, humans consume lots of oil. There are safer, renewable alternatives such as solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and wave that have been systematically sidelined by those very same oil companies and their political servants. There is also the issue of taxpayer subsidies for the fossil fuel extractors. Those subsidies advantage oil and gas, etc. and disadvantage renewables. Finally there is the issue of endless wars that siphon tax dollars away from socially useful needs like education, healthcare and housing. Some of those war funds land in the pockets of the fossil fuel extractors. So the fossil fuel providers get a payday not only from consumers, but also through subsidies and war contracts. In fact, fossil energy is solar energy. It was created by the sun, shining on vegetation that died and decayed, or was eaten by animals that died and decayed, over millions of years. It is the cumulative solar energy from millions of years of sunshine, stored in fossil form. This is why such small amounts of the stuff can now release such giant amounts of energy. Oil companies are among the most profitable corporations on the planet. They did not need subsidies in the past and they certainly do not need them now. Subsidies represent another way fossil fuel extractors divert funds from the national treasury to their own pockets. The subsidies exist because of their ability to purchase politicians. Renewable sources of energy such as sun, wind and geothermal are perfectly capable of meeting global energy demands. Recent energy storage technology in the form of batteries are making one hundred percent energy conversion to renewables feasible. Utilities need to deliver reliable and steady energy by balancing supply and demand. While today they can usually handle the fluctuations that solar and wind power present to the grid by adjusting their operations, as the amount of energy supplied by renewables grows, better battery storage is crucial. Batteries convert electricity into chemical potential energy for storage and back into electrical energy as needed. They can perform different functions at various points along the electric grid. At the site of solar PV or wind turbines, batteries can smooth out the variability of flow and store excess energy when demand is low to release it when demand is high. Currently, fluctuations are handled by drawing power from natural gas, nuclear or coal-fired power plants; but whereas fossil-fuel plants can take many hours to ramp up, batteries respond quickly and when used to replace fossil-fuel power plants, they cut CO2 emissions. For households, batteries can store energy for use anytime and provide back-up power in case of blackouts. Batteries have not been fully integrated into the mainstream power system because of performance and safety issues, regulatory barriers, the resistance of utilities and cost. It was created by the sun, shining on vegetation that died and decayed, or was eaten by animals that died and decayed, over millions of years. The fossil energy is solar energy argument is specious. In other words, it sounds reasonable, but is false. Fossil energy comes from stored carbon. Human extraction and burning of that stored carbon has caused an imbalance, an excess of carbon, methane and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, oceans and polar ice caps. That excess is driving climate change and threatening the lives and livelihoods of millions of people. Burning fossil fuels is not a sustainable energy solution for humans or the planet.

Everything I read indicated all new work environments are using modern methods such as windmills, solar or nuclear. It will be a very long time before the use of oil is not needed because of the lifespan of of the current means of production. When it is no longer profitable for oil it will be abandoned. The technology is dangerous and storing the toxic waste products is a major hazard. Fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal could have been abandoned long ago. They are still around because the suppliers have great sway over their paid political servants. Both moves were expected.

The private firm worked in conjunction with the police forces of more than five states to shut down the peaceful protests of Standing Rock. This shows how energy dinosaurs are resorting to extreme measures to keep an unsustainable business model alive. This is true not only in the energy sector, but also in other corporate and government sectors. Ordinary citizens non-violently asserting their rights are labeled and treated like berserk soldiers on a battlefield. Sometimes hammers hurt the hands that use them.

This was a plea bargain; she originally was charged with attempted murder. That is what the quote in the first article refers to, about an informant who tried to talk protesters into arming themselves.
