(Photo: Michael Vadon) Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is being sued for allegedly protecting the financial interests of for-profit colleges over the plight of students with excessive loans. As Politico detailed on July 6: Eighteen states and the District of Columbia filed suit against Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday over her delay of regulations meant to protect federal student loan borrowers defrauded by their schools. The lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in D.C., led by Massachusetts and joined by 18 other Democratic attorneys general, accuses DeVos of illegally delaying the regulations aimed at predatory colleges, which were finalized by the Obama administration and had been set to take effect on July 1. A letter from the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) makes a formal complaint about DeVos's inaction and offers recommendations to resolve the inaction through the CFPB picking up the slack: We write to express our outrage over the recent decision the U.S. Department of Education to abdicate its responsibility to protect student loan borrowers and provide meaningful oversight of its contracted student loan services. We therefore call on the bureau, in coordination with the state attorneys general and state banking regulators, to fill the void left by Secretary DeVos and the Department of Education by: Committing to an industrywide investigation that prioritizes making harmed consumers whole, by reviewing numerous complaints lodged against every servicer, and suing companies that break the law. Regulators must ensure servicers and their executives are held fully accountable and should avoid settlements that allow companies to operate business as usual. Developing enforceable nationwide servicing standards immediately. Federal and state regulators should use their considerable authority to ensure servicers adhere to clear standards that protect borrowers against abuse. Already, the bureau has indicated its intent to develop borrower protections. We are eager to see these protections become a reality and will vigorously defend them against the inevitable attacks. Devoting additional staff to policing student loan servicers to ensure compliance with federal and state consumer protection laws, and monitoring the student loan market more thoroughly. In addition, Public Citizen, a national progressive advocacy group, and the Project on Predatory Student Lending of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School filed a lawsuit to immediately activate the rule that DeVos is delaying. We are asking the court to order this administration to implement the rule now, as the law requires. DeVos, before she was appointed and confirmed secretary of education by Donald Trump, was a well-known advocate for the privatization of education. She was and is a strong booster of for-profit educational companies. Her current position on delaying the Obama student debt rule clearly sides with the bottom line of educational corporations over the dire debt relief needs of students. It should be added that many of these debt-loaded college students and graduates received inferior educations from companies focused more on their own profits than on students' learning. To a for-profit college, students are often seen as nothing more than consumers who represent cash flow to the company. Students are not pigeons to be fleeced. They attend college to seek an education that broadens their horizons and prepares them for future employment. Opportunistic educational corporations that take advantage of those goals and shortchange students in order to rake in profits should be regulated to ensure they don't engage in disreputable practices. Betsy DeVos is a hindrance to defending the rights of defrauded students. Nobody Really Knows.
