It did not negotiate any payments from Monsanto shareholders for Roundup-related litigation. Genetically modified (GM) crops that withstand glyphosate are a main source of cash for Monsanto, mainly generated in North and South America, where the technology is widely accepted. Australian chemical maker Nufarm Ltd, which Macquarie Bank analysts estimate earns about a fifth of its revenue from glyphosate-based products, plunged almost 17 per cent to a more than two-year low. Lawyers for a school groundskeeper dying of cancer asked a San Francisco jury during a trial Monday, July 9, 2018, to find that agribusiness giant Monsanto's widely used weed killer Roundup likely caused his disease.

After the verdict in favour of a California school groundskeeper with terminal cancer, Monsanto faces more than 5,000 similar lawsuits across the United States over claims it did not warn of the cancer risks of glyphosate-based weedkillers, including its Roundup brand. The case by plaintiff Dewayne Johnson, filed in 2016, was fast-tracked for trial due to the severity of his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system that he alleges was caused by Roundup and Ranger Pro, another Monsanto glyphosate herbicide. No significant link between Monsanto weedkiller and cancer in farm workers, study suggests Having closed the Monsanto takeover, Bayer is only awaiting the approval of some final antitrust-related asset sales before folding it into its own organisation. It did not negotiate any payments from Monsanto shareholders for Roundup-related litigation. Bayer shares were on track to close at their lowest in almost five years. Nearly a third of food samples in CFIA testing contain glyphosate residues The controversy could also affect future revenues. Genetically modified (GM) crops that withstand glyphosate are a main source of cash for Monsanto, mainly generated in North and South America, where the technology is widely accepted. The health worries could further darken the outlook for a product category following the emergence of weeds that have grown resistant to the herbicide. Discovered by the Monsanto chemist John E. Franz in 1970, patent-free glyphosate herbicides are now sold by the global crop protection industry despite the dispute over its safety. The U.S. court ruling caught many Bayer investors off guard as no hard evidence of a causal link to cancer had been produced so far. A Reuters report in October showed that the WHO's cancer agency dismissed and edited findings from a draft of its review of glyphosate that were at odds with its final conclusion that the chemical probably causes cancer. In Europe, the EU Commission in December drew criticism for renewing the licence for glyphosate. Germany and France have meanwhile taken steps to phase out use of the weedkiller. The U.S. case may prompt some retailers to curb sales of Roundup products. Homebase, one of Britain's largest home and garden improvement retailers, is reviewing the sale of glyphosate-containing products in the light of the jury's decision, a spokeswoman said. Glyphosate-exposed stocks also plunged in Asia and particularly in Australia where a withering drought has already hit herbicide sales. Australian chemical maker Nufarm Ltd, which Macquarie Bank analysts estimate earns about a fifth of its revenue from glyphosate-based products, plunged almost 17 per cent to a more than two-year low.
