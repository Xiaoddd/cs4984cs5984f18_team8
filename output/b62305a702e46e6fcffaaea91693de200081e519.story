Simple-minded but deadly thinking at the top derives from influential groups and individuals who think we have to KILL to keep the rest of the world in line. The compliant mainstream media scares us into accepting wars and drone killings overseas, military-style defenses on our own streets, surveillance of our private lives. For the war-happy leadership of America, certain realities are better left unsaid, or at most reported quickly and quietly. This graphic derived from the Rand Corporation's terrorism database shows that the frequency of terrorist acts was greatest in the 1970s and 1980s. 2. Violent Crime Is Down -- Except Where Young Men are Left to Languish and Die The national rate of violent crime has been consistently dropping since 1993. The solution is JOBS -- but Congress has a long record of stifling job creation proposals. 4. Suicide Kills More American Soldiers Than Terrorism In 2014, 55 U.S. soldiers lost their lives in foreign occupations, but 269 active service members committed suicide. Almost five times as many. It gets much worse. In that same year of 2014 over 7,400 veterans took their own lives, accounting for an incredible 18 percent of all suicides even though vets make up less than 9 percent of the U.S. population. About 75 percent of the suicides were committed by veterans without VA care. 5. Whistleblowing was Part of the Founding of America John McCain and Paul Ryan and numerous other super-patriots condemned President Obama's pardon of Chelsea Manning. Other pro-whistleblower legislation has been passed in recent years. Our nationalist leaders don't care about any of this. But as more of our misdeeds go unreported, more and more of the world is learning to hate us. Nobody Really Knows.
