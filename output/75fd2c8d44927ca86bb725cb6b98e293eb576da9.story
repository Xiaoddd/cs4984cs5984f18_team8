Photograph By DARRYL DYCK, The Canadian Press Protesters hold a banner as a transport truck attempting to deliver heavy equipment to Kinder Morgan sits idle as others block a gate at the company's property in Burnaby, B.C., on Monday, March 19, 2018. May said she was protesting in solidarity with demonstrators across the country who are fighting the project. Protest organizers said about 100 people were taken into custody. She said the pipeline expansion means dire consequences for First Nation communities and for the environment. The expansion project will triple the capacity of the pipeline to nearly 900,000 barrels from 300,000 and increase tanker traffic through Burrard Inlet and Strait of Georgia. When they refused, Mounties told them they were under arrest. May was flanked by RCMP officers as she was led down Burnaby Mountain. She said she grabbed their arms to prevent slipping on the muddy, rocky ground. She said she hugged the two arresting officers before she left. May was led into a tent set up by RCMP as a processing centre. She signed an undertaking agreeing to not return to that site again before her court date of June 14. May said that does not prevent her from taking part in other protests or from continuing to voice her opposition to the project. She said she was released within half an hour. The Federal Court of Appeal is hearing a consolidated lawsuit that will feature arguments against the pipeline from seven First Nations, environmental organizations, and the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby. The province of British Columbia is an intervenor. If the federal court rules against the pipeline project, civil charges against protesters will likely be quashed, she said. Similar rallies took place at the offices of 44 members of Parliament across the country. Rankin could not be at the rally but phoned in to thank the protesters for making their opposition known. The seven-fold increase in tanker traffic through our waters is not something that we can accept. Rankin said that implies anyone against the pipeline is unpatriotic. All rights reserved.
