This is a peer-reviewed paper that was scrutinized by other experts for almost a year before it was accepted for publication. Irrespective of whether or not new climate policies are adopted, global demand growth for fossil fuels is already slowing due to the accelerating transition to a low carbon global economy. There can be no doubt that a global energy transition is fully underway. Since investors had assumed that these reserves will be commercialized, the stocks of listed fossil fuel companies may soon be judged to be over-valued. The modeling results show that the lower demand for fossil fuels leads to substantial stranded fossil fuel assets weven if climate change policies are not adopted. The low carbon transition generates a modest GDP and employment increase in regions with limited exposure to fossil fuel production (for example, most of the EU and Japan). Unemployment increases to around 8 percent over the same time frame. Percentage change in GDP. Originally posted on The Narwhal.
