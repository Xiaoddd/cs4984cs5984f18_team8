TransCanada needs a permit to build part of the pipeline through Nebraska, and the Nebraska Public Service Commission (PSC), which is conducting a multi-month review of the pipeline project, is currently accepting comments from the public. Our allies in the climate justice movement have filed lawsuits to block the construction of the pipeline, so this is our opportunity to join the fight to protect the environment and prevent dirty tar sands oil in Canada from fueling runaway climate change. With a so-called president who publicly denies climate science and an administration in the pockets of the fossil fuel industry, this action could be one of our last chances to stop the Keystone XL pipeline. Thanks for all you do.
