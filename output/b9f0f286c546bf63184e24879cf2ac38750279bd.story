(Screen shot via Unicorn Riot) Editor's note: This live blog begins Dec. 1, 2016. Truthdig editorial assistant Clara Romeo captured the following images from the rally: The Mohawk Warrior Society flag waves in front of the U.S. Capitol. The influx of people to Standing Rock as winter arrives has been an enormous strain on local resources due to the inherent challenges and dangers of travel and camping in this climate and, in many cases, a lack of necessary knowledge, skills, and experience on the part of those who have traveled to join us. Also, the closure of Highway 1806 and the twisted media portrayals of the camp have essentially acted as economic sanctions against the tribe, denying revenue to an already impoverished nation with a long list of urgent social problems. We ask anyone that is considering traveling to join the encampments at Standing Rock to stay home for now and instead take bold action in your local communities to force investors to divest from the project. We also support those who choose to stay, if they are able to live comfortably and self-sufficiently through a winter in the Great Plains. We support the Sacred Stone Camp, the original encampment established in opposition to the pipeline back on April 1st, 2016. Rest assured, LaDonna is not going anywhere. But due to limited space and infrastructure, there is no longer an open call for people to come join Sacred Stone Camp unless personally invited. 2:02 p.m. PST Friday, Dec. 9: A group of veterans apologized to Native American elders for the decades of abuse perpetrated by American armed forces against indigenous people. The statement continued: The goal is to raise funds and gather supplies and deliver to the water protectors who are currently camped in the Standing Rock reservation, North Dakota. A few days after the show, 3 of the main-organizers, Talilo Marfil, Freddy Flowpez and Quincy Davis, will head out to Standing rock to deliver the supplies and the compilation CD, as part of the Standing Rock International Caravan led by Chief Buzz Nelson of the Lakota Pine Ridge and Northern Cheyenne. For more information, go to the Cypher Cure website. 2:34 p.m. PST Thursday, Dec. 8: Although North Dakota's weather has worsened significantly over the past few days, water protectors and Standing Rock allies aren't backing down. We stay. New photo and video footage shows the harrowing conditions at the Standing Rock encampments. A blizzard in North Dakota is bringing a major arctic chill. PST Wednesday, Dec. 7: Two emails shed light on the inner workings of Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the Dakota Access pipeline. Journalist Shaun King shared the emails he'd received from separate sources, both regarding future developments of the pipeline. According to King, the text of the email included the following: Now is not the time to lay down and take the Army Corps of Engineers decision yesterday as a full victory. His company routinely finds any loophole it can and minimizes the social engagement necessary to get pipelines approved. They will NOT back down on this unless they are unequivocally forced to. They will fight with every tool they have and have a willing supporter in Trump. So not only is the fight for the pipeline not over, it likely just got HARDER, because attention and funds could fade. Everyone needs to be on their guard until literally every nut and bolt are removed from the site. Energy Transfer is a debt-riddled company with a lot riding on this easement. In late November, Sunoco Logistics and Energy Transfer Partners agreed a merger. The email states: I stumbled across some of the emails through our firm's file-sharing system and to sum up what I saw, ETP is counting on the future president's administration to have this pipeline happen. I nearly gagged in my office. To say the least, my desire to leave this firm has increased exponentially. I know that it's your job as a journalist to verify the facts, but I just need you to take my word on this. I'm not asking you to write about this, but to let any contacts you know who are at Standing Rock that the fight isn't over and that they really need to gear up once Trump is officially the president. I don't have any contacts over there and don't know anyone who does. If you don't believe me, I understand. You don't know me and have no reason to trust me. Just please, reaffirm anyone you know at Standing Rock that they need to be prepared to keep fighting. 10:37 a.m. They fear that Energy Transfer Partners will continue construction despite the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' decision to halt the project. Lawyers for Energy Transfer Partners asked U.S. District Judge James Boasberg for an expedited ruling late Monday that would allow the company to complete the project. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday morning in Washington, D.C. As such news continues to spread, many water protectors are determined to spend the winter at camps around Standing Rock. And, as many of them note, the future of the pipeline under the Trump administration is unclear . A blizzard hit the area around Oceti Sakowin Camp Monday, and temperatures fell as low as -9 degrees Fahrenheit. Perhaps adding to their concern was news that a crude oil pipeline in Western North Dakota was shut down Tuesday after a leak spilled crude oil into a nearby creek. Reuters reports: The leak that prompted the shutdown was discovered in a six-inch pipeline operated by Belle Fourche Pipeline Company, the North Dakota Department of Health said. An undetermined amount of crude oil was spilled, the state said. The spill leaked oil into the Ash Coulee Creek in Billings County. 10:40 a.m. Publisher, Zuade Kaufman, and Editor in Chief, Robert Scheer. All rights reserved. Personalize your Truthdig experience.
