Barlow. We are deeply disturbed by the police actions that have been taking place, where non violent protests have been and continue to be met with extremely aggressive tactics including; being shot with water canons in below freezing temperatures, chemical weapons, rubber bullets, and attack dogs. Water is life and this cannot be underestimated or taken for granted in 2016. This is a time for taking a stance and not just showing off about being rich. Look at what's happening to the world and what's already happened, the stuff we've ignored for years. When I saw that I thought, in 40 years it's going to be so difficult to survive. And these issues are connected. The North Dakota Pipeline is part of it because the Indigenous People are connected to the land and respect the planet. America affects the entire globe culturally, financially and politically. Secondly, the story has been suppressed. Even in America the media aren't reporting on it enough. Coverage of American issues around the globe is important at this time. It's a very important time for us to be holding America to account for its power and the promises it makes. We should have an opinion and a voice wherever we are. People's rights have already been threatened. It sounds dramatic but these are the facts. People have said they're not going to move by December 5th and my main concern is that lives are going to be taken. People are very injured, they're subjected to freezing conditions, and any barbaric treatment has to stop. We all have the right to peacefully protest and these people have the right to protect land that was promised to them. I'm also urging a repeal. I've been seeing more and more social activism there. I had a lack of knowledge about the Native American people. It's not a history I'd ever studied as a British person so I had no understanding of it. I'd like to shed light on it for the UK. It's important in breaking down the perspective we have of America, particularly with this new leader coming into power. remember growing up with music and activism always being integrated together. Whether it was John Lennon, Nirvana, Kathleen Hanna, Patti Smith, or Freddie Mercury, my favorite musicians have always stood up for things. As an artist you have a platform and you are a leader. In 2016 it's more important than ever to use your voice. I want to help us be part of a brighter, more positive future and I would urge other musicians to look to their heroes and hear their voices.

As a quick background to the story, this issue revolves around a pipeline being built by Energy Transfer Partners which is due to transport oil from North Dakota to Illinois daily. It intends to travel underneath the Missouri River which is the main water source for the Sioux tribe. Beyond the risks of their water supply becoming contaminated, the tribe also argues that the pipe interferes with sacred grounds which belong to them as Native Americans according to agreements known as the Fort Laramie treaties. The Sioux claim that the federal government didn't do enough to involve them while seeking a permit for the pipeline, a matter which would defy federal law. Over the past few months, thousands of protestors have descended upon the site, setting up camp on land owned by Energy Transfer Partners. Increasing reports of clashes with policemen circulate on social media, as the issue gains more international momentum and the winter weather conditions worsen. Anyone who remains onsite after December 5 will be deemed an illegal trespasser. So far journalists covering the protests have been arrested, protestors have been shot with rubber bullets and 300 people have been treated for injuries, while there are allegations that concussion grenades and water canons have been used to control crowds. British artist Kate Nash, who uprooted her life from London to LA two years ago, has been particularly vocal in the days and weeks following Donald Trump's Election, and is now turning her efforts towards this heated issue. Kate has always had a political streak, appearing on BBC News to defend Russian punk band Pussy Riot when they were deemed guilty for protesting the Russian Orthodox Church's support of President Putin in 2012. She founded a female collective called Girl Gang, intended as a positive, feminist movement to rally and support women in the arts. She took to the streets of Downtown LA immediately after Trump's Election alongside thousands of others, posting Instagrams to document the scenes. Kate was concerned about the lack of media coverage, revealing that many of her fans back in the UK didn't even know anything was going on. Over the weekend she drafted a letter, addressed it to President Obama, Army Corps of Engineers, and the Department of Justice, and is now asking artists and members of the music industry to sign it in a bid to hold America to account in these increasingly nefarious post-Trump political times. Even if we don't make a difference, I want America to feel watched. Kate's letter appears below with signatures so far from Billie Joe Armstrong, Tegan & Sara, Karen O, Hayley Williams of Paramore, Shirley Manson, Moby, Mark Ronson, Vic Mensa, Pussy Riot, Cat Power, Maroon 5, Ben Gibbard from Death Cab for Cutie, and many, many more. Kate would also like to direct you to two additional sites if you're a member of the public looking to support the cause. Sacred Stone Camp allows you to donate directly to the camp at Standing Rock and contribute to the legal fund. You can also order supplies from Amazon via the site to send to those camping. She is Dominican on her mother's side and Black and Native on her father's and is raising funds to buy ten winter shelters complete with heating units and stoves to accommodate 10-12 people per shelter for Christmas this year. - Reporting by Eve Barlow. Dear President Obama, Army Corps of Engineers, and Department of Justice, We are writing to express our shock at the treatment of the people of Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota. We are deeply disturbed by the police actions that have been taking place, where non violent protests have been and continue to be met with extremely aggressive tactics including; being shot with water canons in below freezing temperatures, chemical weapons, rubber bullets, and attack dogs. These are the same inhumane methods used during WWII and the Civil Rights Movement. We feel strongly in the current political climate that those in power must be held accountable for their actions. We encourage you to remember that this planet provides for us, not the other way around. Water is life and this cannot be underestimated or taken for granted in 2016. We are aware of the long and painful history between the US and its indigenous people. Know that the world's eyes and the eyes of the music community are on you now as you continue to disregard the treaties you have with the Native American people and act barbarically towards them. Standing Rock we stand with you. Kate Nash: Music has to be political. This is a time for taking a stance and not just showing off about being rich. Look at what's happening to the world and what's already happened, the stuff we've ignored for years. Take the Leonardo DiCaprio documentary Before The Flood. When I saw that I thought, in 40 years it's going to be so difficult to survive. And these issues are connected. The North Dakota Pipeline is part of it because the Indigenous People are connected to the land and respect the planet. It's important for us to learn from them. Why is it important as a UK musician to rally behind this. The importance is two-fold. America affects the entire globe culturally, financially and politically. Secondly, the story has been suppressed. Even in America the media aren't reporting on it enough. Coverage of American issues around the globe is important at this time. Donald Trump is to become President, people connected to Trump are Heiling in meetings, there's a normalization of white supremacists. It's a very important time for us to be holding America to account for its power and the promises it makes. We should have an opinion and a voice wherever we are. People's rights have already been threatened. It sounds dramatic but these are the facts. Stand up for little people who are being crushed by big bullies. Let's talk about the letter. I stand against the violence towards people. People have said they're not going to move by December 5th and my main concern is that lives are going to be taken. People are very injured, they're subjected to freezing conditions, and any barbaric treatment has to stop. We all have the right to peacefully protest and these people have the right to protect land that was promised to them. I'm also urging a repeal. I saw it on Instagram at first. I've been seeing more and more social activism there. I had a lack of knowledge about the Native American people. It's not a history I'd ever studied as a British person so I had no understanding of it. I'd like to shed light on it for the UK. It's important in breaking down the perspective we have of America, particularly with this new leader coming into power. Learning from history is key. I remember growing up with music and activism always being integrated together. Whether it was John Lennon, Nirvana, Kathleen Hanna, Patti Smith, or Freddie Mercury, my favorite musicians have always stood up for things. As an artist you have a platform and you are a leader. In 2016 it's more important than ever to use your voice. I want to help us be part of a brighter, more positive future and I would urge other musicians to look to their heroes and hear their voices. They took a stance. It was exciting and heartwarming to see that a lot of people care on the ground after Trump's election. We need to continue the momentum. Follow Kate Nash on Twitter.
