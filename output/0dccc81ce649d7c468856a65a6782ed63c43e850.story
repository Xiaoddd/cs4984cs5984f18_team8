Thanksgiving is a day when many of us will be spending time with our families and giving thanks for what we have. While it is celebrated in the US as a national holiday, we must also remember its painful history for Native American communities. This painful history continues until today, and we stand in solidarity with the indigenous people who are resisting the ongoing colonization of their land. On Sunday night, Water Protectors were met with water hoses in freezing temperatures, shot with rubber bullets, and sprayed with pepper spray. President Obama has the power to permanently stop construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline and respect the sovereignty of Native Americans. After you send the email, call the number displayed on the screen and leave a phone message for President Obama. The Dakota Access Pipeline would be a huge threat if it continues and is drilled under the Missouri River, and cut through First Nation sacred lands, threatening water resources for millions of people. I am asking you, to use your powers as President of the United States, to reject the permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline and to declare Standing Rock a National Monument. Reject the permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline and Declare Standing Rock a National Monument.
