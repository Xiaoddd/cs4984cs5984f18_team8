Credit: Getty Images This story was updated Jan. 24, 2017, to reflect President Trump's presidential memorandum to advance construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. After months of largely peaceful protests by thousands of demonstrators from across the country who congregated at a camp near Cannon Ball, N.D., to help bring the Dakota Access pipeline to a halt, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has asked the pipeline opponents to go home. The tribe said it plans to continue its action against the pipeline in the courts, but the protest camp has run its course. It also said the tribe may call on federal law enforcement officials to help them remove protesters from all of the camps and to block their re-entry if they haven't left in 30 days. Opposition leaders said they had not immediately decided whether to retract their call to clear the camp. Several hundred protesters have remained in the camp through the winter, down from the high of nearly 10,000 in early December. The process could delay construction by a year or more and could involve rerouting the pipeline. It is still unclear what the Trump administration will do. Residents expressed frustration over a highway closure near the camp that significantly increased the driving time to Bismarck, where many residents work, shop and receive medical care. Residents also expressed concern over the Cannon Ball gym, which has been used as an emergency shelter for pipeline opponents. The community uses the gym for sporting events, meetings and funerals, and it is in need of cleaning and repair. When asked about the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines at a press briefing on Monday, Sean Spicer, Trump's press secretary, said Trump may attempt to overrule the Army Corp's decision to halt the pipeline.
