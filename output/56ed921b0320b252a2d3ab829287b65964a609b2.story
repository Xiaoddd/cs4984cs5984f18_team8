What has been a long and contentious process of building a natural gas pipeline through the two Virginias is about to get even longer. What is being called MVP Southgate is a separate project. As such, it will require approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a process that consumed nearly three years for the pipeline that will run from northern West Virginia through the New River and Roanoke valleys. EQT is a key partner in the Mountain Valley project. The Pittsburgh company will operate the newly proposed pipeline, which will deliver natural gas under high pressure to points in Rockingham and Alamance counties. Plans call for MVP Southgate to be operational by late 2020. Mountain Valley officials say construction of the current pipeline, which began several months ago with tree-cutting, is scheduled for completion by the end of this year. When plans for the buried, 42-inch diameter pipe through West Virginia and Virginia were first announced, the goal was to make a connection in Chatham with the existing Transco pipeline. Mountain Valley said it has a commitment from PSNC Energy, a wholly owned subsidiary of SCANA Corp., to take gas from the pipeline for its North Carolina distribution network. Final decisions about the size and capacity of MVP Southgate will not be made until after the open season, company officials said. For now, the proposed pipeline would be 16 to 20 inches in diameter, smaller than the Mountain Valley Pipeline. As a result, temporary easements needed for construction would likely be 100 feet wide, compared to 125 feet for Mountain Valley. After MVP Southgate is completed, some of the gas transported through the Mountain Valley Pipeline will continue to be shipped through a commercial hub in Chatham to other markets via the Transco pipeline, which runs from the Gulf Coast to New York City. A compressor station, which provides the energy needed to move gas through the pipeline at high pressure, would be constructed along MVP Southgate just south of Chatham. From there, the pipeline would veer west past Danville, cross the Virginia-North Carolina line near Eden, and then head back east into Alamance County, terminating just south of Interstate 40. In Southwest Virginia, that process unleashed a groundswell of opposition from those who say the pipeline will cause widespread environmental damage, increase dependence on fossil fuels and violate the property rights of landowners whose property has been taken for the project through eminent domain.
