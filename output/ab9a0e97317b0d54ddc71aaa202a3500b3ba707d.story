People protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline along the Mississippi River in Iowa. On Monday, Iowans rallied to celebrate this temporary victory and demand that the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) take similar action to protect Iowans and their water resources from the Dakota Access Pipeline by revoking their permit in Iowa. Furthermore, it will require an Environmental Impact Statement for any new proposed route, which will take months to complete. I really have. It means it will be months before Dakota Access can identify and begin construction on a new route and it means work to keep oil from flowing through the pipeline will continue. A few dozen protesters gathered at noon outside the IUB. Following a short rally outside, the group delivered a letter to the Iowa Utilities Board calling for the permit to be revoked. accepted the letter from the activists and took questions for close to 30 minutes. Due to this litigation status, the Board is unable to comment on ongoing litigation. It appears the effect of the decision is limited to North Dakota. Please review pages 47-54 and pages 91-107. The Board also required Dakota Access to file additional information in their Ordering Clauses starting on page 153. As the Board stated in that order, there is no explicit legal requirement, in statute or in rule, for an independent environmental impact report as a part of this proceeding. The Board addressed economic impact on page 46 of its March 10 order. 6) At the Des Moines river site, there was word that 3 drillings were made. Inspections are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA). Use of eminent domain does not require completion of an environmental impact statement. This is addressed in Iowa Code 479B.32. If the pipeline must be taken out of the ground, it would be at the expense of Dakota Access. The Board is providing the most up to date information to all of your questions as of today. The Board is investigating complaints regarding construction and any potential violations as they are filed with the Board and, if any person decides to file a complaint, the board will follow the procedures required by Iowa law and Board rules in addressing the issues raised in that complaint. After hearing from the parties, the Board voted to deny the motion for stay pursuant to Board rule 7.28. Due to the litigation status, the Board is unable to comment on ongoing litigation. There is specific language addressing DAMAGES in Iowa Code 479B. The Board is not aware of any refusal to sign the parental guarantees. Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., and Phillips 66 Company filed.

Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections: For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S., particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century. The comments of our readers are the most vibrant, best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News. Accordingly, we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services. It is, however, important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in. Adapt and overcome. There will be guest speakers in attendance with details being posted on our website shortly. Obviously, the pipeline builders are expecting the protector's camps to be close to, if not entirely empty, by the time the new head of the Army Corp of Engineers, trump, takes office on January 20th. Trump will probably sign the permit on January 21st, and construction of the last little bit of the pipeline will begin the next day with, they hope, no protectors to get in their way. We are HELPING them to finish the pipeline if we pretend this fight is over. It isn't. The Standing Rock Water Protectors STILL need our continued support, donations, and presence. Brace yourselves for the endless stream of conflicts of interest, none of which will be handled well. His recent actions or tweeting show him to be a kid seeing how much he can get away with. America does not need him or the bums who are working for and with him. If substandard materials can be substituted to increase profits, expect this to happen. Sabotage must be taken into account in any environmental impact studies. Whoever is here in this land's best interest, belongs here. . North America is not yet equipped to exist without oil products. It is not to be, and was never intended to be, used here in the States. There will be tremendous pressure on Trump to find a route over or under the Missouri at huge risk to the environment, and I doubt that Trump cares much about the environment anyway. (2005). The extremes of temperature and harsh climate of the northern tier almost guarantee spills in the future. As is common, such authorities go through token hearings making things look like they have been handled according to due process of law, to more or less automatically grant corporations what they seek over ninety percent of the time. They claim that they have listened to both sides, but they just go through the motions and then ignore the concerns that the public have expressed. It is an endless charade that succeeds in getting most people to give up and not stand up for their rights, just as designed, sought and successfully won by the powers-that-be. Thus, there is little or no True Justice anymore. Too many people are being fooled by this, including the ACLU. Native Americans are not as stupid as you seem to imply. They have been recipients of abuse, lies, violence and complete disenfranchisem ent longer than anyone living on the American lands so give them some credit and respect. No, I didn't. Obviously, I know that the protesters who are staying, as I knew they likely would, are not stupid, and I didn't imply that they're stupid in any fashion.
