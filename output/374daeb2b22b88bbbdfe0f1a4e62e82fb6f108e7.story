Home News in Brief The Week in Photos Viewfinder You Might Have Missed The Miseducation of Frank Waln On and off the reservation, American schools tend to whitewash the stories of Native Americans. Author: Tony Rehagen Publish date: Nov 22, 2016 Frank Waln. (Photo: Tomas Karmelo Amaya) A young man walks onto an empty stage. The spotlight glares off of his white moccasins and crisp long-sleeved button-down, which billows, untucked, over dark slacks. My Lakota name is Walks With Young People. I also go by Frank Waln. Visit Website Beyond the stage lights, in the darkened auditorium of the National Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, sit about a hundred Native American men and women from all over the country: Pueblo, Shoshone, Cheyenne, Choctaw, Cherokee, and Apache. Throughout the festival, visitors have attended events centered on Native art, poetry recitals, and traditional music, most of which celebrate the Native cultures and mourn their hastening disappearance. Visit Website Waln, the headliner, is something different. After his introduction, he is joined by the Sampson Bros., Sam and Micco, performance artists whose faces are painted colorfully beneath full and uttering Native dance regalia. Waln bends to his laptop, triggering a barrage of hip-hop beats that blasts across the venue. As the Sampsons dance to the music, the diminutive Waln springs into action, grabbing the mic from its stand and spitting lyrics at the crowd. Pain and anger are palpable in his voice as he bobs and weaves and hacks at the air with his free hand, fighting some unseen onstage foe. That is, before Waln drowns them out with a sharp verse. Your history books (lies) Your holidays (lies) Thanksgiving lies and Columbus Day Tell me why I know more than the teacher Tell me why I know more than the preacher Tell me why you think the red man is red Stained with the blood from the land you bled Tell me why you think the red man is dead The crowd is on its feet now, some singing along, others bobbing in agreement with the beat. The day before his Albuquerque concert, he spoke at a Harvard University symposium on Native politics. The crowd is on its feet now, some singing along, others bobbing in agreement with the beat. Waln is an ascendant member of a Native American hip-hop vanguard that is taking its message of social justice off of the reservation. What separates Waln and other socially engaged artists, like War Party, Without Rezervation, and Supaman, from older generations of Native artists, says Alan Lechusza Aquallo, a professor of American Indian studies at Palomar College, is their authenticity. And through his words and music, on the reservation and off, Waln plans on delivering the wake-up call. He grew up in He Dog, a small Sicangu Lakota community, where his single mom and her sisters ran the family ranch. Frank Waln. (Photo: Tomas Karmelo Amaya) He Dog is located in Todd County, where the poverty rate approaches 50 percent, a problem with deep and tangled roots. Waln remembers grappling with these manifestations even as a child. And indeed, with scant resources, schools on American reservations have fallen behind. A 2011 National Indian Education Study found huge deficits in reading and math scores for schools heavily attended by Native American students. Only 43 percent of eighth-graders said that their teachers included any Native American culture or history in their curricula. Outside the reservation, the Native historical narrative is even more distorted. Frank Waln. He learned piano at age seven; he joined a Lakota drum group in middle school. When Waln was a teenager, his older cousins started gathering in their basements to make music, influenced by rappers like Nas, Talib Kweli, Dead Prez, and Eminem. Waln started sampling beats and recording on his laptop. When he graduated high school in 2008 as valedictorian and was awarded a Gates Millennium Scholarship, he was too insecure to gamble his ticket off the reservation on a musical lark. He chose pre-med at Creighton University in Omaha. Without an outlet connecting him with his past, he says, he fell back into depression. After his sophomore year, he came home and poured himself into his music. His mother supported his interest in going to school for it. Frank Waln. In Chicago, Waln says, he also encountered the vast ignorance of the outside world. He remembers that one girl in his dorm sincerely believed that Native Americans were extinct; other students were preoccupied with pettier problems than his. With the encouragement of his teachers, Waln fused history into his music. Through hip-hop, Waln was finally learning how to heal. At the end of an intense and spirited first set, the Sampson Bros. clear the stage. Waln, silent, falls to his knees. The first shot was fired when a deaf elder refused to surrender his legally obtained rifle. The dead included women and children. Waln is on all fours, eyes closed as the elder speaks. He raps the entire song from his knees, swaying back and forth like a bop bag. As the track climaxes, he makes a gun with his fingers and brings it to the side of his head. The sound of a gunshot rings out; Waln collapses, rolling onto his back, leaving the audience in stunned silence. The largely Native audience is no stranger to this pain, those ancestral wounds. Waln, like artists Kendrick Lamar and Run the Jewels, is making music that shakes its listeners awake to the troubled state of civil rights in this country. Backstage after the show, Waln and the Sampsons are in the dressing room, unwinding in silence after an hour-long performance. Waln peels off his moccasins and rubs his feet.
