Trenches are being dug, camps are being set, and the bugle-cry of justice wafts over the plains. A battle, both peaceful and violent, is brewing. Unless you try not to listen. Counties and rivers wear the nomenclature of tribes and chiefs, their names sounding like a haunting whisper over the unsteady roads of the past. That, after three centuries of effort, America finally erased the song of a colorful history that had existed prior and learned to peacefully coexist with its lingering echo. It undermines the great mythology of our culture: that progress, in whatever form it may arrive, will come. Standing Rock strikes at the base nature of America. In the shadow of the protests at Standing Rock is an intersection of two crucial fights. The other is the fight over Planet Earth itself. The integrity of the natural world has been under attack for centuries. It was only the tools of the Industrial Age that gave us the instruments to finally roll back the edge of the wild. Yet at the doorstep of technological and social progress arrived a demon of our own making: Climate Change. Climate Change, the fruit of our pouring of pollutants into the air, is now posing a direct threat to human vitality. The essence of our species, and our ability to adapt and persevere in an ever-changing world, are directly threatened by global climate change. We are living with climate change, whether we like it or not. The history of humanity is so rooted to the planet, in its relationship to the soil and the land, that its current detachment from the natural world risks the very survival of our species. Our pure ignorance of the natural processes of the planet and the ways in which healthy ecosystems interact undeniably makes us the most environmentally ignorant species on planet Earth. It threatens our ability to survive. If not even the kindness of our hearts can push us to action, certainly self-preservation should. Nation-states have means at their disposal that, unfortunately, ordinary citizens do not yet have. Countries and governments like the United States could, with a slice of the fervor that they apply to warfare, organize their societies into a coordinated battle against Global Climate Change. We could have used our insurmountable wealth to protect the Earth and to safeguard our shared future. And, yes, America has admittedly made small but consequential gains over the past eight years. Under President Obama, we have attended climate treaties in good faith. We sat down with our international neighbors in half-attempts to make the globe a cleaner place. But none of these things were ever enough. Instead, we are squandering that opportunity. America, the most powerful nation in world history, has instead leveraged its power towards the continued destruction of the planet for material gain. We still allow corporations to have indescribable control over the ecological health of the continents and the oceans. We have consistently placed material wealth over biological health. Yet this should not surprise anyone. As much as the United States was built on the foundations of slavery and the annihilation of indigenous peoples, it was similarly fueled by the systemic destruction of the natural world. The health of the native nations and the natural integrity of the wilderness went hand-in-hand. As the Cherokee, Injuns, and Seminoles fell, so too did the old-growth forests and the herds of bison that roamed the Dakota plains. Only with the heroic voices of conservationists and political activists were we able to save the last remaining specks of our once spectacular natural heritage. We are living in an age of colossal uncertainty. Yes, the rise of Donald Trump to the Presidency will undoubtedly hinder national environmental reforms. But our inability to accept the dangers of climate change, and to mitigate them effectively, go far beyond simple party labels. And now we are reaping what we have sown. In this vein, the future of both the America and the world look bleak. Maybe the best that we can expect is piecemeal change, lurching onto climate change like a tortoise towards the finish line. The worst that we can anticipate is another American History, one in which a new Manifest Destiny is called in to plunder the last remaining wilderness. In the void that the nation-state has left with their inability to save the planet, the activist must step in. The activist must make progress where the nation cannot. No one in good faith can proclaim that. It seems, in reality, that Standing Rock is merely another instance of history stuck on loop. It merely rhymes. We hear the old chants and songs of the past; the same yells of tribes that fought for the land of yore while an impatient America ignored their pleas. But we hear them from new faces with young dreams. And this new generation of activists and leaders is poised to write its own history. The protestors at Standing Rock are loudly demanding a different future. They are standing and praying in the bitter cold, diligently defying a system that has ignored both the Earth and her indigenous peoples for centuries. Standing Rock is American history. It is human history. This is the peaceful yet strong rebuke of a political culture that, when analyzing the citizens of this nation, never consider the first peoples. Standing Rock is a legion of people not taking their world for granted. We are still a culture that eats from the table without ever considering where the food grew. We are still a people that write about saving nature on tree-pulp. Humanity is still, and may always be, an experiment in selective hypocrisy, one in which we care for the health of people but not for the planet that gives us life. But in the words of the protestors, and their valiant actions through adversity and opposition, I see hope. The people of Standing Rock are signaling, both to America and to the entire world, that there is still something on this planet worth fighting for. We have a moral obligation, both as Americans and citizens of the world, to constantly grow and work to right the wrongs of our past. Here we have an opportunity. Here, because of the hope that rises off of the protestors like steam in the cold, we have ledges of potential to grab onto. We can make our grand dreams of human equality, and an ecological balance between humans and the planet, a reality. And it begins there, in the frigid December air of North Dakota.
