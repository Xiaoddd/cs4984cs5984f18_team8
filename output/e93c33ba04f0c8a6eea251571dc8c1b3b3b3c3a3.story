Protesters first gathered outside the headquarters of the Army Corps of Engineers, the service branch responsible for approving the permit for building the pipeline segment under Lake Oahe in North Dakota. The lake is the primary source of water for the Standing Rock Sioux Nation reservation. Protests against the pipeline began in March 2016 and succeeded in temporarily halting the construction in December. Within days of his inauguration, however, President Donald Trump ordered the Army to expedite the review. The final segment of the pipeline has since been built, and the oil is scheduled to start flowing as early as Monday. Among the speakers at the rally were Standing Rock Sioux chairman Dave Archambault II and US Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii).
