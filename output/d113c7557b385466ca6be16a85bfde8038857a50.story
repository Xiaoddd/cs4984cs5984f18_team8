A Lakota prophecy tells of a mythic Black Snake that will move underground and bring destruction to the Earth. It does not take an over-active imagination to make a connection between these images and oil pipelines and spills. But to make matters worse, the nefarious reptile seems to suffer from leaky gut syndrome. Expanding pipeline maze Executive actions by Donald Trump just four days into his presidency practically guarantee expedited approval for DAPL, as well as for Keystone XL. This indicates, among other things, that the maze of oil and gas pipelines in the US will continue to expand at an unprecedented and reckless pace. The US is already home to about 2.5 million miles of underground gas and oil pipeline. For the sake of comparison, only one other country exceeds 100,000 pipeline miles: Russia, with 161,502 miles. Canada places third, with just over 62,000 miles of pipeline. All other countries fall far below that, with most containing fewer than 10,000 pipeline miles. More than 72,000 miles of the US conduits carry crude oil, and more than 20 pipelines directly threaten Native lands. Effectively opposing new pipelines and pipeline extensions will require the active participation of thousands, if not millions, of determined citizens. Water is necessary for the life of every person on the planet, and the seriousness of the situation compels every one of us to become involved to the greatest extent feasible. This monstrosity is an environmental disaster waiting to happen. The heroic water protectors at Standing Rock have achieved much, but now the ground they have gained must be fought for all over again. With the stroke of a poisonous presidential pen, Trump has already managed to betray both long-standing treaties and recent agreements, bringing dishonour and disgrace on the US government while jeopardising water supplies and planetary well-being. Significant battles There are a number of other significant pipeline battles that must be fought with the tenacity water protectors have shown at Standing Rock. These include challenges to the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP), the Diamond Pipeline, the Atlantic Sunrise expansion to the Transco Pipeline, the Transmountain Pipeline expansion, the Bayou Bridge Pipeline, the Pilgrim Pipeline, the Trans-Pecos and Comanche Trail Pipelines, the Algonquin Incremental Pipeline, the Alberta Clipper pipeline expansion project, Northern Gateway Pipeline and more. It will travel along a route starting in north-western West Virginia and ending in southern Virginia, with a detour into Pennsylvania. The MVP would cross 377 bodies of water, the Appalachian Trail and the Blue Ridge Parkway, and could adversely affect thousands of acres of forest habitat. Along the way, the Diamond will cross the Arkansas River, the Illinois Bayou, the White River, St Francis River, and the Mississippi River. Diamond Pipeline One of the most disturbing aspects of the Diamond Pipeline is its point of origin. The title is proudly announced on signs placed at the entrances and exits to the town, which was once a part of the Sac and Fox reservations. The area surrounding Cushing has also recently become incredibly earthquake prone, thanks to the large number of waste-water injection wells. The US Geological Survey reported 825 earthquakes of a 1.5 magnitude or greater in the Cushing area between January 14, 2016 and January 14, 2017, with an alarming 5.8 record-setter in nearby Pawnee last September. Each of the planned, proposed, and under-construction pipelines listed above deserve strong opposition, as do the many other pipelines still in the planning and approval stages. They are dangerous, as evidenced by the number of leaks, spills, and explosions. In the six-year period between 2010 and last year, 4215 pipeline incidents occurred. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration reported that pipeline accidents between 2010 and 2015 were responsible for a total of 26.5 million lires of crude oil being leaked into surrounding soil and waterways. The as-yet-untallied quantities lost last year and so far this year will add significantly to that total. Many of the existing pipelines are old and poorly maintained, and for some reason, the newer pipelines are even more accident prone. Human error causes some of the pipeline accidents, while natural occurrences are responsible for others. In 2013, for example, lightning struck a pipeline in North Dakota, causing 3.2 million litres of crude oil to spill onto a nearby wheat field. One wonders what will happen when the ongoing swarm of fracking-related Oklahoma earthquakes damages the Cushing oil storage tanks or the pipelines connected to the facility. Oil pollutes the water and land, sickens and kills. Natural gas contributes to climate change, pollutes the air and explodes. Oil and gas pipelines create temporary jobs for a relative few and permanent jobs for a small handful. Individuals living near petrochemical plants contend with chronic respiratory illnesses and high rates of cancer. With so many clean, green energy sources ready to be put into place, there is no reason to allow the Lakota prophecy of the planet-destroying Black Snake to become a permanent and fatal reality. The turnaround will not happen easily. In fact, it will be quite a struggle. Greed is strong, and the oil corporations wield unreasonable power. Now they have even more friends in high places, including the one who may as well be referred to as the CEO of the USA. But the previous halting of Keystone XL and the temporary victory at Standing Rock have proven that it is indeed possible to make a difference with determination and solidarity. The frightening number of proposed pipelines and the likelihood that those pipelines will receive swift approval make it clear that the battle for Mother Earth is indeed a war.
