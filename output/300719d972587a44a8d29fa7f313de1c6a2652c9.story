If like me you have chosen the path of social change you know the road is long and full of disappointment. In fact disappointment becomes a way of life, just another shoulder shrug and onto the next hurdle. Of course you are always hoping it will be different this time, despite the odds. Not unlike the gambler that know the house always wins. But then, the unexpected happens. This is what happened to me when I heard that the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline will not continue at Standing Rock because the easement to the company has been denied. I had to let it sink in. As I think about this question, images of people at Standing Rock pop up. I see Blue Owl holding her new born baby, the first baby to be born at the camp at standing rock. She named her son Mni Wiconi which means water is life. I see women stomping their feet, shaking their bodies and singing, while they perform the sacred jingle dance. I see shadows of grandmothers reflected on the walls of a teepee. The teepee representing the womb, from which one is reborn every day. I see the US veteran who walked up to the razor sharp barbed wire wearing his uniform and holding the US flag. I am the first of many warriors to come. These are people I have never met, yet I see their faces and hear their voices. I would even consider them my friends. So basically I owe them big time for taking on the cold, the pain, the aggravation, while I sit comfortably at my desk. Spiritual Bankruptcy 1,7 M people have checked in at Standing Rock with their Facebook accounts. Those millions of people, and I count myself among them, more than anything want to know there is hope. And we are looking at those who traditionally root our beliefs to the land and water. It is not surprising that it has hit a sensitive chord in America and Europe alike, increasingly secular societies in which religious meaning has been pushed back to the private domain. Collective forms of religion are at best associated with backwardness and at worst with fundamentalist extremism. Meanwhile there are a lot of lonely spiritual people out there. Sharing your yoga studio is not the same as sharing a dream, a vision, a belonging. In a society that is lost, 1.7 M people have found a beacon. A few years back some of these people were part of the occupy movement. I was also one of them. First, the occupy movement never had a grounding. And most of the participants were struggling to begin to understand the issues at hand. As a result confusion dominated my conversations, which ranged from right out crazy to very intellectual. Water and subsequently food is as real as it gets. A water dystopia will make you wish for a financial crisis. Second, and more importantly the occupy movement had a different personality, it was angry, it was masculine, it was white and not very lovable. Although it was non-violent, anger meant that there was little constructive dialogue. Just like the Lakota Sioux women that I saw perform their jingle dance. At occupy you saw masks, at Standing Rock you see faces that have nothing to hide. I doubted posting this when I heard of the oil spill that took place 150 miles from Standing Rock at a branch of the Missouri river. Everything the people at standing Rock are trying to prevent seems to have happened. But in a way it is good that this spill happened before the eyes of the world. Because in North Dakota alone there were a 150 oil spills last year that we never heard of. Now that we know, it is a very painful reminder that water is a right, but not a given. And if we do not change the way our environment is sold off at a sales prices to big companies and financial institutions, we are going to be denied the fundamentals of life. This has nothing to do with right or left wing politics, it has to do with power and powerlessness. We need Standing Rock to keep standing. The leadership of Standing Rock is encouraging its members to go home. The main reason being that the increasing group of protestors is creating a burden on the ecosystem. As they return home, 1.7 M people like me remain sitting at their desk and I wonder what we can do. Looking for inspiration I attended my first a water ceremony yesterday. There was a child pooring water in a bowl. Her mother looked up at the grey sky with a look of pain in her face. Drums were beating. These people were not native Americans, they were Dutch people in my home town. I left not knowing what to make of it, but it felt good to be standing for 2,5 hours, rather than sitting. Still, I am not Lakota Sioux, none the less I share their believe in the sacredness of water. Still, I spend significantly more time looking at my computer. While I do, thoughts and information are free-flowing together to create article, ideas and projects. Like water I can flow anywhere. So I have decided to be a water keeper, but one in my own right. But if all of us 1.7 M flow like water we can create a rapid undercurrent that cuts through rock. The Sami are a Nordic indigenous group and together with overall public pressure were the reason for DNB to pull out of DAPL. The Rockefeller foundation has just announced that it will divest completely from fossil fuels. Ironically finance could play an important role in pushing the energy transition forward. But that is not where I expect the leadership. I expect to find it with those who have always led us: with the keepers of the earth and water, the keepers of our spirit. Standing Rock to me has shown how much they are tied together and how strong they can be if they are united. I think as a novice water keeper I can learn a lot from them. I hope they will keep filling my inbox with prayers and wisdom. I hope they will continue flowing once they stop standing. More than anything I want to believe spirit can prevail over greed.
