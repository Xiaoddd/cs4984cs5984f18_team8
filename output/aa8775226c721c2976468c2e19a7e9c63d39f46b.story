That's why the corn is genetically modified, to survive the most dangerous herbicide on the planet. First the researchers examined levels of lithium in drinking water and suicide rates in the prefecture of Oita, which has a population of more than one million. Then they found that the suicide rate was significantly lower in those areas with the highest levels of the element, they wrote in the British Journal of Psychiatry.
