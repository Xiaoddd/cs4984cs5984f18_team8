The spill comes just days before a crucial decision next Monday by the Public Service Commission in Nebraska over whether to grant a permit for a new, long-delayed sister pipeline called Keystone XL, which has been mired in controversy for several years. Both are owned by Calgary-based TransCanada. The spill on the first Keystone pipeline is the latest in a series of leaks that critics of the new pipeline say shows that TransCanada should not receive another permit. The company said it obtained permission from the landowner to assess the spill and plan cleanup. Walsh said the leak was detected about 5:30 a.m. The first Keystone pipeline, which runs 1,136 miles from Hardisty in Alberta, carries about 500,000 barrels a day of thick bitumen from the oil sands area to pipeline, refining and storage networks in Steele City, Neb., and Patoka, Ill. TransCanada told the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration that the May 7, 2011, spill at the Ludden pump station was caused by a threaded connection on small diameter piece of pipe that had been installed improperly, causing stress fatigue. There were two other small leaks at pumping stations that month. TransCanada first applied for a permit for its Keystone XL pipeline in 2008, but it has been delayed by environmental concerns. Some opponents said the pipeline would encourage the exploitation of the oil sands, whose extraction emits more greenhouse emissions than the extraction of other resources. President Obama approved the southern half of the project in 2012 but ultimately rejected the northern segment in late 2015. After his election, President Trump issued an executive order to clear obstacles for the Keystone XL, but TransCanada still needed a permit from the independent, five-person Nebraska PSC. TransCanada, by contrast, said the pipeline would be good for the economy and would create jobs. Trump promised to build the Keystone XL. Three votes in Nebraska could stop it.
