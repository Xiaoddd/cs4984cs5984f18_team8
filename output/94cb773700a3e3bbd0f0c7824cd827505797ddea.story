National Their camp turning into a pit of mud, Dakota pipeline protesters packing up to leave By Joe Heim Joe Heim Reporter covering numerous areas, including white nationalism, schools, student culture and Native American issues Email Bio Follow February 12, 2017 The protest camp near the Dakota Access pipeline drilling site, in North Dakota, where rising temperatures have led to snowmelt and rising water, shown on Saturday. Many protesters are preparing to leave the camp. The rising waters, and a federal eviction notice for Feb. 22, have forced their hands. Others say they will stay and fight the Army Corps of Engineers, which decided last week to allow completion of the 1,172-mile pipeline. The drilling began last week. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has joined a motion by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe to halt the drilling. Horses still run free in the camp. Small packs of dogs dart about, tussling in the snow, their barks drowned out by the incessant whine of a snowmobile that wends its way through the slushy mess. Everything is white, brown, gray. The only flashes of color come from weatherworn tribal flags, banners that were jubilantly raised last summer and now, some in tatters, snap to and fro in the ever-changing wind. One day soon, all of this will be gone: the tepees packed away, the yurts pulled down, the abandoned tents and sleeping bags and boxes of belongings scraped up by bulldozers into waiting dumpsters and hauled off to landfills. Josh Dayrider, a member of the Blackfeet Nation of Montana, has been at the camp off and on since early last year. We woke the world up by showing how the oil companies treat the land and the people. Tanya Olsen stood next to her mini-camper, pulling out a mattress that had been soaked by rising waters. She arrived here in November. I knew very little about pipelines. But what really caught my attention was the mistreatment of the Natives here. As she prepares to leave, Olsen says she takes solace from the impact the year-long protest has had on tribes. The yell is picked up and repeated from different corners of the camp for a minute or so, echoing up to a snowy bluff overlooking the encampment where state and local police sit in a fleet of law enforcement vehicles, monitoring comings and goings. Quiet returns. But he arrived at Reagan National Airport to learn that final approval had been granted while he was en route. Their teacher, Kim Warren, a tribal member, said she made regular visits to the main camp in the fall, believing the protest was a necessary and valuable one. As legal options dwindle and the prospect of a completed pipeline that could begin transporting more than 500,000 barrels of crude oil a day in two to three months appears more likely, its opponents are taking stock. Dallas Goldtooth has been one of the leading voices of the protest, filing regular Facebook Live feeds to share the most recent developments. An environmental activist who is an Isanti Dakota from Minnesota, he wants supporters to know that their participation has not been in vain, no matter what the outcome. The fight never stops. It builds. It moves. Some activists have called for more protesters to come out to the site, but the Standing Rock tribe has discouraged that, asking that opposition be directed at the local level and at a March 10 march planned for Native American rights in Washington. The tribe welcomed the 200 or so Native tribes that gathered here in late summer and fall to help their cause, and it welcomed the national and international support that followed.
