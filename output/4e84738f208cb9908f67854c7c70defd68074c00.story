Not Jobs or Energy Independence. You can find new stories here. Profit. By Jonathan Thompson Miles of unused pipe prepared for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline sit in a lot in October 2014 outside Gascoyne, North Dakota. As the weather gets colder, the fight over the Dakota Access Pipeline is heating up, in rather ugly ways. One protester may lose her arm as a result of injuries suffered during the violence. Construction on the pipeline is about 85 percent complete and it has, indeed, put people to work. Yet it is not clear how many new jobs have been created since the jobs are spread out over 1,000 miles. That, in turn, generates sales and lodging tax revenues for the local governments. In a few months, when (and if) construction is complete, the workers and their spending money will depart. The finished pipeline will require just 40 permanent maintenance and operational jobs along its entire stretch. That said, it might be enough to buy the county sheriffs some more military gear from the Pentagon in order to squelch the next pipeline protest. They otherwise go mostly unnoticed until they spill, burst, or explode. The bigger-picture impact, whether on climate change or energy independence, is more difficult to suss out. That is, if you expand pipeline capacity for North Dakota crude, it will encourage more oil drilling and thus more oil production. If more domestic oil is produced, the logic goes, then we have less need to import foreign oil and we achieve greater energy independence. The flip side to that is the more oil we drill, the more we consume, resulting in greater carbon emissions. We can move crude oil not only through pipelines but also with trucks, trains, and tankers. The lack of pipeline capacity is not a major limiting factor in oil development and production; when the North Dakota boom was on, no one opted out of drilling because of a lack of transportation options. In fact, prices were so high, no one opted out of drilling at all. Just as the biggest driver of oil development is a high oil price, the biggest hindrance, particularly for expensive-to-drill North Dakota crude, is a low oil price. That relationship has been on display in North Dakota, and across the West, for the last decade: Oil prices went up, thanks to burgeoning demand in China and the developing world, so drilling intensified and production went bananas. Wells that produced 220 barrels per day when they were drilled in 2005, for example, now only produce about 20 barrels per day. No longer does more pipeline capacity directly lead to more production; it must first either raise the price of oil, or induce demand. A pipeline across the upper Midwest will not inspire the masses in China to buy cars and drive them all over the country. It will not affect global demand. The Dakota Access Pipeline is expected to carry a half-million barrels of oil per day to refineries and market hubs in Illinois. After the last bust, producers and their investors are unlikely to fork out that kind of cash until oil prices go up considerably and stay there, which will only happen if Saudi Arabia commits to a long-term slash in its production. Unless new wells are drilled in North Dakota at a furious rate, production will continue to decrease, thanks to the decline curve. There is one other way the pipeline could impact oil prices, at least for the oil flowing through the line. Some oil customers reportedly entered into contracts with producers prior to construction to buy DAPL oil at or near 2014 prices. If those contracts remain in place despite the protests-caused construction delay, it could, theoretically, push producers to drill a few more wells to produce enough oil to fetch the higher price. But probably not. The glut grows. Prices slide further downward. Production slides. The cycle continues. Therefore, it will not directly lead to a significant increase in carbon emissions. Nor will it get the U.S. any closer to energy independence. The equation that answers that one is far simpler. Yes, Trump is invested in the companies behind the pipeline, though the amount of his stake decreased substantially between 2015 and 2016.
