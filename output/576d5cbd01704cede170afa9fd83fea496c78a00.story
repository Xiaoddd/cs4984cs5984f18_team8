Also pictured is Craig Stevens, spokesman for Grow America's Infrastructure Now, who joined a discussion about the aftermath of the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. Eid, formerly Colorado's U.S. attorney, said he worked with one pipeline company that spent five years negotiating with 43 tribes for a natural gas pipeline. Companies can look to best practices to minimize risk of lawsuits, including engaging with tribes early and giving consideration to non-tribal lands that may have cultural or religious significance to Native Americans, Eid said. To counter the campaign against the pipeline, Stevens and the coalition began speaking out in favor of the project and using social media to counter misinformation. Pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners did not have a media relations team in place that could handle the magnitude of the protest and, in some cases, was limited by attorneys about what could be said, according to Stevens. For future infrastructure projects, it's important for companies to have a game plan including public relations, Stevens said. Some Dakota Access opponents used troubling tactics, such as posting threatening messages on social media and publishing the home address of the pipeline developer's CEO, Zehr said.
