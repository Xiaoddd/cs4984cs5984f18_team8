Since April, protesters, who have described themselves as water protectors, have gathered at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota in an attempt to stop the development of a crude oil pipeline that they say would rip through sacred land, destroy natural resources and open the door to devastating social and environmental impacts. Over the last eight months, the protesters said they have been maced, shot with rubber bullets and kept in dog cages by police. Most recently, a demonstrator was seriously injured in an explosion protesters say was caused by police. Police, in turn, have blamed the protesters for the explosion. Since 2014, Energy Transfer Partners has been developing the route for the Dakota Access pipeline, which was originally directed through the Missouri River, just 10 miles north of Bismarck, North Dakota. After the Army Corps of Engineers determined that the environmental risk was too high and could potentially endanger critical drinking water sources, the route was re-evaluated. Despite resistance from tribal leaders, the pipeline was redirected away from Bismarck and instead routed through the Standing Rock Reservation. The Army Corps recently released a statement demanding the protesters leave their camp, located just north of the Cannonball River, by Dec. 5. In their statement, the Army Corps said that their request is aimed at protecting the general public from violent confrontations between protestors and law enforcement and from the harsh weather approaching. Sandy Tolan, journalist and professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, has made several trips to Standing Rock this fall and has recently returned to continue covering the protest. He said he is impressed by the passion fueling the Standing Rock Movement. All throughout the country, rallies and protests have been popping up in support of Standing Rock, including here in Los Angeles. On Sunday, there was a march in Washington, D.C., to bring to light anti-pipeline sentiments. Despite national support, Tolan said the presence of law enforcement in Standing Rock is distressing. Hundreds of officers come out in riot gear. The size of this pipeline is significant, especially when considering the environmental impact and the global contribution to climate change. The Dakota Access Pipeline, which is planned to go on line early in 2017, will carry anywhere from 470,000 to 570,000 barrels of oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois, according to Energy Transfer Partner's website. Despite little talk on environmental issues at during the election, President-elect Donald Trump has been loud and clear about his position on pushing investment into fossil fuels. While he hasn't specified on whether or not he is in support of the the Dakota Access Pipeline, he laid out his intentions to move forward with the Keystone Pipeline in his 100 Day plan. Although Trump recently sold off his stock in Energy Transfer Partners, his previous financial relationship with the oil industry has many people concerned about what his presidency could mean for the development of the pipeline.
