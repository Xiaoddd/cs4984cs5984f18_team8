The rocky buttes and mixed-grass prairie that once enchanted the former president are punctuated with oil derricks, their Tyrannosaurus-shaped heads bobbing slowly up and down across the horizon. Semitrucks lumber along, rattling compact cars as they pass through the Bakken, an oil patch that spans some 25,000 square miles and covers much of western North Dakota, eastern Montana, and the southern parts of two Canadian provinces. Here, in this previously quaint farming community, signs of the state's oil boom are everywhere. The once-cozy Main Street has been ripped open by road construction. Banners pinned to the sides of hotels, apartment complexes, big-box stores, and chain restaurants announce grand openings. A new strip club stands two doors down from the remnants of a Christian bookstore. Williston alone has seen its population more than double, from fewer than 15,000 people in 2010 to at least 30,000 today.

This modern-day gold rush has brought the problems of the old Wild West: crime, drugs, and sexual violence. This modern-day gold rush has brought the problems of the old Wild West: crime, drugs, and sexual violence. Overall, violent crime, including murder, aggravated assault, forcible rape, and robbery, increased by 125 percent between 2005 and 2013, according to the state's Uniform Crime Reports. In Williston, calls to the police went from 4,163 in 2006 to 15,954 in 2011; in nearby Watford City, from 41 to 3,938 in that same time frame. It's gotten so bad that earlier this year, the FBI announced it would open a new permanent office in Williston. It was against this backdrop that officials in the Bakken started to worry about a different kind of crime. The small-town police departments were overwhelmed by day-to-day calls, forcing detectives off larger investigations and back on the streets to respond to bar fights and patrol for drunk drivers. Social services, too, were overrun. Williston's battered-women shelter reported a 300 percent increase in victims between 2009 and 2011. Workers there were in triage mode, with no time to define what they were seeing or identify trends among victims. Those factors, combined with the large male population newly flush with cash, meant it was open season for opportunists. They would soon.

But after a few months, their relationship crumbled: He lost his job, they started doing meth, and he started mentally and physically abusing her. Eventually, he became her first pimp, selling her to his boss when he took a new job as a mechanic. High at the time, Jordan doesn't know how much money her ex made from selling her. a classified website notorious for prostitution, earning money to keep a roof over her head. She also spent a month under a pimp's control, circling around oil towns with two other women, one from Milwaukee, the other from Atlanta. They went to the mall, got their nails done, stayed in nice hotels, ate good food.

Detectives posed as someone selling a 14-year-old girl on classified websites and arrested interested buyers. One weekend in Williston, police arrested three men; two weeks later, they arrested 11 in Dickinson, a town of roughly 25,000 located about two hours away. Police had to shut down the sting ahead of schedule because Dickinson ran out of jail space. Fourteen arrests may not sound like an emergency to city dwellers, but to many in this rural area, it was devastating. Victims here were at a huge deficit: There were no social-service organizations or advocacy groups specifically focusing on the issue in the state and no safe houses or shelters dedicated to trafficking victims. Even the federal government was concerned. As anyone who's lived through one knows, there's nothing like a natural disaster to bring a community together. Together, they formed a new anti-trafficking coalition called FUSE (a Force to end hUman Sexual Exploitation) and named Sambor coordinator. They walked away fired up, their mission clear: Quantify the scope and scale of trafficking in the area, raise public awareness, increase victims services, and institute forward-thinking legislative and law enforcement practices to fight the problem head on.

Her mother, who worked in corrections, taught her that she could be whatever she wanted to be. So she went to law school outside of Los Angeles, worked in Washington, D.C., with Polaris, and looked forward to an exciting career taking on big issues in big cities. But Sambor graduated in the middle of the recession and found her options limited, so she moved back to Bismarck to work in a private practice. To her surprise, those big-city issues she dreamed of tackling were right before her eyes. On a warm day this June, Sambor and Erin Ceynar, 41, a North Dakota native and fundraiser for the Women's Foundation of Minnesota, are touring the Bakken, trading stories of junkyards stacked with abandoned RVs and truck drivers who toss bottles of urine out the window. Ceynar's throat clenches up. Ceynar grew up in the wide-open spaces between Watford City and Williston, working oil jobs on summers off from the University of North Dakota. One day, in 1994, while Ceynar was recording data at a site, an employee threatened to assault her in a nearby field. Holy shit, she thought. I'm gonna get raped right now. Instead, another coworker intervened. But when Ceynar told her boss about it, the employee wasn't punished. She was, relegated to counting pipes alone in a warehouse for her own protection.

Working on an anti-trafficking campaign called MN Girls Are Not For Sale, she interviewed several survivors at Breaking Free, an anti-trafficking nonprofit. One girl described being sold for sex at a hotel where Ceynar had done 4-H exhibits as a child. Ceynar e-mailed Purdon, with whom she'd discussed women's issues in the state over the years, to see how she could help. He connected her with Sambor, who had been talking with him about combating trafficking, too. The two women started exchanging e-mails and eventually met face-to-face in Minneapolis in the fall of 2013 at a conference on trends in victims services hosted by Ceynar's employer. They decided they had to develop some sort of coordinated effort, where all the major players could work on anti-trafficking initiatives. The first step was to increase public understanding of what it means to be trafficked. Victims are more often women who were sexually abused at a young age and sold for the first time by someone they trust, like a parent or boyfriend. By that definition, anyone being sold by a pimp who controls their comings and goings and cash supply is being trafficked. Victims are more often women who were sexually abused at a young age and sold for the first time by someone they trust, like a parent or boyfriend. Sure. Women posing as victims even started using the shelters to recruit others to work for their pimps. ads for four months and found 70 percent of the women had been for sale in a different state the previous week.

In June 2014, Levell Durr of Wisconsin was arrested on charges of transportation for illegal sexual activity in Bismarck. In court, an FBI special agent testified that Durr had trafficked three women to North Dakota, used drugs and physical violence to keep them compliant, and forced them to have sex for money and then turn it over to him, kissing his hand when they did. At one point, the FBI agent said, Durr kept a girl in a dog kennel for days for breaking one of his rules. Three months later, California natives Trina Nguyen and Loc Tran were accused of luring women from their home state by promising large amounts of money for work in massage parlors in Dickinson and Minot. The parlors were actually brothels, and an FBI affidavit alleges Nguyen and Tran used their earnings to pay for Backpage ads. Then, in December, a Williston resident named Keith Graves, who came from California, was charged in federal court with sex trafficking by force or coercion.

Working at a feverish pace required both by the high stakes of the problem and the fact that North Dakota's legislature meets only once every two years, the coalition drafted and, in April of this year, successfully lobbied the state's conservative government to pass a suite of trafficking bills. While the frenzied work was underway in North Dakota, Congress was working on a legislative package of its own. Introduced in the U.S. Senate in January and signed into law by President Barack Obama in May, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act was designed to crack down on traffickers while improving services for victims. As an undercover agent for North Dakota's Bureau of Criminal Investigation, his appearance has helped him during trafficking stings. ad. By then, Jordan had left her pimp and was selling herself online. When Fontenot knocked on her hotel room door, she screened him through the peephole and thought, Easy. She opened the door wearing a crop top and thong, and tried to give Fontenot a hug. Unlike in prostitution stings that aim to arrest sex workers, Fontenot's goal during these encounters is to make sure the women are over 18, doing all right, and have access to help if they need it. Just a couple years ago, Fontenot says he would have seen women like Jordan as criminals rather than victims. But in the past two years, through conversations with FUSE members and trainings that encourage cops to view people in prostitution as individuals who might need help, his perspective has changed. Because Jordan wasn't arrested when Fontenot knocked on her door, she had a chance at another new start. At a client's house a month or so later, she decided she'd had enough. Today, back in New York, she's working to put her own life back together. This spring, at age 20, she earned her high school diploma. All Rights Reserved.
