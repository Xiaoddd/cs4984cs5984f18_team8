Parts 104-108, 110-117, 122-140, 230-233, 401-471, and 501-503. Sewage Sludge Use and Disposal Program - Establishes a permit system covering the use and disposal of sewage sludge by land application, surface disposal, incineration, and disposal in a municipal solid waste landfill. Water quality standards are state or tribal goals for individual water bodies and provide the legal basis for control decisions under the CWA. States are required to establish a priority ranking for such waters, taking into account the severity of the pollution and the uses to be made of such waters. Facilities must sample the effluent, submit reports on the results of such sampling at a frequency specified in the permit and submit monitoring reports to EPA, States, or POTWs with approved pretreatment programs. EPA or State inspectors may have access to any records, inspect any monitoring equipment, and sample any effluent to check compliance with NPDES permit requirements, water quality standards, pretreatment standards, effluent limitations, or toxic standards. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 amended section 312 by directing EPA and the Department of Defense to jointly establish Uniform National Discharge Standards for discharges (other than sewage) incidental to the normal operation of a vessel of the Armed Forces. Dischargers generally must submit Discharge Monitoring Reports that record flow measurement, sample collection data, and laboratory test results on a quarterly or monthly basis. Noncompliance reports generally must be submitted quarterly or monthly stating the cause of a noncompliance, period of noncompliance, and plans to eliminate recurrence of the incident. MS4 permits require operators to develop and implement a stormwater management program to reduce the discharge of pollutants in discharges from the MS4 to the maximum extent practicable, and to meet other permit requirements as determined appropriate by the permitting authority. However, the Army Corps of Engineers retains authority over certain waters and their adjacent wetlands within the State. The prohibition shall continue until the Administrator certifies that the person corrected the condition set in motion by such conviction. The rule applies to owners or operators of certain facilities that drill, produce, gather, store, process, refine, transfer, distribute, use, or consume oil or oil products. The regulation requires that all regulated facilities (including Federal facilities as specified in 40 CFR 112.1(c)) have a fully prepared and implemented SPCC Plan. These guidelines include measures such as secondary containment, facility drainage, dikes or barriers, sump and collection systems, retention ponds, curbing, TCPS (tank corrosion protection systems), and liquid devices. Under the regulation, facilities must detail and implement spill prevention and control measures in their SPCC Plans. The term also includes mobile or portable facilities, such as drilling or workover rigs, production facilities, and portable fueling facilities. A new SPCC Plan is not required each time the facility moves to a new site. However, the regulation states that the position or location of onshore mobile or portable oil storage tanks (onshore) should be such as to prevent spilled oil from reaching navigable waters. In addition, in accordance with the regulation, facilities should furnish a secondary means of containment, such as dikes or catchment basins for the largest single compartment or tank. Any person in charge of an onshore or offshore facility must notify the National Response Center (NRC) immediately after he or she has knowledge of the discharge. Facilities must report oil discharges that reach navigable waters to the NRC at 1-800-424-8802 or 1-202-426-2675. The report to the NRC only satisfies federal reporting requirements under the Clean Water Act. Additional state and local reporting requirements may apply. In most cases it makes sense to call 911 in the event of an oil spill, particularly in the case of flammable or combustible oil spills. However, there are some exceptions. v. U.S. Postal Service, 13 F.3d 62 (3d Cir. The typical compliance agreement contains provisions such as a schedule for achieving compliance, citizen suit provisions regarding the enforceability of the settlement, and dispute resolution. This authority includes responding to discharges or a substantial threat of discharges from a vessel, offshore facility, or onshore facility. However, pursuant to the Supreme Court case Department of Energy v. Ohio, 503 U.S. 607 (1992), states cannot recover penalties for past violations against Federal facilities.
