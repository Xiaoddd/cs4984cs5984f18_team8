Lawyers for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe will file a motion this week asking a federal judge to rule on the legality of the project. And a separate tribe is suing against the pipeline on religious grounds, saying it threatens water sacred to American Indians. Up to now, opponents of the pipeline had been asking the courts to temporarily halt work on a span of Dakota Access that would run under Lake Oahe in North Dakota. Tribes in the region say Oahe has both practical and religious purposes. But the tribes are shifting their strategy now that the Trump administration has issued an easement allowing construction of the pipeline span under the lake. Boasberg gave his preliminary approval as well, when he denied a Standing Rock request to halt construction on the pipeline in September, though that decision was based on a different section of the law. Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond Law School, said pursuing an environmental impact statement could be a strong argument, but that time is running out.
