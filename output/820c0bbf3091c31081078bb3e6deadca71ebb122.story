On February 11, I spoke with Dawn Neptune Adams, a Penobscot Native who arrived at Standing Rock on February 10. This is her third trip to support the Water Protectors. Dawn Neptune Adams: I arrived at about midnight. DA: I am from the Penobscot Nation and the Fisher Clan, and I live just down river from Bangor, Maine. DA: Right. The Wabanaki Confederacy is made up of the Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, Abenaki, and Penobscot, and collectively we are the People of the Dawn. DA: Correct. AG: So you got there at midnight last night. We had some hot tea in the veterans kitchen and stayed for about three hours talking with Joseph Hock, who was tending the Sacred Fire. He has been here since August. DA: Veterans Stand is a group that came out on December 5. As I was leaving, I heard that there were thousands of them arriving. DA: A veteran that I spoke to this morning was from Tennessee and he was holding a Veterans Stand flag, but he wanted everyone to know that there are a lot of veterans from many different groups, not only Veterans Stand, coming to help. Another already here is Veterans Respond. Laramie Treaties of 1851 and 1868, but the Army Corps of Engineers are claiming it anyway. Oceti Oyate, formerly known as Oceti Sakowin, will be totally cleaned out except - maybe - for the parts on high ground like Media Hill and the legal tent near it. Sacred Stone Camp is mostly on high ground. What needs to be moved there is the area known as Yurt Village, which is next to the Cannonball River. Everything has to be moved by February 22nd. DA: There is an evacuation order for that day. If the yurts aren't moved, they might be confiscated or destroyed. People are moving their homes and belongings to keep from losing them. However, that doesn't mean that no one will be there to resist on that treaty land. There'll be a presence there, though I'm not sure what kind. Maybe the vets. DA: Be prepared to survive some vicious weather. The temperature today is 38 degrees, but anyone on their way here should be prepared for it to get as harsh as 50 degrees below with wind chill. Ice cleats are essential. One woman without ice cleats slipped and hurt her hip yesterday. There are children here, and people are doing their best to keep them safe. A group of high school students from many tribes came to bring them toys this weekend. I brought my seven-year-old daughter with me in December, but I didn't bring her this time because I was uncertain about safety now that the Army Corps has issued its evacuation order. One of the yurts was ablaze. I walked down to Yurt Village to see if I could help, but by the time I got there, the fire was out and no one had been harmed. On my way back to bed, I ran into a man named Romeo who was pulling a big sled filled with belongings from a yurt near the river. The people who are still here are the strong ones. They're not here to play. They have suffered through unimaginable things. And they still stand. So come help, but come prepared. All rights reserved.
