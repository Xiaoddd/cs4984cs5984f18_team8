Tesoro oil spill still not cleaned up One of the largest onshore oil spills in US history continues to highlight the dangers of oil pipelines, as the battle over the four-state Dakota Access pipeline continues. The massive oil spill still isn't fully cleaned up three years and three months after it happened, and the company responsible hasn't set a date for completion. Less than a third has been cleaned up. In the wake of another spill this month, 150 miles further south, as well as the ongoing debate over the four-state Dakota Access pipeline, the slow progress of the Tesoro Corp. cleanup is causing some consternation. A farmer noticed the smell of oil permeating the air for days on end, and the wheels of his combine became coated in the stuff. Yet Bill Suess, a North Dakota Health Department environmental scientist, worries that much of the oil may never be removed. Neither is believed to have contaminated any water sources, but in the Belfield incident an estimated 176,000 gallons of oil spewed into a creek that feeds the Little Missouri River, a tributary of the Missouri River. Freezing temperatures appear to have limited the spread. The builder of that pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, says that remote monitoring will allow workers to shut down the pipeline in case of a leak. When oil spewed from the Belfield line earlier this month, monitoring equipment failed to detect the leak, and it fell to another farmer to raise the alarm. Far from any major population centers, no water sources were threatened, but an unknown amount of private and US Forest Service land along the waterway was fouled. Crews have been digging as deep as 50 feet, removing hundreds of thousands of tons of tainted soil. Get unlimited Monitor journalism. Log in for unlimited digital access.
