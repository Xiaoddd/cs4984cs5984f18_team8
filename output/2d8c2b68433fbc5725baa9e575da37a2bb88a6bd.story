For every land it passes should require the same, that a study locally be done, as well before approving make sure the entire length has been done. Enough scars from fragmented science being manipulated or misinformed, etc. That is bad science. We will ask you to announce the rollout of our agenda and a full-throated support of a unified electorate. We are a small band of determined citizens who believe that every American deserves the same opportunities, the selfsame life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Together we can help the better members of Congress find their courage and replace the rest. Our agenda is simple: Rebuild the American economy by adding millions of high-wage jobs. Dakota pipeline is good example. Reps can be in interchangeable roles so they them self do their part as a mindful local participant. NO ONE SHOULD OF HAD TO SUFFER LIKE ANY OF THIS IN PAST AS WELL NOW THAT CONTINUES. Let the truth be told. But only if we all have something identifiable to relate it to. No GMOs as other countries are not even allowing them. When yet US is hung up still on wanting them labeled. Forget the FIGHT TO LABLE. Just tell what is in your product on the lable. Celebrating along the awy that together all make this a better world to live in for all. Not even a religion. Not more religious stories of the past or even fragmented bad science that many permitted. Not profit over it as others stay without. respecting all life. It is not the natural way of any ecosystem, rather all are interdependent on our neighbors also balancing their genetic biodiversity supporting migratory life that sustains all. Yet many talk only about America. Yet many Americans support the wars. As many profit from them. US has yet to learn how to have an economy without wars. Making space for neighbors in time of ER whether natural diasters or human made. So no more false aid comes from a far or interferes. Where many are interfered with by US, then have to leave to survive. Or they rebel becoming ill them self, then on to hurting others as well oneself. From this interference from others. Knowing their boundaries of who to work with. So all can enjoy making these transitions friendly instead of horror stories as they continue. Long before they lead into a mindbody illness, etc. This way the whole family continues to explore as all support each other or do it together, etc. No one should have to stay in one place. That is our human right. Many issues of the times, yet not all are yours. Knowing when to help another or when to do it collectively. In fact in our travels we have seen, as well we are guilty ourselves, as many chase the American materialistic delusional ideas, that one cannot see the natural solutions below their feet. We are not saying all doctors are wrong, but many are. As well not properly diagnosed. The credit swaps interfere in communities to live local. So the next desire of BNC we already addressed above. Vs throw people off by ideas that are generalized, keeping people preoccupied in the wrong direction, missing the whole picture. As people stay at unease picking at wrong roots of the problems. Institute real criminal justice reform. Not one get all the blame but the communities many times need to tell the truth to start this transition. Ensure equal rights across the board. No religion should be part of school. It should be a choice to choose once one is old enough to realize choices. Not people coming from afar to control what takes place. Then locally this is put into retrospect so all gain awareness to become able to make good decisions. As they worked to or maintained balance of their natural world. s we state above helping vulnerable, etc. We do not support any aggressive acts, accept for healthy egos. Rather ask. Stopping the waste that is presently being exploited around the world. ictts thanks you all for what you each can do. ictts suggests all stop fighting, enough scars from fighting. They to can help you network. As well even being transferred to Southern Hemisphere as well Nuclera plants are opening, globally that is wrong. No one can stay isolated without becoming more infested. The EIS must be done from skilled sensitive people to consult with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and evaluate how this pipeline would affect THE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL IF AN ACCIDENT. POLLUTION CONTINUES at many communities along this route. BUT MANY ECOLOGICAL REALITIES ARE NOT EVEN ADDRESSED ALONG THE ALREADY CONSTRUCTED AREAS OF THIS PROJECT, IF ALL THE COMMUNITIES DO THEIR STUDY. EXCEEDING THE NATURAL ENHANCED ECOLOGICAL LIMITS OF ANY COMMUNITY ANYWHERE ON THIS PLANET IS A CRIMINAL ACT AGAINST HUMAN RIGHTS AS WELL ALL THE WILD LIFE INVOLVED. Let alone the children having children unaware of good communication skills to self develop first then to explore relationships by mentally having shared subject matter to fuel each to self develop. As i see how beautiful the homeschooled children are. As we the people become aware of humanities options now to do it the right way.
