Christopher Mark Juhn for MPR News File Listen Protesters resolve to fight Dakota Access Pipeline 6min 59sec Monday night in Bismarck, N.D., the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe plans to speak at a public forum for the first time about a controversial encampment where tribal leaders say an estimated 10,000 people are staying to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline. In a statement Sunday, the Army Corps said it has no plans to forcibly remove protesters, but anyone staying on the camp after that date will be trespassing and subject to prosecution. The camp currently sits on a prairie, surrounded by hills next to the Cannonball River. It's called Oceti Sakowin. The name means Seven Council Fires and it represents the many bands that make up the Sioux Tribe. Some sleep in Indian teepees, others in modern campers. Many are in tents. And a few have even built tiny wooden homes. Late afternoon light illuminates a portion of an encampment called the Oceti Sakowin Camp near from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in southcentral North Dakota on Nov. 19, 2016. Ann Arbor Miller for MPR News Oceti Sakowin is on federal land, but some 150 years past, according to treaties cited by tribal leaders, the land and the rivers belonged to the Lakota people or Sioux Tribe. Tribal elders call the Standing Rock protest movement a spiritual war, a rebirth for Native Americans everywhere. More than 300 tribes are now represented, and the numbers are climbing. Native men and women spread announcements through the camp on horseback. There's a school for children, a large medical tent, kitchens throughout the prairie, and designated areas where people can find donated winter clothes. In this Nov. 24, 2016 photo Michael Penuelas of Washington State stands in the Oceti Sakowin Camp where he has been volunteering for a month. One of the elders Penuelas has met is Virgil Taken Alive. He was born and raised on Standing Rock. But Taken Alive says things are not like in the past when Native tribes physically fought white men. And especially the water. And to respect it. As news of the Army Corps' intention to shut down the camp spread over the weekend, people like environmental activist Nick Tilsen expressed renewed resolve. He says protesters will only move on their own terms. The Associated Press reports more than 560 protesters have been arrested in the area since August, including more than 30 at a mall over the holiday weekend. On Friday, protesters went to Bismarck's Kirkwood mall and formed a prayer circle. By the end, police arrested at least 33 protesters for criminal trespass. Bismarck native Rick Kringstad was at the mall that day. He's like many locals who say they want the protesters out of Bismarck, away from businesses, and off federal land. We've had a pipeline under water since the early 1950s they did that, there's no repercussions, no problem at all. I can see both sides, but enough is enough.
