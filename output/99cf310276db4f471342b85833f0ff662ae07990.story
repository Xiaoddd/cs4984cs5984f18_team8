Garrett Ammesmaki Jasmine S. LaBeau helps re-strike a teepee at the Oceti Sakowin camp on Nov. 15 in preparation for the winter. On that May afternoon, while Kane lay in the grass licking ice cream, a small white puppy playfully gnawed at her bare toes. She felt an overwhelming feeling of serenity, tinged with the knowledge that things would soon change drastically. She was right. In the next three months, violence would escalate while police and private security contractors would implement brutal tactics against protesters. In November, many people around the country were shocked to wake up to headlines about authorities using water cannons on protesters in below-freezing temperatures. She has long since stopped worrying about what she might face each day as she wakes up anew at the Oceti Sakowin camp, where she now lives just outside the Standing Rock reservation in a traditional Mongolian hut called a yurt that was recently donated. Kane is a member of the Miwok tribe. She was a Creative Loafing contributor in Charlotte before co-founding The PPL, a grassroots home for independent media, in the lead-up to the 2012 Democratic National Convention. She later moved to Arizona to produce documentaries for Vice News and most recently lived in Denver before going to Standing Rock reservation in May to help with communication training for water protectors. She left after completing that training, but soon answered a call to return and has been at the camp since. Speaking over the phone, she says she felt it was her duty to be there in a supportive role for the tribes whose water sources would be affected by the construction of the pipeline, which will travel under a nearby lake used by the Standing Rock Sioux and other Lakota tribes as a main water source. But what's always alarming is the level in which they're willing to go to harm us, especially being unarmed. We never expect to hear stories about police smiling in people's faces while simultaneously shooting them with rubber bullets in their kneecaps, or dumping water on people. She says she and other water protectors haven't had a chance to register what they've been through, but she's concerned with how the experiences will affect her later. Despite the hardships, Kane continues to get back on the horse, quite literally in one instance early in her stay in which she hurt her arm after being bucked from a bronco that had just been broken from the wild three days earlier. There was one experience, for example, in which two indigenous women, one a lesbian, presented for show the musket and flag captured during Custer's Last Stand. The mixed symbolism between history and progress in that moment stuck with Kane. Eric Schwabel The Oceti Sakowin camp at night. The lights in the distance are the pipeline construction site. From Charlotte, it can feel tough to make a difference in what's happening 1,600 miles away at the Standing Rock camps. Some Charlotte activists have made the trip to North Dakota to stand in support with water protectors, while others in the area have donated money and needed materials. Around Halloween, more than 1 million Facebook users around the country used the site to check in at Standing Rock thanks to a viral post claiming it would help confuse police who were targeting organizers on the ground there. That turned out not to be true, but did act as a symbolic show of support for those peacefully resisting the construction of the pipeline. Linda Simthong, founder of School of Jai, began planning the event after seeing videos of water protectors being brutalized online and on television. While Simthong is connected in those communities, she is not connected with the local indigenous community, so she reached out to make sure she would be helping the right people. She began to get council from a friend in Arizona who knew people on the ground at the protest site, then started hearing from people nearby. She has since been in talks with the Metrolina Native American Association as well as water protectors at Standing Rock, who have told her that Oceti Sakowin would be the best camp in which to funnel funding. Kane said people at the camp are currently in need of gear to survive the coming cold, but emphasized that people could also help in ways that didn't put a strain on their own time or resources. We have influence through our money. The most tangible and helpful thing people can do besides sending material support and sponsoring indigenous organizers is to pull their money out of the banks. Use a credit union. In the short term, however, funds and materials are needed now at Standing Rock reservation more than ever, and new threats have arisen that make it unclear whether the Oceti Sakowin camp will be around by the time Simthong throws her party. As folks at the camp prepared for an oncoming blizzard, they recently faced two eviction notices coming within days of each other; first from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers then from North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple. Garrett Ammesmaki Water protectors in the Oceti Sakowin camp prepare hay that will be used for insulation during the coming winter. The camp is on disputed land, as the government claims it's federally owned but leased for grazing, while the Standing Rock Sioux point out that they own the land by right of the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty. The letter says the land will be closed on Dec. 5, leading many to speculate that authorities would forcibly remove any water protectors who hadn't left by that date. On Sunday, however the Army Corps released a new statement stating that won't be the case. The Dec. 5 ultimatum coincides with plans by two veterans to deploy a force of hundreds of veterans to the Standing Rock reservation to join water protectors and prevent further progress on the pipeline. Wesley Clark Jr., and Michael Wood Jr., plan to arrive at the site with between 500 and 2,000 other veterans on Dec. 4 then lead an action of peaceful resistance on Dec. 5, the day the Oceti Sakowin camp will be officially closed. On Monday, Dalrymple took things a step further, ordering the mandatory evacuation of all water protectors on federally owned land. The governor cited the oncoming weather hazards and said he is taking action for the well-being of activists. As of CL's print deadline, Dalrymple had not specified how he planned to carry out the order, which states that no state agencies, emergency service officials or nongovernmental organizations will be offering emergency provisions in the evacutation area. Spokespeople for the Standing Rock Sioux have pointed out the hypocrisy of implying that authorities are worried about the water protectors' well-being after spending weeks blasting them with water cannons in below-freezing temperatures. The protesters have stood firm in stating they will remain where they are as fears grow of a forced removal taking place during harsh winter conditions in the upcoming weekend. That is our camp. It can be hard to reach Kane at the Oceti Sakowin camp, as her already-busy camp life has only accelerated in preparation for the oncoming storm. On Monday, following news of the Army Corps ultimatum and preceding the governor's evacuation order, I reached out through text message to get her thoughtson the impending deadline. Her answer, while blunt, showed that the resolve she showed during our original conversation a few days before hadn't left her or her campmates. Violence, racism and personal attacks that go beyond the pale will not be tolerated.
