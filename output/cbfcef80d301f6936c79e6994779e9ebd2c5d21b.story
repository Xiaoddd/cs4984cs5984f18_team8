And he suggested in testimony and in media appearances that dark-skinned Native Americans in Connecticut were faking their ancestry. The racially tinged remarks and broad-brush characterizations that Trump employed against Indian tribes for over a decade provided an early glimpse of the kind of incendiary language that he would use about racial and ethnic groups in the 2016 presidential campaign. The GOP nominee has portrayed Mexican immigrants as rapists and murderers, accused a Latino federal judge of bias because of his ancestry, and suggested that most American Muslims are harboring terrorists. She is the worst senator in the U.S. Senate. In one case, he lobbied a California tribe in person in an unsuccessful attempt to win the right to manage its planned casino. A Trump spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment about his history with Native Americans. Native Americans take offense When Trump began clashing with Native American tribes, the stakes for him were huge. Trump owned two casinos and opened a third in 1990. In the early 1990s, just as the casinos were emerging from bankruptcy, federal lawmakers were working out how to regulate the fledgling Indian gaming industry. Imus mentioned a Connecticut tribe that had opened the successful Foxwoods casino in 1991, saying that their members looked like black basketball star Michael Jordan. The comments offended Native Americans across the country, said Rick Hill, who at the time was chairman of the National Indian Gaming Association, a nonprofit group that lobbied government officials on behalf of tribes. What Trump did not mention during the Imus interview was that he had been trying to partner with a tribe near Palm Springs, Calif. The tribe chose to partner with another casino operator. Trump had arrived late to the hearing. The chamber was packed with people, including a class of first-graders whose school was built with Indian casino revenues. Trump stood at the back of Room 1324 of the Longworth House Building, scribbling in the margins of a seven-page speech, as top officials from the FBI and Department of Justice shot down one of his previous statements. Gay Kingman-Wapato, an Indian gaming proponent who attended the hearing, was watching Trump closely. The cause was appropriate. But his use of language was not necessarily appropriate. To get federal recognition, a tribe must submit extensive documentation to the Bureau of Indian Affairs showing that it meets seven criteria. Those include evidence that the group has maintained political influence over its members as an autonomous group since historical times and that members descend from a historical Indian tribe. The process can take decades. Trump knew the reaction he would get, Stone said. He fears nothing. Secret anti-Indian ad campaign In 2000, when New York was considering expanding Native American casinos in the Catskill Mountains, a series of TV, newspaper and radio ads popped up in the state accusing the Mohawk Indian tribe of having long criminal records and ties to the mob. As far as the public knew, the ads were sponsored by a newly formed group called the Institute for Law and Safety. Trump scrawled on a proof of the ad with the cocaine lines and syringes, according to documents first reported last month by the Los Angeles Times. Trump and Stone never reported the ad spending as a lobbying effort, as state law required, and acknowledged their role only after regulators launched an investigation. Even as he was warning of the dangers of Indian gambling in Upstate New York, Trump pushed for an Indian casino in nearby Connecticut, according to court records. The tribe won recognition in 2002, but there was a hitch. The BIA ruled that the Paucatucks were part of another Connecticut tribe, the Eastern Pequots, also seeking recognition. The Eastern Pequots had their own plans for a casino with a different builder. The federal ruling meant that the combined tribal leadership had to choose between Trump and the other developer. Among those casting a vote was Joseph Perry, a former high-ranking state police commander in Connecticut and a member of the Eastern Pequots. In 1992, Perry had become the first nonwhite officer to lead the Connecticut State Police. He retired and has been on the Eastern Pequot tribal council since 1997. Some are dark-skinned like myself. The combined council voted to go with the other developer. Trump sued the tribe, and they reached an out-of-court settlement. Perry would not disclose the details other than to say that it involved no payments to Trump. Platt answered with an expletive. Trump then picked up a yellow legal pad, slammed it onto a table and stormed out of the room, Platt said.
