Donald Trump hung a portrait of Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office on the same day that he signed an executive order to expedite construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The construction gets back on track just as protests spread nationwide from the North Dakota homelands of the Standing Rock Sioux and crystalize a new phase in the ongoing quest for indigenous rights. The pipeline fight remains combustible. In early 2016, most Americans, including the news media, were largely unaware of what was unfolding in North Dakota, transfixed as they were by the presidential campaign. The images of animals attacking peaceful protestors called to mind those of police with dogs going after African American civil rights protestors in the South only a few decades ago. Instead of deterring new pipeline opponents from joining them, the violence perpetrated on the protestors continued and brought new protestors streaming into North Dakota. He joined a group that took supplies to Standing Rock last October. Another tribe, the Cheyenne River Sioux filed a new case challenging the pipeline that summarizes the worries about the possible drinking water contamination from leaks. Not everyone wants to wait for the courts, however. Many of the people who remain at the site are moving only to safer grounds from areas that will that see seasonal spring flooding after the snow melts. This has never been about presidents of the United States or agencies. Trump is likely motivated more by his commitment to boost domestic oil and gas production than by animus against Native Americans. It could also portend the opening of another, darker chapter of conflict between Native Americans and the federal government.
