His first clue was sunshine. After a week of storms and snow, the clouds parted, warming the prairies. Tension lifted, he said. A caravan of cars filled with Veterans for Standing Rock supporters stretched a mile south on Highway 1806. News on Sunday that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of Dakota Access Pipeline, the easement needed to drill across the Missouri River at Lake Oahe, took many by surprise. The Army Corps further stated a full environmental impact statement must be made and a new route must be explored. The pipeline stretches 1,172 miles to Illinois and is projected to transport as much as 570,000 of crude oil per day, according to the Army Corps. Most, if not all of the oil transported eventually to Texas is for export and not for national consumption, activists and analysts say. He ran for congress in North Dakota this year, and has become active in the DAPL fight since his loss in November. Archambault further said more peaceful prayer is needed, but hinted that it may be time to return home. Activists on the loud speakers also began talking about how the area of Oceti Sakowin, which is in a floodplain, needed to be cleaned of all debris, tents, tipis, and equipment soon. As hundreds of veterans with Veterans for Standing Rock slowly caravanned into the camps, Kenny Frost, who works with federal agencies on indigenous training said the day was historically important. Goldooth is the director of the Indigenous Environmental Network. The real fight has only just begun. Few people are preparing to leave the camps off Highway 1806. After a brief celebration of fireworks, dancing, and singing around the sacred fire, activists resumed their work on sturdier housing. The Cannonball River is quickly freezing, and more snow and lower temperatures are predicted for the week. Bullets have been taken out of my wheels from my vehicles, tires have been slashed, brakes cut. Maybe God wanted me to see this amazing time in history. All the people think this fight is over, but it is not over. Iron eyes and others reiterated the fight is only beginning, and now, more than ever, the camps must not be emptied. The Army Corps denial of the easement means nothing until all law enforcement is gone, until DAPL is gone. Iron Eyes is further calling for renewed talks with the federal government over treaty rights. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said Army Corps decision has little to do with his office. Congressman Kevin Cramer R-ND., called the Obama administration lawless. Tribal leaders hope the new administration will respect the Army Corps stance, Archambault said.
