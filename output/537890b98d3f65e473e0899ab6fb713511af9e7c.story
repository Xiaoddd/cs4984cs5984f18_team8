CEO Jeff Bezos, Bloomberg LP founder and former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg, Alibaba founder Jack Ma, and a handful of others to join him in the fund. The coalition partnered with Mission Innovation, a group of 20 countries and the European Union that pledged to double their investment in clean energy research over five years. Gates explained that some of the members of the coalition are investing in energy on their own, and others have joined him in the new Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund. The investors in Breakthrough Energy Ventures have a high tolerance for risk and are willing to wait longer than typical venture funds for a return on their investment -- they're calling it a 20 year fund. For transportation, areas to explore include high-energy-density gaseous fuel storage, high efficiency thermal engines, and low greenhouse gas air transport. Gates invested in Pacific Ethanol back in 2005, but reportedly reduced his investment three years later; he also invested in nuclear power firm TerraPower, which has been working on building a technology called a traveling wave reactor. Khosla's firm, Khosla Ventures, bet on biofuels, including a company called Kior, which had a technology that was designed to turn wood chips into a biofuel that could be refined; the company was reported to have filed for bankruptcy and was selling off assets in 2014. So far just a few of the clean energy investments have yielded technologies that are being more widely adopted or that have been financially very successful. On a media call with Bill Gates, John Doerr, Vinod Khosla and John Arnold, Gates and others mentioned that there are lessons to be learned from the past decade of investing in clean energy. Gates highlighted the need to fail fast and not spend vast sums on large factories or refineries that might not work. If the Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund can back several companies like Tesla (in other sectors), that would be a win. Doerr said the fund will invest in both early stage companies and growth stage companies. Other investors in the fund include quite a few billionaire entrepreneurs: Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, hedge fund manager Ray Dalio, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, U.K. hedge fund manager Chris Hohn, Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife Cari Tuna, Chinese real estate developers Zhang Xin and Pan Shiyi, French telecom tycoon Xavier Niel, South African mining magnate Patrice Motsepe, German software entrepreneur Hasso Plattner (cofounder of SAP), U.S. finance titan Julian Robertson and Japanese entreprenuer and telecom investor Masayoshi Son.

In addition to the investors, Gates said that companies like Southern Co. and oil and gas company Total would serve as strategic partners that will help the fund figure out whether it's backing technologies that industry will adopt.
