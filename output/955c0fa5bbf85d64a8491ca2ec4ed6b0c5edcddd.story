But that was never enough. They wanted to own you. Swallow you up. They wanted to rip out your guts. Today a trumped up warlord sent soldiers and dogs. Never caring about your histories, traditions or lore. To your struggle. To your fight. To your tenacious battle. To your determination and might. Know that we care. And we feel your frustration. We feel your furious rage. It sears through our bones. It singes our veins. We feel your anger. We feel your ancestors pain. Remind you that the thing they take is nothing you can lose. So, let their war soldiers, with their tear spray, guns and dogs Stumble blindly over your logs. Who favored oil over honor Were the ones who lost today. Were the ones who truly paid.
