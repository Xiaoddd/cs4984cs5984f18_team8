We are going to be here throughout the winter in hopes of shutting down this pipeline, and preserving 18 million people's sole source of clean water. Temperatures get down to -60 degrees with the wind chill. This is important, not just to the natives, but to me, too. Water is the most important resource we have on this planet, and if we allow big oil companies to poison and destroy them, we'll all perish. That is why I'm here, and will stay here until this job is complete. Our great Mother will thank you in ways you cannot yet imagine. Got lots of fortifying to do now. Got my funds today, so will be buying good snow gear in a couple hours. Winter is upon us. Please try again. Sign in to track your impact. Connect We will never post without your permission.
