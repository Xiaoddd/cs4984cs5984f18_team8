Roughly only half of the eligible voters went to the polls in the 2016 presidential election. Many of them voted against a candidate they disliked rather than for a candidate who inspired them. During his Democratic primary campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders energized millions, especially the young, to mobilize and get involved in politics. We believe that a political revolution requires a party that represents working people. We call on Bernie Sanders and others to organize a new political party that is funded by the people, not special interests, and to continue the political revolution to make government work for all.
