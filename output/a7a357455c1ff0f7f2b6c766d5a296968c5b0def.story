In South Orange County, the members of the Acjachemen, along with other neighboring tribes such as the Tongva, are making themselves heard in current, local politics. Gilio-Whitaker, who derives from the Colville Confederated Tribes of Washington, also spoke up at the Laguna Beach protest. Representatives from local Native American tribes, including the Acjachemen and the Tongva, gathered at the protest against offshore oil drilling at Laguna Beach on Saturday, Feb. 3.

Most of the areas mentioned in the proposals are along the outer continental shelf of the U.S. Among Native American representatives at the protest, members of the Surfrider Foundation and Oceana were also vocal against the oil drilling. In congregation with Native American activists amplifying their voices in environmental and social justice issues, the awareness of the tribes and people themselves is also growing as a result. Of the 3 million or so people in Orange County, roughly 3,000 identify themselves as Acjachemen. After all, the natives have been here protecting these oceans and land for thousands of years, she said. Not only are there concerns for oil spills which could harm the ocean and its inhabitants, but the degradation of the local Native Americans spiritually and culturally.
