The US west coast is also contaminated and traces of seaborne Cesium 123 (the indicator of Fukushima nuclear contamination) were detected in the ocean waters. The researchers collected samples from the shores of Tillamook Bay and Gold Beach in January and February last year and conducted tests which revealed traces of radioactive Cesium 123. After more and more reports of contamination started appearing everything was clear, it was just a matter of time when the sea life will become contaminated as well. Last month researchers at the Fukushima InFORM project in Canada led by University of Victoria chemical oceanographer Jay Cullen tested several samples of sockeye salmon from Okanagan Lake in British Columbia and the results came positive for Cesium 134. Radioactive iodine 131 was also found in municipal water supplies in places like Pennsylvania and Massachusetts shortly after the initial Fukushima explosion.
