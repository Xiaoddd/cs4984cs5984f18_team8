Now, roughly a month before a key state hearing over permits that would be needed to build the pipeline, Carlson is part of a group planning to install solar panels on his farm in the same spot where the pipeline would go. advertisement advertisement The installation is part of Solar XL, an advocacy campaign currently crowdfunding solar installations along the route of the pipeline in Nebraska. Indigenous Environmental Network, CREDO, and Oil Change International. The pipeline, which also crosses through Montana and South Dakota before linking up with an existing pipeline in Steele City, Nebraska, also has approvals in the other two states. But a group of 90 farmers and ranchers resisted, and have been fighting the project for eight years. They are now part of a last stand against the pipeline, which is intended to carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Canadian tar sands to refineries in Texas. After several hearings, another will take place on July 26. In August, a panel of five public service commissioners will hear arguments from everyone involved, with a final decision on whether to issue permits due in November. The panel will also consider whether to require TransCanada to use another pipeline that already exists in the state, rather than building on new land. The installations are also an attempt to make a point about job creation. Though Trump cited jobs as a reason for green-lighting Keystone, the project would primarily create temporary jobs, and only around 50 permanent positions. The solar and wind power industries, by contrast, are among the fastest-growing sources of new jobs. Kleeb is optimistic that the permits could be denied. We have a very different way of looking at land and water and a different way of looking at politics. I feel good about our chances. advertisement advertisement advertisement About the author Adele Peters is a staff writer at Fast Company who focuses on solutions to some of the world's largest problems, from climate change to homelessness.
