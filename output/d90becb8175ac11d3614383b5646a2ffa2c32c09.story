One section of the so-called Sabal Trail pipeline is being laid beneath the crystal waters of the Suwannee river, whose pure mineral springs were once fabled to cure anything from marital strife to gout. Today, the abandoned stone bathhouse at Suwannee springs is a crumbling ruin, and the four hotels that once stood here, the last of which burned down in 1925, are long consigned to history. At first glance, the quiet town of Live Oak, with a population of fewer than 7,000, seems an unlikely venue for such a stand against big energy. But in recent weeks a sizeable woodland protest camp has grown on the banks of the Suwannee and a number of non-violent direct actions have taken place, including one last week that temporarily halted construction and resulted in eight arrests. Opponents say the building of the pipeline is harming not only the natural beauty of places such as the Suwannee, but irreversibly damaging sensitive environmental and culturally important areas in all three states, and threatening the supply of clean drinking water for millions. In these parts of northern Florida, as in much of the rest of the state, the karst bedrock being drilled for the pipeline is a fragile and porous limestone. The consortium of companies behind the project, Spectra Energy of Houston, NextEra Energy of Juno Beach (the parent company of Florida Power and Light) and Duke Energy of Charlotte, North Carolina, insist that stringent safety measures are in place and that the threat to the environment is minimal. Drilling the pipeline, they say, creates a much smaller construction footprint than highways, railroads and water mains. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Protesting the pipeline at Live Oak, Florida. Debra Johnson, who remembers playing with her siblings in the springs of the Suwannee river as a child, was one of several who spoke passionately against the pipeline at a well-attended public meeting in Live Oak last week hosted by the WWALS coalition.

The claims, however, cut little ice with Quarterman, who believes drilling for the pipeline is producing more sinkholes, which could lead to pipeline failure.
