Here's our privacy policy We need to mobilize the energy from the Women's March towards stopping Trump's dangerous agenda--the Trump administration just announced plans to gut the Department of Justice's Violence Against Women programs. President Trump wants to immediately begin cutting funding for hundreds of local rape crisis centers and sexual assault and domestic violence response training for hundreds of thousands of law enforcement officials. Gutting these programs will literally cost women their lives. Luckily, Trump can't do this alone. Congress needs to approve these cuts--if we can shut down the streets in cities across the country we can--we must--speak out and push our elected leaders to stop these cuts.
