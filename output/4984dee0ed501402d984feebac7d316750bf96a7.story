Peter O'Neil Updated: January 6, 2017 A freighter is seen in the background as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tours Vancouver harbour in December. Trudeau, for the first time seriously considering such a future, is advised to think hard about the four or five key issues he would fight for. That reputation turned much of Western Canada into a wasteland for Liberals for decades, and paralyzed successive federal governments that vowed to tackle climate change but were fearful of triggering a new backlash in Alberta. Armed with focus group data suggesting many Canadians might be skeptical of environmental groups, political aides concoct a strategy aimed at discrediting anti-pipeline activists on the eve of regulatory hearings on Northern Gateway. Suddenly, a review process that most Canadians would have likely ignored becomes highly politicized and polarized. He advised his audience to not be overly pleased about having a federal government cheerleading the industry while showing little sensitivity for demands by many Canadians for action on the climate file. Demonstrators hold up signs to passing motorists as the group Communities Against Pipelines protests in Vancouver. He has also, according to one oilpatch insider, a far less aggressive approach to lobbying federal politicians. Liberal, Conservative and NDP MPs interviewed for this article confirm that Anderson showed far more savvy. In a speech last November to an Alberta business audience, Anderson described how he would drive along the Alberta-B.C. pipeline route to ensure he knew aboriginal and municipal leaders by name. Oct. 2, 2012: Trudeau begins mapping out his vision almost immediately after he announces his long-expected candidacy for the Liberal leadership. In Calgary, he raises eyebrows by admitting his father erred in the 1970s and 1980s by bringing in the infamous National Energy Program. Oct. 30, 2013: After easily winning the Liberal leadership, but facing concerns that he is all style and no substance, Trudeau begins delivering a series of speeches on his belief that Canada will never be able to access world markets for its natural resources without adopting a more robust climate change policy. But while hinting that a Liberal government might support pipelines if Canada could also put a price on carbon, he adds a caveat that suggests to many that local communities under a Trudeau government would hold a veto over major projects. Suddenly Canadians, used to seeing a string of Alberta premiers defiantly refusing to limit the growth of a carbon-spewing oilsands industry, are faced with a diminutive, sympathetic-looking, left-leaning, giant-killing female premier who, while still advocating for pipelines to help a provincial economy hammered by low oil prices, plans concrete climate action. Oct. 19, 2015: Trudeau wins a parliamentary majority, thanks in part to a record-breaking 17 seats in B.C. The new government begins the transition with briefings that include finance department advice that economic growth is slow. It is clear to the incoming Liberals that if they want to fund their major tax break and infrastructure plans, the economy needs the construction of at least one pipeline to generate tax revenues. Three days after the election, the six federal and Alberta officials meet. He also confirms that the Kinder Morgan approval was a key part of the national carbon tax plan. Without a coherent national plan to deal with emissions, he said, Trudeau would have been under far greater pressure to reject pipeline applications. Jan. 11, 2016: The B.C. government tells the National Energy Board it opposes the Kinder Morgan project because the company has failed to prove it has adequate measures to prevent or respond to a spill. May 4, 2016: Trudeau rises in the House of Commons to respond to the devastating Fort McMurray wildfires that had left some Alberta MPs, including interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose, in tears. Alberta native Ken Hardie, the B.C. Liberal MP for Fleetwood-Port Kells, would say that his personal opposition to the Kinder Morgan pipeline was trumped by his broader empathy for struggling Albertans collecting welfare cheques. May 9, 2016: The National Energy Board approves the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion, subject to 157 conditions. Environmentalists complain that the process was tainted due to limits on who could testify, and a prohibition on cross-examining company witnesses. The federal government has also indicated possible financial support for a new transmission line to get B.C. hydroelectric power to Alberta. The Trudeau government insists its environmental review process was objective and technical in nature, and made independent of any other factors. Oct. 3, 2016: The pattern of buffering major decisions likely to upset Canadians concerned about the environment begins. This is when Notley plays her own linkage game. Protest against the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion began in earnest after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced approval for the project. Trudeau, as part of his vow to review projects in a more credible way than his predecessor, had set up a three-person panel to give the public another chance over the summer to express their views. Some opposition MPs and environmental groups dismissed the panel as a toothless and biased rubber stamp, and argue that Trudeau misled British Columbians by indicating he would make Kinder Morgan go back to the drawing board. Suddenly, environmental groups who had dismissed the panel are cheering, while the conclusions take Ottawa by surprise. He was founding editor of DeSmogBlog.com from 2005 to 2010, and co-author of Climate Cover-up: The Crusade to Deny Global Warming. Panel member Tony Penikett, the former Yukon NDP premier and SFU professor who approached Littlemore, did not respond to a request for comment on whether it was appropriate to hire a writer who has publicly identified with one side of the debate. Speaking in Stanley Park, he unveils the first of three initiatives clearly aimed at deflecting concerns about his commitment to the environment in advance of the Kinder Morgan approval. He also imposes a North Coast crude oil tanker moratorium. Dec. 9, 2016: Trudeau caps the carefully timed trifecta when he and eight provincial premiers, including Clark, agree after a year of wrangling to a national plan to price carbon as part of a strategy to combat climate change. And Trudeau, according to Leach, would have had difficulty approving that pipeline without a broad national consensus on a carbon tax.
