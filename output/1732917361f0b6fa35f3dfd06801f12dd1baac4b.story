The veterans 'deployment,' a show of support planned for this weekend, coincides with Sunday's Interfaith Day of Prayer, initiated by Chief Arvol Looking Horse, the 19th generation spiritual leader of the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota Nations. The thousands putting their bodies on the line near the reservation will be supported by a movement to mobilize people across the country to reach out to their elected representatives before Dec. 5--the date water protectors were told to leave the lands where they have been camping for months. It is time that all of us become leaders to help protect the sacred upon Mother Earth. Archambault is referring to the violence at the hands of law enforcement that left scores of people injured Sunday, Nov. 20, after a confrontation on a barricaded highway bridge. Water protectors were trying to remove burned out vehicles off the road that provides the quickest access to area medical centers. With the Monday deadline looming, there have been reports that the North Dakota governor plans to escalate the blockade, stopping supply shipments from reaching the water protectors, and threatening fines for those who don't comply. The Rev. Marlene Helgemo, pastor of All Nations Church in Minneapolis, Interim Executive Director of the UCC Council of American Indian Ministries (CAIM), and a frequent visitor to the Oceti Sakowin camp, points out that telephone advocacy is a very important way thousands around the country can show solidarity with Standing Rock. She hopes every person who has voiced support for the tribe will now use their voice to call their lawmakers. Our Senators need to hear from constituents from as many states as possible so they can act on upcoming solutions and ask the President to intervene. More than 300 Tribal Nations are offering support and allegiance to stopping the Dakota Access Pipeline. The Rev. Brooks Berndt, the UCC environmental justice minister, is currently working with a group of interfaith religious organizations around the country who plan to reach out as one to President Obama. He's encouraging clergy who want to be part of the effort to send him an email, with a statement expected before the Dec. 5 deadline. If you have any questions, contact us.
