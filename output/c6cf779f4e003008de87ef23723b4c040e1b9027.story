We cannot cross until we carry each other, all of us refugees, all of us prophets. The sea will not open that way. This time that country is what we promise each other, our rage pressed cheek to cheek until tears flood the space between, until there are no enemies left, because this time no one will be left to drown and all of us must be chosen. Of course, this does not mean that the long fight against the pipeline is over. It remains to be seen whether Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of the Dakota Access Pipeline, respects the decision of the Army Corps. An incoming Trump administration with deep ties to this company and to energy profiteering could overturn the decision. In a statement released Sunday, Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault looked forward to seeing protectors return home for the winter. As I fretted about Standing Rock, the words of the Jewish-Puerto Rican poet Aurora Levins Morales ran through my mind. Levins Morales rerouts the Exodus story away from the promised land. And so it has been with the United States. This time, safety in a promised land for some cannot come at the price of displacement for others: that country is what we promise each other.
