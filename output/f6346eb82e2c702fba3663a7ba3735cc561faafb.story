Subscribe to our free newsletters. A North Dakota judge on Monday dismissed the criminal charges that had been filed against a journalist over her reporting on a controversial oil pipeline project. Amy Goodman, host and executive producer of Democracy Now, was facing riot charges related to a report she filed earlier this month from a protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline. At a hearing Monday in Mandan, North Dakota, Judge John Grinsteiner ruled there was no probable cause to support the allegations, and he dismissed the case. The attempted prosecution caused an outcry among environmentalists and free-press advocates. Protesters gathered outside the courthouse Monday for what turned out to be a celebration, though at least one person was arrested, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Last week, documentary filmmaker Deia Schlosberg was arrested while filming demonstrators who shut down tar sands pipelines in Wallhala. Deia is facing three felony charges, which reports say carry a combined maximum sentence of 45 years in prison. The controversy over the Dakota Access Pipeline has become particularly intense in the past few weeks, with several activists and celebrities being arrested on various charges. Approved in late July, the 1,172-mile pipeline project has attracted passionate protests from Native American rights activists and environmental groups. Leading the charge are members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The tribe filed a lawsuit seeking to halt construction, saying the pipeline would cut through ancestral lands and threaten its drinking water. The charges against Goodman were filed after she reported on a clash between protesters and Dakota Access Pipeline security officers, who used dogs and pepper spray in an attempt to disperse the crowd. The video went viral, surpassing 14 million views on Facebook. At first, Goodman was charged with criminal trespassing, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. Last week, Goodman announced she was returning to North Dakota to fight the allegations. For her part, Goodman is celebrating her court victory.
