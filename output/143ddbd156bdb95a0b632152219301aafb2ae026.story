Although he did not mention the Dakota Access pipeline by name, the Vatican City press suggested Francis appeared to have that project in mind. This was not the first time the pope has indirectly commented on U.S. issues. To defeat evil with good, the offense with forgiveness. Building and burying an oil pipeline across four states is a question of earthly legal intricacies, not the views of the pope. Yet the tribes have appealed on religious grounds, saying the pipeline interferes with the exercise of beliefs. The Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes had asked in a filing last week that a D.C. federal judge halt construction of the Dakota Access pipeline because it would endanger what they called sacred waters of the Missouri River. The pope, who spoke in Spanish, was addressing the Indigenous Peoples Forum in Rome. The tribes on Tuesday filed a new motion asking that construction be halted, alleging that the Army Corps of Engineers had violated the Administrative Procedures Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.
