Understanding anger in the Donald Trump era We hear we need to stop being angry. Or maybe you ignored all of the advice columns and let him have it. But those columns focus on helping us navigate four difficult days. They are of virtually no use for those of us trying to figure out how to make it through four difficult years. The post-truth world takes on frightening proportions because it is wrapped in anger. Anger management in the Trump era is no longer a call to settle down and be civil. We are all pretty pissed. Reports of upsurges in anger come at us from all corners. Meanwhile there has been plenty of anger on the side of those whose candidates lost. As protests developed across the country, we heard that we needed to respect the democratic process and give Trump a chance. All that did was piss everyone off more. His point was that the post-election anger was not about policy; it was about refusing to forget that Trump has no business being president: My anger is not about any given policy of the new president. No, it is about him, about the election of a fundamentally unsound, unserious and unfit man, a misogynist who brags about sexual assault, a bigot cheered to victory by the Ku Klux Klan. It would be easy to say one type of anger is good and the other is bad. It would be super convenient if we could just say that Trump supporters need to stop being angry, so we can be. Some, but not all, of the anti-Trump anger is righteous, reasoned, valid and principled. We need to remember that Trump may have been one of the angriest candidates we have seen in recent years, but Bernie Sanders was plenty pissed too. But Sanders supporters (some of whom got behind Stein) had their own anger too. Salon's Amanda Marcotte is right that much of the white male anger that boosted Trump to victory was real but not valid. And she is right that we have absolutely no reason to offer empathy to racist, misogynist bigots. But it is a mistake to lump all of the Trump anger into a backlash on political correctness. Part of our problem has been that we have mapped the anger brewing over this election too closely to the race itself. But anger has been a constant part of our daily diet in this nation for decades. Hate crimes may have spiked since the election, but the overall hate crime rates have been fairly steady for the last decade. There is a real link between the rise in anger and the establishment of neoliberal policies that privileged profit over people. While we now know that many Trump supporters themselves had not suffered economic hardship, it would be a mistake to ignore the very real role that neoliberalism has played in creating the anger we have today. Neoliberalism does more than create an economic system of deregulation and privatization, it offers up a whole way of being. Neoliberalism has also worked to privatize anger, to turn the political into the personal. Private anger replaces political struggle. Personal anguish replaces productive political fights. Even more important, neoliberalism affects us all, regardless of whether or not we are economically suffering. The core of neoliberalism is the destruction of a common good, of shared community, and of collective values. It produces privatized resentment and tries to foreclose politically productive fury. In response to the disintegration of the social fabric caused by neoliberalism, we saw increased calls for civility. But civility is about as slippery a concept as anger. As David Palumbo Liu points out, civility is used all the time to repress dissent. Calls for civility are often a cover for censorship. It gets even messier. We also live in an era of mass-mediated manufactured anger. What used to pass for news is now just a bunch of angry vitriol that alternates between scaring viewers and getting them riled up. And that leads me to one of the best complex treatments of anger in US movie history. I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to riot. I don't want you to write to your Congressman ... All I know is that first, you've got to get mad. All Beale wants is to stay on air, so he encourages his audience to begin with anger at the system but end by doing nothing more than shout in the streets. Similarly to Trump, he offers no meaningful outlet, just an unleashed rage that he can use for personal gain. The Beale rant also reminds us that one way to disentangle productive anger from its destructive cousin is to consider where the anger comes from and what its goals are. There is a real difference between righteous anger and toxic resentment. Anger is the feeling produced when one feels offended or wronged. Righteous anger of the sort Sanders stoked is an essential feature of any real political movement. Anger is what is keeping the protesters at Standing Rock out there in the cold and under duress. Anger is what helps people stand up and fight against a president who threatens to destroy our core values. But anger can morph quickly into rage. Rage is anger with the intent to destroy or retaliate or cause harm. Rage happens when political anger has no hope. Sure, we have stories of the rabid Trump supporter who attacks someone. Those stories stoke our desire to feel justified in our anger. We can also choose to dismiss stories of Trump supporters being attacked as random acts of violence. But if we do that, we miss the larger reality. Sometimes righteous anger morphs into destructive rage. And sometimes bigoted hate is also mixed with legitimate frustration. As we gear up for a Trump administration, anger isn't going away any faster than post-truth. Our job will be to fight to maintain a distinction between justifiable anger and personal temper tantrums.
