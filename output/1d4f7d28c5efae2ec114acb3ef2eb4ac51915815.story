The vast majority of the comments, which come from as far away as Hawaii, are in favor of the petition, which arose from concerns among some lawyers there were not enough criminal defense attorneys in the state to handle the 570-plus criminal cases arising from the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. When the petition was filed in mid-December, 264 people were listed as being without attorneys, a problem they said could be partly attributed to a shortage of public defenders and private criminal defense lawyers. But many key North Dakota stakeholders, including the state bar association and the presiding district judge, expressed reservations about allowing such lawyers to practice in the state without strict supervision, a review of public comments provided to the Tribune by the court clerk's office shows. The petition, which was submitted in mid-December by 10 North Dakota and Minnesota lawyers and organizations, asks the state supreme court to relax the rules on out-of-state lawyers. One way they suggest doing this would be to allow lawyers to practice in North Dakota as long as they are licensed in the federal system. Currently, out-of-state lawyers must work very closely with a local lawyer, who must appear at all hearings. According to the petition, willing lawyers have had trouble finding local partners, because of existing workloads, conflicts and extra fees. The bar recommended that any rule changes only apply to lawyers working on protest-related cases. Also, it suggested there should be rules that lawyers must be in good standing in their respective states, pay licensure fees at least once and be subject to discipline. It also said it may not be the best organization to supervise such a program. The Indigent Defense Commission remained neutral with respect to the petition, which is purportedly written to help it handle an ever-increasing number of cases. In a letter to the court, the executive director detailed the efforts the commission has taken to appoint 81 lawyers to pipeline cases and said she was committed to continuing to provide services to all who qualify. South Central District Presiding Judge Gail Hagerty, writing on behalf of the judges in the district, including Morton County, opposed the petition and said she had not seen the issues obtaining lawyers that were pointed out in the brief. The judge, B.J. Jones, said several attorneys had asked him to be their associate counsel, but the time-commitment was too difficult, as he would need to appear with them at any proceeding. Among the supporters were civil rights and legal defense groups, including Amnesty International, the Civil Liberties Defense Center, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the National Lawyers Guild, which has helped coordinate out-of-state lawyers to assist protesters with their cases. The NLG said that, if the rules were approved, they could help provide attorneys from its network. Some tribes and native organizations, including Standing Rock, also endorsed the measure. Thousands of members of the public, many from other states and using a template response, also wrote the court to endorse a temporary change. Meanwhile, some North Dakotan members of the public rejected the idea, condemning it as special treatment or a way of pulling business from local lawyers. Comments were accepted Dec. 15-30.
