While thousands have part of the encampments since last April, about 500 water protectors still remain. It is unclear on Saturday how many of those who remain will, in fact, leave. There are several reasons why the tribal council voted to close the camps. Among the most urgent is the camps are located in a floodplain and the tribe needs time to ensure all debris leftover from the encampments will be eliminated prior to the rising water. Here is the statement released by the tribe on Saturday: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is grateful to all who have stood with us during our efforts to secure a thorough review of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Because we worked together, the Federal Government will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement. Moving forward, our ultimate objective is best served by our elected officials, navigating strategically through the administrative and legal processes. Yesterday the Tribe passed a resolution brought forward by the Cannonball District which asked that no camps remain in the Cannonball District. Councilmen from across the reservation, including Cannonball, described the hardships and strain on the citizens and resources of our Nation. The Council passed the motion unanimously. For this reason, we ask the protectors to vacate the camps and head home with our most heartfelt thanks. Much work will be required to clean up before the spring thaw, which will flood the area. It is imperative we clean the camps and restore them to their original state before this flooding occurs. Once again, thank you, and we wish you well.

Arrest tally hits 624 from continued clashes at Highway 1806 bridge blockade, Turtle Island & near DAPL drilling pad. Red Warrior camp shut down a few weeks ago. Take a look at Cannonball, ND 10 day weather forecast. Snow, snow, snow. LaDonna Allard & others might want to consider a diplomatic approach with Trump & incoming administration. Schmooze & do a business deal. Maybe invite 1st lady Melania Trump to the REZ. Volodymyr Vasyliuk (Isnala) 2 years ago May the Creator assists you in combat. I pray for you. Sandra Phillips 2 years ago I pray for all waterprotectiors an families. The people show their strength an will power. Be proud an never lower your heads again. No need to run out to Standing Rock as I never felt called. This is sending the wrong message (at this time). izopnyde 2 years ago I guess that this is what needs to happen to get the highway open. Of course the k rails are frozen to the ground and that means somtime in late March after the flooding. I would like to believe that our love and energy remains available to our brothers. This is not like shutting off a water-faucet but needs to be tempered down I hope everyone is patient. Drink no poisoned water, . . . izopnyde clyde lanthier 2 years ago Need to move to higher ground . will go on . steve shay 2 years ago Thank you President Obama for doing absolutely nothing to assist the Tribe knowing that President Trump will probably do nothing to help, either. Margaret fannen 2 years ago I tend to agree with Helen. To move the camp to higher ground yes, to shut down completely no. You have started a movement around the world probably never seen before, a domino affect, and the world salutes you for your massive effort. We all realize what Trump will likely do, but he hasnt done it yet, he might reverse the decision of the Corps of Engineers, noone knows, but it Is very likely. I feel a huge sadness and disappointment and a deep sense of betrayal, not only for myself and the millions who have supported you all, but more for the poor Souls who now have to live with the results, bad records, gaol, physical and mental injuries for life. Sadly this looks like capitulation, and i wont say the obvious. David could have explained in greater depth why he and the tribal council have made this momentous decision, why he previously said to move to higher ground, but to keep the presence there. The Police, Governor, DAPL will all be cheering that they have won, thats sadly the way it looks. You have the immensely satisfaction of knowing you have made a huge change in the world, which cant be stopped now, but this leaves a nasty taste in the Mouth. I grieve for those who have given their all. As a matter of interest, why wasnt David or any of the Elders arrested. Maybe some were, but i never read a post that mentioned it. TribalMember and Proud of it. Even in a court of law. As hurtful as this appears to be. MAY OUR CREATOR, SHOW ALL OF US THE TRUTH BEHIND THIS, IN DUE TIME. Until then, as loving and spiritual people we have to continue prayers for ALL. Help support Native News Online by clicking on our sponsors' advertisements.
