A federal judge on Monday refused to stop construction on the last stretch of the Dakota Access pipeline, which is progressing much faster than expected.

Mahmoud omitted the comment about terrorism as he read his testimony aloud to a House energy subcommittee Wednesday. The comment was included in written remarks submitted to the panel. The chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux, one of two tribes suing to stop the project, called Mahmoud's comments unfair. Law enforcement has used tactics such as rubber bullets, tear gas and water sprays against protesters during clashes in southern North Dakota near the pipeline route, Frazier said, adding that he personally has been hit by rubber bullets and tear gas. Mahmoud, the pipeline executive, also blasted the Obama administration, which twice delayed the project last year. Mahmoud also targeted the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation lies near the pipeline's route and who say the pipeline threatens their water supply and tribal artifacts. The company reached out to the tribe more than two years ago but has been continually rebuffed, Mahmoud said, adding that the project poses little threat to drinking water. The pipeline will be at least the 15th to cross the Missouri River, will employ state-of-the-art technology and will be buried more than 90 feet below the river, he said. Chad Harrison, a councilman at-large for the Standing Rock Sioux, said the pipeline company and the government ignored the tribe's concerns for almost three years before the Obama administration paused the project last September. On Dec. 4, then-assistant Army secretary for civil works, Jo-Ellen Darcy, declined to issue an easement, saying a broader environmental study was warranted. Mahmoud declined to comment after Wednesday's hearing, ignoring shouted questions as he walked away. A federal judge on Monday refused to stop construction on the last stretch of the pipeline, which could be operational as soon as next month. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled that as long as oil isn't flowing through the pipeline, there is no imminent harm to the two tribes.
