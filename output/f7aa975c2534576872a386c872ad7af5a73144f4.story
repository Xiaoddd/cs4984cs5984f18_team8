Proponents of the pipeline say that bringing Mexico natural gas will help with the air pollution in Texas as Mexico will be able to close its coal power plants. Some also hope that the natural gas pipeline will ensure that their towns will get natural gas, as they use propane for heat. Since 2015, dozens of archaeologists, landowners, ranchers, anarchists, and other concerned citizens have organized groups like the Big Bend Conservation Alliance, which is now called Big Bend Defense Coalition, to oppose the Trans-Pecos Pipeline. Issues from this pipeline have even had conservative ranchers asking the federal government to intervene to prevent construction. In direct opposition to TPPL, direct actions, prayer, and ceremonies took place in Texas in late November. Just before the new 2017 calendar year, on December 30th, Two Rivers Camp in West Texas was formed. The TPPL is a fracked gas pipeline that is being built through west Texas. It will go under The Rio Grande River into Mexico where the gas will be exported to various foreign countries. The TPPL will: 1) Go through the Chihuahuan Desert, which is one of the three most biologically diverse arid regions in the world. 2) Will destroy the delicate ecology on both sides of the border. 3) Go under the Rio Grande. In the event of a leak or an explosion, the methane from the gas could infiltrate the water aquifer that sits just 50 feet below the Rio Grande. 4) IF completed, FRACKING will begin to take place and this will bring on a whole new set of water contamination issues to a water source that is already scarce to the area. 5) The pressure testing of the pipeline ALONE is also going to use millions of gallons of water. Energy Transfer Partners (company also behind DAPL) has forcibly taken land from 34 local landowners in the name of eminent domain, a legal process that should only be used to benefit the public. Comanche Trail is a 195 mile natural gas pipeline slated for a January 2017 completion date. One person locked down to the backhoe and another locked themselves underneath it. With the newly created US-Mexico Energy Business Council (May 2016), pipeline projects such as the Trans-Pecos and the Comanche Trail will continue to grow in number, often endowed with an ability to supersede local laws and regulations. Spectra Energy, the main owner of the Sabal Trail Pipeline, has a history of pipeline accidents, with a single pipeline (the Texas Eastern Transmission pipeline) causing over twelve million dollars in property damage in the last decade. Some of those opponents, in late 2016, initiated the Springs not Pipelines action camp in an attempt to stop the Sabal Trial Pipeline. For a few examples, the project is slated to impact 4,370 acres of forests, 1,958 wetland systems and 699 water-bodies; it will emit greenhouse gas and toxic pollutants through its compressor stations, not to mention the impacts from power plants that will burn the fuel for electricity and the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals that will process and store the fuel. Resistance has continued through the winter and is growing. On January 12th, there was a die-in at the Florida State Capitol building in Tallahassee protesting the Sabal Trail Pipeline. A call-out for mass civil disobedience to stop the Suwannee River crossing construction took place on Saturday, January 14th, as hundreds of people marched and came together in a festive gathering in attempts to shut down the construction areas near Suwannee River. A press release by Illinois water protectors, states that they have observed several active DAPL construction sites across southern Illinois. Both of the two arrested water protectors have since had their charges dropped. We are telling them to stop serving the interests of filling their own campaign contribution funds. Stop forcing the police to work against the communities they are supposed to protect. Finally, show some overdue respect to the people of this land who are entitled to the freedoms of speech, religion, and assembly, as well as having clean air, water, and earth in every community, and not just some communities. We will continue to fight them. There are many ways to fight: construction is not complete, permits can still be challenged and rescinded, the divestment campaign is still mounting, and we have found that DAPL has disturbed several Indigenous burial sites along the pipeline route. We call on communities across Illinois to commit to stopping this and all other pipelines, and to upholding the sovereignty and self-determination of native peoples across Turtle Island. I have this radical idea that all this land is Native land.

Bookmark the permalink. May You be in peace and may we be in peace. Peace be upon those who returned the greeting and even upon those who did not. Peace, in the name of the lord of peace, the lord of mankind, the god of eternity. Peace in which we prospered. Peace mixed with the earth of this country. Peace in which we no longer live. Peace which no longer lives in us. Peace we keep an eye on while it packs its bags. To abandon our lands, little by little. And it is replaced by surrender and submission to an islamisation in which there is no islam. As if the islam of our grandparents no longer had anything to do with us. We are a society afraid of difference. My words will not please some of you, or most of you, or all of you - i know. But i will say them because i refuse to be one of the herd. We are a society which refuses to admit that it is a society that lives in ignorance. We are a society that shots with all audacity and pretends that it carries a different message. We are a society that loves to claim superiority without having a valid reason. And pretends that it is an educated society. Among us, the acceptance of difference is nothing but a cover. The difference in colour does us harm. The difference in shape does us harm. The difference in thinking does us harm. The difference in religion does us harm. Even the difference in gender does us harm. That is why we try to kill any difference in our midst. We have turned into a lethal poison for each other. We are a society more stupid than stupidity itself. Yes, we are a society more stupid that stupidity itself. We fight over silly things, over delusions, over superstitions While always refusing to look into the root of the problem. And none of us is innocent of that. No those who find comfort in silence. Nor those who pretend to be saints. Nor those who follow the west blindly. Nor those who pretend to go back to the glory of the caliphate and the slave markets. And to the amputation of the limbs of those who differ. Today, let us try to look inside ourselves Inside the depth of our souls. Let us try to embrace our souls. Let us try to embrace our differences with our souls. Here i am, before you, with my colour, with my hair, with my poetry, with my peculiarities, with my ideas. I am not afraid of you. Let us create art. Let us grasp the dream. So we can erect a culture without stupidity, So our sophistication becomes the best of caliphates. Let us melt away the traditions, the classes, the types, the ideas, the colours and the religions. So we see nothing except the human being. On the level of thought, the resistance is some form of judgement. On the emotional level, it is some form of negativity. The intensity of the pain depends on the degree of resistance to the present moment , and this in turn depends on how strongly you are identified with your mind. The mind always seeks to deny the Now and to escape from it. In other words, the more you are identified with your mind, the more you suffer. Or you may put it like this the more you are able to honour and accept the Now,the more you are free of pain, of suffering and free of egoic mind. Because it cannot function and remain in control without time,which is past and future,so it perceives the timeless Now as threatening. Time and mind are infact inseparable . Another feature of the homeless population in San Francisco is that many of these people are simply too ill to care for themselves. We're almost half a century into the failure of the social experiment that closed the State Hospitals and no closer to ending the experiment now than when our media first noticed the experiment had failed in the 1980's. I'm glad the people's voices were heard and the police did their jobs. Fantastic, and I hope South Korea can heal from this and get good leadership. But I am very glad truth was revealed, and we may hope for fair punishment, and perhaps rehabilitation, involving prison time. This needs to become a world-wide trend. The families still work cooperatively, like the Rothschilds, but in a smaller way. When you think of petroleum and banking in this country, think Rockefeller. Their man Nixon took us off the gold standard and prevented the silver certificate, replacing precious metals with the petrodollar. Think of global power possibilities with a monopoly of that liquid black gold, especially when accompanied with the fiction of supply limitation held for many decades. ------------------------------------- From Neben on The Taino of the Caribbean: the People Who Do Not Exist I am Taino and Caiqueto, living in Georgia. I have family members in Florida, New York, and other states. We do and have always existed. These settlers and colonists need to be told our lives matter. Even if our African brothers and sisters were brought here, or even travelled here on their own (many did), they became us. Not we became them. When you immigrate you assume the tribal identities and customs of the host nation. These are all lies. It is the beginning of the awakening of intelligence . Your intelligence sharper. The correct date to observe the crescent of Sha'aban is upon sunset of Thursday, the 27th of April 2017. ----------------------------------------- A Sacred Conversation Tasting the Sweetness of Prayer and Worship by Unraveling the Secrets Within.
