One group was held for two hours and made to unlock and hand over their mobile phones for inspection before ultimately being denied entry. Each member of the group was photographed and fingerprinted, before border agents first told two French citizens they had been denied entry to the US and would need a visa for any future visit. The group was also warned that if they tried to cross the border again this weekend, they would be arrested. Around 150,000 marched in Chicago and events were also staged in cities around the world.
