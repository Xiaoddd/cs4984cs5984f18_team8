You'll receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities. The fight for indigenous rights and to keep dirty fossil fuels in the ground is facing a new battle, and we need your help. Energy Transfer Partners, one of the companies behind the Dakota Access pipeline, is nearly finished constructing the Trans-Pecos fracked gas pipeline in West Texas. If completed, this massive pipeline will destroy historical Native sites and environmentally sensitive areas, deplete drinking water supplies and release massive quantities of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. The media has been largely silent about this potentially destructive pipeline, so we must lend our voices now to the activists who are on the ground fighting to stop this dangerous pipeline in its tracks. Tell President Obama: Stop the Trans-Pecos pipeline. President Obama must honor this commitment to protect this region from any further pipeline construction that would harm indigenous sites, destroy the environment, or cause any destruction from a potential pipeline catastrophe. Hundreds of thousands of us helped our indigenous and environmental allies on the ground to halt the dangerous Dakota Access pipeline. Now we can do it again. Tell President Obama: Stop the Trans-Pecos pipeline. Thanks for all you do. References U.S. Energy Mapping System, U.S. Energy Information Administration.
