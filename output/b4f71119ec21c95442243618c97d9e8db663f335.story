She has long been active in campaigns against fracking, documenting its pernicious health effects, particularly on her reservation. For instance, opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Keystone XL. Mossett: Well, I mean, you can kinda look at this from a historical context too and see that especially as Native American people we have been at the forefront of the conflict since the beginning of colonization. Um, being here in our home territories and then having people come in and tell us what we can or can not do, uhm, ((laughs)). So you know, this has been a struggle for over five hundred years, if you think about it in a historical context. So I think that when it comes to, uh, these fossil fuel infrastructure industries citing where they put uh, refineries or where they put extractive industry, pipelines, that a lot of times it just so happens to be in our um, communities as well. Which today, in this day and age, we have reservations that the government established, that they put us on. These industries, uh, force us into this conflict by continually putting our health at risk and the lives of our children at risk by contaminating water sources. So, I hope that that answers that. Right with Bismarck wanted though, it was moved. Um. The oil is not flowing through the pipeline; they might have put oil in there. Because they are going to have to look at a possible reroute or look at some other form of um, of infrastructure. The only thing that is helping them greatly right now is that we are in this Trump administration. ((laughs)) E: Right. I think that it had um, had it been anybody else it would have been a different circumstance already. And so there is a lot of different behind the scenes things that are happening with this company where their not being completely honest with everybody. And it was supposed to have been at least by April 1st, at least is what they told their shareholders. Gosh, it sometimes feels like it because we fought so hard to have clean drinking water. And we felt like the Obama administration was finally listening, that it was a small victory, and so something unprecedented happened when Donald Trump came in, which was to just completely forgo the environmental impact statement process in which there were already thousands and thousands, maybe even hundred of thousands of comments that were submitted. So there is a lot of unprecedented things happening. E: Yeah,everything seems upside down. But let me ask, however the Dakota Access Pipeline comes out, you definitely had a unique confluence of tribes and also some unexpected allies, like military veterans opposing the pipeline. Mossett: I feel like underneath the Trump administration we are actually building stronger alliances because people that are like minded are coming together, we might not have the exact same sturggles. And in the past we might have been a bit more segregated as a result of that, but now, because everyone is under attack we are joining forces together, um against the administration that does seem to be making everything upside down. And so, I feel like the alliance is going the be strengthened, even more, as the days go on. Um, indeed as the years go on. And the thing is is that people are finally getting it, um its not just a nimby issue, you know not in my backyard. And so even though, traditionally and historically it was low income communities, people of color communities that were the first and worst impacted, and still are, we are not the only ones anymore. And that we are not segregated we are not separate. That includes the Koch brothers, I mean that even includes all the stuff that is happening in Russia, and a lot of the conversations that have been being had or around, his influence in the fossil fuel sector, wanting to open up, um drilling in Alaska or in Anmore, or in the artic, and he may have been working with-with Russian ties, to say yeah you can drill here if you help me get elected. So we got, there is a lot of crooked corruption going on as well. But this is calling it out. And so the battleground right now is definitely Nebraska making sure that it stops again with Nebraska. And there are a lot of really strong landowners and people that came together the first time to stop it which is why we were so successful. And in fact the reason why that Dakoda access pipeline was so rushed and just ramrodded through was because of Keystone XL. The other thing is that the Trump administration said that the Dakota access pipeline the Keystone XL pipeline would have to use American still. Why are we approving it. Why are we approving the Keystone XL. The thing is is that people are pulling out of tar sands projects you know Shell. E: Right, the tar sands are probably the worst, the heaviest environmental impact of any kind of oil. And then you have really, well you could call it a unique alliance of say landowners and tribes, becoming less unique. Mossett: It is, it is, it used to be it was the cowboy and Indian alliance. When we first were fighting the Keystone XL. And so we said we still have it. And so it just is sometimes it just takes people to have to go through it to really understand. E: And of course the other key part of the alliance environmental group such as Earth justice your club or 350.org. But historically there has been some tension in the environmental groups, were seen as elite and out of touch. But seem to be working better these days So can you comment on the reasons for this alliance, the strength of the alliance. Mossett: Sure. I mean the Indigenous Environmental Network has been around since 1990 as an official organization. Prior to that you know we were a part of the American Indian Movement and we have been sort of loosely forums for so many decades. But I think that the discourse happened because we coined the term environmental justice. We talked about how we were impacted in our communities and what happened was a lot of these bigger organizations in the front end. And I think these organizations now are getting it. This is years and years and years of base building and community outreach and really understanding the struggles that people are facing in their communities and how it impacts their families. So I think that we were able to learn from each other, as organizations, so they learn from us how to build community. Which is a clean energy future for for everyone. ((laughs)) E: Getting there, not 100 percent. E: Great, since you bring up environmental justice I do want to bring up the African-American influence on environmental justice from the beginning starting in the 1980s. And of course keeping stuff like incinerator out of African-American or minority communities. Mossett: Oh yes. Yesterday April 4th which is the anniversary of when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his beyond Vietnam speech. He talked about denouncing poverty racism military-ism and then one year later he was assassinated. And so what we did was launch something called the majority and this group called the majority has indigenous groups, Black Lives Matter groups urban and rural groups, climate justice alliances. Were all coming together because we understand the necessity to build each other up. And that is because historically there was a fight for an eight-hour work day that goes all the way back to 1886 in Chicago where were striking workers had a had a run in with the police. And there were several deaths. And so this whole this group of ours the majority is calling to light the historical context and to the light the fact that these things were never remediated fully you know and that we still have a way to go in the struggle and to not forget our history. E: And the definition of sustainability is often not just environmental, it also includes social justice and uh, economic equity. Mossett: Right. But, um, this seems all part of the same movement. We were the first ones here. We were heavily impacted. And it just has continued since then. It goes back to that historical context. E: Right. But climate change is global. We tell our traditions stories, or oral stories based upon where we live. You know how can you how can you live on the land that belongs to all of us. Yet we remain we still have our stories we still have our culture we still have our language. And we have people saying and this is what we know from our own communities. How can we join together in the struggle to make it stronger. Probably a lot of that has to do with technology. So I think that our alliance is heading in the right direction when it comes to the power of visiting and the power of connecting. We just have to be really careful and really mindful of how we move and where we move. And what that looks like is getting back to the small scale thinking and doing of of our everyday lifestyle. Small scale distributed wind and solar on each home, you know instead of a huge solar plant or huge wind farm because when you start getting corporate It inevitably becomes negative. We need to get back to small scale community style living which can happen even in urban settings that simply can happen by community gardens. In each block. So the block can come together as a community with their garden and talk to each other and learn about where their food sources are coming from. You know the earth is 4.6 billion years old. Our lifespan is the blink of an eye. And now we have the scientific facts behind us. You know that love of the land that everybody has and just how people to remember basically where they come from.
