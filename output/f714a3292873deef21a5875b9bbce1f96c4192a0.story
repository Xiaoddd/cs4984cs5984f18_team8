As such, it bludgeons the truth when it does not serve its interests or program. The Christian fascist cohort led by Pence is readying its assault on the science of evolution and in other areas. Only science and engineering serving corporate and military interests are to be encouraged and funded. Such a regime must not only be resisted, it must be driven out. Imperialist wars; the oppression of Black people and other oppressed nationalities, of women and immigrants; and the destruction of the environment are a matter of course and a result of the workings of this system. And capitalism-imperialism is a real and substantive fetter on the pursuit of science. Just some of the ways include: Large sections of humanity are locked out of training and working in the realm of ideas. Billions of children around the world are denied the basics of science and the scientific method, of truths that we have come to know, about how the universe and life came to be. The systematic reinforcement of religion by the ruling classes plays no small role in this. All this then creates fertile ground for fascism to whip up its social base for anti-scientific attacks, along with a general know-nothing-ism. These do not correspond to the interests of humanity. Research grants skewed to conform to aims of the defense and energy departments, or corporate entities, are but a symptom of that. These funding levers are now in the grip of the fascists. Scientific findings, instead of being shared with the world and humanity for the common good, are treated as intellectual property, to be monetized and used against competitors, national or corporate. In imperialist countries like the U.S., basic scientific research and areas like public health and the environment are afforded. This is not the case in what is commonly known as the Third World. One that aims to get beyond oppression, exploitation, and antagonistic social divides as part of a worldwide process. It is an economic system not based on exploitation of people or the environment, a political system that aims to eliminate antagonistic social divides, and the radical transformation of social relations and ideas. A concrete and viable vision of this society is captured in the Constitution for the New Socialist Republic in North America, authored by Bob Avakian (BA). In the overall context and blueprint for the new society, there are detailed sections on the Environment, Education, and Science and Scientific Endeavor that will be of specific interest to those marching in defense of science and the environment. For more, we encourage you to read the interview of the award-winning scientist and author Ardea Skybreak: Science and Revolution, On the Importance of Science and the Application of Science to Society, the New Synthesis of Communism and the Leadership of Bob Avakian. Past communist theory was marked by shortcomings that ran counter to its principally scientific character. and Revolution Send us your comments.
