However, construction could still be delayed because the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which has led opposition to the pipeline, said it would fight the latest development. The Army intends to allow the Lake Oahe crossing as early as Wednesday, according to court documents the Justice Department filed that include letters to members of Congress from Deputy Assistant Army Secretary Paul Cramer. The stretch under Lake Oahe is the final big chunk of work on the 1,900-kilometre pipeline that would carry North Dakota oil through the Dakotas and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. Developer Energy Transfer Partners had hoped to have oil flowing through the pipeline by the end of 2016, but construction has been stalled while the Army Corps of Engineers and the Dallas-based company battled in court over the crossing. ETP says the pipeline is safe. An assessment conducted last year determined the crossing would not have a significant impact on the environment. The Corps launched a study of the crossing on Jan. 18, two days before Obama left office, that could have taken up to two years to complete. The court documents filed Tuesday include a proposed Federal Register notice terminating the study. ETP has been poised to begin drilling under Lake Oahe as soon as it has approval. Workers have drilled entry and exit holes for the crossing, and oil has been put in the pipeline leading up to the lake in anticipation of finishing the project. Those protesting the pipeline at an encampment the tribe set up on federal land have at times clashed with police, leading to nearly 700 arrests. Bookmark the permalink. Leave a comment. account.
