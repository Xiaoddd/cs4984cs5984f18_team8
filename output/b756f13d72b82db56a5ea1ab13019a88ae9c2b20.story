Follow us openDemocracyUK presents a debate about how to build a just, sustainable, and resilient economy. Find out more about the project & submit your ideas. Murphy has a well-deserved reputation as a leading figure in the tax justice movement who, as a trained accountant, has expertly dissected the tax avoidance practices of multinational companies and the failures of successive British governments to crack down on them. The rule commits Labour to balancing the budget for current (day-to-day) spending over the first five years and borrowing only to invest in reconstructing the economy. Borrowing to invest is very different in its consequences than borrowing to finance tax cuts for the rich and corporations, which is what the Conservatives have been doing since 2010. Murphy believes that governments do not need to borrow on the money markets at all because the Bank of England can simply create as much money as needed with a few keystrokes on a computer. MMT argues that this is what normally happens when Governments spend. Central banks can create as much of it as they want with a few strokes on a keyboard. Indeed, the so-called quantitative easing (QE) programmes pursued by all the major central banks since the financial crash of 2008 has provided the most spectacular possible confirmation of that. Back in 2013, the fifth anniversary report of the Green New Deal Group, to which Murphy contributed, called for Green QE. Creation of a Green (or National) Development Bank would bypass the private banking system by issuing bonds which the Bank of England could purchase along with all the other bonds it has been purchasing under its QE measures. The advocates of this plan argued persuasively that this would be a far better use of the additional QE money than feeding into property prices in cities such as London. I am not concerned here with that rather technical debate. The MMT school originated in the USA amidst a current of heterodox Keynesians who are understandably insouciant with respect to the strength of the dollar. They stress the willingness of foreigners who want to sell to the US to not only accept dollars in payment, but to hold onto those dollars for extended periods of time. Indeed, any attempt to swap sizeable quantities of those reserves into another currency or gold would lead to a sharp fall in the dollar and reduce the value of their remaining assets. This of course is not true of the pound. But when the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan were all engaged in pressing those keyboards and generating extra liquidity to compensate for the implosion of the global banking system, the Bank of England could join in without worrying about the exchange-rate. A future Labour Government cannot assume it will be in the same situation. And so bankers. A Corbyn-led government, with its commitments to all the other radical measures Murphy ignores, may well have to ride out a period of capital flight and a sharp fall in the pound. Some might respond that a fall in the pound will make exports cheaper abroad and contribute to reducing the current account deficit and rebalancing the economy. In an extreme case this process can, as in Venezuela in recent months, make the currency worthless. Of course, the British state remains in a far stronger financial position than Venezuela or Turkey, but regardless of Brexit we do not and will not inhabit an autonomous national economy. Today, we have a national economy inextricably enmeshed in both the European and the world market. Most of the major banks and corporations operating in Britain are multinationals capable of transferring funds from one currency to another with the stroke of a keyboard. Imposing effective controls over speculators and tax dodgers will require at a minimum cooperation with the European Union. The best thinkers in the Marxist tradition always understood that socialism in one country was not a sustainable option. One could say the same today for the unfettered demand-side Keynesianism advocated by Richard Murphy and the MMT school. Certainly not. A radical break with neoliberal policies of spending cuts, deregulation, privatisation, outsourcing, and anti-union legislation remains on the agenda. There is much that still needs to be thought through about how to manage the threat posed by the money markets which Murphy blithely wants to ignore. There are policy proposals which I disagree with, such as retaining Trident nuclear submarines and wasting more money on HS2, and I am skeptical about recent proposals for a universal basic income. However, I also attended the daylong New Economics conference in London in May which was open to all Labour Party members. What most impressed me was not the lineup of headline speakers, but the diversity of contributions in workshops I attended on finance and housing, and the openness to debate on questions such as alternative forms of public ownership and the urgent challenge of climate change. If Richard Murphy wants to contribute to those discussions, I hope and suspect he would still be very welcome to join. IE not the currency their Govs issue. Bonds will suddenly decide en masse to trash the value of their own holdings. All of them, all together, in micro second synchronicity. You are a disgrace. Let me point out some of the (various) problems with MMT. This is not a new observation. In real terms, if you knew the government was printing money many people will do something with that money before it devalues. Either convert it into another currency or buy something with it, driving inflation even higher. MMT then decides to assume away any risk of inflation by saying inflation will ONLY ever occur at full employment. This leads to two observations. The first is that it is obvious that inflation can and does occur without full employment. The second being that MMT does not have a serious model for inflation (it assumes an L-shaped Philips curve). Despite unemployment being at 40 year lows and sitting at the NAIRU level, Murphy still claims unemployment is a huge problem and we are nowhere near full emplyoment. Despite not being willing to give his definition of what full employment actually is. yet again we can make a few observations. But taxes would have to rise significantly if you are talking about the 50bn or so extra spending Murphy suggests, unless you are willing to accept significantly higher inflation, and that interest rates will be set to an effective zero. Of coure if you raise taxes to that extent, you choke off growth at the same time, so any extra investment is likely to be choked off regardless. There simply is no free lunch. QE is in real terms an asset swap and does not increase the base money supply, or reduce the amount of government debt held (again something which Murphy quite incorrectly claims). QE works by increasing liquidity and lowering long term interest rates. MMters are very keen to ignore any potential drawbacks of this tried and tested road to economic ruin. As a (real) economist and a pension fund manager, we wargamed our response to Corbynomics before the last election. Our initial reaction would be to reduce our holding of Gilts to the legal minimum and then hedge the rest with interest rate swaps. To control the extra spending, we estimated the basic rate of income tax would have to rise to close to 40p in the pound. The higher rate close to 75p. Inward investment would dry up inflation would likely be a problem and higher taxes would kill the economy, all due to the irresponsible policies of the government, which would pose a huge risk. Simply put, there is no free lunch. If you want the government to spend more, you could simply argue for higher deficit spending or increased taxes. And be honest about it. MMT simply will not provide a land of milk and honey with no negative consequences. Murphy and the other MMTers are either in denial, delusional or more worryingly, actively misleading people if this is the claim they are making. Why not try Murphy, and ask him if he can give you: 1. A detailed, numeric definition of full employment 2. A detailed inflation model for MMT 3. How much taxes would have to rise for each X amount of increased MMT spending. My guess is he will be unable and very unwilling to provide you with such answers, bar in some form of rhetoric. He likes it because it fits his worldview, however disjointed and fantasy filled that may be. But with respect to your specific point about Turkey and Venezuela I agree of course that having a considerable debt denominated in foreign currency is a serious problem which makes a falling exchange-rate far more devastating in its consequences (as evident in the East Asian crises of 1997-8 or repeatedly in Latin America). One could also refer to Greece with debts denominated in euros which only the ECB could produce, giving the ECB in particular a chokehold over the Greek state evident within days of the election of the Syriza government in 2015. But the absence of foreign denominated debt does not mean a currency such as the pound cannot be subject to sustained speculative attack. If there coiuld be a run for the exits which would devalue their assets the issue for them is who gets through the door first. My point was about the impact of a falling exchange-rate on inflation via import prices. That I would argue is where the fault-line becomes a gaping crack. Yes, they can have full employment at home. Yes, that could lead to trade deficits. Yes that could (possibly) lead to currency depreciation. Yes that could lead to inflation pass-through. But they have lots of policy options available if they do not like those results. Import controls and capital controls are examples of policy options. It is just mainly wrong. As usual things are not given proper weight and credence is put in some common but baseless fabrications. But the absence of foreign denominated debt does not mean a currency such as the pound cannot be subject to sustained speculative attack. As does the dollar, the renminbi, the yen and the chocolate-backed Swiss Franc. Just a price bump, at worst. Depreciation boosts exports and shrinks imports and so is self-limiting. So the pound goes down a little. It did after the Brexit vote. This is based on a fabricated, but common history. The reality was that these were choices, very bad ones. For instance, France commissioned a report from US economist Robert Eisner on its expansionary policies. His recommendation was to continue them as they were succeeding well and to ignore the not very meaningful currency depreciation. Or from an irrational obsession with fx currency values, grossly disproportionately to its economic importance. As Lerner comments, the basic possible negative systematic effect of expansion on exchange rates is depreciation due to rising imports, due to prosperity. But he notes how absurd this argument is, as it is an argument against prosperity from any cause whatsoever. (And is therefore only made against government led expansion in favor of the general populace, never against the usual crony capitalism for the rich). For a rich developed country, the benefits of functional finance expansion dwarf the self-limiting and only speculative effect of depreciation. In general, countries like the UK are obsessed far, far beyond reason with matters of foreign exchange. It just is not that important, compared to the domestic economy that austerity blithely wrecks with wild abandon. The best thinkers in the Marxist tradition always understood that socialism in one country was not a sustainable option. All he had was rhetoric, backed by no rational arguments. Socialism in one country most certainly is not only economically sustainable, but economically superior to, outcompetes non-socialism. By the way Abba Lerner, (MMT grandfather) first met Hyman Minsky, (MMT father) after he returned from visiting Trotsky to unsuccessfully convince him that his one country stuff was wrong. andycfc There is no issue about investment in this argument. The argument is about Labous fiscal rule. What SWL, JP and James Meadway seem to miss is that both training and depreciation are current spending items (where they are placed is via international accounting standards so not open to debate). So with training it is going to mean you can build hospitals but not staff them under this rule. Secondly with depreciation being a current spending item means just to keep up will need more and more investment, this is a bridges to nowhere policy. This rule comes from a time before the welfare state, it appears the above 3 mentioned do not realise that. The latter are not living in the world as it is, but in the world as they hope and believe it could be. But, politics. You did this, disingenuously, to other Labour economists. So therefore you also own the disappointed anti-neoliberals. Jeremy Fox Reading this piece felt like peering over a hedge into a landscape enshrouded in mist. Before Labour can get anywhere near the levers of economic policy, the whole country has to clear Brexit. Rees-Mogg et al. are already decamping into the Euro, the Bank of England is also buying Euros, and many members of the financial elite are reportedly shorting the pound. They predict it. A contributor below writes that real physical capital cannot flee. Rather the US government, like the UK under Thatcher, worked hard to de-industrialize and wreck productive regions. Martin Freedman Peter, you have responded to the 3 blog posts by Richard Murphy, who is sympathetic to MMT, but not one of the core economists who have developed this (and I have not read his posts so cannot comment on your response to his arguments). How about you respond to Bill Mitchell, who is one of the founders and leading practitioners of MMT, whose posts I have read and does deal with this. He has also written a 3 post series on exactly this topic. Find out more about the project & submit your ideas.
