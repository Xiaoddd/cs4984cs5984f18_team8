Making this worse still is the central role the U.S. government played in the horrors from which many of these now-banned people are fleeing. The suggestion that Trump protected the countries with which he does business is preposterous. That's a horror movie, not a foreign policy. And the reason Trump is able so easily to tap into a groundswell of anti-Muslim fears and bigotry is because they have been cultivated for 16 years as the central fuel driving the war on terror. There are factions on both the center-left and right that are primarily devoted to demonizing Muslims and Islam. A government can get away with bombing, invading, and droning the same group of people for more than 15 years only by constantly demonizing and dehumanizing that group and maintaining high fear levels, which is exactly what the U.S. has done under two successive administrations. Both the Bush and Obama administrations ushered in all-new and quite extreme civil liberties erosions aimed primarily if not exclusively at Muslims. Trump did not appear out of nowhere. The parallels with how Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution were treated in the 1930s and 1940s are obvious. As my colleague Lee Fang documented in 2015, the prevailing rhetoric about Muslim refugees is identical to that used to demonize Jews during the World War II era. Das Kleine Blatt, 1939. Even more significant, albeit harder to quantify, is the extreme fear that Muslim Americans and immigrants quite rationally harbor about what this will all spawn, both in terms of cultural norms and additional policies. The largest such group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), has long been the target of the U.S. government. CAIR now plays a critical role in defending American Muslims and immigrants from these civil liberties assaults. Muslims who have nowhere else to turn are often defended by CAIR as their basic rights are assaulted, and that will be even truer now. That is precisely what we are now witnessing as anti-Muslim crusaders in the U.S. adopt the same premises as ISIS and its allies: that the West and Muslims are inherently and irreconcilably adverse. The danger now is that this immigration ban is merely the first step on this heinous path, not the last.
