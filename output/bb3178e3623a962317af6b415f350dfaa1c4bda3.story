The building of the DAPL and the protests that have consequentially followed are only heating up as the Army Corps of Engineers is refusing to back down. Digging their heels in, we have seen K9s illegally unleashed on protestors; protestors arrested and caged like animals, with numbers written on their arms, reminiscent of Nazi Germany; and last week, in the cold temperatures, protestors suffered an unleashing of water against them, as they were hosed down in sub-freezing conditions. The fear is that they are being doused with chemicals from crop dusters flying late at night with the lights off. After all, this is perhaps as dirty as it gets when you protest on American soil. .

The footage is poor when he tries to zoom in, but the part that I want you to notice is the Airplanes flying overhead without any running lights.
