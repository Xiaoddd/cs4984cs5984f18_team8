That includes 27.6 percent to Enbridge and 9.2 percent to Marathon. The deal reduces Energy Transfer ownership to a controlling 38.25 percent, while Houston-based Phillips 66 maintains its 25 percent stake. Energy Transfer said it will use the proceeds for debt reduction. The partial sale was delayed for months after the nearly completed oil pipeline project encountered regulatory holdups under the Obama administration. President Donald Trump put a quick end to that. The pipeline project was nearing completion last summer when the Standing Rock Sioux tribe launched protests to block the project, drawing international attention and environmental activists from around the country. Hundreds were arrested and injured during recent protests and skirmishes. Protests remain ongoing, but construction has resumed.
