In an apparent attempt to make the public comment process less transparent and to isolate public commenters, instead of holding an open public hearing, FERC required members of the public to deliver their oral comments privately to a court reporter and a FERC representative. Representatives from the Department of Homeland Security were also present in the waiting room while commenters waited to speak to FERC. By the time I was finished giving my comments, there were almost 40 people present, and more arriving as people got off work. In order to move forward in New York and New Jersey, the pipeline must first obtain a Clean Water Act certification from each state. These bays support species of ecological, commercial, and recreational importance. The Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays are especially important areas for wildlife. Officially designated as a significant habitat complex by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the area includes Essential Fish Habitat for 33 species. It also includes 23 species of birds and marine life that are federally listed endangered or threatened, and 18 that are state-listed endangered or threatened. Because of its unique location, Raritan Bay and Sandy Hook are especially significant as a migratory path for shorebirds, raptors, waterfowl, and landbirds. The Fish and Wildlife Service counts an average of over 60,000 birds every year. FERC neither includes a measurement of the potential greenhouse gas emissions in this DEIS, nor does it explain specifically why a reasonable estimate could not be made. The mere absence of one single accepted standard to measure downstream greenhouse gases is not sufficient to excuse this omission. As proposed, this pipeline would cross 6 aquifers, one of which provides drinking water for approximately 3 million residents in New Jersey. We're hiring.
