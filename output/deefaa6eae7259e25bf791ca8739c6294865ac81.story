The PUC staff comments are a recommendation for a new Line 3, but they are not the final decision in regard to the project. They often include PUC staff analysis and recommendations. The 1960s-vintage Line 3, one of six Enbridge pipelines that ferry Canadian oil across Minnesota, runs at only 51 percent capacity due to safety concerns. Enbridge said a new pipeline would be safer and would restore the full flow of oil. As proposed, a new Line 3 would divert from Enbridge's existing pipeline corridor at Clearbrook, Minn., jutting south to Park Rapids before heading east to Superior, Wis. Enbridge maintains it doesn't have enough pipeline capacity to meet oil shippers' needs. While administrative law judge decisions carry significant weight, like recommendations from the PUC staff they are not binding. The PUC staff took issue with O'Reilly's recommendation to tie the certificate of need to the proposed pipeline's route. Instead, she recommended that Enbridge dig up old Line 3 and drop a new pipeline in its place. welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.
