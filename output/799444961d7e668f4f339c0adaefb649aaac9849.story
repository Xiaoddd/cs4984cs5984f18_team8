Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated. Police and about 400 people who were protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline clashed Sunday evening as demonstrators lit cars on fire and police launched tear gas and water at the crowds. A live stream from the North Dakota location showed a chaotic, loud scene full of screaming and honking cars. Protesters set fire to two trucks and several parts of the bridge, police said. Officers tried to disperse the crowds. Some decried the use of water on the crowd on a cold night when temperatures fell to 28 degrees Fahrenheit. But police say the protesters are not peaceful and that water was used to put out fires as well as to control the crowds. One person has been arrested, police said. Protests have simmered for months, spawning bitter clashes over the 1,172-mile oil pipeline that would span from North Dakota to Illinois. Why protests are happening Protesters say the Dakota Access Pipeline will threaten the environment and destroy Native American burial sites, prayer sites and culturally significant artifacts. Multiple groups have joined the protests over the months. Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners took legal action, asking a federal court to allow them to complete the pipeline.
