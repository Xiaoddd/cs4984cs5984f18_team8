It was a huge victory for protesters there, who had maintained a camp for months as temperatures dropped and heavy snow arrived. The decision not to grant the easement means that one of the last sections of the (mostly-complete) pipeline cannot be built under Lake Oahe, a dammed stretch of the Missouri river that falls under the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers. Lake Oahe is the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Souix Reservation, who sued the Army Corps of Engineers in July to halt the pipeline. While the decision not to grant an easement addresses some of the issues raised in that case, the legal group Earthjustice, which filed the lawsuit, has said that it will wait to see how future events play out before they decide how to proceed with the case. Some changes are already being made. In September, the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Army issued a joint statement prompted by the lawsuit and protests saying that they would focus on improving communications between tribal and federal governments on public infrastructure issues like the pipeline. The current plan for this particular project is for an Environmental Impact Statement to be developed exploring alternative routes for the pipeline, including a route that passes 10 miles north of North Dakota's capitol of Bismarck. That route was rejected from earlier considerations due to concerns that a leak of the pipeline there might impact the city's drinking water. For now, the pipeline will sit unfinished. The sections of pipe to the north and south of Lake Oahe are almost complete, so options for re-routing the pipeline are more limited now than they were before construction began. Other Environmental Impact Statements prepared for the US Army Corps of Engineers took anywhere from several months to several years to be completed. There is a large concern among protesters and advocates that the incoming administration will take a different view of the situation, and may try to find a way to push construction forward again. Protesters are still deciding on how to proceed. Standing Rock leaders are telling people to head home, but some protesters vow to stay through the bitter winter as distrust lingers and unproven rumors swirl that the construction is continuing despite the denial of the easement. President-elect Donald Trump has publicly supported the pipeline and at one time owned stock in the company building it.. His team has said that he will review the decision after he takes office. The company itself has no plans of backing down. In a blistering statement released by Energy Transfer Partners, the company argued that the recent Army decision was politically motivated, and maintained that they would continue to push for the completion of construction. The protests that brought about the current decision were led by the Standing Rock Souix and other indigenous peoples, but were eventually joined by environmentalists, celebrities, and veterans. Depending on the circumstances, if Trump reversed the Army Corps decision, these groups would likely come back in full force.
