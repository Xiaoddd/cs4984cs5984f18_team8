The surge in donations has coincided with a wave of media attention the group has received over the past two days. In a short period of two days, the picture changed dramatically. But with the increased funds, Wood Jr. says, the group will be able to afford more equipment and supplies to aid them in their three-day mission, which will culminate in an attempt to break through the line of guards protecting the Dakota Access construction site. The Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which spans the border of North and South Dakota and is home to members of the Lakota and Dakota nations (known collectively as Sioux), has been the site of an increasingly tense standoff between law enforcement-backed security contractors and activists since July, when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approved a plan to build one of the final segments of the 1,170-mile Dakota Access Pipeline on land adjacent to the reservation, sparking a massive protest that has drawn activists from as far as Israel, Russia, and Japan. According to the Standing Rock Sioux, the planned route, which will cross beneath the Missouri River, will threaten their drinking water supply and destroy sacred sites and burial grounds located on land that the government stripped from the Sioux in the past. Veterans For Standing Rock is headed to the area at a time when the situation on the ground appears to be growing increasingly chaotic. On Nov. 20, a 10-hour standoff between demonstrators and the police resulted in 300 people injured, according to the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council. Previous claims of excessive police force recently prompted the United Nations to launch an investigation of potential human rights abuses. In addition to concussion grenades, security contractors and law enforcement have repelled activists, often numbering in the hundreds, with pepper-spray, fire hoses, batons, dogs, and rubber bullets. I am extremely happy to be stressed out right now, trying to make this as soon as possible. Of course, more boots on the ground means more opportunities for people to get hurt. So far, it appears that the most violent episodes of the standoff have occurred when the demonstrators confronted the guards in overwhelming numbers. Wood Jr. points out that the violent efforts by law enforcement to dislodge the protesters merely prove his point that they have abrogated their responsibility to protect and serve the public, acting instead on behalf of private corporate interests.
