The Federal Court of Appeal ruled the federal government failed to adequately consult with Indigenous groups affected by the project, and did not include a proper environmental assessment. Most notably, the court ruled the National Energy Board failed to assess the potential impact of increased tanker traffic on marine life. However, this court ruling essentially voids federal approval for the pipeline, which would have tripled the capacity of the Trans Mountain pipeline, which runs from Edmonton to Burnaby, B.C. The move forces the National Energy Board to restart its review process if the government still wishes to move forward with the project. Some Canadians were quick to respond to the news on social media. Meanwhile, others expressed shock in response to the decision, which effectively places the major infrastructure project on hold indefinitely. B.C. native Wally Debling wondered if taxpayers could ask for a refund on the Trans Mountain pipeline purchase.
