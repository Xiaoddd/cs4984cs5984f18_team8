By Daniel J. Graeber (0) A new report suggests the Dakota Access pipeline is exposed to the financial risks in a volatile energy market. With nationwide protests against the project mounting, the company said more delays that followed a lengthy review process were contrary to the rule of law. RELATED Dakota Access pipeline delayed The last few hundred feet of construction requires drilling under the Missouri River. Outside of the environmental and tribal concerns, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said there were concerns about the economic risks for the project. According to the IEEFA, if the pipeline isn't completed by Jan. 1, the project consortium may have to revisit some of the contracts for shipping oil through the 1,110-mile pipeline. The institute said further that crude oil prices being about 50 percent lower than they were at the height of the U.S. shale era means the regional economic prospects are far from certain. RELATED Obama called to stop Dakota Access pipeline construction Enbridge Energy, which is party to North Dakota pipeline infrastructure, in September said regional crude oil production was too low to support the development of the planned east-bound Sandpiper pipeline. The company in its latest quarterly results said most of its existing pipeline networks were oversubscribed. The Dakota Access pipeline could carry as much as half of what North Dakota produces and the pipeline consortium said that would reduce shipment by rail, which carries its own risks. At least 40 people were killed in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, in the 2013 derailment of a train carrying tankers of crude oil from North Dakota to Canadian refineries. The IEEFA in the past received grant money from the Rockefeller Family Foundation, which since 2006 has focused almost exclusively on climate change.
