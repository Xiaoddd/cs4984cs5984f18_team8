Dakota Access on the Move The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced Tuesday that it will grant the easement required to finish construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a project the threatens the drinking water and sacred lands of the Standing Rock Sioux. The news came after President Trump ordered the Army Corps to move forward on the project. When the Corps did, it shut down a mandatory environmental review process. The tribe filed a legal challenge against the easement on Thursday. Selective Science A disagreement broke out last weekend between climate scientists. In fact, this is a story about an abuse of political power to bring scientists to heel. Climate-denying politicians have twisted the dispute into an argument about whether climate change is real. The president and Congress have moved with amazing efficiency to fulfill the desires of the oil and gas industry. Clean Up Your Mess In 2010, Donald Trump, Jr. helped start Titan Atlas Manufacturing in South Carolina. When the company failed two years later, Donald Trump, Sr. bailed his son out. What a swell dad. Titan contaminated the groundwater on its property in North Charleston. Rather than simply paying to remedy the site, the Trump-affiliated business entity that took over applied to limit its liability, arguing that it had nothing to do with the previous managers (some of whom were also named Trump). South Carolina regulators saw through the Trump shell game. On Tuesday, after the Trumps refused to disclose information about the relationships between Titan and the subsequent owner, the state rejected the liability limitation application. Maybe Trump should have told South Carolina about all his environmental stewardship awards. You'll receive your first NRDC action alert and update email soon.
