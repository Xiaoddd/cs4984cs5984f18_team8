They break the rules in order to convince the rule-makers that they need to change the rules, which is itself a kind of state-approved process. However, at Standing Rock in North Dakota, Indians from all over North America have been protesting for seven months in some ways never before seen. Protest in this case is related to process. Part of the process was for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the agency that approved the pipeline, to consult with tribes about how the pipeline would affect their reservations and treaty lands, sacred sites and cultural areas. According to documents filed in federal court, the Corps did just that numerous times. In response, officials adjusted the pipeline route. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe chose not to fully engage with pipeline officials until late in the process. The legal and ethical argument is about tribal sovereignty and the protection of natural resources. There is nothing new about such issues. However, what is novel is that the tribe and the outside protesters are working together. The Standing Rock reservation set up a protest camp and made a stand with the protesters. What also makes this Indian protest different from others is its manner and its reach. Theirs is a nonviolent protest that is speaking broadly, in such a way that non-Indians can see that these environmental and policy concerns affect them, too. An overwhelming number of them are women. This all stands in contrast to the American Indian Movement, which flourished in the early 1970s, culminating in the takeover of the Wounded Knee trading post on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and the shootout with federal agents nearby. That movement had few specific aims, a violent tendency and little non-Indian support. The Standing Rock protesters are making the argument that the pipeline threatens not just tribal land and resources but American land and resources. The protesters are making a stand on behalf of all Americans for better decisions for our energy future. This is their sacrifice and this is their new Thanksgiving gift. A non-Indian friend asked me recently, in response to protests about Indian mascots for sports teams, where is our Rev. We Indians are a plurality. There are more than 500 tribes in the United States and we all have different cultures, histories, landscapes and ways of organizing politically. We are united by the legacy, and current practices, of colonialism. Like African-Americans, we have fought for and won some of our civil rights. But we have always fought for something quite different from that, too. We have fought for the recognition that we are American and Indian, and that as Indians we belong to sovereign nations and have treaty rights that have always been our rights. We do not have, like the African-American civil rights movement, a single institution like slavery to define our struggle, and a hard date when that was to have ended. But the protest at Standing Rock does have something Dr. King possessed, and that is dignity in the face of dire opposition. We also have the same kind of ecclesiastical calling, a call from God or the spirits, to not only ennoble ourselves through protest but to ennoble the democratic republic that seeks to diminish us. There is something inside the protest to ponder. And it is grave. We have seen water protectors maced, arrested and fired upon with rubber bullets. David Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, wrote in The New York Times that this is proof that government, once again, is against us. That it is once again cowboys versus Indians. There is, of course, a history of conflict. This is ever more clear in the violent backlash against protesters in recent days. But to say that the story of the Dakota Access Pipeline is another iteration of that old western story is to repeat the mistakes of past protests and movements. We situate ourselves in a position of powerlessness. It absolves us of our own complicity in how the world of power around us has been shaped. It absolves our tribal leaders of their reluctance to show up for meetings and to fight diligently and thanklessly in the trenches of numb process. We have to show up to get up. Neither is irony. The civil rights movement got results not just because activists marched in the street but also because activists marched into classrooms, county board meetings, law schools and the voting booth. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page SR 5 of the New York edition with the headline: An Indian Protest for Everyone . Fight. Fight.
