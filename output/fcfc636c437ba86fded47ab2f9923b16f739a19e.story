It is no longer accepting RSVPs. When water is calm it is tranquil and beautiful. Water is both fluid and powerful. Water can erode foundations and put out fire, it is truly the most powerful element. One drop of water evaporates but a whole ocean can cause tsunamis. Each and every one of us matters to this cause. To do nothing and stand by. Please be a part of the resistance, it will be noticed, it does matter. The people, the citizens of united states are getting noticed. It matters to me. The Earth might be 7,500,000,000 billion strong but we are all ONE people. United in solidarity we will peacefully withdraw from the US economy for 24 hours. We encourage all those at home and around the world to do the same. We encourage responsible activism, and do not support using the platform to take unlawful or other improper action.
