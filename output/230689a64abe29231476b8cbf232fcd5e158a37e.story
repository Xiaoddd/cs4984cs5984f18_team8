Fallin joins twelve other transition vice-chairs, a list that looks like Trump's unofficial cabinet, although it does include members like Sen. Jeff Sessions, Dr. Ben Carson and Fmr. Gen. Mike Flynn whom Mr. Trump has tapped as his Attorney General, Secretary of Housing and Urban development and National Security Advisor, respectively. Fallin says she has no new plans to visit New York and the work won't take away from her job of running the state. She recently met with the President-Elect at his offices in Trump Tower. Fallin is rumored to be a top pick for secretary of the interior, which handles the national parks, Indian affairs and environmental quality. According to NASA, 97 percent of climate scientists agree climate change is real and is being caused by human activity. Last month, the World Meteorological Organization predicted 2016 would be the hottest year on record, topping the record set in 2015. So far, Fallin said there had been no other movement on when Mr. Trump would be announcing his pick for Secretary of the Interior, only that she would continue to work to help fill more than 4,000 open positions before the inauguration in January.
