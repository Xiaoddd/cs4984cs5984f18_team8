Donald Trump's selection of climate change denier Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency is the tip of the spear of an all-out war on our climate. Thankfully, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has broad authority to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including creating a plan to transition New York to 100 percent renewable energy and rejecting the swarm of fracking infrastructure projects proposed across the state, such as the CPV power plant, the Pilgrim and Dominion New Market pipelines, and the fracked gas storage facility at Seneca Lake. But Cuomo's leadership at the state level must be matched by U.S. Sen Charles Schumer's commitment to leading the resistance in Congress. As minority leader, Schumer must do everything in his power to stop Pruitt from becoming head of the EPA and to ensure that Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson doesn't run the State Department. The question is whether Cuomo and Schumer are up for the fight.
