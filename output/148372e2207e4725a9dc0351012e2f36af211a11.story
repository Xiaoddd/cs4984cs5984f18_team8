Dakota Access pipeline activists have said they will not leave a protest camp after officials ordered them to leave. The standoff threatens to further escalate. Activists and tribes protesting plans to run the Dakota Access oil pipeline under a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota said Saturday they would not leave the main protest camp after the government issued a directive for them to vacate the site. Those who remain at the camp could face prosecution. Protest organizers said Saturday at a press conference that they plan to stand their ground. Archambault said the tribe is also working to find a location on reservation land in case protesters decide to move there. Protesters needed to move: state government North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple said in a statement on Saturday that it was the federal government's responsibility to close the camp because the government had allowed it to grow. Republican Senator John Hoeven and Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp also said the protesters needed to move for public safety. The main camp has turned into a sprawling village with semi-permanent structures, motor homes and trailers, as preparations are made to hold out over the freezing winter. Since the protests began in August, more than 400 people have been arrested as tensions rise between protestors and police. The Dakota Access pipeline would carry Bakken shale oil from North Dakota to Illinois, where it can be moved to US Gulf Coast oil refineries. Most of the 1,886-kilometer long (1,712 miles) pipeline is complete except for a section planned to run under Lake Oahe, a little more than half a kilometer from the Standing Rock reservation. The government and Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners, which owns the project, argue the pipeline would carry oil more cheaply and safely than already overburdened rail routes. Protesters say the pipeline is a threat to water resources and Native American sites. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe says that when those behind the pipeline approved the route, they failed to take into account tribal opposition. They demand the route be diverted away from their ancestral and treaty lands. In September, the government postponed final approval of the permit to build the pipeline under the lake in order to give federal officials more time to consult with the tribe. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama said the pipeline could be rerouted, but Energy Transfer Partners is opposed to the idea.
