Photo by Andrea Cornejo In Tennessee, seven water protectors locked their arms to barrels of cement, blockading the entrance to the Memphis Valero refinery, the endpoint of the proposed Diamond Pipeline. The 440 mile pipeline is under construction from Cushing, Oklahoma, to Memphis, Tennessee, and plans to cross more than 500 waterways, including five major watersheds. At Standing Rock, local law enforcement and the National Guard attacked unarmed water protectors in freezing temperatures. Hundreds of water protectors led a prayer walk to the razor wire barricade approximately 700 feet from the drill pad where the Dakota Access Pipeline is proposed to cross the Missouri river. A total of 14 water protectors were arrested, and some were held in cold dog kennels overnight. Repression of water protectors intensifies at a statewide level as North Dakota GOP lawmakers introduce bills which would restrict the use of face masks, allow the federal government to be sued to cover law enforcement costs, and protect drivers from liability if they injure or kill a pedestrian obstructing traffic on a public road or highway. We came to stand in prayer, and we were attacked. Unarmed citizens exercising their right to free speech are hit with tear gas and rubber bullets for opposing a fossil fuel pipeline. As protectors we have risen against all odds, to protect the water and the future of our children. Journal Collective. Please consider subscribing today.
