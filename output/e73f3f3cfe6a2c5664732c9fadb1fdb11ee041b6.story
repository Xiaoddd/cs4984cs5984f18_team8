The controversial project faces opposition among First Nations, the public, and elected officials across Canada and the Pacific Northwest, including steadfast resistance from British Columbia Premier John Horgan and opposition from Washington Governor Jay Inslee. In response to mounting legal challenges and widespread public resistance, Kinder Morgan announced in April that it would suspend work on the pipeline and make a decision by May 31st about whether to move forward with the project or cancel it altogether. Not only would the project threaten land, water, and communities along the route in Canada, it would also dramatically increase dangerous tanker traffic along the West Coast, putting coastal communities in Washington, Oregon, and California at risk of increased pollution and threat of spills.
