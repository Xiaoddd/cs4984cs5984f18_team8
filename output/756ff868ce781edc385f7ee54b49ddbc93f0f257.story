We can no longer dial you in to the call at 8 pm ET tonight as we need to get the list of numbers to dial to our large-scale call vendor by 4:45 pm ET. or on this page. We'll discuss three effective strategies for resisting Trump: cities, Congress, and corporations. We'll hear a special report from Cristina Jimenez of United We Dream on the wave of deportation sweeps that Trump unleashed on immigrant communities, and what we can do. And we'll lay out the plan for the upcoming February congressional recess, when we'll have the opportunity to speak directly with members of Congress when they return home from Washington.
