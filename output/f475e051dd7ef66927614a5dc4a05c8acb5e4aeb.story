Now, with the help of the US Government and militarized police suppressing and attacking peaceful protesters, big industry is building a pipeline on Sioux land without their consent and against their will. The pipeline, being constructed by Dakota Access, a subsidiary of Texas-based company Energy Transfer Partners will pump 470,000 barrels of oil a day across 4 states, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. Oil will pass through communities, farms, sensitive ecosystems and habitats, traditional and sacred Sioux lands and over and beside the Missouri river, a critical fresh water sources for millions. Oil spills and leaks from pipelines are extremely common and highly dangerous to the ecosystems and human health. Since 1996 in the United States alone, there have been over 11,200 serious pipeline incidents reported (many go unreported) to the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration. Among those incidents, there have been 360 fatalities and 1,376 injuries. reports that in 2010, a single pipeline spill poured 1,000,000 gallons of toxic bitumen crude oil into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. The cleanup cost over one billion dollars and significant contamination remains. And in January of 2015, more than 50,000 gallons of Bakken crude oil (the same oil to be transported via the Dakota Access), spilled into the Yellowstone River in Montana for the second time since 2011. Sunoco Logistics is one of the largest pipeline operators in the United States and will be operating the Dakota Access pipeline. Sunoco has spilled more crude oil than any of its competitors, with over 200 spills since 2010. In October 2016, Sunoco leaked 55,000 gallons of gasoline into Wallis Run, a tributary of the Loyalsock Creek that drains into the Susquehanna River, which over 6 million people depend on for drinking water. The Susquehanna has also been declared the third most endangered river in the US. Since the first proposal of the Dakota Access Pipeline, the Standing Rock First Nation has been leading frontline resistance and has taken legal action on the basis the pipeline project will destroy historic and cultural sites, is a direct violation of Treaty and Title Rights and because it threatens to poison the lands and waters their people and all people depend on. The Standing Rock peaceful protests are making history in few ways. First, it represents the largest unified indigenous-led fossil fuel opposition and movement in the assertion of indigenous Nationhood, title, rights and demand for treaty promises to be upheld. More than 200 Tribes in North America have joined the protesters at Standing Rock and in the wake of the growing opposition, we have witnessed the signing of a historic treaty representing 85 Nations called the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion. It also represents the call for Non-Indigenous people to stand in solidarity with Indigenous people, respectfully and as anti-oppressive allies, in this fight and all others like it in the name of protecting the earth and its critical resources we mutually depend on. Water protectors and protesters have remained peaceful and weaponless. The only weapon reported was a rifle carried into the protest encampment by a Dakota Access security employee who, given documents found in his car, was sent by the company to instigate violence from within the protesters (see video). He was not dressed in his security uniform, but his company ID was found in the car he had been driving following his arrest by Tribal Police. Police continue to use weapons on unarmed and civil protesters of all ages including tear gas, tasers, concussion grenades, rubber bullets, sound cannons (LRAD), pepper spray, batons and water cannons in freezing temperatures. Because large media outlets have been refusing to cover the protest will not send reporters or write honest reports about what is happening. Many big media outlets have been bought out or are owned in some way by big industry, similar to some politicians and police officials who depend on them to keep their dirty secrets quiet, such as funding militarized police violence to suppress peaceful protesters threatening to stop a large economic project. The Dakota Access Pipeline is also opposed, as have been all other major fossil fuel projects, for its relation to climate change. The Paris Agreement sets a 1.5C limit on global temperature rise, which if we surpass, the earth natural systems will become unpredictable and unmanageable. This means the world needs to transition off fossil fuels completely by 2050. We already need to immediately halt current pipelines and our consumption of fossil fuels, let alone to build a new pipeline and consumer more oil. It is a movement for climate justice, a decolonizing movement for indigenous sovereignty and a movement for democracy and ensuring a shared future. Quick Glance at Main Issues: Violation of Treaty Rights and Indigenous Sovereignty: The US government is ignoring the legal treaty obligations and agreements they made with the Sioux via the Fort Lamarie Treaty of 1869 as they allow the fossil fuel industry to dig up Sioux burial sites and traditional land they have rightful title over and rights to. This is yet another forceful assertion of political dominance and control over Native Americans, denying the Sioux Nation its right to self-govern and self-manage its own land. Violent Assaults from Militarized Police on Peaceful Water Protectors: There is a large force of militarized police who continue to wrongfully assault and arrest men, women and children both Native and their non-Native supporters without provocation. These protests are and always have been weaponless and peaceful as Sioux water protectors and their allies make a stand to stop the project. Police continue to use weapons on protesters including tear gas, Tasers, concussion grenades, rubber bullets, sound cannons, pepper spray, batons and water cannons in freezing temperatures. Dangerous for the Environment, Dangerous to Human Health: Pipelines fail and leak oil into local environments extremely often, many even go unreported. They have and will continue to cause unmanageable and irreversible damage to ecosystems, habitats and will poison resources like water and healthy soils humans depend on. The Dakota Access crosses the Missouri river and thousands of other water sources. A spill would affect drinking water for millions and ecosystems for miles. At the same time, pipeline leaks can cause explosions and have injured and killed people. The Climate is about to Bust. We need a Transition Now: We cannot be investing in or allowing the development of oil projects which will grow or maintain our consumption and dependency on an energy system- fossil fuels- responsible for climate change. The climate has almost reached its tipping point that will send us into a cataclysm of unpredictable weather patterns. We need a fast and efficient transition to renewable, sustainable energy.
