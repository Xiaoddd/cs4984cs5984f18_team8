By Rose Aguilar - October 31, 2016 Rose Aguilar is sending daily reports from the pipeline protests at Standing Rock. Read more coverage here. The drive south from Bismarck, North Dakota to Oceti Sakowin, the main camp at Standing Rock, takes about 40 minutes. The Missouri River just outside Standing Rock is the source of fresh water for millions After about 30 minutes on Highway 1806, we were stopped by a National Guard checkpoint and told to turn around and take another route. According to the Indigenous Environmental Network, more than 300 police officers from four states are here. The pipeline is in the middle of blockades. Anyone who wants to oppose it no longer has access. This is what it looks like when you take a right out of the main camp. The road is blocked. The pipeline is being protected by those structures. This was not the case when I was here last month. They also say sacred sites are being bulldozed. From the camp, you can see Humvees on a hill where 11 burial sites are located. Altogether, the pipeline will pass through 59 counties. An early proposal called for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River north of Bismarck, the capital of North Dakota, a town that is 90 percent white. The pipeline would pass through sacred sites and burial grounds, which are supposed to be protected under federal law. All of the above deserves far more attention. Many questions remain unanswered. Journalists need to be asking these questions. I have yet to receive any answers. None of those spills were reported to the public, officials said. Most of the pipeline has been completed. Native Americans and their allies are incredibly frustrated, but remain determined to protect the Missouri River and sacred sites.
