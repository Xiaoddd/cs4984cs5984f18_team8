Led by Stanford University economist Tony Seba, the report has caused spasms of anxiety within the oil industry. Additionally, EVs have an expected lifespan of 1 million miles. In comparison, most fossil-based cars barely last 200,000 miles. Seba predicts that in less than a decade, it will become very difficult for consumers to find petrol stations, spares or mechanics knowledgeable enough to fix combustion engines. Those who cling to their outdated cars will probably have to pay to dispose of them in the future, says Seba. Following that, it will be the death of big oil.

This article is a joke.Maybe it will happen in US. So your numbers are way out of date. Mark Roest September 3, 2017 at 8:57 pm We'll have a system for converting existing cars to battery-electric, and the engines can go to recycling plants. Mark Goldes August 31, 2017 at 3:48 pm Future electric vehicles will have on-board recharge and unlimited range. They will become power plants when suitably parked, selling electricity. They have such strong finance and I'm sure that many will have government loans to fall back on if there is even a slight hint of decline in the industry. So many countries are reliant on their fossil fuel exports to survive. Unless there is more down to encourage alternative energy production, there will always be one of these big polluters still standing... crkuhns1 May 20, 2017 at 2:53 pm Source: Global Lithium LLC 2016 Most of the known supply of lithium is in Bolivia, Argentina, Chile, Australia and China. The supply is ample and concerns of global shortages are speculative. To attain at one ton of lithium, Latin America uses 750 tons of brine, the base material for lithium, and adds 24 months of preparation. Lithium can also be recycled an unlimited number of times, and it is said that 20 tons of spent Li-ion batteries yield one ton of lithium. This will help the supply, but recycling can be more expensive than harvesting a new supply through mining. Filthy Rich May 20, 2017 at 2:04 pm Funny Ted because at current 'known' reserves in the world there is enough Lithium for 100 Tesla gigafactories to last FIFTY YEARS. Nice try though. txlonerider May 19, 2017 at 1:33 pm According to Google, in 2008 world Li reserves where 13 million tonnes of Lithium. A base Tesla battery is 60 kWh, or 240kG of Lithium used, or 0.264609 tonnes. Sounds like a lot of cars, not really, considering annual car sales, world wide is 77,800,000. So, if everyone bought a Tesla for one year we could outstrip the worlds Lithium reveres. So we could almost replace every passenger car in the US. Ted Clark May 18, 2017 at 10:35 pm Yeah, it's called finite resource - lithium. Unfortunately Musk hasn't revealed that there isn't enough to produce his latest mass production car, Model S. Lithium is mined and is rare. Good luck with this thesis Stanford.
