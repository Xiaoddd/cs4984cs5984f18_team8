Sawant called for supporters to be united and militant, in building what she sees as a movement that includes her Socialist Alternative party and a number of advocacy organizations and social movement organizations. Before the march left Cal Anderson Park, I had a very brief chance to speak with Sawant about how she would tackle this as a local city councilmember, since this is a statewide measure. A February 11 rally with environmental, indigenous, and LGBTQ activists to denounce the Trump administration and celebrate the No Dakota Access Pipeline movement. The several hundred-strong march went a familiar route through Capitol Hill escorted by police. For Christine Margot, a protester from Tacoma, this march was personal. Another protester, James Lewis, a Microsoft worker in Bellevue, was impressed by the solidarity with marginalized communities. The demonstration arrived at Wells Fargo on Capitol Hill, as the protest had grown slightly, adding families and late-comers to the march. Matt Remle, a Lakota Native and environmental activist, led the protest with the American Indian Movement song. The predatory lending practices that Remle were referring to were identified as the cause of many individuals in communities of color and low-income communities losing their homes through foreclosures and loss of equity during and after the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. Toward the end of the rally, the main focus was using local movement, legislative and policy means to counter the effects of the change in politics nationally. The scope of this effort remains to be seen.
