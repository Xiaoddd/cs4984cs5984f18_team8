Nov 28, 2016 Governor of North Dakota Jack Dalrymple has signed an executive order demanding the evacuation of the Standing Rock water protector camp. Unarmed water protectors have been bitten by attack dogs, sprayed with pepper spray, beaten, shot with rubber bullets, and even hit with concussion grenades. Sophia Wilansky nearly lost her arm to a concussion grenade that was shot by police. She is still recovering. I also covered when reporter Erin Schrode was shot with a rubber bullet during her interview. Perhaps the most ironic thing that has been done to the people the governor now ostensibly wants to protect from cold weather is when the militarized police blasted them with freezing water in sub-freezing temperatures. All of this comes just days before THOUSANDS of veterans plan to arrive at Standing Rock and join the fight for a clean and safe future. The state of North Dakota and the Army Corps of Engineers has claimed they will not use force to evict the water protectors. Therefore I imagine this executive order is designed to allow police to stop anyone else from arriving at the camp. Many around the world are sending support for the water protectors and those helping them in this fight. One of the most important things you can do is simply spread the word about this disgusting abuse of human rights by our corrupt corporate state.

Morton county sheriff dept, along with hired militia and the national gaurd have tried to incite violence to justify the brutality and opressive acts perpetrated by them. However the water protectors have remained dedicated to a peaceful protest where their only weapon is prayer. Prayers for intervention to stop the eviction and STOP DAPL. I suppose it makes some kind of sense though. One last thought.

Instead of using his last days to STAND UP for ANYTHING of substance regarding regular American citizens and somehow use his Bully pulpit to intervene in North Dakota, he instead is handing out Presidential Medals of Freedom or threatening States who refuse to let Transgenders use womens bathrooms.
