What follows is a list of those changes. Again because of lawsuits, that rule has been watered down, but Trump has successfully banned refugees from ten majority-Muslim countries plus North Korea, leading to a 40 percent drop in overall refugee admissions and a 94 percent drop in Muslim refugees. It has also stopped accepting new applications for the program, which has been around since 2014, and plans to abolish it altogether. The idea is to coordinate help for more than 60 million people who have been driven from their homes by wars, poverty, or climate change. But the U.S. announced in December that it was quitting; Secretary of State Rex Tillerson claimed that participating would undermine American sovereignty. Immigration agents are now required to treat the claims of asylum-seekers more skeptically Homeland Security is telling its asylum officers to take a more critical stance on the stories of immigrants who say they are fleeing violence or persecution. If the interviewees seem nervous, the agents are to avoid factoring in that it might be caused by trauma or culture shock. Immigration lawyers told CNN it could mean millions fewer immigrants will be admitted here by 2020. Criminal Justice Federal prosecutors have been stripped of their discretion and ordered to seek maximum penalties Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued the order in May, with a specific intent that prosecutors pursue stiff sentences for drug-dealing, gun crimes, and gang violence. But the mandate applies to every kind of case. A police-department reform program has been cut off After the Department of Justice sued the police in Ferguson, Missouri, and ordered the department to clean up its act on race relations, the DOJ created a program where other police departments could seek similar guidance, but on a voluntary, cooperative basis. Police departments in Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Las Vegas, among others, took advantage of it. Sessions effectively cut off the program and channeled the money to groups like police unions instead. Local police are once again stocking up on military weapons After police in Ferguson used military weapons against protesters in 2015, Obama took measures to end the militarization of police. Sessions rescinded those rules, so police can once again obtain surplus grenade-launchers, bayonets, and armored vehicles for free or with federal dollars. In August, though, the Department of Education said it would stop sharing student information that the watchdogs depend on. Schools have more leeway on how they investigate sexual-assault reports Under Obama, schools were told to come down against the accused students if there was more evidence of guilt than of innocence. A plan to reduce racial disparities in schools is being delayed Under a plan released in the waning days of the Obama administration, the states would have to review districts where minority students are disciplined or sent into special education disproportionately often. It was set to take effect next year; DeVos has pushed it back to 2020 and may end up scrapping it altogether. Environment The U.S. has rescinded its commitment to the Paris climate accord The U.S. submitted its formal notice of withdrawal from the Paris climate accord in August. Besides the implications for domestic energy policy, this means the U.S. will renege on promises to provide aid to poorer countries for climate measures, and may also cause diplomatic and economic blowback around the world. The EPA is dismantling its Clean Power Plan The Clean Power Plan was intended to make sure the U.S. met its overarching goal in the Paris deal: i.e., to reduce carbon emissions by at least 26 percent by 2025. It would limit carbon pollution from energy plants and would encourage states to invest in alternative energy. Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, has said he wants to replace the plan with new guidelines, but meanwhile the repeal is underway. The Dakota Access pipeline is now open, after its final construction phase was greenlighted by the Army The pipeline runs more than 1,100 miles from North Dakota to southern Illinois. The pipeline opened in June. And the State Department has approved construction of the Keystone XL pipeline The Keystone pipeline is designed to ship oil from Alberta, Canada, down to Texas, via the Canadian firm TransCanada. Trump invited the company to reapply, and in March the State Department approved its plans. Environmentalists worry it will devastate marine life and lead to oil spills. After some setbacks in court, the Bureau of Land Management has worked out a plan to delay the implementation until 2019. The EPA has canceled limits on the pollutants power plants can dump into waterways Steam electric plants unload aluminum, arsenic, mercury, and other pollutants into streams, which has been linked to fish die-offs and other environmental problems. But under Trump, the agency has retracted those limits and said it will come up with new guidelines instead. Plastic water bottles are once again allowed in national parks In 2011, the National Park Service banned plastic bottles, a rule intended to keep the parks clean. Hunters are free to use lead ammunition in national parks The Obama administration banned lead ammunition at the end of 2016, along with lead sinkers for fishing, on the grounds that lead is widely known to be toxic. The Department of Interior, led by outdoorsman and former oil-company-board-member Ryan Zinke, lifted the rule in March. Environmentalists were especially upset about the Pacific walrus, given that its habitat in the Arctic is eroding due to global warming. As the CEO of Exxon, Rex Tillerson had lobbied vigorously against it, and the first bill Trump signed after taking office annulled the rule. It was supposed to take effect on June 1, but the Department of Labor has refused to enforce it, and the administration is trying to repeal it entirely. Investment banks were reportedly irked about the competition. Worker Protections The Labor Department is backing off on overtime enforcement Obama tried to cut off the exemptions that companies use to avoid paying overtime to millions of workers. Under Sessions, however, the DOJ has changed its position: It now says employers are free to discriminate against transgender people, and it plans to argue that position in any future court cases. Industry lobbyists called it a job-killer, and Trump revoked it in March. Consumer Protections The subsidies that undergirded Obamacare have been wiped out The federal funds went to insurance companies so they could offer cheap plans to poor people. Employers can now refuse to cover birth control In contrast to the original Obamacare rules, any employer can now opt out of paying for contraceptives for employees by claiming they have moral or religious objections. Hundreds of thousands of women may lose their access to contraceptives. The government is also paying some of the legal fees for groups that sued the Obama administration to get this mandate overturned. The Obama administration spent five years working on a vast rule that would have encouraged more class-action suits, but in October, Congress voted to strike it down, and Trump swiftly signed the bill. The FCC voted in December to revoke those rules. It also voted to reduce its own influence over broadband companies, which will constrain future regulatory efforts. But in August, the FCC found an obscure loophole that will let Sinclair buy 42 more stations and expand its reach to as much as 72 percent of the country. The FCC is targeting rules meant to protect local journalism The FCC has taken other measures to help Sinclair as well. The rule helped protect the connection between local communities and their news organizations. And in November, the agency removed limits on how many stations or newspapers any company can own in a single local market. In November, its board voted to impose a cap on the subsidies, and it also approved a measure that will force most poor households to find a new internet provider. The EPA has decided not to ban a ubiquitous pesticide from farms Chlorpyrifos, which farmers use to kill pests on fruits and vegetables, has been known to cause headaches and nausea at high doses and to harm fetal development. Foreign Policy The military and CIA have eliminated measures that protected civilians from drone strikes In the fall, Trump approved two changes to the use of military drones, according to the New York Times. One change allowed the military and CIA to target low-level jihadists with no particular skills or leadership roles. The other removed the requirement for high-level vetting before an attack is carried out. A similar ban is in place for businesses. Miscellaneous FEMA has dropped construction standards meant to help with flood preparation The agency issued construction standards in 2015 for roads, housing, and other infrastructure built with federal money, in response to climate change. One provision, for instance, would have required buildings to be elevated from the reach of rising water. Trump struck the rules down less than two weeks before Hurricane Harvey hit. A rule aimed at combating housing segregation has been suspended The Small Area Market Rent Rule, which was scheduled to take effect next year, would give bigger subsidies to some Section 8 recipients so they can afford to move out of impoverished areas. That provision was delayed, then thrown out in October. Many federal agencies are being less generous with public information. EPA scientists have been restricted from speaking in public about climate change. The White House no longer keeps logs of its visitors, which would reveal who has had direct access to the president. The same is true at Mar-a-Lago. And the administration has refused to release the names of some members serving on its deregulation teams. A rule from the Obama administration blocked their efforts for a few months early this year, but Congress quickly voted to undo it, and Trump signed the bill in April. International nonprofits that provide abortions can be defunded, too The Mexico City Policy, announced by Reagan in 1984, revoked federal funding for any nongovernmental organization, anywhere in the world, that provides abortion counseling. It has been repealed and reinstated several times since, depending on which party is in power, and Trump reinstated it in January.
