MIKE MCCLEARY, TRIBUNE Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save A sheriff who is leading operations for law enforcement at the protest camps in southern Morton County said at a news conference Saturday that officials are considering withdrawing from Backwater Bridge on N.D. Highway 1806. Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said there was a discussion held on the bridge Friday between law enforcement and camp organizers. He was asked whether police would consider leaving the bridge, which is reinforced with cement jersey barriers and wire. Multiple vehicles burned there that night, and authorities have said the bridge may be structurally unsafe for traffic due to the fires. We will pull back to an area that gives us separation between law enforcement and the protest groups. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said Saturday that the bridge will not be re-opened, yet, and the barricades will remain until it has been inspected. Violation of these agreements will result in the arrests of anyone moving to the area north of the bridge or the waterlines north of Army Corps of Engineers' property, Laney said. Maj. Kirchmeier also briefed reporters on a phone call he had with U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch. He said he reiterated that the federal government needs to reach a decision on the pipeline easement. The Tribune's efforts to get comment on the proposal from protest leaders were unsuccessful.
