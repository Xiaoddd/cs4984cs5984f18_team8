Over a dozen devastating oil spills have occurred in the northern Peruvian Amazon in 2016, spewing thousands of barrels of oil into Amazonian rivers and affecting local communities. The initial Peruvian government response was to minimize the seriousness of the threat, provoking multiple mobilizations from indigenous water protectors in different communities. Only after months of protest and national and international pressure did the government agree to constructive dialogue, sending ministers to the Saramurillo to negotiate directly with leaders and community members. 5,431 people have taken this action so far. We appreciate the effort to engage in constructive dialogue, as opposed to the violent repression of past administrations. Now, the important work begins. I urge you to ensure that every single one of the agreements is fully implemented in order protect indigenous communities and the Amazon rainforest from further oil contamination. Please demonstrate that words on paper really can become reality.
