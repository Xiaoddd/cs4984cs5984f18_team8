Introducing the timeline, the BNC noted how progress over the past year has occurred in the face of intensified Israeli state efforts to undermine, attack and sabotage the BDS movement. No matter how extreme the rhetoric gets, or how shameless the smears become, the case for BDS remains as straightforward and compelling as it always has been Despite this, the BNC points out, campaigners have seen successes in activism targeting major multinationals, churches, city councils and student groups, as well as securing the support of the European Union and national governments for the right to boycott (despite Israeli efforts to equate such campaigning with illegitimate hate speech). But Israel and its friends are as determined as ever to prevent the application of any sort of pressure whatsoever, as we also saw this past week. Watson, it seems, has decided to enthusiastically ally himself with the jailer and bulldozer against the human rights defender and forcibly displaced farmer. Tom Watson, it seems, has decided to enthusiastically ally himself with the jailer and bulldozer, against the human rights defender and forcibly displaced farmer Meanwhile, Michael Oren, deputy minister for public diplomacy in Benjamin Netanyahu's government of settlement cheerleaders and nationalist demagogues, slammed France's decision to make it obligatory to correctly label produce from Israeli settlements in the West Bank. For Oren, this modest measure was reminiscent of the Dreyfus affair and France's Nazi-allied Vichy regime. Yet no matter how extreme the rhetoric gets, or how shameless the smears become, the case for BDS remains as straightforward and compelling as it always has been. It is based on the reality of Israel's longstanding, systematic violations of international law and human rights, on the call for solidarity from Palestinian civil society groups, and its value as a tactic. The clarity of the case for BDS stands in stark contrast to the stagnation afflicting other potential arenas for advancing Palestinian rights, both internal and external. Statement fatigue At Fatah's long-awaited conference in Ramallah this past week, it was business as usual, despite the various and serious challenges awaiting novel solutions, both inside the party and with respect to the bleak picture faced by the Palestinian national movement more broadly. The revitalisation of the Palestinian national movement, the fate of the PA, and the use of the UN as a forum for strategic gains, are all imperatives independent of BDS Fatah's conference opened on the United Nations' annual International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, which UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon marked with a run-of-the-mill statement. UN peace process official Nickolay Mladenov, meanwhile, addressed the Fatah meeting in person. BDS, it should be emphasised, is just one tactic. The revitalisation of the Palestinian national movement, the fate of the Palestinian Authority, and the use of the UN as a forum for strategic gains, are all imperatives independent of the global, civil society-driven boycott campaign. BDS can only do so much, but it is also something that can, and must, be done. For example, a boycott of settlement produce should be built on and expanded, since it is the Israeli state and various institutions (financial, academic, etc) that are either directly responsible for, or complicit in, the illegal colonisation of Palestinian land, the apartheid regime in the West Bank and the forced displacement of a stateless people. The arms trade, and the demand for an embargo, is similarly a serious issue that directly impacts on Israel's ability to control and brutalise the Palestinian people. In short, BDS offers specific, concrete campaigns. As well as having useful goals in and of themselves, this helps advance that logic of pressure which, irrespective of other political developments, must shape the international approach to Israel's ongoing occupation and apartheid regime.
