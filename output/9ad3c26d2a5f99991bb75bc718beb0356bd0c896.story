email April 18, 2018 By Rebecca Bengal Photographed by Mitch Epstein email Share this story At the northern edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota, several dozen cars, trucks, and vans pulled over alongside Highway 1806 by the Cannonball River. At least one had NO DAPL (No Dakota Access Pipeline, DAPL rhyming with apple) painted on the door. Snow still covered the ground; the temperature hovered around 17 degrees. A single teepee had been put up. A small fire was burning, encircled by rocks and the 50-some people who gravitated toward it. They had come to take part in a four-day prayer walk to the town of Mandan, 40 miles away. It was February 22, exactly one year after the governor of North Dakota ordered the evacuation of the camps, which for 11 months had maintained an occupied resistance against the pipeline. Most of those gathered had made their home in teepees and yurts and tents back when the resistance was at its peak in late 2016. They reported surviving rubber bullets, LRAD sound cannons, mace, pepper spray, and dogs, too. They had put their lives on hold and on the line in order to defend treaty rights and sacred lands and, primarily, water. An earlier proposed path that ran just north of Bismarck was scuttled; now it would cross twice under the Missouri River, the primary source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux and an estimated 17 million more downstream. They were water protectors, not protesters, they maintained. A year earlier, National Guard vehicles were parked on 1806 and law enforcement stood poised in riot gear on the roadside. He and Phillips sang and drummed as they joined a procession of the last water protectors of Oceti Sakowin, the largest of the three main camps, as structures burned behind them and snow and ashes fell. Phillips is tall and rangy, with shaggy, thinning hair and glasses. At camp, he was known as Uncle Nate, or simply Uncle. Phillips has a loose, jaunty demeanor and a rhythmic, lilting speech. When he described the recurring dream that gave him the idea for the prayer walk, he fell into a cadence. Some of those walking were from Standing Rock. Swan Americanhorse brought her children, including her youngest, who had spent her very first days living at the first camp, Sacred Stone. Some had never really left. Alex High Elk drove up from Cheyenne River Reservation; at Standing Rock he had sung songs and roused water protectors in the predawn hours for long days of ceremony and actions and work. That was me. He laughed; his friend Ghost Big Shield laughed, too. Someone else asked Angel when the march would start, and she corrected him. He raised a wooden staff adorned with nine eagle feathers in the air as he addressed his security team, volunteers who had stepped back into familiar roles guarding gates at camp. They were outfitted in head-to-toe camouflage, masked by bandanas printed with the word Resist, and bearing walkie-talkies. That was my role. Phillips hoisted the staff in the air again. Across the road, the bare cottonwoods were trimmed with red prayer ties. At first there were no police vehicles in sight; earlier that day, Phillips had spoken with Morton County sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier who, he said, had directed them to stay out of the roadway. The water protectors serving as security stood in the middle of 1806 and urged the walkers to the roadside, where snow gathered in drifts in the ditches. They halted traffic when the walkers briefly swelled into the northbound lane. Buffalo were lined up in the west hills, watching the procession below. Cheryl Angel carried a seashell full of smoking sage. Behind Phillips, a water protector named Danny carried an upside-down American flag that matched another upside-down American flag pinned to the back of his coat. On the road it rang out like a hymn, anthemic. As the road curved upward, the 80-acre expanse of the former Oceti Sakowin camp came into view. The teepees and dome and yurts and tents and wigwams were gone. The flags of the hundreds of visiting tribes and nations that had flapped in the Plains winds along the main road had disappeared, as had much of the entry road itself, now just a snowy hump bisecting a vast, quiet swath of prairie. The sacred fire that had burned for months had long been extinguished. One by one, the walkers approached the gate, knelt, and scattered dried tobacco into the dirt. He had come to Standing Rock from Los Angeles in November 2016. When I came here, I buried my heart at Oceti Sakowin. She and her father had returned to Standing Rock last September for a healing gathering of water protectors. A few of them had made it over to the Oceti grounds that lay behind these new fences. A quarter mile down the highway at Backwater Bridge, the walk would conclude for the day. Here, on October 27, 2016, 141 people were arrested in the single largest mass arrest at the camps, and here, on the night of November 20, 2016, camp medics lost count of the number of hypothermia cases they treated after local law enforcement turned high-pressure water hoses on water protectors in 26-degree weather. In footage of that night, ice crystallizes on razor wire as water protectors hold up plywood shields in defense. Audible in the background are the voices of water protectors alternately singing and shouting over popping sounds. Vanessa Dundon, a Navajo water protector, suffered permanent disability in one eye. Israel Hoagland-Lynn was shot in the back of the head with an impact munition, lost consciousness, and received 17 staples for a head wound. Dozens more were also rushed to hospitals. Now it was quiet, placid even, the sun going down for the day. In the middle of Backwater Bridge, Phillips said a concluding Four Directions prayer, raising his staff to the east, south, west, and north. In the north, three white trucks were spotted in the hills. Zeuse Larsen, on security detail, craned to get a better look. Larsen turned to face him, planted her boots firmly in the road, and raised a fist in the air. In its early days, the WPLC operated out of a tent at camp, dispensing essential know-your-rights advice to newcomers and providing a phone number for anyone heading to the front lines to write on their arms in case of arrest. As the months went on, more than 800 water protectors were taken into custody, overwhelming the tiny Morton County jail. The WPLC, which is funded by individual donations and grant support, secured permanent office space in order to manage that caseload and ongoing work. By late March, 316 state criminal cases had already been dismissed in court, according to the WPLC. A team of pro hac vice lawyers (those licensed outside North Dakota) supplements local representation, said Moira Meltzer-Cohen, who now spends two-thirds of every month in Mandan; she was on her way to catch a flight back to New York City, where her work focuses largely on activist and mass arrest defendants. According to the National Lawyers Guild, 58 anti-protest bills have been proposed in 31 U.S. states since the end of 2016, among them a bill introduced before the North Dakota legislature that would have eliminated criminal and civil liability for drivers running over protesters blocking public roads. Mary Redway, an environmental biologist from Rhode Island and a participant in the prayer walk, was one of the first and only defendants in state cases against water protectors to receive a jail sentence. Eventually she decided to leave a coveted job with the Native American oral history program at the Center for Southwest Research in order to work at camp full-time. In late May, Little Feather is set to be sentenced; around the same time, so will Michael Markus and Red Fawn Fallis. They gave up their livelihood, they gave up their families, they gave up their freedom, they gave up their physical bodies to protect us. From Backwater Bridge, walkers processed single file along Highway 1806. When water protectors arrived on site, they were menaced with dogs and pepper spray by members of a private security firm working for the pipeline . Phillips, still carrying the staff, loped ahead. Jim Northrup and Jarod Galvin broke into a run to keep pace. A woman in a long printed skirt gathered its folds in one hand and sprinted along behind them. Back at the gym, Verdelia Americanhorse heated up a pot of homemade soup and fry bread; people ate and drifted into the bleachers to stretch out and figure out the rest of the night. The Bismarck Radisson hotel had been the planned destination after dinner, but gas money was scarce, and after two days the walkers still had about 30 of the 40 miles left to go. In earlier years, NYA held vigils on the National Mall, championed the preservation of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and advocated against nuclear waste dumps; it hosted a pipe ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery for veterans. Now, with his feet up in the bleachers, Phillips closed his eyes. Night had fallen. Raymond Kingfisher and his friend Carolyn Christmas, also from Washington, were finishing dinner across the gym. The six-day BIA takeover was a turning point in the Red Power movement, a precursor to the Wounded Knee standoff in 1973 that would reverberate decades later in Standing Rock. It was a lesson in improvisation, too, and for reading the needs of the room. Kingfisher has a gift for slipping seamlessly between solemnity and humor, in a way that calls to mind actor John Goodman. Christmas laughed and clapped her hands as the verses continued, through increasingly decrepit and outlandish modes of transportation. Phillips, swiftly reinvigorated, hopped down from the bleachers, sidled up to her folding chair, and offered his hand for a dance, leading Christmas in a looping waltz to half court and back around the gym. Someone arrived with bags of sandwich bread and meat. At the opposite end, a pick-up basketball game was under way, with players ranging from ages 3 to 35. The anxious look on his face had disappeared. Turtle Feather, a 17-year-old who made his first trip to Standing Rock nearly entirely on foot from Oklahoma, hugged an old friend. He had been on the road for months; now he was staying in a house in Fort Yates. He wiped away tears. At one of the folding dining tables, Teena Pugliese sat hunched over a laptop, guiding Tokata Iron Eyes, a 14-year-old tribal member and daughter of activist Chase Iron Eyes, through a video edit. Pugliese, a filmmaker and actor from California, has a preternaturally vibrant, seemingly ceaseless energy. They cracked up, but kept working until two water protectors began to remove the chairs around them, as they prepared to begin the day. The sky began to clear. Pugliese, following in another pickup, flew a drone overhead, her laptop propped on her knees. Security cruised along the highway, pulling off occasionally to give cold or tired walkers a rest, funneling them to the next gathering point. The police. The eagle-feather staff and the upside-down American flag bobbed in the air a half mile ahead and took a right turn into a boat launch parking lot, signaling the end of that day. The Cannon Ball prayer singers clustered around him and the sound of their drumming thundered across the river, loud enough for the ice fishers a few hundred yards away to hear. Only one fisher, huddled around a little wooden hut on the ice, glanced in the direction of the drums. The walkers clambered into waiting cars, bound for Cannon Ball and Bismarck. The staff and flag strode ahead, Phillips and Danny joined by a third walker who marked their path with prayer ties. A few of the security crew hung back, ambling down a low embankment before they strode into the center of the clean sheet of the frozen river. For several minutes they shuffled their boots in slow, methodical, curving movements, a near soundless dance. Someone laughed; the sound spooled across the ice and echoed back. At the turnoff from Highway 1806, a hand-painted plywood sign advertised a local political candidate. It was Sunday morning, the last day of the walk. Jim Northrup said when Allard shushed him from the sofa where she sat, meeting with Pugliese. She rolled her eyes, flashed a smile. Her hair was newly cut, also a tradition. After the evictions, people were severely traumatized. He was laid to rest at Sacred Stone alongside her son, her father, and many aunts. Her eyes widened. Some of the water protectors drifting through her house that morning live in green energy trailers parked on her street, some are part of Sacred Stone Village, the long-term arm of the camp, which aims to transmit cultural knowledge and create sustainable, eco-friendly communities. Allard, who has addressed the U.N., continues to deliver lectures throughout the world. Her message, she said, remains simple. No matter how much they will keep trying to wipe our footprint off our land, we will continue to stand. Phillips had made it here at sundown yesterday, following an old railroad trestle trail that paralleled the highway. The trail dipped low, crossing under wooden bridges and by immense boulders. Tall banks surrounded the path on either side. On the west side, a hill shot up steeply toward the highway, covered in snow. Nathan and Alethea scrambled nimbly up the side of it, cheerful and purposeful. Turtle Feather walked along the trestle path, a giant smile on his face. Leoyla Cowboy and her daughter pulled over with a takeout carafe of coffee. Phillips said and downed half a paper cup. He walked on. About two miles remained. The sun had begun to fade and slim. It was his birthday and I thought about that, too, but I had to do it. She looked down, fiddled with the camera in her hand. Today she let her father take the lead. In the west, a trail of pink sun still ribboned across the sky, but on the eastern roadside, dusk cloaked the grass; the moon was rising. They reached the signpost for Fort Abraham State Park. Later that evening, in the Cannonball Community Center, he would be the center of all the dancing; later that evening, he would announce another prayer walk to coincide with the court dates of the federal defendants who will be sentenced at the end of May. Now the Cannon Ball singers encircled him, and Phillips joined them in song and prayer. In the past 24 hours he had covered nearly 40 miles, counting his solo walks after dark. They had made it. When the singers finished, Phillips pitched forward slightly, suddenly. A woman ran to steady him. Another brought water. They leaned in and surrounded him, propping him up. Alethea had been filming, but she ran over, too. She embraced her father, used his shoulder to steady her camera as she followed his gaze skyward. Heading north on Highway 1806.
