View all posts Vault 7 to Deep 6: Secrecy, Mendacity and Complacency Destroyed Our Republic By Teodrose Fikre on March 8, 2017 Our Republic died a long time ago. The universal rule of revolutions held true with America as well; all revolutions devolve right back to the tyranny that gave birth to it. We are led by crooks and con artists; from our carnival barking president Trump whose maturity matches his hand size to our criminal congress that passes laws that applies to all except legislators, calling our Republic a banana is an insult to North Korea. What you will find is a document dump from Wikileaks that will shock your conscience. The conspiracy is one that is being committed by our own government against us, the common people. The truth is getting out; what the powerful have always feared is an awakening from the masses because people can only take so much iniquity and unfairness before they eventually rise up against their tormentors. The gentry learned from the past for the history is full of one example after another of revolutions that were birthed by totalitarianism. One has to only look back to the French Revolution to understand what the aristocracy fear the most. In the case of the French Revolution, the overthrow was as violent as they came as the gilded class was treated to guillotines and bloody lapels. In order to sidestep this gory consequence, the powerful focused their energies on misdirection and mass manipulation. After all, a government does not possess enough weaponry to forcefully put down a rebellion of 300,000,000 people. Even if they had the means to subdue the masses through bullets and bombs, they knew that the military and police force would not unleash hell on their own neighbors and fellow citizens. Parenthetically, this is the brilliance of the founders for having a police force that is not federalized and why the constitution forbids the military from being deployed domestically. A decentralized police force prevents forces from one state being state to another. Maybe more people should rethink about the ongoing efforts, initiated by Obama and continuing through Trump, to effectively federalize our police through the tentacles of the Department of Justice. The plutocrats have steady been chipping away at our rights and our freedoms for a very long time. A creeping autocracy takes root and gains momentum through patient planning and ruthless use of force that can be washed away with talking points and well crafted speeches. Our politicians in this light are nothing more than front men and capos acting as a diversion for the mafioso bosses who are the true overseers of our nation. We are perpetually fighting over Democrats and Republicans in DC when in reality the ones who set the agendas and control the politicians we vote for are the plutocrats who live in places like Jamestown, RI and Needham, MA to oversees destinations like Brussels and Zurich. Rich pricks, using their ill gotten billions, have deployed their bank accounts to initiate a hostile takeover of our nation and most of the planet. Eisenhower warned us a long time ago to be leery of the military-industrial complex; his dire prediction seem quaint because a military-financial monster is now consuming the entire world with a combination of bullets, bombs, and debt. In the process, they have turned America and most of the world with it into one big pyramid scheme where wealth flows from the masses to a tiny few who thrive as the rest of a shrivel. Rest in peace opportunity and pursuits of happiness, instead we are left hope sandwiches and distress. It is in order to hide this truth from us, to paint over injustice with the pretense of patriotism and freedom, that our government expends the most energy on. Imagine that, what our government fears the most is the people waking up to the bullshit of it all. The mainstream media is to free press as Barack Obama was to change. I swear we are living in one big Truman Show, up is down and down is up as media has been weaponized in order to manipulate our thinking and to submerge the citizenry in a perpetual state of outrage and acrimony. You see, when everything is an outrage then nothing is an outrage. Sensationalism is not only a good business model to get more clicks, there is a darker side to the mainstream media as they are intentionally stoking animosity and grievance into the populace in order to keep us in a constant state of rage. In case anyone wants to dismiss the power that media has over our daily lives, there was a time the press started to report about shark attacks on a daily basis. There are more than 300,000,000 of us living in America, on a daily basis someone is most likely getting bit by a shark. Those who own the gun rule by fear but those who own the media and information rule through capitulation. All the while, the true powers that run this nation, the malignant suits in various agencies throughout DC and their bosses on Wall Street, are running our lives with iron fists befitting of Pol Pot. In fact, terrorism overseas is funded and armed by the political appointees at the Pentagon, at Langley Park and the NSA who create foreign monsters in order to justify their continued power grab domestically. Just for the record, the same way I refuse to blame our veterans and active duty personnel responsible for the immoral wars that our bankrupt government keeps declaring for the sake of corporate profits, neither will I blame the men and women who work at the Pentagon and various intelligence agencies for the heinous acts outlined in the Vault 7 documents. We have to separate the workers from those who sit at the table of power. There is a vast gap between the bosses and those who are employed by the endless civil and defense agencies who, for all intent and purpose, act as a shadow government within our government. After all, not too long ago I too worked as a consultant for Booz Allen Hamilton where I provided IT and logic support to endless agencies throughout the Pentagon and Department of Treasury. If I blame CIA workers for Vault 7, then I have to take the blame for the Iraq war. The saner course is to understand that a paycheck makes slaves out of all of us. All of us are, in this way, part and parcel of the continued nullification of our nation and we too are to blame for the death of our democracy. It is complacency that has led us to give up our freedoms for the sake of security and in the process we have let our minds be hijacked by a fatuous president Trump, the clowns in congress and the sideshow pundits on TV. We need to stop fighting each other and instead unite to take on an enemy within that sees all of us, the people, as a threat to their depraved existence. What we need is a paper napkin revolution, not a revolution of guns but a revolution based on unity and love. We keep trying revolutions based on bullets and we end up right back in the embrace of tyrants. The tyrants are them, the politicians, pundits and their plutocratic masters. The target is us, the people. Or we can finally wake up as a people before we are the ones who end up in guillotines as the powerful lop off our heads with yet another economic crash like they did in 2007. When it comes to finding truth in this world that is getting drowned by a tsunami of lies, everything has to be taken with a grain of salt. What I basically have to assume is this: when it comes to those who are afforded proximity to power and accorded a megaphone by the corporate owned media, you have to assume are part and parcel of the system of disinformation. The truth is that we are being water tortured, drip by drip, into an age of neo-totalitarianism. In the meantime, we are witnessing in real time a collusion between the mainstream media, our government and corporatists as there is a conspiracy of silence in order to keep the citizens shrouded in ignorance. This is how the farce of political adversaries gets torn asunder when both parties in DC are being mum in the face of the damning facts. To all Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren fans, please understand that those two are to truth tellers as Sara Palin is to the Mensa club. Instead the tools in DC, from Democrats to Republicans, are either being silent hoping this all goes away by the next news cycle or pretending to be outraged like a clownish Captain Renault that there is spying going on in DC. What a joke, the fourth estate is no more as they have become a bunch of juvenile jackasses chasing retweets instead of speaking truth to power. Our politicians are engaged in theatrics befitting of WWE wrestling. Meanwhile our government continues to commit atrocities throughout the world in our names and continues spying on Americans. We either reclaim our government from the clutches of despots in dark suits and red ties or the noose will continue getting tighter and tighter around our collective necks. Let the audacity of Ethiopians, Haitians, and American uprising serve as a lesson to us and those who rule through division. A published author and prolific writer, a once defense consultant was profoundly changed by a two year journey of hardship and struggle. Going from a life of upper-middle class privilege to a time spent with the huddled masses taught Teodrose a valuable lesson in the essence of togetherness and the need to speak against injustice. Originally from Ethiopia with roots to Atse Tewodros II, Teodrose is a former community organizer whose writing was incorporated into Barack Obama's South Carolina primary victory speech in 2008. He pivoted away from politics and decided to stand for collective justice after experiencing the reality of the forgotten masses. His writing defies conventional wisdom and challenges readers to look outside the constraints of labels and ideologies that serve to splinter the people. Teodrose uses his pen to give a voice to the voiceless and to speak truth to power. Update: My open letter to Congress in defense of Democracy and justice by clicking...
