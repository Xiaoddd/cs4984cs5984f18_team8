Among those quoted in the Declaration is Chief Vern Janvier, Chief of the Chipewyan Prairie First Nation, a tribe on the frontlines of the Oil Sands. In the document, Chief Janvier articulates how the sacrifice of sacred beings on the altars of fossil fuel profits is an act of cultural genocide. A prominent figure in the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) struggle, Sazue is serving his third term as chairman of the Hunkpati Dakota Oyate, the Mdewakanton and Ihanktonwan of Crow Creek. Chairman Brandon Sazue of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe A major emphasis of the Declaration is treaty rights and consultation mandates. Joining Chief Grier and Chairman Sazue to make presentations at the Declaration signing are Chief Judy Wilson of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs Executive, and Councilwoman Casey Camp-Horinek of the Ponca Nation of Oklahoma. A founder of Indigenous Women Rising, Councilwoman Camp-Horinek is at the forefront of the struggle against the Keystone-XL Pipeline. We will not continue to serve as sacrifice zones for the extractive industries to use and leave behind the environmental devastation for us to die in. As a delegate of the Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN), Councilwoman Camp-Horinek has previously addressed the UN Permanent Forum on indigenous issues.
