Captured on the ubiquitous smartphone, intimidated protesters scurry away from a scene of unprovoked police violence. Correct, that is, up to a point. Violence and nonviolence are urbane concepts. Much of what passes as progress and normality is actually imbued with a hyper-violence that most of us remain blissfully unaware of. For the sake of cheap furniture, games consoles and fizzy drinks, we have reduced complex woodlands to lumber yards; people to cogs in the machine; animals to generic product; oceans to depleted fish farms; and paradise into parking lots. Few, if any. The modern mind does not like such talk. From most angles it appears a laudable belief. But there is one angle that we keep missing. And in our current climate, it is a crucial one. This is not an argument for mindless violence. It is an argument against mindless nonviolence. It should be obvious that tackling the major social and ecological injustices of our age in ways that are legal and nonviolent is the first port of call. What we must understand, however, is that in persisting with ineffectual tactics we are failing those we seek to help. While big business is admirably single-minded in converting the splendour and majesty of the world into cash, those who want a fairer, more ecologically harmonious world often find themselves split over how best to achieve it. George Monbiot has done more than anyone to highlight how crucial wolves are to the health of our ecological landscapes. The political landscape needs rewilding just as much as our ecological landscapes. The eradication of the political wolf has diminished our potential to combat merciless systemic violence. Our ecological crisis became critical a long time ago, and is only getting worse. Billions of animals are sentenced to cruel existences in prisons, for a crime no worse than being born into a world of human supremacy. We have a responsibility to be honest with ourselves about this. Look at the largest protests of the last decade. Despite millions peacefully protesting, we went and created havoc in Iraq. Look at Occupy. While many good people are doing everything they feel they can, most are straitjacketed by cultural narratives around violence and nonviolence that are so simplistic it beggars belief. The same could be said of nonviolence. The Machine, owned and run by the Establishment for its own ends, must be resisted and revolted against, before it kills us all. Yet, just as there are times when nonviolent means are appropriate, there will also be times when it is not. It is in these moments when we must decide how far we are willing to go in order to protect what needs protecting. We live in a time of tough choices, when there is often no prescriptively right or wrong solution. Wise discernment is as important as it always has been. If much of the beauty of the world is to be not only preserved but enhanced, we might do well to concern ourselves a little less about our protests being peaceful, and a little more about our actions being effective.
