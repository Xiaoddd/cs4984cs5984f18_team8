This is the first time a river has been given a legal identity. The agreement was signed on behalf of Whanganui iwi by Brendan Puketapu of the Whanganui River Maori Trust, which represents a group of iwi along the river, and the Crown in Parliament this evening. An agreement between the Crown and local iwi on what the values will be in protecting the river are yet to be decided. A whole river strategy, in collaboration with iwi, local government and commercial and recreational users is still being decided. An eventual settlement will also include monetary compensation for historical claims. Minister for Treaty for Waitangi Negotiations Christopher Finlayson said the signing was an historic event.
