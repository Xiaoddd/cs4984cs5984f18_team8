Currently, about three-quarters of U.S. natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico flow from southern Texas. This natural gas is sourced primarily from the Eagle Ford Basin in Texas and transported on an existing pipeline network to serve industrial and power sector customers in northeastern Mexico. Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Natural Gas Monthly, and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Exports from western Texas, however, have been limited, despite a significant increase in cross-border pipeline capacity from 2015 to 2017. Significant delays in construction of the connecting pipelines on the Mexican side of the border have led to relatively low utilization of cross-border pipeline capacity from western Texas. Some pipelines in Mexico have been delayed by more than a year from their original expected in-service dates, in part because of disputes contesting pipeline routes. Several key pipelines in Mexico were placed in service earlier in 2018. These pipelines will transport natural gas from western Texas into central and western Mexico through the Ojinaga-El Encino and Tarahumara pipelines. Both pipelines are expected to be placed in service in October 2018. However, pipelines at the other end of this underwater pipeline have been delayed. Until these pipelines begin commercial operations, the high-demand market around Mexico City is expected to continue to be served by existing pipeline infrastructure transporting natural gas from southern Texas.
