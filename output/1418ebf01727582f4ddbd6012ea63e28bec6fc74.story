Hughie Tweedy, 61, of rural Montrose, said he recorded a Nov. 20 conversation with a right of way agent working with Dakota Access LLC, a subsidiary of Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, which wants to build a 1,134-mile crude oil pipeline from the Oil Patch in North Dakota to Patoka, Ill., cutting through the Dakotas and Iowa. Tweedy allowed reporters to listen to the 15-minute recording, but only on headphones so they could not record the audio. He also would not let them take notes. He said his attorney advised him not to distribute or publish the recording in case it becomes part of a court proceeding. Tweedy said he asked the agent to meet him for beers. The man also mentions an escort service. Tweedy first captured media attention Monday when he spoke on the steps of the Iowa Capitol about the alleged offer. Dakota Access said at the time that the company was aware of the allegation and was investigating. Dakota Access spokeswoman Vicki Anderson Granado made a similar statement Wednesday. We do not conduct business in the manner suggested, nor do we condone any contractors to conduct themselves in any manner other than to treat people with the utmost respect and professionalism. She declined to answer questions about whether Dakota Access was still investigating or had taken action over the allegation. The North Dakota Public Service Commission will hold three hearings on the proposed pipeline, starting with a hearing May 28 in Mandan. This can be removed when origin is fixed. Trigger the set to pull in again.
