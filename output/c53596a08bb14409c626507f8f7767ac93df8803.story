I withdrew money from Wells Fargo and sent the letter below to Tim Sloan, CEO of Wells Fargo. You can see Lily Tomlin on the far right, Catherine Keener on the far left, Frances Fisher, Delores Huerta and Viva Vadim, my granddaughter in the middle. It was very colorful with drummers, dancers, prayers and youth from an LA-based Indigenous school who sang happy birthday to me in their native language. It was the best birthday ever. The fact that Wells Fargo has invested money in DAPL indicates corporate irresponsibility and hypocrisy. Even minimal due diligence shows that Energy Transfer Partners and Sonoco, the companies that own and operate the pipeline, have the worst oil spill records in the United States. DAPL already crosses a vast stretch of land and is asking to dig beneath the Missouri River. Yet, shockingly, despite its horrific record of contaminations, DAPL has not been required to do a full Environmental Impact Statement. And why is your bank sinking so much money into maximizing the amounts of oil and gas that can be brought to the surface and burned at a time when climate science is clear: we must maximize what we keep in the ground. Harm to Native lands, culture and rights have already occurred. DAPL personnel deliberately desecrated documented burial grounds, committed gross violations of Indigenous Peoples rights; pose a major threat to the Tribes water source, and stands in violation of the international standards of Indigenous Peoples right to Free Prior Informed consent. Until then, I am withdrawing my money from your bank. I watched it from the room of my house, far away in Portugal, but with my heart and soul with you all, and the noble causes you fight for. You are, were always and always will be an inspiration Jane, i look up to you with the utmost admiration and respect. You are a lider and a warrior and i am proud to be your follower. Merry Xmas dear Jane, Happy 2017, full of hope, health, peace and joy. With love. Glad I could join. I totally support you in everything that you do. Hope to see you again if you ever come to Pittsburgh to film a movie or just to visit our beautiful city. Happy Birthday Again. I wonder how many others have withdrawn money. The place to hit these businesses is in the pocketbook. But I wonder if they even care. I am sure it was quite a sight to see on Sunset Blvd. with the dance. I canceled my credit card with one of the banks listed on the link you had posted and sent them a letter explaining why. You truly are an inspiration to me. & I love that Lily was there with you, your partner in crime. Happy Birthday, yours is truly a day to celebrate. You have brought so much good to the world, including politics from way back, entertainment (both French and American), exercise, and then all of those all over again, including really good comedy, and in this latest letter, reverence for the environment and respect for native cultures. Long sentence. The letter is just excellent. Your letter spells it out and with outstanding rhetorical finesse. Caroline from Madison, WI. . Because Peace is the Will of the Great Spirit. But do not think that just because the True Hopi People have been told by the Great Spirit never to take up arms that the True Hopi People will not fight, even die for what we know to be the right way of Life. The True Hopi People Know how to fight without killing or hurting. The True Hopi People Know how to fight with Truth and Positive Force In The Light Of the Great Spirit. The True Hopi People Know how to educate by clear thoughts, good pictures and by carefully chosen words. You are an inspiration to us all. Thank you for all your efforts on behalf of mother earth and its inhabitants. If they want to fund Sunoco well they will do so without my dollars. I am tired of these banks thinking there is no retribution for their actions. Well we can respond, by closing our accounts and using credit unions or small banks. Just got done watching 3rd season of grace and Frankie. Loved every minute. I have multiple sclerosis and some times felt like giving up. Was depressed but started watching the new show Netflix season 3 and it has cheered me up. I love the show. A wonderful woman. Love you Jane. She would be 81 years old and she died Nov 17th last year.
