The Dakota Access Pipeline goes through 18 Iowa counties. The camp is a county away from where the pipeline sits. The protesters are camping on some private land. They've made a small sustainable community, and have no intention of packing up anytime soon. Christine Nobiss is one of the founders of the camp. The group says some farmers that own land that the pipeline now goes through could win an eminent domain lawsuit. One called DefendIowa constantly posts about the group on Facebook. They are not to be trusted, based on their history at previous violent movements. The Iowa County sheriff tells TV9 deputies will stop by to check on the people living there, but they aren't doing anything illegal. The protesters are also planning on going to an Iowa Utilities Board meeting in June to protest the pipeline.
