She has now been living in a makeshift tent rigged to the pole for an astonishing 49 days, surviving on an assortment of initial supplies, catching her drinking water straight from the clouds and going to the bathroom in a bucket.

Across the ridge, in Monroe County, West Virginia, a man named Deckard is living in a tree-sit that has been occupied since February 26th. About 80 miles east, in Franklin County, Virginia, a three-person tree-sit was established in April to block the Mountain Valley Pipeline. In central Pennsylvania, 62-year-old Ellen Gerhart faces six months in prison for her part in establishing a series of tree sits to block the Mariner East 2 and 2X pipelines from crossing part of her family farm. A resistance camp known as the Three Sisters Camp has sprung up on a plot of lush woods adjacent to the James River, in Central Virginia, to block the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. In the western Philly suburbs, where Britton lives, the lines pass within close sight of schools, shopping malls, senior centers and hundreds of backyards. In March, a series of sinkholes emerged along a section of West Whiteland Township, where drilling intended to take the pipelines beneath an Amtrak route and a residential neighborhood transformed a series of backyards into swamps of mud.

The support camp is known as Slanty Camp because the ground is so steep. On Monday, a woman from Monroe County, West Virginia hiked in to sing for Nutty. Earlier in the month Tasha Hiner, also from Monroe, visited with her two sons, Justis, 10, and Will, 14, bearing a dish of curried couscous, a pineapple, a rack of deer ribs (the deer was shot by Justis) and fresh ramps from the garden.
