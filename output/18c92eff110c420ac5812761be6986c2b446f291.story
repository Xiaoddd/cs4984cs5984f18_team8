York University researcher Anna Zalik told DeSmog in an interview that TransCanada increased its investments in Mexico due to the high costs of doing business in the U.S. and Canada, after years of sustained resistance to pipelines including Keystone XL. TransCanada won the contract for the Tula-Tuxpan pipeline in November 2015, just after then-President Barack Obama denied TransCanada's attempt to build Keystone XL. However, TransCanada only held consultations with 15 communities along the route. Oliveria Montes Lazcano is the spokesperson of the Regional Council of Indigenous Peoples in Defense of the Territory of Puebla and Hidalgo, an umbrella organization for the communities in resistance to the Tula-Tuxpan pipeline. More than half of the pipeline has been constructed, but since December 2017, construction was halted at two points along its route, Cuautepec and San Pablito, due to legal rulings. However, the Regional Council is re-invigorating indigenous forms of governance. While the communities partake in indigenous forms of governance, they did follow the 2018 political campaign closely. Montes Lazcano says that organizing the Regional Council has empowered people to think critically about the political situation. These local battles over pipelines have already become a major headache for the oil and gas industry. A column of fire shot 150 feet in the air and destroyed a home, a barn, and several cars.
