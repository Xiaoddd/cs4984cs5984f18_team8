News often involved the movement of goods and German transports plus political and economic developments. These resistance fighters also carried out acts of sabotage by staging bomb attacks and setting fire to factories. In addition, the three-man team helped agents escape from the Protectorate. Czech policemen serving as translators for the Germans also supplied information. The Three Kings also kept in contact with Soviet diplomats. Sabotage Another objective involved sabotage. The group was responsible for bomb attacks in Leipzig, Munich and Berlin. Two attacks in Berlin were the most successful. However, another significant attack did not deliver the desired results. When the Three Kings tried to assassinate military commander and leading member of the Nazi Party Heinrich Himmler in 1941 by blowing up his train near a Berlin station, the bomb went off as expected. After being captured during 1915, he joined the Czechoslovak Legion. When the war veteran returned to Czechoslovakia, he climbed up the ranks to lieutenant colonel. As the Nazis began to occupy Bohemia and Moravia, he contributed to the resistance movement and became leader of the Three Kings. Even torture could not convince him to betray his two colleagues. He was executed October 3, 1941. From 1916 to 1921, he served in the Czechoslovak Legion. Thanks to false documents, he left with a car full of weapons. Later, he was tortured but did not give his tormentors any information. The brave fighter was executed June 30, 1942. When the Occupation began, he was demoted to a clerk. As a member of the resistance, he always carried with him two pistols, many gun magazines and a pocket Bible. He had many secret identities and was known for his adventures. The resistance fighter even lit a cigarette for Fleischer, who did not recognize him. Later he wrote Fleischer a letter bragging about the incident and stating that thanks to him he won a 1000-crown bet. That was by no means his only heroic exploit. During March of 1940, two thousand German policemen and 200 secret agents were looking for Jan Smudek, who had shot a German police officer. During the shootout that followed he was killed by an enemy bullet, though the Germans officially called it a suicide. These three risked their lives for Czechoslovakia not once but every day. Their feats sound as if they came from a novel rather than from real life. Cloudy. Light breeze. Partly cloudy. Gentle breeze.
