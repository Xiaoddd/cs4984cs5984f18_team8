Here, Kadin Mignery, 2, plays on his front porch. Pell and Joshua Schneyer Filed Dec. 19, 2016, 2 p.m. GMT A Reuters examination of lead testing results across the country found almost 3,000 areas with poisoning rates far higher than in the tainted Michigan city. Yet many of these lead hotspots are receiving little attention or funding. As he played, she scolded him for putting his fingers in his mouth. In explanation, she pointed to the peeling paint on her old house. Kadin, she said, has been diagnosed with lead poisoning. He has lots of company: Within 15 blocks of his house, at least 120 small children have been poisoned since 2010, making the neighborhood among the most toxic in Missouri, Reuters found as part of an analysis of childhood lead testing results across the country. Last year, the city of Flint, Michigan, burst into the world spotlight after its children were exposed to lead in drinking water and some were poisoned. In the year after Flint switched to corrosive river water that leached lead from old pipes, 5 percent of the children screened there had high blood lead levels. Flint is no aberration. And more than 1,100 of these communities had a rate of elevated blood tests at least four times higher. In some pockets of Baltimore, Cleveland and Philadelphia, where lead poisoning has spanned generations, the rate of elevated tests over the last decade was 40 to 50 percent. Like Flint, many of these localities are plagued by legacy lead: crumbling paint, plumbing, or industrial waste left behind. Unlike Flint, many have received little attention or funding to combat poisoning. To identify these locations, Reuters examined neighborhood-level blood testing results, most of which have not been previously disclosed. The data, obtained from state health departments and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tracks poisoning rates among children tested in each location. The resulting portrait provides a granular look at places where decades-long U.S. efforts to stamp out lead poisoning have fallen short. In children up to age 6, the CDC threshold for an elevated blood lead level is 5 micrograms per deciliter. Any child who tests high warrants a public health response, the agency says; even a slight elevation can reduce IQ and stunt development. Nationwide, the CDC estimates that 2.5 percent of small children have elevated levels. In the communities identified by this analysis, a far higher rate of children who got tested had lead poisoning. In most cases, the local data covers a 5- or 10-year period through 2015. WATER KITS: Milwaukee residents wait in line for water filtration kits under a pilot program run by the Sixteenth Street Clinic, United Way and the city. In each location, it was easy to find people whose lives have been impacted by lead exposure. MAPPING LEAD HAZARDS Most U.S. states disclose data on the percentage of child blood tests that show elevated levels of lead. Yet this data, often for statewide or county-wide populations, is too broad to identify neighborhoods where children face the greatest risk. Instead, Reuters sought testing data at the neighborhood level, in census tracts or zip code areas, submitting records requests to all 50 states. U.S. census tracts are small county subdivisions that average about 4,000 residents apiece. Zip codes have average populations of 7,500. In each area, a relatively small number of children are screened for lead poisoning each year. The test results allow for local analysis, pinpointing neighborhoods whose lead poisoning problems may be obscured in broader surveys. For example: Across Maryland, 2 percent of childhood lead tests were high in recent years, just a small fraction of the rate in the worst-affected Baltimore tracts. The findings, Walker said, will help inform the public about risks in their own neighborhoods and allow health officials to seek lead abatement grants in the most dangerous spots. The nationwide map constructed through this analysis has empty spaces: The available data includes 21 states, home to around 61 percent of the U.S. population. Even with these gaps, the data shows that despite broad national progress in curbing poisoning, lead hazards continue to imperil many communities. That success story masks a sober reality in neighborhoods where risk abatement has failed. TINY PLUMES OF DUST St. Joseph, Missouri, is filled with old homes that for a century featured lead paint and plumbing. Built in the 1880s, it has restored tiger-stripe oak floors and an antique clawfoot bathtub. As a pediatrician, Brownfield treats lead-poisoned children. A decade ago, her children were among them. Soon after moving into the home in 2006, her two youngest daughters tested high. There was lead in the tiles near the fireplace, the original stenciled wallpaper and the bathtub. The family did extensive work to fix the hazards. She blames lead paint in their house, built in 1883 in the Museum Hill Historic District in St. Joseph, Missouri. The family fixed the hazard. Others ignore explicit warnings. McCush, a certified lead inspector, says his office told one family that sanding paint off their walls was poisoning their son. When Mignery moved into an old, affordable home, the mother of four was aware of dangers like street crime. Over the past five years, 20 percent of tested children in the census tract showed poisoning. An inspector visited the home and found the culprit: old peeling lead paint. The family could only afford a partial fix. Children in at least 4 million U.S. households are exposed to high levels of lead, the CDC says. In Milwaukee last year, 11.5 percent of children tested had elevated lead. In a half dozen depressed North Side census tracts, about a third of tests showed poisoning from 2010 to 2014. One in 10 was highly elevated, at 10 micrograms per deciliter or more. Childhood poisoning victim Brandon, now 20, lives with his mother DeeDee in an old two-story home. The family agreed to meet a reporter but asked that their last names not be published, citing the stigma attached to lead poisoning. Brandon, 20, afflicted with lead poisoning as a child Across the street is the old rental house where, as a baby, Brandon was exposed to peeling lead paint. Health records show that before age 2, his levels reached nearly 10 times the current CDC threshold. He was hospitalized and received chelation treatment. The drugs remove heavy metals from the body and help prevent further damage, but once a child is exposed, the impact can be irreversible. Brandon, who is easily excited, was at turns cheerful and mournful during an interview. He has cognitive impairment, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and outbursts of anger. He was recently arrested after a dispute with a convenience store clerk over soda pop, and is now on probation. Federal law requires owners of homes built before 1978, when lead paint was banned, to disclose hazards to tenants or buyers. Laws that can require owners to remediate lead from properties vary across the country. He also said childhood blood screening has more than doubled in the city since the late 1990s. The city still has 135,000 prewar dwellings with lead paint, and 70,000 with lead water service lines. The Sixteenth Street Clinic, a non-profit, was giving away tap-water filters. Among them was Rebeca Velazquez, a mother of five. Her 5-year-old daughter was recently diagnosed with lead poisoning. TOXIC IN BALTIMORE, CLEVELAND, PHILADELPHIA Like Brandon, many children with lead poisoning fall into a vicious cycle: Cognitive deficits breed poor school performance, high dropout rates, few job opportunities, and brushes with the law. Last year, one man mired in that cycle met a notorious end. At 25, Baltimore resident Freddie Gray sustained a fatal spinal cord injury in a police van, setting off months of tension in the city and fueling the national debate over policing in black communities. He was exposed and suffered developmental problems, the legal filings say. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount. In several nearby census tracts, elevated lead levels were found in between 25 percent and 40 percent of children tested from 2005 to 2015. Joseph County in South Bend, Indiana, said budget cuts have made it more difficult to attack lead poisoning. Dr. Luis Galup, health officer for St. Joseph County in South Bend, Indiana Cleveland has similar problems. The state health department refused to provide census tract testing data; the news agency obtained the information from the CDC. Brown has pressed federal and state agencies to increase childhood blood testing rates and fund more lead abatement efforts. Pennsylvania has a dubious distinction. In 49 different tracts, from inner city Philadelphia to capital Harrisburg, at least 40 percent of children tested had high lead. The gaps make tracking poisoned children more daunting. In South Bend, Indiana, where health officials face a cash crunch, lead testing is in sharp decline even as existing data points to a serious problem. Filled with old dwellings, it has one of the highest poverty rates in town. Dr. Luis Galup, a pathologist and the county health officer, said funds to tackle the problem in South Bend have dwindled. Mayor Pete Buttigieg said the evidence that poisoning is widespread in parts of South Bend could cause public health administrators to seek more state funds or reallocate resources. ONCE HOSPITALIZED: Edward Brown Jr., once stricken with lead poisoning so severe he was hospitalized, feeds his sister Jewel, 1, at their home in South Bend, Indiana. The county, with around 265,000 residents, has two nurses and one environmental inspector tasked with lead poisoning prevention. Finding those children is getting harder. Housing and Urban Development grants that paid for South Bend lead testing ended in May. For years, the local Women, Infants and Children program, or WIC, conducted hundreds of childhood blood lead tests annually. That testing, which has stopped, relied on outside funds from HUD and others. South Bend pediatricians and the local Head Start program still order screenings, but many children go untested. Edward Brown Jr., 2, was first tested last year. An inspector found lead paint inside and contaminated soil outside. Levels that high can be life threatening, provoking seizures or coma. Now in a new home, Edward danced around and shared applesauce with his baby sister. He has met many of the typical developmental milestones for his age. Still, Marshall worries. IRON COUNTY INDUSTRY: The Doe Run Company's Resource Recycling Facility, in Boss, Missouri, located in Iron County, an area with a high percentage of children with elevated lead levels. The company said it takes steps to avoid lead problems. One-in-five cases of ADHD may be linked to lead poisoning, a recent American Academy of Pediatrics report concluded. Lead workers shower and change outfits at the end of their shifts, to avoid tracking toxins into their homes. In fact, lead contamination in the community is pervasive. The Environmental Protection Agency has mandated so-called Superfund cleanups of two contaminated lead sites in and around Viburnum. And Doe Run and other mining firms are currently under federal orders to clean up lead contamination from 150 properties in the region and test the soil at 250 more. Among the spots the EPA ordered to be cleaned or tested: playgrounds, daycare yards or other places where small kids gather. For some locals, poisoning is a cost of living in this mining town. Bohac said he was nearly taken off the job a few years ago after he was poisoned himself - with a lead level four times higher than what federal officials consider healthy for adults. Bohac himself was diagnosed with high lead levels. This data explored test results at the census tract or zip code level. Broader data surveys, such as the ones usually published by states or counties, cannot identify specific neighborhoods with a high rate of lead poisoning. The neighborhood-level testing results helped us pinpoint areas where lead exposure is a high risk. The data has limits, however: The picture it paints is not complete. Testing rates vary significantly by city and state, and millions of children go untested. Variances in data from states can make comparisons challenging. Reuters only included census tracts and zip codes where at least 100 children were tested over a multi-year period, as small sample sizes can distort the extent of the problem. Reuters defined elevated lead levels as any test result at or above 5 micrograms per deciliter, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention threshold for an elevated test. The CDC lowered its threshold most recently in 2012 to reflect the medical consensus that even low levels of lead exposure can do permanent harm to children. Some states differ with the CDC in how they define high blood lead levels or lead poisoning. At the neighborhood level, which often included only a small sampling of tested children, anomalies can cause an annual rate to spike or drop drastically. For that reason, Reuters combined data over a broad period, up to 11 years for each census tract or zip code. Epidemiologists say this approach paints a more accurate picture. Nationally, lead levels among children have declined steadily over recent decades. In any given community, the rate of children who tested with high lead levels over the last decade in aggregate is usually higher than the rate in the most recent testing year, reflecting the larger trend. Though many of the troubled spots have seen some decline in lead poisoning rates over the period of analysis, they remain areas of concern with disproportionate risks. Most states provided data covering 2005 through 2015. The differences are noted on our interactive map. Other states provided results for capillary tests that did not undergo a second test or finger prick. Rates can also be influenced by different policies on who is targeted for testing. For instance, pediatricians in some areas may only test the children they view as having the highest risk of poisoning. Pell and Joshua Schneyer Data: M.B.
