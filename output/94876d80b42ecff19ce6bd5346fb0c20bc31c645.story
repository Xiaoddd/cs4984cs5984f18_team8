Energy Transfer Partners, which is developing the pipeline, argued in court that when the Army Corps of Engineers issued a permit in July to build the line under Lake Oahe in North Dakota, it also took all the necessary steps to issue the easement that the company also needs. The Army Corps on Sunday announced that it would not grant the easement at this time, instead ordering a comprehensive environmental review of the planned pipeline crossing under the lake. It was a major victory for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, its allies and the thousands of protesters who had camped out near the lake for months to get the easement rejected. But the victory may be short-lived. The pipeline from North Dakota to Illinois is nearly complete, and the Lake Oahu easement is the last major approval it needs. Sign up for our daily email.
