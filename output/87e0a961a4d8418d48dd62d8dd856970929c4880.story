In 2008, Trump faced backlash from local officials and environmentalists in Scotland when he proposed to build a golf course on protected sand dunes. Ultimately, Trump got his project approved after promising to create jobs for local workers. Trump later fought an offshore wind farm project near his golf resort in Scotland, saying the wind turbines sullied the view from his course. Trump had one certification in progress with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), but LEED is a building certification, not an award. The only award that Henderson found was the 2007 Metropolitan Golf Association Club Environmental Award, given to the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. But in 2011, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection cited the golf course for a series of environmental violations. The book does not list any environmental awards. Russo did not respond to repeated requests for clarification. The White House did not respond to our request for clarification. Trump donated the land to be built into the Donald J. Trump State Park. We know of one award by the Metropolitan Golf Association, given in 2007 to his golf course in Bedminster, N.J. The golf course was later cited for environmental violations. The story must be told.
