2,348 signatures 652 signatures until 3k The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is showing the world how to fight climate change in their brave blockade against the North Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). Thousands have peacefully gathered to stop a 570,000 barrel-per-day pipeline that would endanger the ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux. BoA has actually pledged to go fully carbon neutral by 2020. Tell Bank of America you want real climate commitment. Demand it divests from the Dakota Access Pipeline. Without that capital, quite simply, there is no pipeline. What we are bearing witnessing to at Standing Rock is a moment of history. Thousands are literally putting their bodies on the line to keep our world, our water, our soil and our air safe. We could feel that power when tens of thousands of SumOfUs members raised their voice and stopped the Keystone XL pipeline cold. Stop the money, stop a pipeline. Tell Bank of America to divest now. 13 September 2016. Food and Water Watch. 6 September 2016. Unfortunately, you can't take action while Javascript is disabled in your browser.
