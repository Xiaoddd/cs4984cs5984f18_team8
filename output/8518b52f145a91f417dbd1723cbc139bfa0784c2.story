The primary concern of officials responding to remediation efforts in the area, which is a floodplain that has a history of sustaining heavy flooding, is public safety. Burgum said cleanup efforts at the camp area have been going slowly so far. He gave a rough estimate of about 20 percent of the items needing removal from the site have been taken away. He said efforts will be made to speed up the timeline for removing items at the camp. Burgum said the large number of illegally constructed housing structures as well as numerous abandoned vehicles, personal belongings and likely presence of human waste are concerning. He added that a large number of propane tanks are likely still there too, which protesters used for heating as temperatures took a nosedive late in the fall. The mix of recent high temperatures and nearly 60 inches of snowfall since December is as a recipe for a potential crisis, and in a more condensed timeline than previously anticipated. Opponents are concerned over river water contamination in the event of a rupture to the line as well as potential damage to tribal cultural sites along the route. At its peak the camps were home to thousands of tribal and non-tribal protesters gathered from across the country. The protests have resulted in hundreds of arrests since last August as well as tens of millions of dollars to the state for law enforcement response efforts, drawing international attention in the process. A North Dakota Department of Emergency Services spokeswoman said the state has adequate manpower and resources in the area, ready to deploy in the event of rapid flooding and the need for quick rescuing of individuals were to arise.
