Following the Army Corps' announcement, Energy Transfer Partners won't back down from the DAPL, proving that protesters still have a lot of work ahead of them to ensure a pipeline isn't built underneath the Standing Rock Sioux's water source. Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way. The strongly-worded press release also touches on an important aspect of the protesters' supposed victory: that rather than legally stopping the pipeline, the announcement on Dec. 4 merely stalls the pipeline's initial trajectory until President Obama leaves office in January. ETP's statement in response to the DAPL decision at best promises major pushback to a move made by the sitting president, and at worst implies potential defiance of a major political decision (albeit one that isn't legally-binding). With its use of right-wing language, his statement is a dog whistle to the many pro-DAPL Republicans who are attempting to shoehorn a human rights issue into the realm of electoral politics. The bottom line of ETP's press release is clear: not even the president can stop them from completing the Dakota Access Pipeline in its original form. Below is the full text of the press release. This is nothing new from this Administration, since over the last four months the Administration has demonstrated by its action and inaction that it intended to delay a decision in this matter until President Obama is out of office. For more than three years now, Dakota Access Pipeline has done nothing but play by the rules. The Army Corps of Engineers agrees, and has said so publicly and in federal court filings. In spite of consistently stating at every turn that the permit for the crossing of the Missouri River at Lake Oahe granted in July 2016, comported with all legal requirements, including the use of an environmental assessment, rather than an environmental impact statement, the Army Corps now seeks to engage in additional review and analysis of alternative locations for the pipeline. As stated all along, ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe. Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way. news that the Army Corps of Engineers will block current plans for the Dakota Access Pipeline that place it near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation and under Lake Oahe, the groups behind the pipeline announced that they intend to complete the pipeline without rerouting. bottom line of ETP's press release is clear: not even the president can stop them from completing the Dakota Access Pipeline in its original form. more than three years now, Dakota Access Pipeline has done nothing but play by the rules.
