In this post, I speak to the magic and power of practicing meaningful solidarity. I share some personal stories, many links, and five steps for acting in beloved community in the Trump age. Dano T. Bob beautifully showcases the heart magic of solidarity in their writing against a once-proposed coal terminal in West Oakland, CA. That's how love works in the public eye. You show yourself for who you are; you don't hide behind lies, policies, or distortions. She says, solidarity is the new I love you. Like Dano T. Bob, who I don't know personally, and Mollie Costello, who is one of my heart sisters, people like us are everywhere. We're soul warriors. We have radical collective intelligence. We feel the power of direct community engagement. We are true love. Let me break this down for you in clear steps in case the learning is a bit hard to grasp. 2. Have faith, as in Spirit or Wakan Tanka as the Lakota say. Here's how my faith manifested for this post: I've been musing about this post for about 24 hours, recalling anecdotes and related learnings about unity, about beloved community, about practicing meaningful solidarity. Yet, when I sat down to write, these words came to me fast and soft, solidarity is the new I love you. 3. Act to the tune of your heart's calling. For me, answering the sacred calling of this phrase was to use the magic of the internet to find Shonda Roberts' on the webs of Anansi. That is what lead me to Dano T. Bob. I don't know them, so I'm using a gender pronoun that speaks to all peoples without assumption. I also want to ensure that linking myself to them is directly reflective of my dedication to love, peace, and justice. In reading a few of Dano T. Bob's posts, I feel confident in connecting to their blog posts. Using YouTube, I found this video of Virgil TakenAlive. It wasn't until the fourth time seeing the video that I was able to focus on their last names, TakenAlive. Just writing those words, these words, brings tears to my eyes. Now they spill. 5. StayWoke. My eyes are open, much like my soul. Yours can be too. You can use the power of your heart and the magic of the internet to see truth through delusion. We are at the biggest political fiesta of all time, of end times. May no more peoples be taken alive and put to death at the hands of the State and the schools who sustain violence. Stand with us.
