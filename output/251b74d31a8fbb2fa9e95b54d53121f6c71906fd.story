FILE PHOTO: Construction equipment sits near a Dakota Access Pipeline construction site off County Road 135 near the town of Cannon Ball, North Dakota, U.S. on October 30, 2016. The company said environmentalists approached the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, the public face of the months-long fight against the pipeline, and used it to wage a battle against the project. Last year it represented Resolute Forest Products in a defamation lawsuit brought by the global logging company against Greenpeace. The case is Energy Transfer Equity LP v. Greenpeace International, 17-cv-173, U.S. District Court, District of North Dakota (Bismark).
