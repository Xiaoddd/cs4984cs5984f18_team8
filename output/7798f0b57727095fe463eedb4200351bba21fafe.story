LaDuke told Tilton that he should represent a man named Charlie Thayer, who had gotten himself arrested while protesting the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline project. Around the same time, a friend from Bemidji independently contacted Tilton with the exact same message. After that, he went to law school, became the first convicted felon to be admitted to the state bar, and hung up a shingle in St. Paul, where he has since specialized in medical malpractice and personal injury law. After agreeing to represent Thayer, Tilton wound up taking on more pipeline protestors as clients, travelling to North Dakota four times over the course of the fall. To help alleviate the stress on the court system, Tilton figured it would make sense to get himself admitted to the North Dakota bar. As it turns out, that proved to be an unexpectedly onerous undertaking. Although Tilton was granted a temporary North Dakota law license back in October, he learned earlier this month that his application for full admittance to the bar remained incomplete. Tilton was also informed by letter that a failure to provide a timely response to the outstanding issues on his application could delay approval by as much as six months. In contrast to that process, the admission to the federal bar in North Dakota is a cakewalk. According to Tilton, it took him less than a half hour to complete the application, which was approved within a matter of days. Frustrated, Tilton decided to switch course and drafted a petition to the North Dakota Supreme Court, asking the court to relax its rules on an emergency basis and adopt the federal model for admission. Co-signers to the petition include Tim Purdon, the former U.S. Attorney for North Dakota and now a partner at Robins Kaplan, Bruce Nestor, a Minneapolis criminal defense lawyer and past president of the National Lawyers Guild, and six North Dakota attorneys. According to the petition, the most pressing problem is the relatively tiny number of criminal defense lawyers who are licensed to practice in North Dakota. He also pointed out there are practical (and entirely non-political) reasons for the court to grant the petition.
