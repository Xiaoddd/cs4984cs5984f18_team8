But it will also set alarm bells ringing. It was argued that the pipeline threatened to contaminate the local water supply and traverse sacred burial grounds. After a prolonged showdown between protesters and the police, the Obama administration announced the pipeline would be rerouted in December.

The provincial government was notified about the latest spill late in the afternoon on Friday, and 170,000 litres have since been recovered, said Doug McKnight, assistant deputy minister in the Ministry of the Economy, which regulates pipelines in Saskatchewan. It comes seven months after another major incident in Saskatchewan, in which a Husky Energy Inc pipeline leaked 225,000 litres into a major river and cut off the drinking water supply for two cities. Mr McKnight said Tundra Energy Marketing Inc, which has a line adjacent to the spill, is leading cleanup efforts.

Ocean Man Chief Connie Big Eagle said the spill was 15 metres (50 feet) in diameter on Friday. Ocean Man has 540 residents, one-third of whom live on the reserve, Big Eagle said. She said an area resident who had smelled the scent of oil for a week located the spill and alerted her on Friday. The chief said there are no homes near the spill but it is about 400 metres (1,320 feet) from the local cemetery. Yes, submit this vote Cancel You must be logged in to vote.
