By Brady Dennis Brady Dennis Reporter focusing on environmental policy and public health issues Email Bio Follow April 30, 2017 Thousands of protesters turned out in Washington on April 29 to voice concern over climate change. The large-scale demonstration marked the 100th day of President Trump's first 100 days in office. Protesters had chanted and sung, carried clever signs, Snapchatted and tweeted their way down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Now, the streets of Washington were quiet. The crowds had mostly gone home. Trump was still in the White House. Republicans still controlled Congress. Part of the answer, they hoped, was in this room. They would spend the day learning the ins and outs of running for office at every level of government, from fundraising to organizing to connecting with voters. Rather, he said it also was intended to jump-start the building of a stronger, more diverse, more strategic environmental movement. That includes training candidates for office at the local, state and national level. It also includes amplifying the voices of people in minority and indigenous communities who have been disproportionately affected by pollution and global warming. And, ultimately, it includes persuading elected officials that their constituents care deeply about environmental issues. But he added that change is possible, even during an administration that is less than friendly to environmental causes. He pointed to the Richard Nixon era, when widespread anger over pollution, smog and unsafe water prompted the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. They certainly have their work cut out for them. The administration has announced it will reconsider stricter fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks. It has approved two major oil pipelines, Dakota Access and Keystone XL, that President Barack Obama had halted. An office that focuses on environmental justice issues would vanish. So would the Energy Star program. The White House has yet to say whether it intends to pull the nation out of the Paris climate accord, under which almost every country agreed in 2015 to begin slashing emissions of carbon dioxide to slow global warming. Even if the United States technically remains part of the international agreement, it almost certainly will no longer play the leading role it did under Obama. Back inside Union Station on Sunday, the talk was more of local action than global action. But that remaining on the sidelines was no longer an option.
