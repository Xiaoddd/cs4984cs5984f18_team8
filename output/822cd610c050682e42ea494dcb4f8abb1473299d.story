Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This Declaration was Ratified by the United Nations. When it was Decided in 2007, Canada was one of 4 Nations who SPECIFICALLY voted against UNDRIP, in addition to 11 other nations who abstained. Still, even though Justin Trudeau has been elected, because of this and other promises he has since Broken, Trudeau has yet to live up to this commitment. This is unacceptable. Mr Trudeau loves standing in front of Cameras, being adorned with our Ceremonial Headdress by First Nations chiefs who have had the wool pulled over their eyes. As a Mohawk Canadian I am not blind nor ignorant to the fact that a Man's Trustworthiness is only as good as the promises he Keeps, or breaks. If Justin Trudeau wants any support in 2019, he will implement UNDRIP as soon as the ink is dry on this petition.
