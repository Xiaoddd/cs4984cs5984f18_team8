A three-judge panel with the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Friday to uphold a 2015 federal court decision on a lawsuit filed by the New Orleans-based Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East (SLFPA-E) in 2013. Shell, Chevron and BP are among the major industry defendants named in the suit, along with 94 other oil and gas companies the SLFPA-E blames for widespread destruction of the state's coastal wetlands through the construction of exploration and production canals. The state has seen its sea level rise about twice as fast as the global rate in the last 50 years, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Without healthy wetlands to provide a buffer from storms and sea level rise, coastal Louisiana may cease to exist. The appeals court also agreed with US District Court Judge Nannette Jolivette Brown's 2015 ruling that the SLFPA-E failed to prove the companies had a duty under federal law to address damage from their operations, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Brown also ruled that the SLFPA-E's levees were located too far away from industry damage done by drilling. The authority claims industry activity has left the area more susceptible to flooding and hurricane damage based on weakened levees. The oil and gas industry has admitted to 36 percent of wetland erosion, while the US Department of Interior previously said the industry is to blame for anywhere from 15-59 percent of the damage. Louisiana's oil and gas industry, a major source of power in the much-drilled state, has fought the suit with claims of frivolity and malice. A number of similar lawsuits against the industry are still outstanding. Parishes that have sued over coastland destruction include Cameron, Jefferson, Plaquemines, St. Bernard and Vermilion, according to the Times-Picayune. Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards has promised to file more lawsuits as well. Louisiana officials said the appeals court ruling will likely not affect various parish lawsuits against the industry, the Times-Picayune reported, which are based on provisions of the state Coastal Resources Management Act and not federal law. Former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, a Republican, led the fight against the SLFPA-E lawsuit, encouraging and signing a legislation in 2014 that aimed to block oil and gas lawsuits. That legislation was later ruled unconstitutional in state court. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.
