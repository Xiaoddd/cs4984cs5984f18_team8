The company originally predicted spills larger than 1,000 barrels of oil would occur no more than once every 100 years. TransCanada's operating permit may be revoked if South Dakota's Public Utilities Commission finds the pipeline is not up to license standards. Loading... November 27, 2017 By Valerie Volcovici and Richard Valdmanis Reuters TransCanada Corp's existing Keystone pipeline has leaked substantially more oil, and more often, in the United States than indicated in risk assessments the company provided to regulators before the project began operating in 2010, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. The Canadian company is now seeking to expand the pipeline system linking Alberta's oil fields to US refineries with its proposed Keystone XL project, which has President Trump's backing. The existing 2,147-mile Keystone system from Hardisty, Alberta, to the Texas coast has had three significant leaks in the United States since it began operating in 2010, including a 5,000-barrel spill this month in rural South Dakota, and two others, each about 400 barrels, in South Dakota in 2016 and North Dakota in 2011. Keystone XL: 5 basic things you should know The spill risk analysis was conducted by global risk management company DNV GL. A spokesman for DNV did not respond to a request for comment. Members of South Dakota's Public Utilities Commission told Reuters last week they could revoke TransCanada's operating permit if an initial probe of last week's spill shows it violated the terms of the license. Those terms include requirements for standards for construction, regular inspections of pipeline infrastructure, and other environmental safeguards. TransCanada shut a section of the line while it cleans up the leak, which occurred near the town of Aberdeen on Nov. 16. An official did not respond to a request for comment. The spill took place days before regulators in neighboring Nebraska approved a route for TransCanada's proposed Keystone XL pipeline through the state, lifting the last major regulatory hurdle for the expansion that has been delayed for years by environmental opposition. Mr. Trump handed TransCanada a presidential permit for Keystone XL in March, reversing former President Barack Obama's decision to reject the line on economic and environmental grounds, saying that it would create jobs and boost national security. It estimated that spills exceeding 1,000 barrels would occur at a rate of once per century. This story was reported by Reuters.
