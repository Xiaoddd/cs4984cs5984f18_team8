Tribal leaders and their lawyers intend to stand their ground. In December, the US Army Corps of Engineers denied pipeline builder Energy Transfer Partners the necessary permission to build the Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe in North Dakota, and called for additional environmental review of pipeline routes. The decision arrived after months of protests and legal action led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which contended that the pipeline threatened a key water source. The tribe also argued that consultations around the pipeline, promised in treaties, were left out of the initial pipeline planning. The immediate path at forward for the pipeline is not clear. She believes a rapid reversal of this decision could raise legal questions. In 2015 the Obama administration rejected the Keystone XL pipeline, which was due to carry crude oil 1,179 miles from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska, after years of debate. The State Department denied the permit to builder TransCanada, saying the project did not benefit the national interests of the US in terms of jobs or contributions to the economy, and also presented an environmental threat. The administration's support of both projects cheered petroleum industry supporters. Environmental groups that fought both projects strongly condemned the executive orders Tuesday. The groups argued that the decisions flouted treaty rights to tribes, and risked accelerated harm to citizens and the climate. Submit it here.
