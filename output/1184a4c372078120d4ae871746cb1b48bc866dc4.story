Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Dallas-based billionaire and CEO of Energy Transfer Partners has been making headlines for fast-tracking a 1100 mile crude oil pipeline across the Midwest and under the Missouri River, just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. No environmental impact assessment, no respect for cultural sites, and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river. A similar story is unfolding out in West Texas, where Warren's company has split through the pristine Big Bend region with the 200 mile Comanche Trail Pipeline and nearly-complete 143 mile Trans Pecos Pipeline. Sadly, many of the governor-appointed representatives of the TPW Commission have often proven ill-fit to stand as a true representation of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. In particular, the personal interests held by chairman Kelcy Warren DO NOT line up with the TPWD mission statement and threaten the agency's integrity. In Texas, despite ongoing protest, Warren's Trans Pecos and Comanche Trail pipelines have used eminent domain to cut through the heart of the beloved Big Bend region to export natural gas into Mexico. Such a wide pathway over these 143 and 200 mile pipelines destroys a massive area of habitat. Further, Warren's pipelines are being installed to service the growing natural gas industry of West Texas. The intense fracking planned for the region threatens underground water sources and stands to transform the iconic West Texas desert forever. The desert ecology has not been the only thing damaged in construction, in September, ETP bulldozed the 5000 year old Trap Springs archaeological site in Brewster County. I am asking Governor Greg Abbott, and Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn to remove Kelcy Warren from the TPW Commission, or for Warren to step down under his own power. Warren has brought nothing but bad attention to TPWD and it is in the best interest of the agency to operate without him as a commissioner. I write this out of love for our beautiful Big Bend and Trans Pecos regions. I, like many other people, draw so much inspiration from this land. I do not want to see the future of our wild places left in the hands of corporate interest, so let us keep these interests separated from the agency's that are here to help preserve and protect it.

April of 2016, the Standing Rock Sioux have been organizing to stop a pipeline that would cross the Missouri River a mile away from their reservation. Their work has helped bring to light a broader movement of people standing up to pipeline and oil projects that they feel threaten their safety and that of the environment. Though proponents of the pipeline argue that it would be perfectly safe, impacted communities point to the hundreds of pipeline leaks and breaks that have happened over the past year as proof that it is too risky. needs you. has already take action for orca whales. orcas are starving to death. horses in Texas need your help in 100 degree weather.
