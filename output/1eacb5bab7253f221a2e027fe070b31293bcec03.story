Dakota Access, LLC has stated in court filings that oil could flow as soon as Monday, March 20, 2017. A briefing schedule on the merits of the appeal has not yet been set. The fact that the Lakota people are here today is because our ancestors never gave up. They always fought for us and for our future. We owe it to them and to our grandchildren to stand up and fight now. The district court will be considering those issues in the near future. The court still has to consider our treaty and trust arguments, which we think are very strong. Share this: Twitter Facebook Email Like this: Like Loading...

To me that is just a given and expected. What is it going to take for the Federal government, politicians, and big oil companies to realize what is happening to the water and land is a real problem. Every citizen of The United States of America should be up in arms about what is happening without much not happening. Well, that no longer applies with our government. The people in government as well as the big oil companies need to seriously think about is the future lives of their children, grand children, and all families after that. If the government and big oil companies do not stop the pipelines there will not be any safe water to drink, cook, bathe, animals. It is so difficult for me to believe that our government cares more about GREED than their lives and all family lives. account. Notify me of new posts via email.
