The judge issued her ruling before a packed courtroom with nearly 100 spectators inside and more than a dozen others waiting outside the doors. Cliven Bundy's lawyer put his arm around his client. Supporters held hands, wiped tears from their eyes and hugged. The dismissal with prejudice, meaning prosecutors can't seek a new trial, marked an embarrassing nadir for the government, which now has failed to convict the Bundys in two major federal cases stemming from separate armed standoffs. Document: Transcript of Judge's ruling The second stunning victory for the Bundys and their followers may serve to bolster their fight against federal control of public land, but it's not clear how their movement has fared. The three have spent most of the last two years in jail. But he promised to keep working for his cause. The government authorities were acting on a court order filed after Cliven Bundy failed to pay grazing fees and fines for two decades. Outnumbered, the federal contingent retreated and halted the cattle impoundment on April 12, 2014. Prosecutors and the lead FBI agents in the case quietly sat listening to the judge's ruling. They didn't make any statements in court. The government may appeal the dismissal. The prosecution team in recent weeks added a new assistant U.S. attorney, Elizabeth White, the chief appellate lawyer in the Nevada U.S. Attorney's Office. Attorney General Jeff Sessions also sent an evidence discovery expert to the federal prosecutors' office in Las Vegas to review the case. Public land advocates fear the fumbling of the Nevada case, following the 2016 jury acquittals of the Bundy brothers and others in the armed takeover of the Oregon wildlife refuge, will buoy the Bundys' claims of federal government overreach and embolden militias to engage in future showdowns over who has authority over public land. Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League, decried the government's mistakes and also predicted similar confrontations in the future. The judge on Dec. 20 had declared a mistrial in the case after finding prosecutors withheld six types of evidence from defendants, representing at least 1,000 pages of documents, that should have been shared at least a month before the trial started in November. She said then that she would consider whether to dismiss the case outright or allow a new trial. On Monday, she spent a half-hour delivering a scathing assessment of the prosecution's and the FBI's conduct as she tossed out the charges. Just before the hearing, Ryan Bundy led relatives and supporters in prayer in the courtroom corridor, even saying a prayer for the judge. ... Father in heaven, we need our father home. Ammon Bundy, holding black bound copies of the Bible and the Book of Mormon, called his wife and said he was heading back to Emmett, Idaho. He also plans to celebrate his youngest child's birthday. The boy, Elias, turned 3 on Monday and Bundy missed the first two birthdays while he was in custody or at the Malheur refuge. Ammon and Ryan Bundy have been out of jail since November, when they were allowed to stay in private homes under GPS monitoring. But their father declined to be released then because he said other defendants remained behind bars. After the dismissal, Cliven Bundy tried to walk out of the courtroom in his blue jail garb and ankle shackles but was blocked by deputy marshals. He was released soon after, wearing a cowboy hat, gray tweed blazer and cowboy boots. He took hugs and handshakes from supporters. Payne was ordered to report to the U.S. Marshal's Service. He remained on GPS monitoring and home detention late Monday. He'll appear by phone in a hearing Tuesday with Oregon's U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown to determine if he'll be held while awaiting sentencing in the refuge case. Co-defendants convicted during two earlier Bunkerville trials are likely to seek the dismissal of their cases through appeals, arguing that they went to trial without the evidence that came out piecemeal during this trial. But defendants still awaiting trial -- Cliven Bundy's sons Melvin Bundy and Dave Bundy, Jason Woods and Joseph O'Shaughnessy -- are in a different category. The judge ruled that they couldn't join their father and brothers' motion to dismiss the charges because they failed to demonstrate how the prosecution's violations harmed their rights. The deadlines for the government's sharing of evidence hasn't expired yet for their cases, and the judge set their trial date for Feb. 26. Lead prosecutor Steven Myhre wrote in a court brief that he and his colleagues believed the court's restrictions barring self-defense arguments during the earlier Nevada standoff trials meant his team didn't have to share information about certain aspects of the law enforcement response. Myhre until last week served as Nevada's acting U.S. attorney but is now back in his earlier role as first assistant U.S. attorney. She said they waited too long to provide FBI and other agency reports, tactical logs and maps on surveillance, including the location of a camera and snipers, outside the Bundy ranch; threat assessments that indicated the Bundys weren't violent; and nearly 500 pages of U.S. Bureau of Land Management internal affairs documents that included paperwork indicating that cattle grazing hadn't threatened the desert tortoise, considered an endangered species. One government witness under cross-examination by Ryan Bundy, for example, acknowledged watching live-feed video images from an FBI surveillance camera and another referenced a 2012 FBI threat assessment that determined the Bundys weren't likely to be violent. They urged dismissal, saying it was the only remedy for the government's callous disregard of its constitutional obligations to share any potentially favorable evidence with the defense. Cliven Bundy's lawyer said he took no joy in seeing other lawyers getting rebuked for misconduct, but called the judge's ruling the right one. All rights reserved (About Us).
