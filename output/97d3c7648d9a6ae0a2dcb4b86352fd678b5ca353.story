After news spread of the approval of the Dakota Access Pipeline, hundreds and then thousands of Indigenous people and Indigenous allies from across the globe came together to pray peacefully and bring attention to the disgraceful work of Energy Transfer Partners and those who approved the Dakota Access Pipeline project. Today, thousands are living at the encampment and they will not leave until the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline stops. ABOUT THE MOVEMENT: After the failed Keystone Pipeline, a new and virtually regulation free Dakota Access Pipeline was approved. Energy Transfer Partners was awarded the right to build a pipeline. The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) will be built on top of several burial grounds and sacred sites - some of which have already been decimated by Energy Transfer Partners employees back in September. Energy Transfer Partners plans to build the pipeline under the Missouri River which is the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Reservation and several outlying communities. Billions of dollars (in some cases taxpayer dollars) have been spent on cleaning up messes left behind by oil companies. Leaks and spills have ravaged communities and their water supply in the wake of these spills. CALL TO ACTION: It is time to stop looking to oil and fracking companies to solve our energy problems. It is time to respect Native holy sites which are now being destroyed by big corporations which seem to care more about money than respect for our earth and the generations to follow. We have been working with a group of people within the Sicangu Camp (a camp within Sacred Stone) who have dedicated their lives to this encampment until the day this pipeline is stopped. We reached out to our friends at the front line and asked them what would help them the most as they brave the winter. THE ACTION: Our goal is to raise funds to purchase ten large wind and weatherproof tents, woodstoves to be used inside the tents, firewood, and hand cranked laundry machines for the encampment. With these weatherproof tents and woodstoves, peaceful protectors will have a space to gather, sleep, eat and keep warm during the frigid cold North Dakota winter. Having a hand-cranked washing machine wringer will help those who are camping stay clean. Once we are able to supply the camp with the warmth of tents, stoves and wood, we'll send the washing units. Please help us spread the word. Every little bit helps. We are happy to provide receipts for all transactions. I had the chance to go to Standing Rock last weekend and see the tents in person. They're spread all over the place so it's a little hard to track all of them down, but we checked in with security and asked them to point out which ones came from our contacts who were getting them to camp. (Pictures coming next) The load of wood from S. Dakota was headed to the encampment last Friday. We were there to watch people chopping it. We're waiting to hear back form an elder who was in camp earlier this week to hear what the need might be. We are thinking with the extra funds raised, we may see if we can send another load of wood. We are going to do a full accounting of the funds that were spent and share them with the community of donors. This way it's very clear and transparent. We hope to have that up in the next week once the last two tents get to camp. Thank you to each and every one of you who has taken the time to give to this campaign. Thank you to everyone who shared this campaign. I was absolutely floored by your generosity. A lot of people are asking what's next for Standing Rock. Here's a little write-up right after the announcement regarding the denied permit. Please keep your eyes on this issue. It's far from over and Standing Rock needs our support now more than ever. It's on hold and could move forward with the next administration. There are many who will remain in camp until this protection act is completely finished and Energy Transfer Partners moves out completely. Keep in mind - this company didn't care about the recommendation to stop construction by our President and the Army Corp of Engineers. Please continue to support the encampment and keep your eyes on the native news outlets as the mainstream media will likely die down again. Last but not least, there were a lot of politicians working to make this happen - people we called over and over again to hear our concerns. Please consider making a thank you call to their offices. All my love and support to those on the ground and those who have worked so hard to get this far. Let's keep working and see this action through. We have two more tents to go and the weather has been dropping quickly. The first snow hit yesterday and it's dipping down to 12 degrees at night on Friday. Our goal is to have them sent out by next week. This area is not under threat of being shut down. We truly appreciate your help with this effort in keeping our protectors warm through the winter. Let's make one final push and get these tents out to Standing Rock. Here's an update: As I mentioned in the previous update, the tents were on sale at Cabela's, so we were able to order an extra stove for the children's school at Oceti Sakowin. It arrived yesterday with a few relatives from Rosebud. We purchased a stove with a handy hot water heater on the side of the stove in order to make the heat last longer. They can also use the hot water for things like hand washing, etc. The first tent and stove unit is now in camp and I'm told we'll get some photos as soon as they get back on the grid with better WiFi reception. We'll post this as soon as it's available. We've ordered five more tents and five stove units which are heading to the Cabela's store at the moment. We have a friend heading to Rapid City for the pick-up next week and they should arrive in camp by the 10th. Thank you everyone who has helped us get this far. Warmth is coming to the encampment thanks to your support. Also, some good news is coming out of camp today. Again, THANK YOU to the donors and everyone who has shared this page. We really appreciate your help. GOOD NEWS: The tents are now on sale at Cabela's. We received word the school within the encampment is really needing warmth and they were hoping for a wood stove of their own. Thank you to EVERYONE who has donated or shared this fundraiser. Please keep sharing. We've received gifts from as far away as Australia and as nearby as our neighbors across the street. We'll send photos as soon the wood stoves and tents are set-up in camp.
