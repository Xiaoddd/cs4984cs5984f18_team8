President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said he supports the project. Boyt served in the Army and the National Guard from 1994 to 2004, including a tour in Iraq. He said he will be with veterans from all branches and many eras of the military. He said the veterans would serve as human shields against attempts by oil company security or police to mace, gas or shoot rubber bullets at the protesters. As military veterans, he said, they are trained to withstand such force. He said he planned to start his journey Friday night and arrive at the Standing Rock reservation mid-afternoon Saturday. Boyt is a real estate agent, a position that requires a lot of interaction with the public. Boyt called the pipeline illegal and said the company building the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, has flouted Environmental Protection Agency regulations. Boyt said he planned to return to Columbia on Thursday. As he prepared for his trip, a group of activists expressed their support of the protesters and displeasure with the pipeline in the Speakers Circle on the University of Missouri campus. Crystal DeShazo, of Columbia, was one of the organizers. A founder of a new local group called Protectors of Water and Land, she returned Sunday from the Standing Rock reservation. DeShazo said this weekend was her second time at Standing Rock and the camp site was three times as large as it was on her first visit. She said the activists were preparing both for threats from authorities and the harsh weather. Laura Wacker, of Columbia, was at Standing Rock from Nov. 13-17 representing Mid-Missouri Peaceworks. Perry Bigsoldier, of Columbia, is another founder of Protectors of Water and Land. He also is a member of the Sac and Fox tribe and the Otoe tribe. He said he went to the Standing Rock reservation Oct. 10-14, taking supplies, clothing, food and building materials. He said he knows he is on the winning side of the fight.
