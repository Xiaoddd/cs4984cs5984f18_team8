A statement from the Fearless Frontline Agitators. Originally published by Anarchist News Note: Enough is Enough is not organizing any of these events, we are publishing them for people across the US and Europe to be able to see what is going on. As the military, police, private DAPL workers,security and investors have encroached upon and attacked inhabitants on and near Standing Rock Dakota Territory, we must encroach upon and stop their activities utilizing many creative methods of resistance. We are collectives of indigenous and non-indigenous water protectors calling upon homies and accomplices to do whatever it takes to chop the head off of this black snake. Public opinion and the privileged liberal myth of voting with your dollar are NOT going to win the day. We are here to protect our communities,NOT please the mainstream media. We also recognize that corporations and the military industrial complex are responsible for the vast majority of worldwide pollution, NOT individuals or any one group of people. The most violent thing we can do is to allow construction to continue uninterrupted; it is only a matter of WHEN, NOT IF the pipeline bursts, and by then it will be too late. We are setting a precedent for the world, and the kinds of communities that we want to build and live in. In the spirit of Sitting Bull, stand up with strong hearts, help dismantle peace police and liberal disease mentality; these modes and positions of privilege only reinforce our collective enemies and the fascists systems they uphold, and the rich and elite few that they protect. May prayer and strategic direct action collide as one. Embrace harmony not unity- we do NOT all have to do the same thing or sing the same notes to be a part of the same song of resistance. Let actions and protests also send the message that we will not acquiesce to tyranny or accept Trump as President, nor recognize decisions made by IRA tribal council leaders.

Finding The Real Everyone talks about spring and summer being the outdoor months, and as much as I adore the cycles of nature, this is truly the time to get yourselves out of doors and immerse yourself in nature. This is the time to learn of nature and all of the hidden delights. Large militant antifascist mobilisation in London. October 13.
