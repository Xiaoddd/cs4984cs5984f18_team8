But on a Sunday, word came that the US Army Corps of Engineers was withdrawing permission to build the Dakota Access pipeline under the Missouri river, just above the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Many on social media cautioned that this was not the Santa-is-real everything-is-OK-forever victory and we should not celebrate. But the people most involved seemed to realize that this is not necessarily the end of the road, but a really great milestone. But it might be a really big victory, and mid-January might be too late to salvage some of what the frenzied pipeline builders were hoping for as they raced toward their deadlines. Global oil prices began to collapse just a few months after shippers committed to using DAPL, and market forecasters do not expect prices to regain 2014 levels for at least a decade.

False omniscience is a habit that makes people as politically destructive as they are personally annoying, and plenty of people made pronouncements about what was going to happen and what would never happen at Standing Rock that turned out to be wrong. Another is standing up for what you believe in, even when victory seems remote to impossible. Sunday was the pipeline victory. Monday was the 61st anniversary of the beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott. Surely more than integrating the public transit system. They could hardly have expected that they would help launch a movement that not only changed the nation and led to national legislation, but offered a toolbox of nonviolent strategies and visions to the world, used in South Africa and Egypt, in Czechoslovakia and the Philippines. They bet that the future would be different than the past and did everything to make it so. Consequences are often indirect. The movement at Standing Rock may yet stop a pipeline. Whether it does or not, it has brought together perhaps the greatest single gathering of native North Americans (from Canada as well as the United States) ever, and that has been a profound and moving watershed for the affirmation of cultural identities and political rights. It has demonstrated yet again that the environmental movement and human rights campaigns are often inseparable, reminded us that worldwide, indigenous people are in the forefront of the climate movement. Many things we cannot foresee may come of this gathering and its vision, tactics and power. In this moment of rightwing and white supremacist triumphalism, we are hearing a lot about hate crimes: beatings, insults, swastikas, threats and the rest. But also rising into view is another America: the people who stand up for racial justice, for the vulnerable, for women and LGBT people, for science, for nature and for democracy. Standing Rock prefigured and modeled those possibilities and was radiant with this beauty. I went to Standing Rock in early September, when the weather was delightful and the landscape green. The people who persevered into this brutal winter were heroic, enduring harsh conditions and risking bodily safety for the wellbeing of the river, the tribal rights and their principles. Sometimes in direct ways, when we remake history. And on Sunday the people there and those protesting in banks, writing letters, sending donations, organizing marches around the country won something worth celebrating. We are facing a lot of trouble on all fronts. Standing Rock reminds us to come together and stand up to it. Please choose your username under which you would like all your comments to show up.
