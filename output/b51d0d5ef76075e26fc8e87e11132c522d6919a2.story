There is smoke in the air this morning from sage and cedar burning on the sacred fire at the mouth of Oceti Sakowin. The tear gas has cleared from the air since the assault on water protectors by militarized police, the national guard and private contractors a few nights ago on the bridge on Highway 1806. OPINION: How the Fight for Water Unites Palestine and Dakota At Standing Rock, the weather drops below freezing at night, with frost collecting on the inside of the tents; cell phone signals are blocked or severely diminished across the camp, coupled with the dubious draining of cell phone batteries and erratic electronic function. It is very hard to get information out across the airwaves, even through a simple text message or phone call. Surveillance is high: helicopters fly low overhead, with crop dusters circling the camp every few hours and there is a distinct whir of company and camp drones all hours of the day and night. Today, however, songs of prayer and ceremony fill the air at the Sacred Fire and they almost drown out the noise of the engines overhead. Thingstaken morning. However, the real events of that day did not mark peace but marked the ongoing plague of settler-colonialism and genocide of the Indigenous people of the Americas. In the wake of first contact with the pilgrims and European explorers, peoples, things, cultures, and land, were all consequently diminished or exterminated. While many people, even those at Standing Rock, will participate in some sort of collective meal to mark the holiday, there are many who will be fasting and mourning. Dorothy Sun Bear of Wounded Knee, South Dakota has been running the Wild Ogalala kitchen with her family since August. She feeds hundreds of people a day but will be making a point to fast on Thingstaken. While others celebrate and cook, we should pray and fast. Tipi with portrait and quote of Sitting Bull on the side. Approximately 400 years have passed since the Pilgrims reached Plymouth Rock and began taking things from one America to build another. Many of the children and grandchildren of those who resisted colonization spoke about their journeys to Standing Rock, their purpose for remaining here and how the Seventh Generation of Indigenous youth can take their things back. He spoke of his purpose for arriving at the camp and for remaining in the struggle against DAPL. This is personal for me. My great-grandfather was chief gall of Standing Rock. I was lost until I came here. As Native youth, many of us have lost our way. We used to know ourselves and we need to know ourselves again. We are all connected. RELATED: Police Unleash Military-Style Assault on Standing Rock Protesters Many elders have returned to Standing Rock to support the protectors who are working tirelessly on the ground. Darlene Meguinis of the Blackfoot Nation, who was a key organizer in the Idle No More movement in Canada, told me that she came back to Standing Rock to support the elders, the youth and the Indigenous women on the frontlines of Indigenous empowerment and community building. She is not alone. Bettina Castagno of the Mohawk Nation came back to Standing Rock after her first visit in late summer to open up a small kitchen and community center in Oceti Sakowin. She was happy to see so many people returning to camp. You see them here, hugging. I want people to see how many different people are represented here, how many nations, spirits, traditions and languages. she commented. People jeered at me, called me names. Colonization did not stop with reservations and partitions, it continues today and is embodied in the blindness through which so many people in the U.S. celebrate Thanksgiving without acknowledgment of the histories and resilience of the people that were suppressed by that narrative of normalization. We know who we are and where we belong and it is here. When you are getting maced and beaten, sing your song. Though these threads of disempowerment persist nationally through structural, social, and political violence, Standing Rock has become too big to ignore. Today, on Thingstaken, a whole camp of peoples sing their songs, dance together and honor their continuation of life. RELATED: 'It's Not About Me, It's About Indigenous Peoples': Wilansky While many of us who are not Indigenous to Turtle Island, may be struggling around reframing a popularized colonial holiday, there are swaths of Indigenous people who heed no pause in reclaiming Thingstaken through education and narratives by and for Indigenous people. Mother Earth is grounding: she takes your pain and turns it into something powerful. The pain brought by DAPL is just the latest manifestation of the black snake. We must take care of Mother Earth and her people. For all of those with eyes on Standing Rock this Thingstaken, pay attention to the Native voices that are speaking up. Bear witness to resistance: be a part of it, observe it, and contribute to it. Those who have been taken from are here to lift up their cultures, their languages, their land, and their people. If we do not hear them, then we are not paying attention; to truly give thanks for our livelihoods here on Turtle Island, we must listen to the Native peoples of this land and we must act for due justice with their guidance.
