The Industrial Commission, which discussed Skarphol's request during a meeting Thursday, Dec. 8, is taking steps to strengthen state requirements regarding royalty statements and could pursue civil or criminal penalties against companies that don't comply. Lynn Helms, director of the Department of Mineral Resources, said his office has received more complaints lately due to the collapse in natural gas prices, which has stressed the economics of recovering and processing natural gas liquids. Most companies switched to fee-based contracts and in many cases the fees exceed the value of the gas, Helms said. North Dakota Century Code says royalty statements must clearly identify the amount of oil or gas sold and the amount and purpose of each deduction made. A state administrative rule has a slightly different approach, requiring companies to provide an explanation of the deductions if the royalty owner submits a certified letter requesting an explanation. Skarphol said he has helped constituents write letters seeking an explanation and received no response. Staff plan to work with companies to get them into compliance, Helms said. If the companies still don't comply, the Industrial Commission would consider issuing a civil complaint or a criminal complaint. Violating the Century Code would be a Class B misdemeanor. Helms said he anticipates someone will introduce a bill addressing the issue of deductions from royalty payments during the 2017 legislative session. The Industrial Commission also directed Helms to proceed during the next rule-making process a change to the administrative rule regarding royalty statements so it's consistent with the Century Code. If royalty owners have questions about whether the statements they receive meet state requirements, Helms suggested they call his office, which is at (701) 328-8020.
