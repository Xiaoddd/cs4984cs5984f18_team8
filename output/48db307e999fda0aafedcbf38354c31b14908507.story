The demonstrators stopped for a short rally in front of a Wells Fargo Bank. Divest L.A. organized Friday's march and rally, singling out the bank for its part in funding the pipeline project. Protesters asked the Los Angeles City Council to do what Seattle did - sever ties with Wells Fargo. President Donald Trump signed an executive order overturning an Obama administration order stopping the construction of the pipeline. Demonstrators said the pipeline goes over sacred Native American land and threatens the water supply to millions of people. Organizers said along with more rallies and marches, they are also planning to lobby members of the City Council and state legislators in Sacramento. All Rights Reserved.
