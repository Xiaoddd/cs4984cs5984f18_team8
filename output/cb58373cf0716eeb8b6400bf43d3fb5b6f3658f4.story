The Army Corps of Engineers plans to shut down a protest camp next week as the nearby Missouri River is expected to flood. Drilling under the river for the pipeline has restarted. Share story By Lynda V. Mapes Seattle Times environment reporter The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to shut down the Dakota Access Pipeline protest camp next week, still inhabited by about 400 opponents to the controversial project. The Army warns the Missouri River nearby is expected to flood and put the camp, used by thousands of protesters, under water. As drilling advances under the river, the two tribes on Monday, arguing the pipeline violates their religious freedom and endangers their water supply and cultural sites, requested a temporary restraining order against further construction. Even if oil starts to flow, tribal leaders have said they will continue to fight the pipeline. The Army plans to close the protest camp on Feb. 22. Construction began last week after Energy Transfer Partners of Dallas, Texas, received the last easement it needed from the Trump administration to complete the final phase of the more than 1,100-mile-long pipeline, drilling under the Missouri River. Both tribes also warned the pipeline could break and pollute the river, which is the source of drinking water for the tribe and millions of people downstream. Cultural sites also are jeopardized by construction, the tribe has warned. An environmental review of the project must be completed, including consideration of alternative routes, both tribes argue in their underlying suit. The pipeline is expected to carry as much as 575,000 barrels of oil a day. Energy Transfer Partners has long argued the pipeline is safer and cheaper than transporting oil by rail or truck. The pipeline has sparked protests since last summer. Police from nine states and 33 agencies have made more than 700 arrests of demonstrators since last August, and used tear gas, rubber bullets and even water during violent clashes this winter.
