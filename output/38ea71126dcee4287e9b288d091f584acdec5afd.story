Many bank customers take advantage of a number of services offered by banks these days, including direct deposit and automatic bill pay, which complicate the process of switching banks. That search should start with looking at what your priorities are for a checking account. Lower fees may mean giving up some benefits your old bank offered, such as a nationwide network of branches. Your Social Security number. An opening deposit in the form of cash, check or payment information, including account number and nine-digit routing number, for an existing bank account with a balance big enough to cover the amount. That last part is key. Switch over direct deposits and bill pay Switching direct deposits and bill pay over to your new bank just takes a bit of paperwork and precise timing. You might need to bring in a canceled check from your new account, but your new account number and routing number may suffice. These steps should be taken in a short time frame to prevent double payments. Do this in person, if possible. To find out whether your checks have cleared, you can compare your check register against your online statement. To put the finishing touches on your checking account transition, shred all the checks and debit cards that came with your old account to prevent them from being used by identity thieves.
