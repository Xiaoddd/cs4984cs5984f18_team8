Instead, it reupped Section 702 for six more years. That will give the government more legal ammunition to defend these programs in court, in Congress, and to the public. It also suggests ways for the NSA to loosen its already lax self-imposed restraints on how it conducts surveillance. Section 702 differs from other foreign surveillance laws because the government can pick targets and conduct the surveillance without a warrant signed by a judge. Selectors are search terms that apply to a target, like an email address, phone number, or other identifier. Under upstream, the NSA relies on Internet providers like AT&T to provide access to large sections of the Internet backbone, intercepting and scanning billions of messages rushing between people and through websites. Until recently, upstream resulted in the collection of communications to, from, or about a selector. Under Section 702, the NSA collects billions of communications, including those belonging to innocent Americans who are not actually targeted. This is why EFF vehemently opposed the Section 702 reauthorization bill that the President recently signed into law. While S. 139 was described by some as a reform, the bill was really a total failure to address the problems with Section 702. This is a staggeringly broad dragnet tactic. If that email address was an NSA selector, your chat could have been collected, too. This was something of a victory, following years of criticism and pressure from civil liberties groups and internal government oversight. But the program suspension rested on technical and legal issues that may change over time, and not a change of heart or a controlling rule. But the new reauthorization codifies this controversial NSA practice. For years, the NSA has pushed its boundaries. The NSA has repeatedly violated its own policies on collection, access, and retention, according to multiple, unsealed FISC opinions. Once collected, these communications are often stored in databases which can be accessed by other agencies in the intelligence community, including the FBI. While that did not stop the FISC from approving backdoor searches under certain circumstances, it did lead other courts to uphold surveillance conducted under Section 702 and ignore whether these searches are constitutional. Under FBI practice, a predicated investigation is a formal, advanced case. By all accounts, though, backdoor searches are normally used far earlier. In other words, the new warrant requirement will rarely, if ever, apply. But following the latest reauthorization, the government will probably argue that Congress gave its OK to the FBI searching sensitive data obtained through NSA spying under Section 702, and using it in criminal cases against Americans. Either way, the latest reauthorization is a massive disappointment. Please check your email for a confirmation link. Oops something is broken right now, please try again later. Instead, the Committee is seeking only the testimony of big tech and Internet access corporations: Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Charter Communications, Google, and Twitter. This often comes up in discussions about leaving a particular social media platform and taking your data with you to a rival service. And as long as you have the first two, the third takes care of itself. EFF and our privacy allies are fighting back. On June 28, California enacted the Consumer Privacy Act (S.B. 375). 375), a well-intentioned but flawed new law that seeks to protect the data privacy of technology users and others by imposing new rules on companies that gather, use, and share personal data.
