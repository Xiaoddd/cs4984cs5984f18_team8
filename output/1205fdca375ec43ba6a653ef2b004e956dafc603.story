However, it intensified this week when a number of protesters were reportedly arrested after chaining themselves to the construction site outside. This comes after the Texas-based natural gas company was served a blow last week, when the US Army Corps of Engineers refused permission for the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross Lake Oahe. Two protesters chained themselves to a gate at the construction of the Trans-Pecos pipeline. A spokeswoman for the Brewster County Sheriff's office however said the protesters were detained, not arrested, reported Reuters. Two Big Bend Defense Coalition protesters were arrested this morning at Trans-Pecos Pipeline protest in Alpine. Similarly to the Standing Rock protesters, the Big Bend Defenders have concerns over water contamination, specifically the the Rio Grande River, which the pipeline would cross and the lack of Environmental Impact studies carried out in line with the project.
