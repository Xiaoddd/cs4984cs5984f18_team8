As a new mother and a strong Dakota woman from the Crow Creek Tribe, eager to defend Native and environmental rights, she was tricked, she said, held captive for two weeks, threatened with knives, a long gun, beaten, raped, forced to kneel on a broomstick, and strangled into submissiveness. She thought she was going to die, but she is one of the rare missing and murdered Indigenous women who was able to escape, she said. The trial for her alleged attacker, Derrick Jonathan Fasig, 24, is set to begin in less than two weeks, on March 26 in Ramsey County. But her family say prosecutors are giving up. Witnesses in the case, which extend to family members and other activists at Standing Rock, have been deemed incompetent or cannot be found. Police promised her justice, she said, and she grudgingly believed them. Today, her hopes are threatened. Charged with kidnapping, Fasig also faces charges of third degree criminal sex conduct, possession of ammunition and a firearm, felony domestic assault, and assault by strangulation. From small-town North Dakota, Williams was a stranger in the big city last May. She originally agreed to the trip thinking others would meet her in St. Paul, from where they would travel north to other anti-pipeline camps. She met Fasig at the train station, she said, and was expecting others to show up. Nobody else arrived. Williams first met Fasig months before at the Standing Rock camps, but she paid little attention to his advances, she said. It was supposed to be a quick weekend trip. He told her that he had been watching her since the Standing Rock camps, Williams said. And the first slap shocked her, Williams said. I think he liked that I talked back. And then he started choking me, for a really long time. At times, Williams said he made her her kneel on a broomstick. Williams asked Fasig to buy the return ticket home, the complaint stated. He refused. Williams brought two cell phones with her that had not been activated. She asked to use his cell phone to call her mother and he again refused, then broke her cell phones, according to the complaint. The next few days slowly turned into a nightmare for Williams. He punched her numerous times in the head and face and body. He kicked her in the back and stomach. He got on top of her and strangled her using both his hands. She said he squeezed so hard that she thought her eyes were going to pop out of her head. She said she could not breathe. He also held a knife to her throat. She stated that nobody else was home during the assaults. Williams tried to escape, but he held her captive, the complaint stated. He began to zip tie her hands with black zip ties during the evening. After the first time that he assaulted her, the sex changed, and he became violent. He pulled her hair extremely hard, slapped and spit on her. She was also confined in a camper, front door locked with a padlock, according to the complaint. Her eventual rescue began when Fasig brought her to the Dakota 38 protest at the Walker Art Center where she saw a friend known as Slyfox. Williams was punched in the back of her head until she said she loved him, she said, and then he would continue until he felt that she meant it. Williams tried to escape on at least seven different occasions, she said. Once, after being ordered to wash the dishes, she examined the windows, but all had screens she could not fit through. Her cell phones were broken, but SlyFox was able to contact her mother, who posted a plea for help on Facebook. She had connections to the American Indian Movement, or AIM, who said they would begin mobilizing immediately to search for her daughter. She remembered telling her mother. Teams of activists and friends began searching for Williams, eliminating known addresses one by one that she could have been taken to, Stoneman said. At one point, Fasig called Stoneman telling her that she could talk to her daughter on May 31 if she took the Facebook post down. She agreed. The criminal complaint stated that Fasig and his family struck back with a live feed of their own, where Williams stated that she was not harmed. But something was missing in the video, Stoneman said. As official and online pressure grew to find Williams, she said she was told to gather her belongings before Fasig allegedly hit her in the back of the head with a wooden rifle, Williams said. She woke up in a car, scared. Fasig and family members were talking about what to do, she said. A friend of the family, who will remain unnamed, came to her rescue, she said. I tried to escape at least seven times, I ran from a light rail car, tried screaming for help on Rice Street and nobody came to help me. Finally, the family friend persuaded her to make the attempt. An altercation occurred between Fasig and his father, she said, and Fasig won. She called her mother from an auto shop and told her to come get her. Stoneman told her rescuers to bring her to the hospital or the police station, but those involved refused, saying they had pending warrants from the Dakota Access Pipeline controversy, Stoneman said. Since the experience, Williams has contemplated suicide. I knew what the deal was; I am already broken. Williams wanted to be the strong woman she felt she was during the DAPL protests. She walks on thin ice, Stoneman said, when discussing the case with her daughter, who is fragile. She encouraged them to file police reports. The things that he did to her are not right. Other allegations Since investigations into this story began, three other Native women stepped up to tell similar experiences, and all point their fingers toward Derrick Fasig. She went to Bismarck after she was assaulted because a part of her felt sorry for him, she said. Fasig ran when her young son called police, she said. He was caught, charges were filed with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, but Fasig was released six days later. She provided the text message as proof. An Ojibwe woman from the Red Lake Tribe in Minnesota who spoke on condition of remaining anonymous, said she met Fasig while at the Standing Rock camps. Just before the camps were evacuated in February, she said he raped and beat her, but she did not file a police report because law enforcement and the activists standing against the Dakota Access Pipeline were not on the best of speaking terms, she said. A joke escalated into violence, she said. She tricked her way out of the situation, she said, by saying they needed to talk to someone at the camp. As soon as she was free and surrounded by friends, she told him to never talk to her again. Indigenous people represent less than six percent of the population in North Dakota, but Indigenous women are 10 times more likely to be murder victims than the national average, according to the North Dakota Indian Affairs Commission and the Centers and the National Crime Information Center. Indigenous women are also more than two times more likely than other women from all races to experience rape or sexual assault. In 2016, 5,712 cases of missing Native women were reported to the National Crime Information Center. Fasig Mike Fasig and his son, Derrick, have been estranged for years, Mike said. Derrick served 45 days in Scott County Jail in 2014 for domestic assault, according to Minnesota State Court Records. Mike was active in security at the Oceti Sakowin camps, and has recently gained an online following for his work uncovering the relationship between private security firm TigerSwan and local law enforcement, including the infiltrators that were sent into the camps by federal authorities and private security companies. A day after Williams told Slyfox about her predicament, Melaine Stoneman called him, he said. Mike said he tried to make Williams call her mother multiple times, and he tried to make her leave, but she refused. The live feed he posted to Facebook proving that Williams was alive was a last ditch effort to appease her mother, he said. The pressure became too much, Mike said. Soon after the live feed, SWAT knocked on his door. They searched the premises twice in one day, he said. Felony charges against Derrick Fasig hold maximum sentences of up to 20 years imprisonment for kidnapping, 15 years for criminal sex conduct, and another 15 years for possessing ammunition and any firearm. When Derrick and Williams got into fights, Derrick would tell her to leave, Mike said. The gun charge stems from a miniature rifle he confiscated while at the Oceti Sakowin camps, he said. SWAT broke into the camper and found that gun, he said. Mike said that law enforcement checked the gun for fingerprints, and did a DNA test, and both came back negative. Laycie had every reason to avoid her mother. I am not hiding anything. Mike believes his rising popularity is one of the reasons he feels targeted. The idea that women are not funny never entered my mind. Editorial Wisdom from a forgotten flagpole by Sabrina Hornung Photo by Sabrina HornungI had a little bit of gravel-road therapy this weekend, found myself cruising rural Burleigh County and made a pit stop at Lake Mitchell. Participants were judged on creativity, flavor, and presentation; and this year we added a new category. I suffer from acute scoliosis in my lower back, and pain radiates from this area on a daily basis.
