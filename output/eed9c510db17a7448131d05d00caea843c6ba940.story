Inside the camps as the North Dakota winter came rolling in. Story by Amos Barshad Photography by Sara Lafleur-Vetter Share Tweet Lorna Hanes is tall, and of firm gait. She wears her long brown hair loose, leaving it to brush over her broad shoulders. Fifteen years ago, when she was 35, she met Winona LaDuke, the famed Ojibwe indigenous rights activist. Eventually, LaDuke would adopt Hanes as a sister and set her on her own path of activism. ADVERTISEMENT She now lives with LaDuke on the White Earth reservation, in Minnesota, and works with LaDuke's Honor The Earth organization. Hanes lovingly recalls past pipeline rides that snaked through the Badlands of the Dakotas, on ridges miles above twinkling lights of car traffic, on paths surrounded by treacherous openings into seemingly bottomless caverns. The sprawling camps, full of people who call themselves Water Protectors, exist in defiance of the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, or DAPL. Back then, the landscape was all greens and browns. While LaDuke moved back and forth tending to business in Minnesota, Hanes lived on the land with her horse, Lucky. Within weeks of the sisters arrival, a group of activists in a confrontation with construction workers were attacked by DAPL security guards with pepper-spray and trained dogs that bit both people and horses. My sister was really pissed off. The Morton County Sheriff's Department is the presiding law enforcement body in this part of the country. But over the months of the standoff, 76 other law enforcement organizations have volunteered time or material support. In one notorious incident from November, activists attempted to remove burned-out trucks, remnants from a past altercation, from in front of the barricade. In response, Morton County opened up powerful hoses gushing water in freezing weather. During the skirmish, a 21-year-old woman named Sophia Wilansky suffered a severe arm injury and faced a possible amputation from what her family says was a law enforcement concussion grenade. Down the road a bit, on North Dakota State Route 1806, scattered black beef cattle break up the thick, clean monochrome of fresh snow. On the other side is the Standing Rock Sioux reservation and the camps of activists. Just days before I arrive, in early December, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had issued an evacuation order. They then issued a map indicating a small sliver of land where the activists would be allowed to stay. Today, white helicopters swirl around the blockade. Behind the DAPL side of the cement barriers of the barricade, uniformed, helmeted men stick out of their armored vehicles, almost like tank commanders surveying a battlefield. Right now, here on Route 1806, save for the crunch of boots in the snow, there is silence. Farther back, the mass of the Standing Rock camps hum. For the last few weeks, stoves have been installed with fervor; now, the pleasant smells of burning wood greet the camp every morning. Axes swing down on small logs for firewood. Chainsaws roar down on the big ones. Dogs wear clothes, horses run free, cars get stuck constantly, kids chuck snowballs and, giggling, try to linebacker tackle you to the ground. Plastic tents that once breezed through the summer are now comically snowed under. But the tipis, yurts, campers, lean-tos, reappropriated school buses, prefab shacks with porches, and ice-fishing tents are holding strong. We chat; she invites me back to her yurt. Then I get back in my car. I back my car out, and see a woman, panting, in my rear-view mirror. There, Hanes waves at my boots. She has deemed them carelessly lightweight. Inappropriate. She pulls me into a supplies tent and makes sure I swap mine out for a thicker, more trusty pair. She yanks down sleeping bags, tosses me handwarmers, makes sure I have everything I needed to stay toasty and alive for the next few days. Seven months ago, on April 1, on a small sloping plot of private riverbank land, LaDonna Brave Bull Allard officially opened the doors on the first camp, Sacred Stone. But on the way from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to an oil tank farm near Patoka, Illinois, DAPL still had to cross under Lake Oahe, a federally dammed stretch of the Missouri River that abuts the land of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation and provides its residents with water. Standing Rock, fearing a leak and aghast at construction that would disrupt their sacred burial grounds, had long objected. Their defense was multi-pronged. First, there was action in federal courts, including a lawsuit brought against the Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency that oversees pipeline construction on and near waterways. Allard possesses a homegrown regality and electric-purple fingernails. In her Chevy SUV, there are big stems of sage loose on the dashboard and a man in a black jacket with a feather tattoo on his left temple mutely keeping watch out the window in the backseat. To those ends, she wanted to make as much noise as possible. On the first day, there were six tipis and three residents. I remember it was kind of cold. There was still snow on the ground. I ask. She unfolds a slow smile and locks eye contact. From April until July, the camp maxed at 20 people. Grants started to come in from like-minded indigenous groups, and donations started ticking up, too, of clothes and food. Folks from the reservation town of Cannon Ball, a few miles down the road, began to come by with whole cooked meals. Over weeks and months, 20 people became a couple thousand, and major news outlets started paying attention. Mark Ruffalo showed up. So did Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas. Dee Snider shot a music video here. Someone saw a young starlet spending all dinner at the communal kitchen getting reiki. Someone else saw the scion of a political dynasty accidentally getting the port-a-potty door swung open on him, mid-business. In late October, working alongside state police and the North Dakota National Guard, Morton County pushed back, driving activists off a northern sprawl of the community that the activists had named Treaty Stronghold Camp. 141 people were arrested, including Johanna Holy Elk Face, age 64. Then they just started bringing us one by one onto school buses. Then we seen all the buffalo running down the hill towards us. Along with temporary holding pens likened by the arrestees to dog kennels, it painted the incident as a clumsy and dangerous enforcement of power. It was as effective as any call to arms. It fueled more attention, more money, more warm, loud bodies in the camps. In moments like this, you can see how a local sheriff's department can begin, perhaps almost unknowingly, to take small steps toward the language and tactics of international, entrenched power struggles: at times, Israeli authorities have put forth similar reasoning when blocking construction materials from getting to Gaza. The barbed-wired, militarized blockade. The threatened confiscation of basic supplies. Propane can easily be used as a life-endangering flammable. But what the people in the camps would tell you they need propane for is to keep their RVs habitable in freezing nighttime temperatures. And what the folks in Gaza would tell you they need construction material for is to build houses. Clyde Bellecourt Clyde Bellecourt, the co-founder of the American Indian Movement, sits on a crate outside a communal kitchen in Oceti Sakowin. They were a propulsive, combative force. In 1973, they made a symbolic stand by occupying the South Dakota town of Wounded Knee, the site of the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, holding off against federal agents for 71 days. Bellecourt himself is nearly as controversial as the movement. (Much like with the Black Panthers, the FBI actively worked to fracture and weaken AIM). At 80, the years have muddled his voice, giving it that soft, wet, grandfatherly tone, as if there is a hard candy being worked on somewhere in the back of his jowls. But even four decades removed from the seminal AIM actions of the 1970s, Bellecourt is still fierce, and quick to rail. A generation or two later, a new breed of activists has come forth. That includes people like Lorna Hanes, and Thomas Tonatiuh Lopez. Thomas Lopez Lopez, a 24-year-old who identifies as Chicano, grew up outside of Denver as the adopted son of Sicangu Lakota parents. And pretty much since birth, he knew about AIM: one of his grandfathers is the AIM luminary Chief Leonard Crow Dog. After graduating from college, Lopez dreamt of hosting his own The View-like entertainment program, one that would feature indigenous and other minority artists. Quickly, he packed up and headed to Standing Rock. At Standing Rock, he became a member of the International Indigenous Youth Council, a solid, self-defined structure within the anarchic sprawl of the camp. And like a lot of people I talk to, Lopez speaks of his experience at Standing Rock as life-altering: he believes that here he has finally tapped into the leadership capabilities he was born with. He says the story of Standing Rock will forever change self-perception in indigenous communities, encourage heretofore unimagined ambitions. But Lopez also has no problem flashing the grand, righteous fire of Bellecourt and his grandfather Crow Dog and his militant AIM forefathers. The corporations should be very scared of us. A native kid in a thermal shirt, boots, and basketball shorts runs to the port-a-potty. Like decolonization. He pauses dramatically, goes to a stage whisper. There are so many veterans, so many of them physically or mentally injured. You end up hearing about a lot of motivations to come out here, not one quite the same as the next. A few weeks ago, his son Clark was killed in a car accident while on his way to Standing Rock. Passing through Wisconsin, the car Clark was traveling in flipped; the driver had jerked the wheel to avoid a deer carcass. Jay and Clark used to text constantly, swapping links and photos. On the day before the election, Jay sent Clark a Times article about lefty doomsday preppers: folks getting ready for the then-unimaginable possibility of a Trump victory. Then he sent his dad his Google maps route from the East Coast out to North Dakota. Clark was a real activist, a real doer. I ask him. Duly committed to privacy, they have their own security checkpoint. The imagery of militarized police facing off with horse-riding indigenous Americans felt grand, and representative of generations of tragedy. So much of the regular coverage of Standing Rock has focused on the ghastly clashes, and understandably so. But the sheer mass of the outpost is the true bulwark. The kitchens, where volunteers chop cactus leaves and gut turkeys and whip out hash, pasta salad, fried bread. The dusk water prayer ceremonies, where people end up teary-eyed and sniveling in the cold. The morning general meetings at the geodesic dome, where issues get passive-aggressively hashed out. It had nothing to do with my mouth. In the trenches. Boom. After meeting. The DAPL standoff tends to lean toward pitched language: there is a lot of talk of missions, of tactical strategy, of battles. If you want to build a pipeline, you need permit approval from the Army Corps of Engineers. With DAPL, Energy Transfer Partners had all rights to expect that things would continue moving smoothly. Then the combination of the action on the land and the action in the courts came forward and left them anchored in place, awaiting an easement from the Corps that would allow them to cross below. Which is: more community boards, more public forums, more courtrooms. And the atmosphere in the camp has the auspicity of opening day. The call was put out a few weeks back by Wes Clark Jr., an ex-Army officer, and the son of decorated general Wesley Clark. All week, talk has revolved around their numbers, and the estimations keep rising. It seems inconceivable that Morton County would be as quick to act aggressively toward former soldiers as they have been against the people of Standing Rock. The temperature is still in the 20s, but the sun has broken through, and the rays are just enough to suggest the first cracks of a yet-long-away spring, as veterans from every major U.S. combat operation since WWII, from Korea to the Balkans to Iraq, meet, and clap each other on their camouflaged-jacketed backs. That morning, there had been no indication that a ruling on the easement decision was imminent. Seemingly out of nowhere, then, word trickled out in the camp: the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had decided not to grant it. Rather than allowing Energy Transfer Partners to cross under Lake Oahe, the Corps would, in fact, be undertaking an Environmental Impact Statement and exploring alternative routes. There are speeches, prayers, thrown-off announcements about rides to Portland or lessons in dog-care responsibilities. There are lots and lots of songs. Now, a rapid-fire string of speakers takes over to bask in the unexpected announcement. Then the spiritual leader of the Sioux, Chief Arvol Looking Horse, comes on the mic. Hanes and LaDuke are together near the front of the huddle, embracing, grinning big, bopping up and down in place. Nearby, a couple of aunties sit with plastic partitioned camp plates of food, not quite bothered enough to pause on the consumption of their noodles. That night, yelps and songs come strong from the Sacred Fire. In the dim light, between the bumpy topography of the hard, well-trod ice and the army tents popping up left and right, the place begins resembling a bustling moon colony. The fight at Standing Rock has been a part of a larger, loosely-connected international campaign that rejects fossil fuels in favor of alternative energy sources. In 2015, plans for the Kinder Morgan pipeline were felled in Massachusetts thanks in part to grassroots efforts. But there are already 2.5 million miles of pipeline in the United States. The network crisscrosses the nation; your home or primary water source lays closer to a pipeline than you think. And despite recent growth in the field, alternative energy is still very much fledgling: in the U.S., solar power delivers about one percent of total electricity. Originally, Energy Transfer Partners had requested a permit for DAPL to go north of Bismarck. They did it because it was the closest thing they could get to maintaining a straight line between the Bakken oil fields and Illinois. At this base level, Energy Transfer Partners is not inherently malicious. What they are is disproportionately powerful. As his choice for Secretary of State, Trump has named Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson. Ultimately, then, Standing Rock is as much about pipeline protests as it is vested power dynamics. The bizarre, possibly unreplicatable confluence of forces that made Standing Rock an international news story had led to this: actual political power. With perilous nights in plummeting temperatures, with voices shredded raw, with hands run ragged, people who were not billionaires or CEOs chipped away actual political power. Soon, just over a month after the rejection of the easement, the President-Elect will assume power and all of it could slip away. But if the President-Elect is a threat to democracy as a whole, then Standing Rock has a been a boon to it in general. Here, in the tundra of North Dakota, a wild sprawl of life has popped up, to teach us the protocols and the potential power of peaceful, asymmetrical warfare. Just 400 miles to the west, in November of 1876, the Lakota Sioux defeated General Custer at Little Bighorn. With it comes skepticism over the good news about the easement. Accordingly, the camp buzz has not ceased. A massive construction shed is a hive of activity, with folks streaming in and out to grab power tools. As the snow piles up, barracks and huts are still rising. Back in the SUV, LaDonna Brave Bull Allard explains that this is the exact the kind of wobbly permanence off of which she hopes to build. And in the summer of 2017, Allard is planning on using those donations to open a full-time ecovillage. People had given up their lives to come here. People had given up their lives to come here. Meanwhile, on Route 1806, the veterans assemble to execute a peaceful march. With bold chants, they vocalize the anthem of the American Indian Movement. One man runs past the front line and drops onto his back to knock out some snow angels. But the barricade is, for once, unmanned. And the only presence on the bridge are the Water Protectors. A woman climbs on an old burnt out Jeep and encourages the people to say it again and again. Later, as I drive out of the camps, the sunset starts off blazingly orange over the expanse of white, then dips with a thin line of pink over the wide, blank hills. Snow swirls come in gusts that resemble solid mass. These are bursts of winds that feel strong enough to topple steel. After hours stuck in blizzard traffic in the dwindling sunlight, I get an opening to power through. I get to Bismarck, where I get drunk with an ex-Marine from New Jersey and chase a false rumor of Ramada Inn blackjack, and then I get home, where there is warmth and, finally, a shower. But before I go, unlikely as it is, I see Lorna Hanes standing in the middle of that one-lane North Dakota road. I stop the car, bracing for a storm of honks behind me. She smiles and, absentmindedly, makes an S with her finger in my snow-covered drivers-side window. The FADER newsletter. All rights reserved.
