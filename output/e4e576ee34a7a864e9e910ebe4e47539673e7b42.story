Kathleen Bennett, 58, of Las Vegas, is accused of taking her 82-year-old mother, who suffers from dementia, to the camps as blizzards pummeled the area from October to December. According to police, she would leave her mom tied to a chair while she attended protests and on one occasion, left her without pants in her own feces. The allegations were reported to authorities after the elderly woman was hospitalized during a blizzard on Dec. 17. Sauviac commented that some of the evidence came from people with indirect knowledge of the treatment. He also implied the key witnesses had criminal histories that had not been investigated by the police. In addition to this case, Bennett has also been charged with exploitation of a vulnerable adult. The elderly mother still resides in a hospital due to her dementia, Stoneman said in a phone interview Monday afternoon. She said they are working to find a nursing home placement for her in New Mexico where most of her family resides. South Central District Judge Thomas Schneider found probable cause in the abuse case Monday afternoon and will schedule a two-day jury trial. Bennett has not yet appeared in court on the exploitation case. If convicted on both charges, Bennett could face up to 15 years in prison. Click here to learn more.
