TUED is today a vibrant global network of 54 unions in 18 countries, from both North and South, committed to building political support for extending democratic control over energy. In 2016 TUED produced, An Illness to One is the Concern of All, that showed how rising fossil fuel use and climate change has already created a global health emergency. Dirty fuels pollute our air, water and land. These fuels are the leading cause of climate change which is a threat to American security and the survival of human civilization. Climate change causes food shortages, droughts, wildfires, flooding and global conflict. But we can solve climate change and create millions of good jobs for working people by investing in clean energy manufacturing, construction and innovation. As we make this transition, we must demand good jobs, living wages, union rights and no-cost job training for workers. We are facing high levels of asthma, cancer and other diseases caused by air pollution from power stations and diesel trucks. Our hospitals and nursing homes were flooded, causing mayhem for our patients. Not only have we faced coastal flooding here in the U.S., but also many of our members are from countries in the Caribbean, Latin America and Asia that have been continuously inundated. We feel as healthcare workers and union members it is a moral imperative to join the global environmental movement and solve climate change as soon as possible. Health care unions like 1199SEIU stand on the front lines of the battle to construct cleaner and healthier energy systems that are controlled by communities and municipalities in order to meet local needs. This is a global fight. They represent over 400,000 healthcare workers throughout Massachusetts, New York State, New Jersey, Maryland, Florida and Washington, D.C. Their mission is to achieve quality care and good jobs for all.
