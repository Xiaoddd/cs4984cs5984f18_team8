The Standing Rock tribe is standing against the Dakota Access Pipeline which may contaminate drinking water. Not only as Native Americans but as Navajo we are raised to respect mother earth, every time we gather as a family or group we always give thanks for our cattle, our food, our home, we pray for rain and water. As a Navajo from Page Arizona and a United Citizen who just wants to remind the world that we as Native American people are still here and we are not going anywhere. Arrive in Salt Lake City Utah and pick more donations. On November 21st, 2016 my cousin who lives in New York City will join us and we will depart for Standing Rock. We will stay in Standing Rock from the 21st through the 26th of November. We will spend our time away from our families and friends on Thanksgiving to support our brothers and sisters. We know that not everyone is able to make the long drive of 1,271 miles. We are accepting donations of cash. When we get to Standing Rock we will unload our supplies and donations. The money that you send us, we will go to the nearest town and gather more supplies that the camp needs. Because we work for a company in Page that owns seven hotels we will be taking blankets, towels and other items. If you are wondering of what you can help, you can go to sacredstonecamp.org and you will see the supply list that is needed. All of what you donate will be used for this purpose only. If you are willing to help us with gas and food that would be greatly appericated as well. We will also be helping the camp kitchen with food donations as well. Your donations will not go unappreciated, we willmake sure that the camp knows you helped by writing your name in support of the camp. May god bless you and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for helping us. We are still helping the camp, even tho we are not physically there at the moment.
