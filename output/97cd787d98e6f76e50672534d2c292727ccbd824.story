The activists, who are demonstrating in sub-zero temperatures, have been ordered to leave the area by Monday. It is unclear if they will obey. The pipeline, which runs close to the Standing Rock Sioux Native American Indian reservation, is nearly complete except for a section running underneath a nearby river. President-elect Donald Trump has said he supports the completion of the pipeline. He has stocks in Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, the project's builder, and Phillips 66, which owns one-quarter of the pipeline. Mr Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said she believed he had sold his Energy Transfer Partners stock. The Sioux and other Native Americans began protesting against the pipeline in April. They say it will run over sacred burial sites and contaminate Standing Rock's water source.

The veterans' group is led by Michael Wood Jr, a former US Marine and Baltimore police officer. Police deployed at the protests have been accused of beating peaceful protesters.

A post on the Veterans for Standing Rock event page claimed that an additional 2,000 people will protest alongside existing activists. The organisers urged anyone attending to protest peacefully. Activists have been demonstrating in the bitter cold, with temperatures set to drop in the coming week. Average temperatures in the area last December were -5C (22F). Mr Dalrymple said he would instead work on rebuilding relations with Sioux leaders. He and the federal government have ordered mandatory evacuations from the protest site. The local police department said they hope the harsh weather conditions will force people to vacate the camp but there are no plans to remove them by force.
