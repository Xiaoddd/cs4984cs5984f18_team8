Video of the clash between police and unarmed protesters at Backwater Bridge, not far from the Standing Rock encampments, emerged on social media Sunday evening. We are human beings. The truck, along with the rest of the barricade, has been there for weeks. Police confront protesters with a rubber bullet gun during a protest against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Fire trucks at the scene doused those fires and the land around them to prevent them from spreading, she wrote. Jade Begay, a spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network, told The Guardian that two bonfires were lit by activists for warmth and cooking, but that any others were started by weapons from law enforcement. Begay told The Guardian that more than 160 people were injured and another seven activists were transported to a local hospital.

At least one person was arrested, the Associated Press reported. A protester is given medical attention during a protest against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. The company building the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, has said those claims are baseless. The Dakota Access pipeline is nearly complete, except for one parcel of land owned by the federal government. Energy Transfer needs a final permit to tunnel beneath Lake Oahe on the Missouri River in rural North Dakota. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the owners of that land, announced last week that it was delaying construction of the 1,170-mile pipeline until further analysis. The agency said it also welcomed input from the tribe. The struggle over the Dakota Access Pipeline has intensified, as more protesters have joined the standoff and the company building the pipeline filed suit to get its last permit issued. Warren said he was optimistic the pipeline would get built under a Trump presidency. Thanks for subscribing. Please check your inbox to confirm your email address. All Rights Reserved.
