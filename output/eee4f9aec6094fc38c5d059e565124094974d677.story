Today, that figure is less than 20 percent. Reid, who is an associate professor in the department of history, is a registered member of the Snohomish Tribe. Please understand that I am not trying to compare these two very different situations. I acknowledge that I am not from the First Nations Reid spoke about in his talk. I am from another corner of the world. I am from what you could call Europe. And I acknowledge my privilege in being here, and having the platform to speak and be heard. Neither of these movements should eclipse the other; they are equally important. I seek guidance in their intersectionality and perhaps you can do the same with mine. It was during the journey of native peoples we traveled through movements that sought sovereignty where I saw the same spirit of resilience of the Catalan people. Peaceful and well-organized movements have made their way into discourse for centuries. And they are not stopping at any time soon. We saw this in the Ghost Dance movement in the late 19th century, when Ghost Dancers used several networks of telegraphs, railroads, and mail service to spread their millenarial prophetic practice and end generations of oppression. We saw this in the Idle No More movement in 2012, when activists used new technology to draw attention to settler colonialism, oppression, and environmental injustice in Canada through flash mobs and drums in big public spaces. Relentless activism. These women that rose to protect indigenous rights inspire me and many others who strength around the world. This is what I envision for my people as well. In the face of constant abuse and oppression, we must seek stories of resilience around the world such as this one. And we must inspire each other while remaining self-sufficient and independent.
