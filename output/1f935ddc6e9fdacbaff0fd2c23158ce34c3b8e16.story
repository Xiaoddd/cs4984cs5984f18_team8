While environmentalists clashed with Barack Obama over the Keystone and Dakota Access oil pipelines, these fights could pale in comparison to the array of grievances Trump will face over water security, fracking and climate change. It will be the beginning of what they say will be a sustained protest throughout the year. Landowners in Iowa are challenging the government seizure of their land to build the pipeline. But 17 of those parcel owners are suing the Iowa utilities board (IUB), arguing that the pipeline should be dug up and removed because the government violated the law in its use of eminent domain, which is the power the government has to seize private land for public use. Bill Hanagan, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the case, explained that an Iowa law passed in 2006 prevents the state from using eminent domain to grant farmland to a private company if it is not in the public good. Energy Transfer Partners argues that the state will reap significant financial benefits, and the approval of the IUB is all that is required. A judge heard the arguments for the eminent domain lawsuit on 15 December and will probably issue a decision in the coming weeks. But regardless of what he decides, the losing side is expected to appeal and protests are expected to continue. Environmentalists and some from the Meskwaki tribe held protests, conducted a hunger strike, and faced 200 arrests, according to Edward Fallon, a former state lawmaker and lead climate advocate Hanagan predicts the legal dispute may ultimately be settled in the US supreme court. Divestment movement on campus Campuses across the country have been pushing universities to divest from from the fossil fuel industry over the past few years. Neubauer and others are fearful of the prospect of having a climate denier in the White House and the damage that could be wrought by cabinet appointments such as those of former Exxon chairman Rex Tillerson for secretary of state and Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency, which he has rallied against throughout his career, including as attorney general of Oklahoma. Environmental reform leaders say resistance is escalating to numerous proposed oil and gas pipelines around the country. Martin points to opposition to the Sabal Trail Transmission,which would stretch approximately 515 miles through Alabama, Georgia and Florida, as emblematic of future resistance. Activists have been protesting the pipeline since construction began last fall, with 16 people arrested in total and rallies held in five cities across Florida on 29 December. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters in California march against the Dakota Access pipeline. Debra Johnson, 58, said she helped to found a camp that has been running since late September. About 35 people are currently staying there, she said, though the number varies. Merrillee Malwitz-Jipson, a campaign organizer with the Sierra Club in Florida, said she had been fielding calls about how people can donate to two camps established along the Suwannee and Santa Fe rivers. She said said the pipeline poses a range of environmental concerns, including endangering the local groundwater supply and the risk of sinkholes. Martin said there are also major environmental justice concerns that the locations of compressor stations, which she said affected air quality, would have a disproportionate impact on African American communities. Malwitz-Jipson has been encouraging people to document construction violations and reach out to lawmakers. The project also faces legal challenges, including by the Sierra Club. Sabal Trail, a joint venture of Spectra Energy Corp, NextEra Energy and Duke Energy, according to a website for the pipeline, is slated to become operational in the fall. Other pipeline projects eliciting opposition include the Atlantic Coast pipeline, which would travel from West Virginia to North Carolina; the Bayou Bridge pipeline in Louisiana; and the Mountain Valley pipeline, which would travel through West Virginia and Virginia.
