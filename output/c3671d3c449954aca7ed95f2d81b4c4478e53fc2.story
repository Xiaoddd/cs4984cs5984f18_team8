Instead, Boasberg asked attorneys to appear before him again and make a new set of arguments about whether the pipeline should operate. The tribe faces a mixed result: The ruling may establish some important precedents, particularly around environmental justice and treaty rights. Energy Transfer Partners, which owns and operates the pipeline, did not respond to a request for comment before publication. A representative for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers could not be reached. The Dakota Access pipeline runs 1,100 miles across much of the Great Plains, connecting the Bakken oil formation in North Dakota to a refinery and second pipeline in Illinois. Oil began flowing through the pipeline earlier this month. By late October, Standing Rock had become the largest and most high-profile Native protest in the United States in four decades. First, he said, the Standing Rock Sioux are assured certain hunting and fishing rights in their most recent treaty with the U.S. government. This emphasis on consideration points to the broader nature of the legal fight: This case is not about how the pipeline may harm Standing Rock, but whether the Corps adequately studied and reported on those harms before approving it in the first place. According to federal regulation, every major project constructed near a poor community, community of color, or Native American reservation must be studied on environmental-justice grounds. The Corps shrugged off many of these rules, arguing that no affected group lived within a half-mile of the pipeline route. The Corps was technically correct. The Dakota Access pipeline runs 0.55 miles north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. With the project so far along, she said it was unclear if any procedural problem could convince Boasberg to temporarily shut down the project. The tribe was not successful on every claim. The judge ruled that the Corps did not violate administrative law when it quickly approved the pipeline earlier this year. The complicated legal history of the Dakota Access pipeline has stemmed from one important conflict: The pipeline mostly runs across private land, allowing Energy Transfer Partners to quickly secure permission and construct most of it last year. But it also must cross the Missouri River, a federal waterway controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. But less than two months later, in early September, the Obama administration stepped in and asked Energy Transfer Partners to voluntarily stop work on the project. President Barack Obama announced the result of this review in early December 2016, when the administration revoked the permit entirely. It also ordered Energy Transfer Partners and the U.S. Army Corps to study whether the pipeline could be re-routed. Finally, almost two months later and on his fifth day in office, President Donald Trump reversed this order and granted approval for the pipeline. The president celebrated the pipeline during a speech last week in Cincinnati. But I took none, actually none. Hasselman referenced the speech as he spoke to me Wednesday. Journal Collective.
