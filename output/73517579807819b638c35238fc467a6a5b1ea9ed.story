Our dinner is called the Wopila Feast, the Lakota word for a broad statement of thanks. Native Americans saved the lives of newly arrived Europeans in what is now Massachusetts, by sharing their harvest in the winter of 1620. The Wampanoag, who had lived in the region for some 12,000 years, taught the settlers to grow native crops. The Wampanoag were not the only tribe to be generous. In the earliest days, many tribes throughout the Americas helped new settlers survive. Today, many of the foods in our diet were first cultivated by Native Americans, including many on the traditional Thanksgiving table: potatoes, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, beans, corn, squash, pumpkin, and cranberry. The turkey many enjoy on Thanksgiving Day was first domesticated by Native Americans. SPONSORED The idyllic traditional story of the first Thanksgiving in which the settlers shared with the native people is largely a myth. Tragically and shamefully, what followed the European arrival was 500 years of genocide and betrayal of Native Americans. To this day, treaties are being broken for the benefit of white expansionism. If successful in eventually reaching refineries on the Gulf and East coasts, the project will become the source of carbon emissions equivalent to nearly 30 coal plants every year for the next 20 to 30 years. The Standing Rock Sioux, joined by native people belonging to some 300 tribes from across the Americas, are camped along the Missouri River to protect their water, land and way of life. The natives call themselves protectors, and are risking their own safety and comfort to nonviolently stand up to corporate control and the militarism of armed police in riot gear. The protectors say they are working for a healthy future for all of our children and grandchildren, including those of the pipeline workers and police officers. Yet again, Native Americans are leading us toward our survival. We advocate for localized, small-scale renewable energy production. A localized economy will not only decrease the power of large corporations and cut down on the carbons of long-distance shipping, but will also make our communities more resilient and self-reliant as we face the threats of climate change. At the same time, decentralizing our economy spreads business ownership and wealth more broadly and creates meaningful local jobs, building a more just and sustainable economy. As our country suffers divisions following the elections, now is an important time to stand together and become the America we are meant to be. Standing Rock is a call to all of us to protect what we love. A Lakota prophecy speaks of a black snake crossing the land, bringing with it destruction and devastation. The black snake is finally here, in the form of an oil pipeline inching toward the Missouri River. The black snake is part of a larger monster driven by greed, destroying all of life in its path and even devouring the children of tomorrow.
