Adorned with traditional headdresses, some of them lit tobacco and prayed for their water. And as the sun set, they danced under the shade of the multi-million-dollar Trump Tower, one of the monoliths that represents the man who will be stepping into the White House in January. As people continue to protest in various states against the results of the election, thousands of Native Americans and their allies all over the nation are intensifying their fight against the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. Now that a leader who has expressed his support for and has a vested interest in the fossil fuel industry is about to rise to power, those who are fighting the pipeline feel a stronger sense of urgency.

Calling on Obama With less than two months left for the Obama administration, and the pipeline almost complete, Native Americans and those who are in solidarity with them are racing against time, with their voices pleading to Obama, their picket signs poised in front of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers buildings and their eyes locked on Trump. But Obama and the Corps are delaying the process. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is a federal government body that has the power to grant permits for water crossings and construction on federally-owned lands. Energy Transfer Partners and its subsidiary Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. have fought back by filing two lawsuits in federal district court.

Some even believe that depending on how the Obama administration and the Corps frame their decisions, Trump will be able to affect construction of the pipeline regardless. However, this is going to be a complex process. If Trump wanted to lift the halt by executive action, there would need to be legal steps to do it. It is not clear if that process would be any shorter than the lawsuits that are now pending in federal court.

Trump even pledged to relaunch construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which many Native Americans rallied against and was stopped by Obama in Nov. 2015. Despite this, not all Native Americans who are against the pipeline are against Trump.
