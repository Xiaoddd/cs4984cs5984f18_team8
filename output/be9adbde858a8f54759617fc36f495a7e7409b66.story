Pipeline protesters in North Dakota last month. Steve Martinez, 42, of Colorado, was ordered to testify before the federal grand jury Wednesday, Jan. 4, according to his Seattle-based attorney, Ralph Hurvitz. The subpoena required him to answer questions and provide physical evidence, including photos and SD memory cards. Last Friday, Martinez filed a motion in the U.S. District Court of North Dakota to quash the subpoena. The motion was denied Wednesday. While Martinez did not testify, he is required to appear Feb. 1 on a new subpoena, according to Hurvitz. He will not need to provide physical evidence, because the prosecutor voluntarily gave up that requirement. In denying the motion Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland sided with the federal government, who argued Martinez should have to testify because he transported Wilansky from the protest to Prairie Knights Casino and called 911 for an ambulance. Assistant U.S. Attorney David Hagler wrote in his pleading that the severity of the injury led law enforcement to believe it was caused by an explosion. After the protest, police found three one-pound propane canisters and large jars, all of which were allegedly used as improvised explosives, illegal under federal law, according to the pleading. The woman's father, Wayne Wilansky, has blamed the injury on an alleged concussion grenade thrown by police. Police said they had no such weapons. Jackson Lofgren, president of the North Dakota Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said it's uncommon to see this type of motion, because the prosecutors rarely call non-law enforcement witnesses to a grand jury. Wilansky's arm was severely injured during a standoff between protesters and police during the night of Nov. 20-21 at Backwater Bridge in Morton County. The incident began when protesters attempted to remove burned-out vehicles, from a previous clash with police, from the closed bridge. As the situation escalated, law enforcement used water hoses, tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters, who allegedly threw rocks, logs and Molotov cocktails. Hurvitz said he was not sure yet whether Martinez would answer questions at the February proceeding. About 40 pipeline protesters and a handful of pro-law enforcement protesters demonstrated Wednesday afternoon in front of the federal courthouse in Bismarck in subzero temperatures. The building, including the post office, was shut down for about 2.5 hours. Lofgren said the prosecutor could still issue a search warrant to obtain the physical evidence Martinez is no longer required to bring with him. Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections: For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S., particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century. The comments of our readers are the most vibrant, best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News. Accordingly, we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services. It is, however, important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in. Adapt and overcome. I hope the evidence was logged and preserved. Refresh comments list RSS feed for comments to this post THE NEW STREAMLINED RSN LOGIN PROCESS: Register once, then login and you are ready to comment.
