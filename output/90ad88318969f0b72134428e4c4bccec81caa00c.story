He recently edited and wrote the introduction to The Radical King by Martin Luther King Jr. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. Clearly, President Obama is involved with this. He visited the Standing Rock tribe in 2014. CORNEL WEST: He sure did. Yes, he did. They have not said they will not grant this permit. CORNEL WEST: Well, I mean, President Obama, he specializes in symbolic gestures, because he gives pretty speeches. And I just come as a brother, as a comrade, to be in solidarity with them. And I go there and follow instructions. I want to be a force for good there in that context. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Explain what that means, to be a professor of public philosophy. CORNEL WEST: Well, it means simply to engage in a truth telling and an analysis of structures and institutions and try to shape souls and characters of young people in such a way that they are willing to take stands on issues that have so much to do with the destiny of both this nation and the world. And thank God Brother Larry Bobo and Skip Gates and the others were kind enough to invite me back, as well. So, I look forward to being in the Boston area. But I know you know a whole lot about that Harvard context. CORNEL WEST: Yeah, Brother Castro. CORNEL WEST: I never met Fidel Castro. I went to Cuba, and I went there, and I was characterized as a counterrevolutionary with a smile, because I had called for the rotation of elites. I believe that leaders ought to rotate. So I called for the rotation of elites, and they pulled me in the palace. But at the same time, I salute the health system. I salute the education. I saluted the fact that he stood up in the face of American imperial power, 630 assassination attempts, fought back against the Bay of Pigs and affirmed, most importantly, the greatness of the Cuban people. They suffered under Batista. And they did suffer under Castro in terms of his repression of dissenting voices. But at the same time, they now emerge powerful again. But Castro has always, for me, been a fascinating figure, heroic figure. But still, I was very critical of the repression and not rotating, not having the kind of turnover in leadership that I would have liked to see. AMY GOODMAN: Well, on that note, I want to thank you for being with us. Dr. Cornel West, professor emeritus at Princeton University, thanks so much for joining us. CORNEL WEST: Thank you. Thank you.
