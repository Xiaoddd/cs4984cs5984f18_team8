Opinion James Giago Davies: Prayer alone didn't stop the Dakota Access Pipeline Posted: Thursday, December 29, 2016 James Giago Davies.

They more readily internalized the hypocrisy and greed of their BIA masters. The best and the brightest were never considered for roles of leadership, and if they were, they were soon horrified by the rampant corruption, nepotism and cronyism, and so they bailed out, and left tribal government to the types that preferred Tony Lama boots and Stetson hats.
