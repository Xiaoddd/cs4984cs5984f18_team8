Only he's been uniting many hundreds of thousands of people in protest and many millions in outrage at his bigoted, right-wing actions since taking office. But Trump's right-wing admirers around the country have seized on a strategy to push back against mass protest--by criminalizing it. Lawmakers in multiple states are proposing measures explicitly designed to curtail dissent. In perhaps the most stunning example, a Republican lawmaker in North Dakota has introduced a bill, known as HB 1203, that would exempt motorists who unintentionally injure or kill people engaged in protests on public roads from facing any criminal penalties or damages. Yes, you read that right--a North Dakota lawmaker wants to make it legal to run over protesters who have taken over a road--a tactic that, of course, has a long history, notably among civil rights activists. North Dakota Rep. Keith Kempenich introduced the bill explicitly in response to the protests against construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. With the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announcing that it would be approve an easement needed to complete the DAPL, the potential for new confrontations--and a violent attack on protesters--will only increase if Kempenich gets his way. IN SOME cases, the proposed laws against dissent target specific groups of protesters--like a Michigan law that passed by the state House in a lame-duck session in December, which is aimed at hobbling unions and the right to strike and picket. While Republicans tried to claim the legislation would only affect those engaged in violent protest, in reality, it would give the state and employers wide latitude to clamp down. There are also novel new interpretations of existing laws as well. Recently, Martinville Police Chief Calder Hebert told KATC News that the Blue Lives Matter law applies to those who resist arrest--meaning arrested protesters hit with the common-enough charge of resisting could also face hate crimes charges. But the most ridiculous proposal so far has to be legislation North Carolina state Sen. Dan Bishop is vowing to introduce that would protect public officials from being heckled. ATTEMPTS TO curtail the right to free speech and protest are nothing new, but this latest wave not only betrays the fears of the right at the tide of opposition toward their hero in the White House. And squelching burgeoning protests and growing movements is definitely in their interests. Nothing is as threatening to those in power as when masses of ordinary people begin to organize and mobilize--which is why we will likely see more such laws proposed. We need to be prepared to fight to protect our right to speak out at each turn--like protesters did in Minnesota, when a House committee voted the measure to make protesters financially liable for police costs. That bill is specifically meant to crack down on the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted following the police shootings of Jamar Clark and Philando Castile. After voting in favor of the proposed legislation, Republican lawmakers abruptly adjourned the meeting when protesters erupted in shouts. It will be up to us to build movements strong enough to make that lesson clear to those in power. Michael Kandelaars Spying on us is their business plan Recent revelations about Facebook and the mining of user data are just the tip of the iceberg of capitalism's grip over the internet. The debate about consumer privacy is at a boiling point in the battle between Apple and the FBI over iPhone encryption. The proposed reforms to NSA spying programs are essentially cosmetic changes to an out-of-control surveillance system.
