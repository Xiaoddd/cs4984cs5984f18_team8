Kinder Morgan announced this week that it will suspend work on the controversial pipeline and make a final decision by May 31st about whether to move forward with the project or cancel it altogether. The pipeline faces widespread resistance in British Columbia and from First Nations, and legal challenges including from First Nations whose lands were never ceded to the Crown. Not only would the project threaten land, water, and communities along the route in Canada, it would also dramatically increase dangerous tanker traffic along the West Coast, putting coastal communities in Washington, Oregon, and California at risk of increased pollution and threat of spills. Washington Governor Jay Inslee has joined Premier Horgan in opposing the pipeline.
