(Although that is important too) Following-up after Monday's piece on Allyship Post Trump, we're moving from talking about allyship to sharing concrete steps and actions to show up, support, and perform allyship. And since today is Thanksgiving, I'd like to pay homage to the Indigenous people resisting a destructive pipeline in North Dakota that is threatening ancient burial grounds, clean water, and our shared environment. Ah, Thanksgiving. And now, with violence escalating at Standing Rock as Indigenous people of this land (whose genocide marks the day's festivities) continue to resist militarized occupation, the whole thing is infinitely more ironic. And disgusting. So, naming that and moving forward, I hope to use this space on JooJoo Azad today to share a few ways Indigenous people are asking for support: today, tomorrow, and the day after. Happy Thanksgiving. There are already far too few journalists covering what is happening at Standing Rock. And when they do come, they have been targeted and met with rubber bullets. Or, they just stay away completely and report from their sky-rise offices in NYC. Rather, learn about what's happening through live streams and reporting coming straight from those on-the-ground photographing, videographing, writing, documenting, and analyzing. Listen to first-hand accounts and reports that come from Indigenous people. She has traveled to Standing Rock several times herself, and when she's back in Chicago she frequently shares live-streams on her Twitter account during attacks or moments of high tension. Her Twitter is a great place to keep updated with her work and follow her writing and documentation. Monetary donation is incredibly important, despite not always feeling so. Rather than adding additional bodies that need guidance and instruction, fund work that's already happening. Or fund an indigenous person to go instead. I do want to name that not everyone can afford to boycott Black Friday, and I do not want to shame those who are unable to boycott due to financial reasons. their own businesses) (only). So, if using a militarized police force to respond to peaceful protesters isn't valuable in and of itself to draw attention to a major crisis, then it only makes sense to turn to what will. (This is a political fashion blog of sorts, after all). One of these rad Indigenous-designed clothing brand is NTVS Clothing, whose t-shirt design was the cover image for this post. Because they're that good. They have a whole dope t-shirt line dedicated to Standing Rock, and donate proceeds of their profits to the camp as well. Also, they came out with a freaking Indigenous emoji pack. Their work is political, unapologetic, and inspired by their roots (and resistance). Agitate. i.e. the man who is sending militarized police to unarmed and peaceful protesters. His number is 701.328.2200. Call him. Leave him a voicemail. Do it again. Send it to your friends. His address is 600 East Boulevard Avenue, Bismarck, ND 58505-0100. Send him poop. (but his address is still there, wink wink hint hint). Prove it. Call him. The White House's number is 202-456-111 or 202-456-1414. Tell him to rescind the North Dakota Access Pipeline, which is incredibly harmful to the environment beyond just Standing Rock. 6. Talk. Again, it might not be physically, mentally, or emotionally safe for you to confront your racist aunts and uncles, so without shaming those who are unable to, please understand how important it is to be bringing up politics over Thanksgiving. Your family will listen to you before they listen to others. Your family will reason with you before giving my words a chance. And this is especially pertinent for my white friends--family members who have never experienced a politically uncomfortable conversation, understood the complexities of white supremacy and how they benefit from it at the expense of people of color, or have already started normalizing (or hell, even voted for) trump, please. talk. to. them. Talk to them about the Water Protectors at North Dakota. Show them the hyper-militarization (snipers. internationally-banned chemical weapons. armored trucks. water canons in freezing temperatures) Tell them that the foundation of this country was built on the genocide of Indigenous people and on the backs of Black (many of whom were Muslim) slaves. Tell them what they can do about it. (i.e., see numbers 1-6) P.S.
