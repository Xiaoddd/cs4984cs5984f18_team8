A litany of munitions, including water cannons, combined with ambiguous government leadership and misleading police statements, have resulted in mass arrests, serious injuries and a deeply sown atmosphere of fear and distrust on the banks of the Missouri river. Statements by the US Army Corps of Engineers and North Dakota state government that, despite their orders of evacuation, there are no plans to forcibly remove protesters opposing the Dakota Access pipeline have done little to assuage fears. Standing Rock protest: North Dakota governor orders immediate evacuation Read more As the first snows have fallen and more protesters arrive in support, apprehension at the encampments about the coming days is running high. Police have acknowledged using sponge rounds, bean bag rounds, stinger rounds, teargas grenades, pepper spray, Mace, Tasers and a sound weapon. The explosive teargas grenades in use at Standing Rock have been banned by some US law enforcement agencies because they indiscriminately spray people, Lederman said. Dakota Access pipeline protester 'may lose her arm' after police standoff Read more More than two dozen people were hospitalized and 300 injured during the conflict, according to the medic and healer council. But footage later emerged showing police aiming the hoses directly at activists. The department subsequently conceded that it had purposefully used water on the protesters. The department has not responded to requests to substantiate the claim. Caro Gonzales, a 26-year-old member of the Chemehuevi tribe and an anti-police violence activist in Washington state, said the language from law enforcement officials resembled that used to discredit unarmed black men killed by police. Adding to the confusion is an exceedingly complicated jurisdictional terrain. The first Standing Rock encampment, known as Sacred Stone, was established in April on land owned by LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, which sits within the boundaries of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. But as more activists joined the movement, camps were established north of the reservation border, on land managed by the Army Corps of Engineers and leased to a private rancher. While the government asserts that the land falls under its jurisdiction, the Standing Rock Sioux tribe says that it has treaty rights dating from the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie. Given the complexity, Ronal Serpas, a retired police chief and professor of criminology at Loyola University, said the courts needed to step in and provide direction for law enforcement officers. Glenn Morris, spokesman for the leadership council of the American Indian Movement of Colorado, said indigenous people in the Standing Rock region were accustomed to mistreatment by police.
