Californians who want their state to secede from the United States can now start collecting signatures to put the initiative on the 2018 ballot. The group needs 585,407 signatures from registered voters over the next 180 days to qualify for the ballot. If the 2018 ballot initiative passes, it would force a 2019 statewide special election asking voters if they want California to become an independent country. It's not clear whether a California secession would be handled by the federal government, even if the state's voters approved it. Sign up for our daily email.
