Only two candidates remain for the two open seats. Consuelo is one of the Three Hernandez Siblings that are running for offices in Southern Arizona. Her sister Alma just won her LD3 House race since there are no Republicans running for the two open seats, thus making the primary race the determining election.

Disaster Capitalists Are Turning Puerto Rico Into a Tax Haven Read more of this story here from Truthdig RSS by Ilana Novick. The official death toll from Hurricane Maria has increased to nearly 3,000 people. Families on smaller islands like Vieques and Culebra still have no power, and houses around Puerto Rico remain in pieces. Amid this death and destruction, which compounded an already shaky economy, Americans determined to profit off of it can be found. In a new feature for GQ, writer Jesse Barron tells of the mainlanders who, thanks to two obscure laws, have turned the island into their own personal tax haven. About 1,500 U.S. mainlanders have taken advantage of these laws. But the problem is, you have to give up your U.S. passport. When I heard about this, it was too good to be true. I live in paradise. I live at the Ritz-Carlton. I drive my golf cart to the beach club for breakfast. The people who take advantage of Acts 20 and 22 are at the lower end of the ultra-rich. Some of the people interviewed tried to explain Acts 20 and 22 were actually good for the Puerto Rican economy. Read the full article here. Watch Video Between record rainfall and storm surge, it could be some time before we know just how badly Florence flooded the East Coast. But we already know the floodwaters reached higher than they might once have, because the average sea level they start from is higher than it used to be. Before then-Hurricane Florence made landfall, scientists crunched more than a century of historical ocean data for the Carolinas. They say water levels there are roughly half a foot higher now compared to 1900. It's a side effect of human-driven climate change. That's making Florence and other recent storms worse. Climate experts say that same sea level rise contributed to the flooding from Sandy in New York City in 2012. They also say that floods like these are likely to get more common. But knowing just how bad those floods might get is challenging. While scientists agree sea levels are rising, the data doesn't show exactly how much to expect. It can depend on how fast ice sheets melt, or how quickly greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere change. Experts say the seas will creep up anywhere from 8 inches to 6 and a half feet by 2100. SEE MORE: North Carolina Has History With Deadly, Slow-Moving Storms And in North Carolina, there are rules that make predicting that climb even tougher. In 2012, the state passed a law that that limited how state agencies can use today's scientific consensus that seas are rising faster and faster. Since then, North Carolina has weathered four hurricanes, and the flooding hasn't stopped. Additional reporting from Newsy affiliate CNN.

Last month, Vice President Mike Pence said the administration is moving to make the Space Force a reality by 2020. It would become the sixth branch of the armed forces. Applying a broad definition, 13 of the 38 cases in which the Supreme Court has granted review for the upcoming October 2018 term raise criminal law and related issues. This is about average: Between a quarter to a third of cases decided by the court every year are criminal-law-related. This question may take lots of lawyers back to fond, or painful, memories of their 1L law school year. The answer to that question is needed in order to apply the Armed Career Criminal Act, a federal law that dramatically enhances prison sentences for persons who unlawfully possess a firearm and who also have been previously convicted of three drug crimes or violent felonies. But what that definition is, precisely, has repeatedly split lower federal courts. On October 9, the justices will wrestle with that question, first as it applies to robbery, in Stokeling v. United States, and then, in two consolidated cases, Stitt and Sims v. United States, in the context of burglary. The common law distinguished robbery from simple theft by requiring an element of force. Other jurisdictions disagree. Right after Stokeling, the court will consider similar questions regarding burglary. All three of these cases may be further influenced by the fact that the proper interpretation of the ACCA has troubled the court for decades now, so much so that in 2015, in Johnson v. United States, the court declared a nearby definitional subsection of the statute invalid as unconstitutionally vague. At least four cases to be argued this fall suggest that OT 2018 will be a joy for us Crim Pro professors as well. The common understanding of this awkwardly written clause is that a person may not be tried twice for the same offense. For example, two states may prosecute the same person for a kidnapping-murder in two trials, one after the other, one in each state, and upon conviction impose two independent sentences for the same crime. Similarly, a state may prosecute someone for the same crime that the federal government has already tried the person for, and vice versa: Those of us old enough to recall the 1991 Rodney King police assault case remember the federal government prosecuting the offending officers after they had already been tried and acquitted by the state. In McDonald v. Chicago, the court in 2010 ruled that the Second Amendment applies against the states, so now only three provisions in the Bill of Rights have not been incorporated. Timbs now seeks to eliminate that easy Crim Pro exam question. The context is criminal asset forfeiture. The Indiana court of appeals agreed that the excessive fines clause should be applied (incorporated) against the states. This term the court will hear argument in two cases involving the death penalty. On the second day of the term, October 2, in Madison v. Alabama, the court will consider whether the Eighth Amendment permits the execution of a prisoner whose severe and deteriorating medical condition leaves him mentally disabled such that he is unable to remember his offense. Bryan Stevenson, the founder of the Equal Justice Initiative in Alabama, will be arguing for Vernon Madison. The court has previously ruled that the state may not constitutionally execute the mentally insane (Ford v. Wainwright, in 1986) nor the mentally disabled (Atkins v. Virginia, in 2002). But in 2007, in Panetti v. Quarterman, the court declined to set specific standards for evaluating mental competency-to-be-executed claims. Madison provides an opportunity to further develop this constitutional concept. In Bucklew v. Precythe, Bucklew argues that an execution by lethal gas will be far more humane for him, and that Missouri is constitutionally required to use that method instead. Missouri law allows execution by either method, although it has no written protocols for gas executions. Garza v. Idaho (Oct. The march takes place on the second day of debates of the General Assembly of the United Nations, in which representatives of the government of Mexico will be present. In the confrontation of Iguala six people died and 43 students were disappeared. Since then, the parents of these students look for their children and demand to the government to bring them back alive. The crime of the Ayotzinapa students has triggered international outrage; it has become an symbol of the thousands of disappeared people in Mexico and has exposed the corruption of the Mexican government, which continues to protect and prevent an impartial investigation and the creation of a Commission of Truth and Justice, which has been now stalled by a sudden ruling from a judge in Tamaulipas. One of the parents of the disappeared students, Mr. Antonio Tizapa, lives in NYC. He is a victim of the Mexican government in more than one sense: as a victim of organized crime colluded with the government, looking for his missing son, and as an immigrant who opted for the economic exodus after the Free Trade Agreement that was signed without the consensus of the people. Since then, he has worked in the United States to help his family in Mexico financially. Ever since his son disappeared, Mr. Antonio Tizapa has formed an international amateur sports group of runners, called Running for Ayotzinapa 43, to make visible the invisible victims by wearing the Ayotzinapa t-shirt in international marathons. He started running the famous New York marathon. So many runners joined him wearing the t-shirt, that now the flag of Mexico in the marathon of this great city is practically symbolized by the shirt of Ayotzinapa. Also, from different cities in the United States and the world, from Paris to Havana, the people in solidarity with the cause of Ayotzinapa and eager to end the impunity of the government in Mexico are now the shirt. They have decided to put their heart and sweat to find the 43 and thousands more.

Watch Video More than 30 percent of foster children who were prescribed psychiatric drugs didn't receive a proper medical plan or follow-up monitoring, according to the federal government. A new report from the Health and Human Services inspector general surveyed hundreds of sample cases from five states with the highest number of foster kids treated with psychotropic medicine. The drugs in question include medication for anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders. They can have potentially serious side effects, which is why the IG notes supervision while on these medications is necessary. According to the report, up to 80 percent of children go into the foster care system with existing mental health issues. In 2012, almost 30 percent of foster kids were taking at least one psychotropic medication. The watchdog also recommends some improvements to the system. One is creating a strategy to help states meet treatment and monitoring requirements. The other is strengthening those requirements, ensuring foster kids' medical care is overseen on a case-by-case basis. TSON News Proudly powered by WordPress Theme: Gambit.
