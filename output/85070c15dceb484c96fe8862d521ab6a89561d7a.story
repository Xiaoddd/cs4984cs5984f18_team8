NEB said that the condition compliance letter report it issued to Trans Mountain Pipeline covers several remaining pre-construction engineering conditions for the pipeline expansion project. The regulator said that Trans Mountain has now met all applicable pre-construction condition requirements for Spreads 1-4. The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project has been proposed by Kinder Morgan to improve the capacity of the existing Trans Mountain Pipeline system by almost three times from the current 300,000 barrels of oil per day production. Constructed in 1953, the original Trans Mountain Pipeline system was laid between Edmonton, Alberta and Burnaby, British Columbia. Its expansion project will involve about 980km of new pipeline along with reactivation of 193km of existing pipeline. Kinder Morgan will construct new facilities to support the expanded pipeline which includes 12 new pump stations and 19 new tanks that are planned to be added to existing storage terminals. As per the terms of the agreement, the Canadian government will finance the resumption of the planning and construction work associated with the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.
