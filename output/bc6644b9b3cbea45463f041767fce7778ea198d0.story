The giant pipeline, and the terms on which it is built, has become the litmus test of a dispute on how Europe can reach a working relationship with Moscow and yet defend its liberal values from a Russian threat. He also says energy security must be driven by regulations that reduce the ability of any single supplier to exert monopoly control. He insists the EU is right to call for amendments to EU directives to ensure there is a level playing field between gas connectors, a change that would require Germany to allow non-Russian gas to use the pipelines. Although Johnson in his letter does not specifically call for the pipeline to be halted, he says the UK stands firm in its support for Ukraine on the issue. Nord Stream 2 is due to be completed in 2019 and will run through the Baltic Sea to Germany. Germany says the pipeline is necessary to fill an energy gap left by the phasing out of its nuclear plants, and the projected decline in supply from Norway and the Netherlands, as their reserves wane. The issue is starting to dominate major bilateral discussions in Europe, including a summit last Friday in Sochi between the German chancellor and Vladimir Putin. Merkel has been urging the Russian president to guarantee the Ukraine pipeline will still be used, alongside Nord Stream, but he has said that will only happen if it is economically justified. The US pressure stems in part from genuine concern at a Russian stranglehold on EU energy needs, but Germany has viewed the US involvement as a self-interested commercial intervention designed to increase its liquid gas sales to the European market. The UK, preoccupied by Brexit, has until now tried to keep a low profile on Nord Stream even though its closest natural allies in Europe, the Baltic states, Poland, Hungary and the Ukraine, all fiercely oppose the pipeline on current terms. Commentators in Russian newspapers such as Pravda this week confidently claimed that UK energy needs would become the anvil on which British opposition to Russia collapses. There also fears among Euro-sceptics that the Foreign Office has been holding back from condemning Nord Stream because the UK government does not want to alienate Germany at a sensitive moment in the Brexit talks. But the new pipeline is not a done deal, with opposition growing across Europe, including among MEPs. The US injected a fresh element into the discussion when Sandra Oudkirk, its deputy assistant secretary of state for energy diplomacy, said the US feared the pipeline would allow Moscow to place new listening and monitoring technology in the Baltic Sea. She said Congress had given the US president new powers to impose sanctions against a variety of Russian pipeline projects. Germany is looking for a deal that somehow keeps Kiev as a supplier, believing this could normalise relations between Ukraine, Russia and Germany.
