Over the past seven months, the protest has grown to over 3,000 Native and non-Native protesters organized in peaceful prayer camps along the construction site in Cannonball, North Dakota. There are a lot of allies that have been here since the beginning, and there are more allies here now. They realize this has been an indigenous movement and they have to take the backseat, but they also recognize that just the color of their skin allows them to do things we can't. But they have to know their place here and know that this is an indigenous movement and be respectful of that. This is a way of life for us, so they can't just come here and play Indian. And to end the night in good spirits with familiar faces, new friends and family. We had a frontlines camp that was established, people were camping up there and had their teepees up right on the pipeline route. Warren County, along with other sheriffs from around the country, came and they forcibly removed us from that camp. They had all kinds of toys that they were just unleashing on us. It was very traumatic for us because we were watching the workers continue to dig as we were being forcibly removed. That day, I was targeted and pulled in by my hair. They arrested 140 people that day. For me, it's been really hard and my spirit's been detached. When you see something that traumatic, you internalize it. A lot of us are detached from reality. Dealing with the PTSD of everyday with the helicopters and hearing the flash grenades, it's been real out here. We're just water protectors, we've been our here on the front lines. We've done this totally unarmed. There are a lot of young protectors out here who have earned their feathers and paint. You find a whole new kind of strength knowing you're the ethnicity to be most likely shot and killed by police at a higher rate than anyone else, while you're being surrounded face to face by militarized cops with assault rifles, and armored vehicles. You find another level of that strength when the company they are protecting are bulldozing thru your ancestors sacred sites and burial grounds at that very moment right in front of your eyes, all while you are unarmed and being asked to remain peaceful by others. I believe that takes a lot of strength, it also caused a lot of trauma. Pray for our people. . . The other day, I got a chance to be alone in my yurt, and I put on a beat and twelve bars came out of me really fast. It's just therapeutic, and it's bringing back the essence of what hip-hop is to a person and society in general. Hip-hop music is healing. But out here, I'm a hip-hop artist last. I'm an Oglala first, I'm an indigenous man first. I'm a protector and I'm here for the water and that's what's most important. Mainstream media has been very quiet on the subject. It's frustrating because we've been trying really hard to get this out there for months. Skeptical. Just to have them have this on their radar and be socially conscious about our people, I commend them for that because they don't have to care. They don't have any ties to this land or they don't have any real reason to care about us. They can be asleep and be okay with it. Since then we've slept in tipis, yurts, hotel room floors, and in jail cells haha..he locked down the other day in Minneapolis, sacrificing himself to make a statement for the well being of our future generations and water. Over the past seven months, the protest has grown to over 3,000 Native and non-Native protesters organized in peaceful prayer camps along the construction site in Cannonball, North Dakota. But as the movement has grown, the private DAPL security and militarized state police forces have increased in their violence against the self-proclaimed water protectors, hitting them with tear gas, attack dogs, rubber bullets, water cannons and even concussion grenades. He dropped 2 Worlds in 2013, an ode to this double life contemporary Natives must navigate. Below, Billboard speaks with Means about police brutality, the healing power of music, and what being a water protector means to him as an Oglala Sioux.

And a delegation that wanted to start a veterans coming to Standing Rock thing have gotten about 2,000 veterans out. All day was what my spirit needed. And to end the night in good spirits with familiar faces, new friends and family. Lately it's been hard, after what's happened the past week, after being arrested, this felony charge, today was a good one. On October 27th, I was arrested and charged with a felony -- conspiracy to commit endangerment by fire -- and two misdemeanors. We had a frontlines camp that was established, people were camping up there and had their teepees up right on the pipeline route. Warren County, along with other sheriffs from around the country, came and they forcibly removed us from that camp. They beat us, they maced us in the faces, they shot off flash grenades, they set off the LRAD sound cannon. They had all kinds of toys that they were just unleashing on us. It was very traumatic for us because we were watching the workers continue to dig as we were being forcibly removed. That day, I was targeted and pulled in by my hair. They arrested 140 people that day. For me, it's been really hard and my spirit's been detached. When you see something that traumatic, you internalize it. A lot of us are detached from reality.

We've done this totally unarmed. There are a lot of young protectors out here who have earned their feathers and paint. They're not being acknowledged in the rightful way. Literally fighting for clean water. You find a whole new kind of strength knowing you're the ethnicity to be most likely shot and killed by police at a higher rate than anyone else, while you're being surrounded face to face by militarized cops with assault rifles, and armored vehicles.

Just to have them have this on their radar and be socially conscious about our people, I commend them for that because they don't have to care. They don't have any ties to this land or they don't have any real reason to care about us. They can be asleep and be okay with it. Thank you to all the people with big names that have helped with the awareness of what's happening here. My brother Hank Crow and I a few months back. Since then we've slept in tipis, yurts, hotel room floors, and in jail cells haha..he locked down the other day in Minneapolis, sacrificing himself to make a statement for the well being of our future generations and water. Line 3 pipelines just got approved in Canada by Prime Minister Trudeau, and that's supposedly supposed to go through Minnesota. And with Trump coming in promising to create more jobs with energy, we have our work cut out for us. All Rights Reserved.
