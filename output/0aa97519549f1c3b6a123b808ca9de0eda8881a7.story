We have updated our privacy policy to better explain how we use data on this site. The system (which exists) and how it works The vetting begins with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee, which determines who counts as a refugee, who should be resettled (about 1 percent) and which countries would take them. This alone can take four to 10 months. If the UNHCR refers refugees to the United States, they then face scrutiny from federal intelligence and security agencies. Their names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through federal terrorism and criminal databases. Meanwhile, the refugees are interviewed by Department of Homeland Security officials. Syrian refugees in particular must clear one additional hurdle. Their documents are placed under extra scrutiny and cross-referenced with classified and unclassified information. The process typically takes one to two years or longer and happens before a refuge ever steps onto American soil. Intelligence and national security officials have noted the paucity of data. And contrary to what Trump suggests, Clinton has spoken about stepping up the rigor of the vetting and proposed specific solutions. Finally, we should note that refugees are subject to the highest level of security checks of any traveler category to the United States. While there are concerns about information gaps, a system does exist and has existed since 1980. It involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies as well as the United Nations. Refugee vetting typically takes one to two years and includes numerous rounds of security checks.
