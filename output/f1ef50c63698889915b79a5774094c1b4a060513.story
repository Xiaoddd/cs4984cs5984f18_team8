But when we lump together generations with clusters of pop cultural references, it always seems to give the concept flesh. These lineages seem fairly obvious, as does the progression from the Ramones through the Smiths in the four large circles in the center, which drive powerful currents to the disparate likes of Nirvana, Depeche Mode, Shellac, the Human League, and Can. What matters here is that it works: exploring the number of intricate connections between these bands with more breadth and immediacy than most alternative culture histories.
