Investors concerned about the Dakota Access Pipeline have started submitting shareholder proposals to the energy companies building the pipeline as well as to the lenders behind it, urging the companies to better disclose the risks to their business from the controversial investment. In a shareholder resolution filed last month with Marathon Petroleum Corp., which said in August that it would buy a minority stake in the pipeline, the pension plan said that Marathon should disclose to investors how it does due diligence on environmental and human rights risks, including indigenous rights risks, when it comes to M&A decisions. A spokesman for New York State Common Retirement Fund declined to comment beyond the resolution itself. Energy Transfer Partners LP owns the project jointly with Phillips 66 and Sunoco Logistics Partners LP. Marathon and Enbridge Energy Partners LP announced a joint venture in August that would also take a minority stake in the pipeline. Spokesmen at Marathon and Enbridge declined to comment. Jeff Shields, a spokesman for Sunoco Logistics, said the company has not received any shareholder resolutions on the pipeline. An Energy Transfer spokeswoman declined to comment and referred Bloomberg Briefs to a Sept. 13 memorandum about the pipeline by chairman and chief executive officer Kelcy Warren. Other investors are also pushing the issue. Boston Common Asset Management, for example, said last month on its website that it is helping to craft shareholder proposals for Marathon, Phillips 66 and Enbridge that it expects will be filed in coming weeks. The fund is focusing on these companies because the other major partners in the pipeline are limited partnerships and therefore can't receive proxy proposals from shareholders, Boston Common said. The uproar over the pipeline is part of a broader environmental and social debate over whether there is a need for more fossil fuel conduits across the U.S. and whether these projects trample over the rights of indigenous people. While some investors are raising their concerns with the energy companies themselves, other shareholder groups are going directly to the lenders funding the disputed pipeline. The group has also co-filed proposals at Marathon and is planning another at Phillips 66, Fugere said. Rebecca Adamson, founder and president of First Peoples Worldwide, which advocates for funding local development projects in indigenous communities, estimates that at least eight shareholder resolutions have been filed with energy companies and banks involved in the pipeline. The largest lenders involved in the pipeline include Citigroup Global Markets Inc., TD Securities USA LLC, Mizuho Bank Ltd., and Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., according to Bloomberg data. TD said it has retained law firm Foley Hoag LLP, an independent human rights expert, on behalf of the lenders to conduct a review and make recommendations to improvements to Energy Transfer's and Sunoco Logistics' social policies and procedures. Foley Hoag confirmed that it would be working on the review. Representatives at Wells Fargo and Mizuho did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Mitsubishi declined to comment. Some lenders are even taking the matter into their own hands. Norwegian bank DNB said last month that it was conducting an evaluation of how indigenous people's rights were being treated during the resolution of the conflict. The backlash over the Dakota Access crude pipeline may discourage companies from pursuing the construction of similar projects in the future without considering the impacts, said First Peoples Worldwide's Adamson.

Consumer, service and transportation businesses had more specific and detailed sustainability disclosures on material issues important to investors than companies whose models focus more on business-to-business sales, a study of 713 U.S. securities filings by the San Francisco-based Sustainability Accounting Standards Board found. Still, customers and investors don't have exactly the same needs, Guillot said. Customers may care about a company's exposure to forced labor or a chemical in its products, while investors may care about sustainability metrics that could drive profits and help them compare a company's performance to peers, she said. SASB is a non-profit that is working to set industry standards for companies to disclose material sustainability information in Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Boilerplate was found in 43 percent of all sustainability exposures analyzed, but was less common in European filers where there is more regulation on sustainability disclosure, SASB found. The fund says its ambition is to develop a portfolio in line with the 2-degree target that will be achieved by integrating climate analysis into investment process. AP2 has previously divested from companies dedicated exclusively to coal extraction and in oil and gas companies with major investments in new high-cost projects. In total, AP2 has divested from 76 companies due to financial climate risks. Analysis: Low-Carbon Index Performance May Worsen Source: Bloomberg Intelligence. Indexes that exclude fossil-fuel extraction companies or companies with high carbon emissions have generally underperformed their benchmarks by about half a percentage point this year, as oil and gas company shares rallied. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to exit the Paris climate accord and roll back regulations may support high-carbon company prospects and dim those for low-carbon solution providers. Declining renewables and low-carbon technology costs may provide longer-term low-carbon support. The index will contain both investment grade and non-investment grade bonds. The fund, which is set to list on the NYSE Arca, would be the first green bond ETF out of 1,900 ETFs currently trading and 1,200 in registration, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. A Van Eck spokesman declined to comment beyond what is contained in the public filing. The company offers more than 50 ETFs across equity, fixed income and currency markets, according to its website. The five year security paying a 2 percent coupon attracted investors from Europe, the Americas and Asia, according to a bank statement. Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led the sale. Here are some of the year's more unique structures, according to Ridley. Moody's rated the bond Aa3. While it is not technically a green bond because the proceeds are not used to fund a green project, bondholders have the option to receive their interest payments in the form of cash or voluntary carbon units. The carbon units will come from a reforestation project in east Kenya, IFC said. SNCF's Novel Transport Green Bond SNCF is using proceeds from green bonds to both refinance and fund the French rail system. The remaining portion of the bond proceeds will be used for building new infrastructure, the report said. Using a green bond to refinance an existing bond has a few benefits, HSBC's Ridley said. It could also be a benefit to the original bank lender. In the U.S., 9.7 percent of fund managers were women at the end of 2015, down from 11.4 percent prior to the financial crisis.

More than 14 percent of U.S. consumers looked for apparel and accessories made from natural materials in 2016, up from 12.9 percent last year, according to a Euromonitor International survey. Shoppers looking for clothes that were reused or recycled rose 2 percent this year. This shift to so-called sustainable clothing is threatening the underpinnings of a fashion industry that wants consumers to rapidly change styles and move on to the next hot trends. The challenge may come earlier than big retail chains expect. Consumers are more willing to shop at niche, smaller companies this season, according to Deloitte LLP. But fast-fashion companies are trying to respond. In 2013, H&M launched a worldwide garment-collecting initiative encouraging consumers to reuse and recycle their clothes. Zara launched its first sustainable line, Join Life, in September. And the very nature of high-turnover fast-fashion companies strikes many as unsustainable, she said. She said the biggest challenge for retailers will be to make sustainable products affordable and accessible to millennials. Lowering prices for sustainable collections would help these businesses stay relevant, as most consumers shop at H&M and Zara because of the cheap price tags. Still, some in the industry are pushing the notion that millennials will save money by spending a bit more on longer-lasting items. Kim founded Los Angeles-based Dosa after moving from Seoul. Her idea started in West Bengal, where she began collecting old saris to incorporate into new designs. Kim tracked her expenses in both regular and recycled production. With traditional clothing production, 40 percent of her expenses went to materials, 53 percent to labor, and 7 percent to shipping and other duties. With a recycled production, Kim spent 14 percent on materials, 81 percent on labor, and 5 percent on shipping and duties.

Sounds crazy, but the damage makes perfect business sense under the no pain, no gain policy driving the electric-vehicle boom in the U.S. California crafted the doctrine, with tough clean-air rules and a mandate that automakers sell some non-polluting vehicles if they want to do business in the Golden State. Nine others have adopted it, New York and New Jersey among them, and all told they make up close to 30 percent of the U.S. market. That goes a long way to explaining why zero-emissions models from more than 10 brands are on the roads, with more on the way. The hurdles may go higher: Brown, a Democrat with two years left in his term, signed a law ordering greenhouse-gas emissions be 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.

Investment includes venture capital, private equity, public markets and M&A. The move shows how even reluctant fuel producers are positioning themselves to take advantage of growing demand. The report, released Wednesday, lists forced labor and child labor, gender discrimination, as well as exploitative and dangerous working practices. Wilmar is looking into the allegations in order to be accountable to customers and stakeholders, Perpetual George, assistant general manager for Wilmar Group Sustainability, said in an e-mail. Wilmar, in a Nov. 29 statement released before the Amnesty report was made public, said it welcomed the investigation as it highlights labor issues within the wider palm oil industry, particularly in Indonesia.

As content of dubious authenticity swirls on platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google, many in the media worry consumers may lose trust in stories that are actually true. Maybe most uncomfortable are the social media companies, Facebook especially. They make millions in ad revenue by distributing information, but the last thing they want are the responsibilities that come with being a publisher, like ensuring stories are accurate. Shares of the social media and internet companies have underperformed the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index since the US election on Nov. 8. All exporters of gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten to the EU have to trace the origin of the four minerals. Importers must do due diligence checks. The group said unless independent evidence shows iQOS is substantially less harmful than smoking, such products should be regulated as tobacco. Unless an emboldened Republican Congress overturns Dodd-Frank, U.S. companies might have to do the same. Britain's prime minister would also like shareholders to hold binding yearly votes on the bafflingly complicated bonuses and long-term incentive plans that swell the pay of bosses. The response hasn't been effusive: ratios are misleading and difficult to compile, companies say, while some British corporate leaders argue that yearly pay votes would make it hard to recruit the brightest and the best (you know, people like them). But having already backed down from putting workers on boards, May should hold her ground here. Politically, it makes sense. Brits discovered this week that they face the longest period of wage stagnation in at least 70 years. Real earnings in 2021 are on course to be below their level in 2008.

Governance News in Brief Hidden: to copy text from: full story full terminal story Securities Regulators Warn of Risks to Auditor Independence Securities regulators urged companies and auditors to keep auditor independence issues in mind as enterprises begin to apply major new accounting rules and have questions about how to apply them. At the same time, ongoing dialogue between auditors and the companies, whose books they audit, carry benefits in improved financial reporting and better auditing, officials said Nov. 29. The announcement by the Rye, N.Y.-based asset manager ends the first attempt by any investor to utilize proxy access for gaining a board seat. The mechanism allows shareholders to nominate their own board candidates. Last month Gamco, which owns a 7.8 percent stake in NFG, nominated former Goldman Sachs partner Lance Bakrow as a proxy access candidate to the Williamsville, N.Y.-based natural gas company's nine-member board. Bakrow decided to withdraw his nomination, Gamco said in a Nov. 28 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ComScore, whose shares are down 30 percent this year, said last week that it would need to make accounting adjustments for some monetary transactions reviewed in the probe. The company also named a new chairman at the conclusion of a nine-month investigation that found the company lacked appropriate internal accounting controls. The biggest opportunities for impact investing are in emerging markets, especially in infrastructure, he said. Interviewed by Siobhan Wagner, Bloomberg Briefs, on Oct. 25. Comments have been edited and condensed for clarity. Q: Just to start off, I understand that you feel some impact investors are too picky, they apply too many investment screens, and this is causing a lack of deal flow. A: We always screen for those three things. It's more that we may say, for example, we want to do an infrastructure or financial inclusion deal, but we also want to be in a post-conflict country like Sierra Leone or Liberia. When we consider the investment opportunities in a country like that, we may find a transaction in a different sector, so not infrastructure or financial inclusion. It could be in agriculture or services. And because we want to be in that market, we will look at any sector. If impact investors want to scale up and invest a lot more, we really think emerging markets is where they can do it. If they invested even 1 percent of their portfolios in emerging market infrastructure, that would be enough to fill the financing gap. A: In a world where yields on sovereign debt, and things that are the big part of their portfolios, are close to zero, this is an attractive opportunity for them to get extra yield. A: What we're working on is various vehicles that allow institutional investors to invest in a big-ticket-size portfolio, rather than individual projects. We have a couple of models. One is through our asset management company. For example, we offer infrastructure funds, where if you want to invest equity in infrastructure, you can invest in an IFC-managed fund, and that fund invests in infrastructure projects. The second model we have on the debt side is a managed co-lending portfolio program. An insurance company has already made a commitment and we expect other investors to join the program. The idea there is they can invest in a larger ticket size: half a billion dollars or a billion dollars. We then take that money and invest it alongside IFC's own lending, project by project. A: I think it varies. There are fully commercial investors like pension funds and insurance companies, which are really just interested in the financial return. Then you have other investors, some high net worth investors, who are looking at both a financial and impact story. We think that infrastructure does offer a good impact story. Secondly, a lot of infrastructure investments have positive climate change benefits. A big part of our infrastructure program at the moment is in clean energy and retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency.

But despite relative ambivalence toward it by the Obama administration, research has continued apace. At the head of the pack are venture capitalists like Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who is said to be working on Trump's transition team. He's funded a fusion start-up called Helion Energy to pursue the ultimate dream of environmentalists. More than 100 plants have been canceled over the years. Fusion, meanwhile, would eliminate planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions if scientists could only harness its power. But that tantalizing promise of a grand solution has kept investors investing. A consortium of 35 countries are collaborating on a massive fusion project in southern France, called ITER. Fusion is also drawing in venture capitalists like Thiel, who think start-ups can achieve better results than national efforts. Energy from the reaction is used to generate electricity. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is among the backers of General Fusion, a British Columbia company that's designed a reactor that compresses hydrogen plasma into fusion reactions with hammer-like jolts.
