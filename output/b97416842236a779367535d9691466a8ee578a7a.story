Signaled panic, blood rush my embarrassment. Would I teach her to be pieces. To sing she motions simultaneously with her hands I watch her be in multiple musics. Through a virtuosic array of short lyrics, prose poems, longer narrative sequences, resolutions, and disclaimers, Layli Long Soldier has created a brilliantly innovative text to examine histories, landscapes, her own writing, and her predicament inside national affiliations. This strident, plaintive book introduces a major new voice in contemporary literature. She is the recipient of a Lannan Literary Fellowship, a Native Arts and Cultures Foundation National Artist Fellowship, and a Whiting Award. She lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
