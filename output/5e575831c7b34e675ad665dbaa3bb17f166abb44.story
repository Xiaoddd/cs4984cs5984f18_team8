This means that in order to ensure that global warming does not rise to 2C above pre-industrial levels, the target agreed to in the COP21 Paris Agreement which went into effect on November 4, 2016, these reserves cannot be extracted. However much oil ends up being taken out of the ground, much of it will go through pipelines. A corollary of stranded assets is that, in addition to oil reserves, some amount of pipeline capacity will become stranded assets as well. And just as oil and gas companies continue to drill, pipeline companies continue to build. This pipeline goes through the drinking water, sacred sites, and traditional lands of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (SRST), leading to an increasingly contentious conflict. ETP contends that it obtained all necessary permits and licenses from the federal government to build DAPL. Starting earlier this year, the SRST staged a protest to block construction of DAPL. The protest has grown to an encampment of 7,000 people, many of whom vow to hold out through the brutal North Dakota winter. The SRST is also taking ETP to court and as of November 2, the Army Corps was considering options for alternate routes. In the meantime, protesters are being arrested, attacked by dogs, pepper sprayed, and shot with rubber bullets. ETP has a terrible water track record, with pending contamination lawsuits in four states. One would think that by now pipeline companies have learned the lesson that their social license to operate is critical, and would seek to constructively work with communities to get that license. In Canada, the Northern Gateway Pipeline has been mired in delays caused by litigation with First Nations along its route. People gather to join the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's protest against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipe. I think there are two underlying forces that will make such conflicts more numerous and more brutal despite the economic evidence of their costs. The first is dramatic differences in time frames. This land has belonged to the tribe for generations and they feel a deep economic, cultural, and spiritual responsibility to the environmental consequences of pipelines. On the other hand ETP, and the banks supporting it, have a very short time frame. The stakes are high for DAPL. The sooner the pipeline is built and oil starts flowing, the sooner ETP starts making money and the banks start getting paid back. ETP is feeling intense pressure from both its oil company customers and its banks. The second powerful force is the ironic one of stranded assets. The rational response from these companies facing short-term market pressures is to get as much of these assets out of the ground as quickly as possible. This desire to pump is magnified if boards of directors are putting pressures on their CEOs (who have limited tenure in their jobs) because they believe the long-term prices of these assets will only decline. These pressures then translate to the pipeline companies who help bring these assets to market. Here they confront the legitimate rights of Indigenous Peoples over whose lands these pipelines must traverse. We are looking at a combustible mix of stranded assets due to environmental issues, closing windows of opportunity to get these assets out of the ground, and the rights of Indigenous Peoples and other communities to provide FPIC. Within this conflict is a potential solution. Just as capital markets are increasingly addressing environmental issues raised by oil and gas (such as pricing down these assets, pressuring companies to more accurately represent the value of these assets on their balance sheets, and demanding greater transparency on strategies for transitioning to a 2C world), they must do the same for social issues. Investors have enormous leverage to ensure FPIC before committing money and have an obvious self-interest in doing so, as the frequency and scale of conflicts between companies and communities continues to rise. The SRST recognizes the power of capital markets and has asked the NGO First Peoples Worldwide to coordinate a shareholder advocacy campaign. The standoff shows the pressing need for integrated reporting and better ESG data. All Rights Reserved. However much oil ends up being taken out of the ground, much of it will go through pipelines.

According to SRST Chairman David Archambault II, &a;ldquo;At the heart of our grievances is our water. ETP has a terrible water track record, with pending contamination lawsuits in four states. Just last month there was another leak at one of the company&a;rsquo;s subsidiary pipelines in Pennsylvania. In Canada, the Northern Gateway Pipeline has been mired in delays caused by litigation with First Nations along its route. I think there are two underlying forces that will make such conflicts more numerous and more brutal despite the economic evidence of their costs. The first is dramatic differences in time frames. The SRST&a;rsquo;s time frame is basically forever. This land has belonged to the tribe for generations and they feel a deep economic, cultural, and spiritual responsibility to the environmental consequences of pipelines. On the other hand ETP, and the banks supporting it, have a very short time frame. The sooner the pipeline is built and oil starts flowing, the sooner ETP starts making money and the banks start getting paid back. Exacerbating this difference in time frame, the relatively high price of the oil to be delivered is not guaranteed if the delivery schedule isn&a;rsquo;t met. second powerful force is the ironic one of stranded assets.

According to First Peoples Worldwide Founder and President Rebecca Adamson, &a;ldquo;The tribe is demanding that the market capture the full social and environmental costs of the pipeline, and investor response has been overwhelmingly positive. The standoff shows the pressing need for integrated reporting and better ESG data. standoff shows the pressing need for integrated reporting and better ESG data.
