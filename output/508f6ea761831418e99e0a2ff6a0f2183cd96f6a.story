But through her tears of happiness, Mossett urged viewers to continue their support for both the water protectors in North Dakota and protesters fighting pipelines around the world. The Dakota Access pipeline, which would carry up to 570,000 barrels of oil from the Bakken oilfields of North Dakota nearly 1,200 miles to a hub in Illinois, is far from the only pipeline under construction in North America. On the East Coast of the United States, the victory at Standing Rock resonated for opponents of the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which would carry natural gas 600 miles from West Virginia to North Carolina. Jane Kleeb, president of Bold Alliance and director of Bold Nebraska, told ThinkProgress that the decision to deny the easement at Standing Rock reinforces the power of having a diverse coalition rallying behind a cause. And while environmental activism is often painted as a liberal issue, Kleeb said there are plenty of fights taking place in more conservative states like South Carolina and Georgia over pipelines and the question of eminent domain. But the crude-oil-by-rail terminal, which would be built in Vancouver, Washington, just miles from Portland, Oregon, has attracted the attention of some environmental activists: In June, following the derailment of an oil train in Mosier, Oregon, 21 activists were arrested while protesting the practice of shipping crude oil by rail, with another 100 or so participating in the protest.
