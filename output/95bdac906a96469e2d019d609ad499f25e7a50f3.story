They fully expect to drill underneath Lake Oahe on Standing Rock Sioux treaty land. This statement serves as a wake up call for those who thought the battle was over. As a part of the NYC Corn Cob Bus Caravan, we set out to Oceti Sakowin camp to serve our indigenous brothers & sisters in support and prayer. The bus has taken a total of 5 trips and left many behind who chose to stand in solidarity. The increase of the harsh winter weather will mean the old but reliable bus will have to retire until the spring, but our team is steadfast in continuing the fight against the black snake. We are reaching out to our fellow New Yorkers, Tri-State friends and family, and supporters across the globe to help fund 100th Seed's FIRST caravan to Standing Rock. This is a grassroots effort of volunteers and activists who are willing to leave behind the holidays to support the fight throughout the winter and beyond. But we need your help. We hope to have our first trip between Dec. 18th and Jan. 2nd. With more to follow. All are welcome to join us. Stay blessed, thank you. Please try again. Sign in to track your impact.
