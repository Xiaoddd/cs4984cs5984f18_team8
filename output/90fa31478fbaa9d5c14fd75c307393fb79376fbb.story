Close Menu A Free Paper for Free People The Standing Rock Vision National How to beat Trump Peter Rugh Dec 20, 2016 Issue 220 It was approaching midnight on Friday, Dec. 2, when Halim Nurdin decided to take a break from his political science paper. The subject of his essay: democracy and inequality. The 24-year-old former Marine corporal, three years into a history degree at Long Island University, began scanning social media to see what his friends were up to when an item in his Facebook newsfeed caught his eye. Victory Day Less than 24 hours later Nurdin stepped off an airplane in Fargo, N.D. The following evening, his rented Chevrolet Cruiser rolled into the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. The first snowflakes of a blizzard were beginning to fall, but fireworks lit up the sky. Members of the Standing Rock Sioux and their supporters have worked to prevent a multibillion-dollar consortium, Energy Transfer Partners, from installing an oil pipeline on their land. Part of a 1,172-mile project intended to carry oil from the Great Plains to Mississippi River ports in Illinois, the Dakota Access Pipeline was slated to travel through burial grounds the Sioux hold sacred. What began over the summer as a small protest camp established by the tribe to impede construction blossomed over the fall into a tent city with 15,000 inhabitants. A half-dozen camps sprouted up, dozens of kitchens and schools, supply and medical tents. Tens of thousands of people travelled through Standing Rock. Nurdin was part of a deployment of veterans to the reservation that weekend. About 2,000 were expected to turn up; more than 5,000 arrived. Many, including Nurdin, had never attended a protest in their lives, but decided to take part as word spread on social media that they were needed. A young woman from the Bronx, Sophia Wilansky, was forced to undergo multiple surgeries after local law enforcement unleashed a torrent of rubber bullets and concussion grenades at the protectors, destroying bones in her arm. Such acts of brutality harkened back the 1960s, with its images of Alabama police attacking civil rights demonstrators with clubs, dogs, and fire hoses: uniformed men treating people like dirt to be washed from the face of the earth. It was as if the results of the presidential election were manifesting themselves even before Donald Trump took office. On Sunday, Dec. 4, as more veterans streamed into Standing Rock, word came down that the Army Corps of Engineers had denied Energy Transfer a permit to drill beneath the Missouri. Celebrations erupted in the camps. Yet throughout the rest of the nation, a different story has unfolded in recent months, perhaps the greatest victory the forces of ignorance, bigotry, fear, misogyny and violence in America have scored in decades. The rise of barbarism from beyond Standing Rock could nullify its accomplishments, if the lessons learned within the encampments go unheeded. Values The good news, you might say, is that Donald Trump has finally stripped away the last vestiges of respectability from American politics. Trump demonstrates unequivocally that there is no inherent dignity in any office, including the highest in the land. They demonstrated that persistent, collective acts of peaceful dissent can overcome concussion grenades, rubber bullets, schutzhund packs, tear gas, mace and the wealthiest corporations in history. For decades the political right billed itself as the party of patriotism, family and faith. In so doing, it has presented an opening for progressives to conquer and replenish moral high ground long ago ceded to the Republicans who have desecrated it. Kauff was arrested for blocking pipeline construction at Standing Rock in October and traveled there again for the mass veterans mobilization. In the wee hours of Dec. 5, the tent where he and around 30 other veterans were sleeping caved in during a snowstorm, exposing them to snow and gale-force winds. They sought shelter in a nearby medical tent. Later in the day, they were among the droves of protectors who took refuge from the storm in the nearby Standing Rock casino. There, a ceremony took place involving 500 former military personnel. But they realize if you carry animosity in your heart, it eats you up. The slogan made its rounds during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last summer, popping up on placards as if strategically placed there so that Hillary Clinton could use it in her acceptance speech and echo the masses. Love, after all, is a four-letter word. Actions give it substance. It was a statement that signified nothing. What politicians greasing the levers for a smooth transition of power miss is that Trump is not just another politician. And yet we must avoid the tendency to see protest as an end in itself, rather than a means of achieving power. Infiltrators were surrounded by security and forced to leave the camp. It will take a Standing Rock nation to hold him back.
