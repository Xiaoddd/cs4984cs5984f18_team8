Four protesters were arrested during the event. The activists support the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their concerns about the oil pipeline being built by Dakota Access. Blocking the entrance is part of a national effort that steps up other tactics that have included vigils and rallies, encouraging people to pull their money from the bank. There is also concern that the incoming Trump administration may change Obama administration policies, even after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers recently announced it had rejected the proposed route for the pipeline through a dammed section of the Missouri River by the reservation. Despite that victory, anti-pipeline activists worry that the project will be revived by Trump, who has expressed support for it. Osten said it is important to not only unite behind the tribe affected, but the 20 million people who live downriver who could be affected by the project and any effect it has on the environment and drinking water supplies. But the three protesters at the main entrance, joined by Harrison Greene, of Northampton, and Paxton Reed, of Osterville, at the back entrance, remained inside the bank. Police officers and members of the Fire Department were seen entering the building through a side door to speak to employees about how to handle the disruption. Around 1:30 p.m. firefighters and officers finally moved in on the protesters. Nelson said his staff is trained in dealing with situations that are both peaceful and ones that could turn violent. A firefighter first talked to the protesters at the main entrance and asked them to unlock the doors and remove their chains. Greene and Reed then voluntarily opened their door, Nelson said. Even though the protest was peaceful, Nelson said he had to call in five off-duty personnel to make sure that ambulances could continue to run and that his department would be ready for any other emergencies. Johnson-Kurts, 22, Osten, 55, Greene, 30, and Reed, 19, were all arrested and charged with trespassing, and will be arraigned in Eastern Hampshire District Court in Belchertown on Monday. An employee who answered the phone early Friday afternoon at the branch said no comment would be offered about the latest protest, which followed a peaceful protest held in front of the same branch Dec. 5. Judith Schmidt, vice president and head of corporate medial relations for TD Bank, said in an email that the bank endorses responsible energy development and has been listening to concerns about the pipeline. When investment decisions affect the climate, we are all stakeholders. When investment decisions affect the drinking water of millions of people in this country, we are all stakeholders. Protesters handed customers trying to enter the bank a sheet with information other credit unions and banks. Pioneer Valley resident Hayden Daiber said protesters would also speak to customers. The message was compelling to customer Travis Poston, of Philadelphia, who said he intends to pull his remaining money from the bank. Poston said he sees moral flaws in the support for the project, and is concerned about the aggressive tactics used to drive protesters away from the site in North Dakota. He praised those who were willing to be arrested in Amherst.
