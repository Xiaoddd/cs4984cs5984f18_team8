The series features dozens of interviews with local officials, Native American leaders and activists, as well as landowners and small business owners who will be affected by the potential construction. The route has the necessary permits in Montana and South Dakota, where activists are preparing to oppose the pipeline if construction goes ahead. The comments fly against much of the Republican support for the project, which has long touted job creation, energy independence and local tax revenue as a justification. The pipeline would carry a daily load of 830,000 barrels of crude oil from Alberta in Canada, along a 1,204-mile route to Steele City, Nebraska, where it will meet the existing Keystone pipeline and transport crude tar sands oil, which is dirtier and more energy-intensive to extract than other oil, down to refineries on the Gulf coast. It is likely that a significant amount of the refined product is destined for export, and the state department estimates that while the project will result in tens of thousands of temporary jobs, just 50 permanent positions will remain after construction. TransCanada says the pipeline will bring jobs, and that the route is safe and will be protected by state-of-the-art leak detection technology. TransCanada insists it has consulted all parties along the route, including Native American tribal leaders. The Obama administration blocked the project in 2015, after the state department found the construction would undermine US leadership in the fight against global warming. In Montana and South Dakota, advocates estimate that dozens of landowners were essentially forced to sign easements with TransCanada under the threat of eminent domain, the right by which private land is seized for public use. Art Tanderup, a Nebraska corn farmer and one of the remaining 90 landowners in the state yet to have signed an easement with TransCanada, said he and his wife planned to lay down their bodies to prevent the company from digging up their land. The Nebraska public service commission, which is administered by five elected commissioners, will hold public hearings over a week in early August, with a decision on the route proposal expected later in the year. A set of meeting minutes seen by the Guardian in the city of Baker, Montana, show that TransCanada representatives told local officials in February that they could commence construction of pipeline pumping stations in 2018, with a view to building the pipeline itself between 2019 and 2020.
