Add to Cart When a teen gets his or her license most parents get additional anxiety. With the number one killer of teens being car-related driving accidents, and 16-25 year old drivers being the number one age group ticketed by police for traffic violations, parents have good cause to feel anxious. Although the thought of a teen driver navigating the roadways alone can be worrisome for most parents, many have turned to technology to ease the stress. GPS tracking systems allow parents to be proactive in modifying and shaping the driving behaviors of their teen, and actually help build trust between parent and teen. With a GPS vehicle tracking solution validating a teen is exhibiting responsible and cautious driving behaviors, many parents allow the teen to have MORE freedoms. Having the ability to always know where your teen is and has been provides a parent with assurance, security and relief. GPS Tracking Key: The Recommended Teen Tracking Solution Negative Influences On Teen Driving Speeding: 1 out of 5 teenagers expressed that they think driving fast is fun. 1 out of 4 teen drivers, who also identified themselves as aggressive drivers, stated that they have drove 20 mph over the speed limit more than once. Over half of all teen drivers said they have exceeded the speed limit by over 10 mph more than once. Peer Pressure: Almost half of all teens stated that they drive more carefully when other teen passengers are not present in the vehicle. Less than half of the teens said they would speak up if a driver were speeding or driving in a scary manner. More than half of all teens stated that they talk on the phone while they drive. A driver speaking on the phone while driving is twice as likely to be involved in a traffic accident than someone not speaking on a phone. Positive Influences On Teen Driving GPS Tracking Systems: GPS tracking systems can send parents alerts via email or cell phone if a teen driver is driving at unsafe speeds. GPS tracking systems give parents peace-of-mind and teens additional freedom. Many insurance companies give discounts to drivers with GPS tracking systems. Curfews: Most drunk drivers are on the road from 10:00 p.m.-4:00 a.m. Almost half of all teen automobile deaths occur between the hours of 9:00 p.m.-6:00 a.m. Seat Belts: Teens use seat belts less than any other age group. GPS Tracking Device: How It Can Help GPS tracking systems can act as effective preventative mechanisms for many forms of negative driving behavior. Another positive impact that comes from using a GPS vehicle tracking solution is the additional freedoms and lowered insurance rates many teen drivers receive. When a teen driver receives additional freedom and parents receive the peace of knowing their teen is safe everybody wins. GPS Monitors Students For Truancy Technology Keeps Kids In Class & Grades Up The old saying is that those who do not miss a single class are much more likely to understand class material, understand curriculum and pass the course, but getting students to attend class regularly and on time has become a challenge for many school districts all across the United States. Although truancy is a problem plaguing school districts everywhere, one school district in Texas has adopted a new plan that uses GPS tracking to help boost class attendance, reduce truancy numbers and hopefully help high school students meet their academic goals. San Antonio Independent School District has been working closely with some parents to boost attendance of high school teens who have a track record of being truant. With the permission of the parental authorities, selected students are being directed to carry a handheld GPS unit that will monitor and document the students' whereabouts throughout the time they are suppose to be at school. Mentors are then assigned to monitor the real-time data for discrepancies, and will contact any student who is off their path. The great thing about the new technological approach to the age-old problem of students ditching class is that it has a two prong positive effect. The first being when students attend class the school district receives more financial support, and the second, and most important, is that once students begin attending class regularly their grades typically improve significantly. This helped promote more positivity for the student, showing the student that through dedication and perseverance a higher education and better life is attainable. Not to mention, working on a more concrete schedule teaches students about diligence, routine and responsibility. Many educational experts and teachers agree with the independent studies that verify there is a direct correlation between regular class attendance and better grades. Although when most people think of GPS tracking systems they think of the vehicle tracking technology used by businesses for fleet management applications, the truth is personal GPS tracking applications are just as prevalent now that GPS units have modernized for everyone to benefit from. Small, portable GPS units the size of a cellular phone or smaller are now being used from everything to overseeing teenage driving (teen tracking) to observing the movements of seniors diagnosed with memory-related illness (elderly tracking).
