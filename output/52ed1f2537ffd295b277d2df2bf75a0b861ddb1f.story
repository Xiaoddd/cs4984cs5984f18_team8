Published 6:47 p.m. CT Jan. 23, 2017 Buy Photo Workers clear trees from the Brandon's Reserve development, 1010 Warrior Lane, last year. M&R Holdings, of Urbandale, will be required to pay the civil penalty after a 30-day comment period ends on Feb. 17. Brees said M&R Holdings is also accused of failing to conduct some weekly self-inspections, which are required as part of its stormwater discharge permit issued by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. Other inspection documents were incomplete, she said. The inspections are required at construction sites that disturb more than 1 acre of land. Contractors are required to self-inspect for all stormwater controls on a weekly basis. Cities are required to inspect the sites quarterly. The inspections will continue until all homes are built and the ground is stabilized. A map filed with the city of Waukee shows how homes will be laid out in Brandon's Reserve, 1010 Warrior Lane. At least 11 of the lots have already been sold. The site came under scrutiny last fall after the developer had clear-cut hundreds of mature trees from the land. Brad Deets, development services director for Waukee, previously told the Register the land needed to be flattened to make way for homes and a new public street.
