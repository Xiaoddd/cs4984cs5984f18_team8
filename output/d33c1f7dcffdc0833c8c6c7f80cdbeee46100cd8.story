1806 on Thursday, Oct. 27, 2016, north of Cannon Ball. House Bill 1426, which passed Thursday with a 35-10 vote, increases penalties for riot offenses. About 700 arrests have been made during Dakota Access protests since August, including some individuals who were arrested more than once. The charge of engaging in a riot has been used more than 360 times during the pipeline protests, according to information provided by the Morton County Sheriff's Department. Sen. Kelly Armstrong, R-Dickinson, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, urged support for the bill and emphasized it does not make participating in a protest a crime. Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, argued against the bills, saying they were an overreaction to the protests. House Bill 1304, which makes it a Class A misdemeanor to wear a mask to conceal your identity while committing a crime or fleeing from a crime, passed with a 33-12 vote. Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, said some involved with pipeline protests have worn masks to conceal their identities to avoid being charged with a crime. All of the bills have emergency clauses, meaning they would take effect immediately if signed by Gov. Doug Burgum. Two of the three bills were amended slightly since the House approved them, and it was not immediately clear how quickly Burgum would receive them for consideration. The bill was introduced in response to protesters who attached themselves to equipment to stall construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.
