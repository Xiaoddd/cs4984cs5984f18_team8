FindLaw Caselaw United States US 10th Cir. UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. James Oliver REESE, Defendant-Appellee. No. 10-2030. Decided: December 10, 2010 Before BRISCOE, Chief Judge, HOLLOWAY, and MURPHY, Circuit Judges.Elizabeth D. Collery, Appellate Section, Criminal Division, United States Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., (Lanny A. Breuer, Assistant Attorney General; Greg D. Andres, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General; Kenneth J. Gonzales, United States Attorney, District of New Mexico; Louis E. Valencia, Assistant United States Attorney, District of New Mexico, with her on the briefs), for Plaintiff-Appellant. Jason Bowles of Bowles and Crow, (B.J. Crow of Bowles and Crow; William Marchiondo of Marchiondo Law Office, with him on the brief), Albuquerque, NM, for Defendant-Appellee. This appeal presents a single issue, whether the district court erred in granting defendant James Reese's motion to dismiss an indictment which charged Reese with three counts of possessing firearms while subject to a domestic protection order, in violation of 18 U.S.C. The United States now appeals. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. I Factual background In July 2003, Reese, his then-wife Jennifer Reese (Jennifer), and their three minor children moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where Reese served in the Navy. In August 2004, Reese and Jennifer separated. Aplt.App. at 104. Id. Jennifer also alleged that Reese owned firearms that could be used to threaten, injure or abuse another person. Less than a week after filing the motion for protective order, Jennifer formally filed for divorce in the Hawaii Family Court. On February 23, 2005, the Hawaii Family Court held a hearing on Jennifer's motion for protective order. Consequently, the Hawaii Family Court did not hear evidence from the parties or make any findings regarding Jennifer's allegations. Id. Id. Id. at 138. The Hawaii Family Court also signed a copy of a motion to amend the protective order that Reese had filed on February 23, 2005. In that motion, Reese's attorney handwrote a number of sentences modifying the terms under which Reese could contact Jennifer and the minor children. Id. at 116. In mid-2005, Jennifer and the three minor children moved to Maryland. At some point thereafter, Jennifer remarried. Reese relocated to Milan, New Mexico, and began working with his father, Oliver Reese, at his mining and exploration business in Milan. Reese also remarried. In May 2009, Jennifer called Brandon Garcia, a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives (ATF). Id. at 63. Jennifer subsequently e-mailed Garcia a copy of the protective order issued by the Hawaii Family Court. Id. at 63-64. At the police department, Hammond encountered Reese's new wife, Danielle Boucher-Reese (Danielle), sitting with her disabled son, who was in a wheelchair. Id. Id. Id. at 33. According to Danielle, she and Reese began arguing while en route to Albuquerque. Id. Id. Id. J.M. also remained in the residence with Reese. Danielle further indicated that she spoke with Jennifer later that evening and learned, for the first time, about Reese's alleged mistreatment of Jennifer and the existence of the protective order. Id. at 36. Id. Danielle consented to Hammond entering her residence and examining the guns. Id. Danielle was also concerned about Reese abusing the children in the residence. Hammond, together with an officer from the Milan Police Department, went to Reese's residence. Hammond knocked on the door of the residence, and Reese responded. Id. at 38-39. Id. Hammond advised Reese of his Miranda rights and, with Reese's consent, continued the questioning. Id. at 40. Hammond then placed Reese under arrest, handcuffed him, and escorted him to Hammond's patrol car. Id. Id. After placing Reese in the backseat of his patrol car, Hammond entered Reese's residence in order to check on the children inside. Id. Id. Id. As Danielle was going through the items in the residence, she asked Hammond if he wanted to look inside of a large combination safe located in the master bedroom. caliber Magnum handgun that she had purchased for Reese. Also contained in the safe were approximately twenty-three additional firearms. Shortly after Danielle and the victim's advocate arrived, an individual named Eddie Tan (Tan) arrived at the residence in his own vehicle. Hammond later learned that Reese, while sitting in the back of the patrol car, had used his cell phone (by dialing with his toes) to call Tan to request that he come to the residence. Id . at 47. After questioning Reese and obtaining his express consent, Hammond accompanied Tan to Reese's pickup truck, which was parked at the residence. Tan first looked for the keys inside a black backpack that was located in the back cab of the truck. Id. Id. Id. Id. After completing his inventory of the firearms found at Reese's residence and in Reese's truck, Hammond transported Reese to police headquarters in Milan. As Hammond completed the necessary paperwork (e.g., booking paperwork, criminal complaints, and statements of probable cause), he spoke with Reese, who was seated nearby. Id. at 52. On June 29, 2009, Jennifer, Danielle, and Danielle's mother all telephoned ATF Special Agent Garcia regarding the incident that had occurred involving Reese. Garcia in turn contacted Hammond, who provided him with additional details of the events leading up to Reese's arrest. Based upon the information provided to him, Garcia prepared an affidavit for a search warrant for both Reese's residence and his place of business. Garcia presented the affidavit to a magistrate judge, who issued the requested search warrant on June 30, 2009. The warrant was executed the following day, July 1, 2009, by ATF agents and three New Mexico state police officers. Approximately thirty-three firearms were seized from Reese's place of business. The first two counts alleged that Reese's possession of weapons occurred on or about June 27, 2009 (the two counts focused on Reese's possession of different weapons). at 11. At some point after the indictment was returned, Reese filed a motion with the Hawaii Family Court seeking to modify the protective order. That motion was apparently denied by the Hawaii Family Court due to the pending criminal charges against Reese. The bulk of Reese's motion was devoted to arguing that the fifty-year duration of the protective order issued by the Hawaii Family Court violated his Second Amendment rights. With respect to this latter argument, the motion emphasized that Reese had not been previously convicted of a felony or of a domestic violence misdemeanor. On January 6, 2010, the district court held a hearing on Reese's motion to dismiss. at 97 (quoting United States v. Skoien, 587 F.3d 803, 809 (7th Cir.2009)). Aplt.App. at 99. With respect to Reese's as-applied challenge, however, the district court agreed with Reese. Id. Id. Id. II In its appeal, the government challenges the district court's conclusion that 18 U.S.C. United States v. Dorris, 236 F.3d 582, 584 (10th Cir.2000). 18 U.S.C. 18 U.S.C. To begin with, the parties agree that Reese was, and remains, subject to a protective order issued by the Hawaii Family Court. U.S. Const. amend. II. Approximately two years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 128 S.Ct. Id. at 2816. Id. at 2821. Id. Id. The Supreme Court did not specify in Heller precisely what level of scrutiny a reviewing court must apply to a challenged law. Instead, the Court indicated only that the rational basis test is not appropriate for assessing Second Amendment challenges to federal laws. Thus, we must apply some level of heightened scrutiny and, in doing so, must look to analogous cases for guidance on precisely what level to apply. In recent months, both the Third and Seventh Circuits have applied intermediate scrutiny to Second Amendment challenges to federal firearm laws. 614 F.3d at 96. Id. at 97. The Third Circuit in turn concluded that the specific statute it was reviewing, 18 U.S.C. Id. In Skoien, the Seventh Circuit sitting en banc, applied a similar test and reached a similar result with respect to a different statute, 18 U.S.C. Skoien, 614 F.3d at 641. Id. Id. at 642. The initial question we must address is whether intermediate scrutiny is also appropriate for the statute challenged by Reese. Specifically, both statutes prohibit the possession of firearms by narrow classes of persons who, based on their past behavior, are more likely to engage in domestic violence. United States v. Williams, 616 F.3d 685, 692 (7th Cir.2010). Reese does not seriously dispute the assertion. Domestic assaults with firearms are approximately twelve times more likely to end in the victim's death than are assaults by knives or fists. Linda E. Saltzman, James A. Mercy, Patrick W. O'Carroll, Mark L. Rosenberg & Philip H. Rhodes, Weapon Involvement and Injury Outcomes in Family and Intimate Assaults, 267 J. Am. Medical Ass'n 3043 (1992). Part of this effect stems from the fact that some would-be abusers go buy a gun, see Susan B. Sorenson & Douglas J. Wiebe, Weapons in the Lives of Battered Women, 94 Am. J. Pub. Health 1412 (2004), and much from the fact that guns are more lethal than knives and clubs once an attack begins. Arthur L. Kellermann, et al., Gun Ownership as a Risk Factor for Homicide in the Home, 329 New England J. Medicine 1084, 1087 (1993). See also, e.g., Jacquelyn C. Campbell, et al., Risk Factors for Femicide in Abusive Relationships: Results from a Multisite Case Control Study, 93 Am. J. Pub. Health 1089, 1090 (2003); James E. Bailey, et al., Risk Factors for Violent Death of Women in the Home, 157 Archives of Internal Medicine 777 (1997); Douglas J. Wiebe, Homicide and Suicide Risks Associated with Firearms in the Home: A National Case-Control Study, 41 Annals of Emergency Medicine 771 (2003). And for this purpose the victims include police as well as spouses, children, and intimate partners. Responding to a domestic-disturbance call is among an officer's most risky duties. FBI, Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted 2008 Table 19 (2009). Finally, the recidivism rate is high, implying that there are substantial benefits in keeping the most deadly weapons out of the hands of domestic abusers. John Wooldredge & Amy Thistlethwaite, Reconsidering Domestic Violence Recidivism: Individual and Contextual Effects of Court Dispositions and Stake in Conformity vi (1999). The full recidivism rate includes violence that does not lead to an arrest. Carla Smith Stover, Domestic Violence Research, 20 J. Interpersonal Violence 448, 450 (2005). John H. Laub & Robert J. Sampson, Understanding Desistance from Crime, 28 Crime & Justice 1, 31 (2001). No matter how you slice these numbers, people convicted of domestic violence remain dangerous to their spouses and partners. 614 F.3d at 643-44. Williams, 616 F.3d at 693. Aplt. Br. at 34. We agree with the government. See 18 U.S.C. Instead, any such challenges could and should have been raised by Reese in the Hawaii Family Court. As for the district court's as-applied analysis, the court erred in focusing on the underlying protective order issued by the Hawaii Family Court instead of the challenged federal statute. For the reasons explained above, it was improper for the district court to engage in what was effectively a collateral review of the protective order. Moreover, the district court made no attempt to engage in the type of scrutiny that is typically considered in as-applied challenges to federal laws. Thus, the district court's order granting Reese's motion to dismiss the indictment must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings, i.e., to allow Reese's prosecution under the indictment. REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings. FOOTNOTES 1. In June of 2010, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is fully applicable to the States by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment. McDonald v. City of Chicago, 130 S.Ct. 3020 (2010). In doing so, the en banc court, upon review of the panel's opinion, rejected both the approach and the result adopted by the panel. Notably, the district court in this case relied on the panel opinion in Skoien and did not have the benefit of the Seventh Circuit's subsequent en banc ruling. 3. By agreeing to the imposition of the protective order, Reese arguably waived his Second Amendment rights, since the order expressly prohibited him from possessing firearms and indeed required him to turn over any firearms and ammunition to Hawaii law enforcement officials. Moreover, it is clear from the record that Reese was well aware of the restrictions placed on him by the protective order as well as the impact of that protective order under federal firearms laws. 4. Right To Life, Inc., 551 U.S. 449, 476 (2007), we are persuaded, for essentially the reasons outlined above, that the government could satisfy these requirements. 5. We have not, to date, issued a published decision reaching this conclusion. BRISCOE, Chief Judge. All rights reserved.
