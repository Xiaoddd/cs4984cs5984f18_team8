Earthling Opinion Adapting Fearlessness, Nonviolence, Anarchy and Humility in the 21st century. La misma forma de la Tierra se percibe y es parecida a las constelaciones. Recientemente hemos aprendido de algunos artefactos que definen claramente este reflejo. La otra piel es un mapa estelar. Podemos ver ahora que muchas de actividades Lakota fueron programadas para reflejar movimientos celestiales. Al nivel humano dentro de la familia extendida, este reflejo, esta reciprocidad toma la forma de respeto mutuo entre parientes de sangre. El reflejo de la imagen alada implica que este mismo poder es mandado hacia abajo como respuesta. El pueblo Lakota viven en un Universo compasivo. Cuando oramos de esta manera, lo que se hace en los cielos se hace en la Tierra, de la misma manera. Research into Lakota stellar theology has added new dimensions to our understanding of how this Indigenous People generated the mentality for experiencing the sacred. It shows that they felt a vivid relationship between the macrocosm, the star world, and their microcosmic world on the plains. There was a constant mirroring of what is above by what is below. The very shape of the Earth was perceived as resembling the constellations. For example, the red clay valley which encircles the Black Hills looks like (and through Oral Tradition is correlated with) a Lakota constellation which consists of a large circle of stars. They correlated several of the constellations to specific sites in these hills. We say it is the heart of our home and the home of our Heart. Some people look at the stars and see only distant suns scattered about the night sky, others see patterns of warriors, animals, and see creatures that they view as governing their everyday lives. They are a pair of tanned hides: one hide is an earth map with buttes, rivers and ridges, etc. marked on it. The other hide is a star map. The star knowledge helps us to understand this temporal spacial dimension more fully. We can see now that many Lakota activities were timed to mirror celestial movements. Thus, when the Lakota observed the movement of the Sun through their constellations, they were receiving spiritual instruction. Their observations when interpreted by Lakota Oral Tradition and their star and Earth maps, told them what to do, where to do it and when. Each Spring, a small group composed by especially devoted members from several Lakota bands journeyed through the the Heart of Everything That Is, synchronizing their movements to the motions of the Sun along the ecliptic. As the Sun moved into a particular Lakota constellation, they travelled to the site correlated with that constellation and held ceremonies there. As the pattern moves across the Sun at sunrise and sunset, creation is filling, lighting and smoking the pipe with a sacred hoop where all of creation is present, altogether. On Earth, the Lakota participate in this same ceremony of renewal in the same way. A fulfillment of the unicity of the entire Universe. For the Lakota, cosmological systems, astronomical knowledge and attitudes towards the Earth, do not stand alone apart from culture, ceremonies, social organizations, and the art. The mirroring in this work expresses by various artistic means the concept of reciprocity. Also the design affirms that for the Lakota the Cosmos is a house of relatives. On the human level within the extended family, this mirroring, this reciprocity takes the form of mutual respect between blood relatives. An hourglass figure (two triangles joined at their apexes) represent a prayer. The lower part triangle has to do with the Earth and the upper part is the heavens. The design represents a prayer from Earth going to heaven and been met halfway by the heavenly bodies. The bird, especially the eagle, is a Lakota symbol for that power which mediates (or carries) prayer from below to above. The mirroring of the winged image implies that this same power is sent back down in response. In other words, prayer is answered. The Lakota live in a compassionate Universe. Her art teaches this, teaches that the Universe is created and sustained by mutual respect and compassion. Everything in creation comes from and returns to the center. For the Lakota to make relatives in this manner transforms a strange and otherwise dangerous world into a house of relatives, into a cosmic extended family where all interactions are founded on mutual respect. The Creator put the stars in a manner so what is in the heavens is on Earth, what is on Earth is in the heavens, in the same way. When we pray in this manner, what is done in the skies is done on Earth, in the same way. Together, all of creation participates in the ceremonies all year. The Great Spirit intended that we must always hold the Black Hills special to our hearts, so we are reminded every night that we have a sacred home. And, all one has to do to be in the Heart of Everything That Is, is to look at a star pattern and be spiritually with the Black Hills. A constant renewal of relationship by traveling home, to that special place, with the stars. So tonight, walk outside and look up. See the Black Hills Sacred Ceremonies of Spring, and you will understand and know why this place is special. And return, in the manner the Lakota have done for thousands of years, to the Heart of Everything That Is, to the heart of our home and the home of our heart. Then when the Sun passes through each part of the star pattern, prepare to travel home and renew the circle, once more, that the children of the Earth from all directions, may all live well in the manner suited to the way the Power of the World lives and moves to do its work, that we may all be well, altogether, and with our generations, walk on the sacred red road in a dancing manner.
