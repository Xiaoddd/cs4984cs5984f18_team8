The lawsuit is aimed at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has claimed responsibility for the spill. The mine spill ultimately tainted waters in Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. The territory, which spans 27,425 square miles, also occupies portions of northeastern Arizona. Winning this battle is as simple as choosing to abstain from the violent corrupt old system and participating in the new and peaceful system that hands the power back to the people. We feel that PIVX is this system. PIVX takes the control the banking elite has over money and gives it back to the people. It is the ultimate weapon in the battle against the money changers and information controllers because PIVX is the only cryptocurrency in existence that allows for completely anonymous storage while simultaneously paying interest.
