Now, the protesters should respect the law and peacefully leave the protest area. The well-being and property of ranchers, farmers and everyone else living in the region should not be threatened by protesters who are willing to commit acts of violence. Now, state, local, tribal and federal authorities need to coordinate their efforts to help ensure that the protesters comply and leave. In the meantime, we will continue to call on the Obama administration follow the established procedure for siting important infrastructure projects and approve the easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline. Twice challenged and twice upheld, federal courts found that the Army Corps had followed the appropriate process, the tribe was properly consulted and the project could lawfully proceed.
