We have been researching the issues the pipeline may cause, and becoming inspired by the stories of the 100s of people in the peaceful community of Standing Rock. With the harsh winter quickly approaching we have decided to take action ourselves and will be making a trip from Toronto to the Standing Rock Reserve, bringing supplies to help winterize the community. To do this, the people that are part of the protest will need money for supplies that will be turned into housing (I.e. teepees, and yurts) and clothing. We would like to contribute by purchasing these shelter supplies, a large water filtration system, and new winter clothing. My family and I had a rude awakening at the border between the USA and Canada. We were denied and sent back to the Canadian side because the officials of the border control had decided that they did not want the three of us entering their country to better humanity. I do not apologize for wanting to help the world, caring about environmental issues and trying to provide help to ongoing humanity issues. The experience was such an eye- opener so we decided to create a poster and stand under a border sign in Windsor to let passersby read and listen to what had happened to us in those 24 hours. In all it was extremely disappointing, I personally did not expect to be denied and detained at all. Maybe I am just naive, or expected more from the officials to understand we were not a threat.
