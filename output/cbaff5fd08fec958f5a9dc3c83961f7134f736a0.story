The statement was delivered via email to a handful of Indigenous journalists and news outlets and was said to be in response to a letter that Native leaders had sent to the former secretary of state asking for her help, as the Indigenous water protectors and their allies have faced tanks, militarized police forces, mace, and attack dogs as they've stood their ground in protest of the tar sands pipeline. Fed-up about her months-long silence, Indigenous youth from the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes also demonstrated outside Clinton's campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, New York on Thursday asking for some sort of acknowledgement. The statement from director of coalitions press Xochitl Hinojosa, who oversees Hispanic, black, and women's media for the Clinton campaign, reads in full: We received a letter today from representatives of the tribes protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. From the beginning of this campaign, Secretary Clinton has been clear that she thinks all voices should be heard and all views considered in federal infrastructure projects. As that happens, it's important that on the ground in North Dakota, everyone respects demonstrators' rights to protest peacefully, and workers' rights to do their jobs safely. In other words, you're going to protest by our rules. You're going to do it as we tell you. Or you can't protest. How, exactly. Despite the treaties we made. Is we all know Hillary Clinton didn't write this. Not a word. She approves, that's it. This is the world we cover. Because of people like you, another world is possible.
