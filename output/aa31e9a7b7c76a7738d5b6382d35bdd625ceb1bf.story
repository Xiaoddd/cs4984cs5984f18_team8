The sun sets behind an oil well in Edmond, Oklahoma. The increased seismicity is a relatively new phenomenon, simultaneous with the uptick in oil and natural gas activities in the state over the last decade. Though Oklahoma typically experienced zero to a couple magnitude 3 or greater quakes annually, the rate shot up to 20 in 2009. In 2013, the state had 109 such earthquakes followed by 579 in 2014, 903 in 2015, and 623 in 2016. In other words, the state went from some two sizable quakes a year to two or three a day. Fracking involves shooting a high-pressure stream of water, sand, and chemicals into the ground to release gas from shale. But in the process, hazardous fracking fluid and toxically salty water rise to the surface as well, so to dispose of this dangerous waste, companies pump it down a different opening deeper under the shale to rest permanently in a well of porous rock. In 2009, companies in Oklahoma pumped 849 million barrels of wastewater into wells. By 2014, that number hit 1.5 billion. Then on November 6, 2016, a 5.0 earthquake hit nearby Cushing. The Pawnee Nation has retained the services of law firm Weitz & Luxenberg, aided by Brockovich, to sue Eagle Road Oil LLC, Cummings Oil Company, and 25 other oil and gas companies for damage to its historic governmental buildings and reservation property resulting from what it alleges are human-induced quakes. At the damaged main communal building, a former school house built in 1878, white teachers used to teach skewed versions of Native American history to Pawnee students. Now oil companies are trying to school the Pawnee tribe in what they say is really going on with the seismicity, deflecting blame from the salt-water deposit wells. Eagle Road and Cummings did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Heading to Tribal Court Even though he was raised in San Diego and is no stranger to earthquakes, Andrew Knife Chief, executive director of the Pawnee nation, recalled the particular shock of the 5.8 magnitude quake. You could feel it. It kept going and going. The tribe has had to deal with the ensuing emotional fallout among it members and physical damage to its buildings. To boot, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt was a long-time Oklahoma politician who championed the oil and gas industry, a fact that leaves Brockovich and others skittish about what protections will remain in place to prevent earthquakes. And though it has found its reservation land shaking, the Pawnee Nation is bringing the arbitration against oil companies to its home turf: the tribal court. When non-Native American entities lease property on reservation land, as the oil companies have done, they agree to the jurisdiction of the tribal court, which often has a lighter docket and can more swiftly process cases. Brockovich visited a Pawnee town hall earlier this year and was back in the state at Oklahoma State University earlier this month with Bob Bowcock, an associate and water treatment engineer, to hold a colloquium about earthquakes and the plight of the Pawnee. The case will likely be a battle of experts in structural engineering on the cause of the damage, and liability on the part of the oil and gas companies remains up for debate. Kim Hatfield, chairman of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association's (OIPA) induced seismicity working group, recognizes the need for preparedness near the Pawnee reservation and in Cushing even as he allays fears. Boak acknowledges the continued risk for major seismic events in the region but says there is scant data to predict them.
