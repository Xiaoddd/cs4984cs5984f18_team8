Concerned individuals like you came together and spoke out in support of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and their fight to protect their sacred land and their water. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Earthjustice remain undaunted in our commitment to challenge the easement in court. Now our voices are being ignored. The Army Corps of Engineers is moving forward with the construction of the pipeline without completing an environmental impact statement, putting the drinking water of millions of people at risk of contamination. The White House comment line is finally back up after several weeks of being shut down. Call President Trump, tweet at him, leave a Facebook message, or add your name to the list of people who oppose this pipeline and let him know loud and clear that we will not back down and we will not be ignored. Your personalized message will be added along with the following letter and delivered to the White House: Important Notices and Resources All information submitted with your comment (name, address, etc.) may be placed in the public record for this proceeding. Do NOT submit confidential or sensitive information. By taking action, you will receive emails from Earthjustice. Learn more on our Privacy Policy. I am one of tens of thousands of people who strongly oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline. I am one of many concerned individuals speaking out in support of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and their fight to protect their sacred land and their water. Unfortunately, our voices are being silenced. The Army Corps of Engineers' decision to move forward with the construction of the pipeline without completing an environmental impact statement will put the drinking water of millions of people at risk of contamination. I am writing to you to express my opposition to the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, and to let you know that I will not back down and I will not be silenced. Remember me. Using the power of law to defend our right to a healthy environment.
