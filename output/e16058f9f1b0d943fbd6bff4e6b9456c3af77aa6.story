In November, attendees at the Indian National Finals Rodeo (INFR) in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the Gene Autry Festival in Los Angeles were invited to place their handprint on the bold, blue background of the tipi, which represents the element of water, of major significance in Native culture. While on display, the tipi quickly became filled inside and out with red handprints of men, women and children as young as six months old who wanted to show their support to those protecting the water for today and generations to come. Saginaw Grant, a Native actor, Korean War veteran, dancer and motivational speaker placed his handprint at the Gene Autry Festival. Some people have asked what I plan to do with the tipi. InterTribal Buffalo Council of Rapid City supported the tipi project to be displayed next to their own tipi and booth at INFR and the Gene Autry Museum. The tipi will again be displayed Jan. 14, 2017, in Litchfield, Ariz., along with other shows throughout the year.
