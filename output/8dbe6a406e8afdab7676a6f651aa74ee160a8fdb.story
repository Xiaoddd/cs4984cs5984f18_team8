Slithering across the northern plains of America is the Dakota Access Pipeline, now 70 percent complete. The pipeline will transport hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude oil from the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota more than 1,100 miles to an oil tank farm in Illinois. Clean drinking water for 18 million people, sacred native lands stolen by the U.S. government and subsequently privatized, and a centuries-old and still-perpetuated practice of environmental racism and aggression against indigenous people in America. A handful of billionaires. Our land was taken, our language was forbidden. Our stories, our history, were almost forgotten. Sites of cultural and historic significance are important to us because they are a spiritual connection to our ancestors. Even if we do not have access to all such sites, their existence perpetuates the connection. Within the tribes, natives experience the highest rate of poverty of any racial group in the country. The land slated for construction of the pipeline was given to the Sioux in the Treaty of Fort Laramie in the mid-1800s. In the coerced treaty, the tribe conceded much of their land, making it available for the eventual private appropriation for construction of the pipeline. In the 1940s, Lewis A. Pick of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intentionally flooded hundreds of thousands of acres of tribal lands with a series of dams in a public works project along the Missouri River. When 200,000 acres of land in the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Nations were flooded by the Pick-Sloan Plan from the Oahe Dam, socioeconomic and cultural life for the Sioux suffered permanent consequences. Living members of tribes today experienced this intentional act of aggression from the vintage Corps. Archaeological evidence suggests the Missouri River has been sustaining human life for more than 10,000 years. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued permits for more than 200 water crossings for the Dakota Access Pipeline, including two crossings of the Missouri River, one of Little Missouri, and one under Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock reservation. Warren Between 2009 and 2015, the number of pipeline spills and leaks rose by almost 60 percent, a number which the Associated Press reported roughly matched the rise in U.S. crude oil production. The Dakota Access Pipeline is approximately 70 percent complete and is estimated to carry between 470,000 and 570,000 barrels of oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois. The Dallas Morning News reported the daily oil capacity of the DAPL is equal to 6 percent of total current U.S. domestic crude oil production. As capacity increases, so do the risks of deadly spills. Not so here. Domestic oil pipelines, unlike natural-gas pipelines, require no general approval from the federal government. Further investment in pipelines with no federal oversight coupled with the knack of corporations to reduce costs of construction and maintenance in the never-enough quest for profits is setting the poorest communities in America up for future disaster and further dispossession. In addition to his 23,000 square-foot mansion in Preston Hollow, Warren also owns ranches in Austin, Colorado, and east Texas, as well as a private island off the coast of Honduras. Less competition can mean higher prices and result in larger, powerful, and autocratic institutions, but potentially fewer superfluous pipeline paths that result from private ownership conflicts. I do not play for companies who defile nature, or companies who attack demonstrators with trained attack dogs and pepper spray. On Sunday, November 27, Browne and artist Bonnie Raitt played a benefit concert for protesters fighting the pipeline. While investment in infrastructure may alleviate immediate shortages and stopgap job creation, the short-term approaches of oil transfer and refinement leave people at risk for generations to come. After all, it is primarily older pipelines that burst and cause great damage. A pipeline built in such close proximity to the sovereign soil of the Sioux may sound a reasonable sacrifice to someone with quarterly profits in mind, but not to people hoping to raise children and grandchildren on land they can neither sell nor trade. The semantics of sovereign soil complicate the options of natives to evacuate future disasters and permanent destruction of land they consider sacred. Long after Energy Transfer Partners falls and Kelcy Warren and his investors are in the ground, the Standing Rock Sioux will be on the land he considers potential collateral damage. These are our only remaining homelands. We have to protect them. Protesters were attempting to clear a blockade of two burnt military trucks on Highway 1806 blocking access to emergency services. More than 400 protesters have been arrested in Standing Rock, leading to multiple incidents of violence between the protesters, police, and the private security firm hired by Dakota Access. While hundreds of protesters have been arrested and charged with crimes, not one security contractor was charged with acts of assault against natives or activists. As insult to injury, protesters have faced humiliating strip searches for misdemeanor charges. The imbalance in arrests represents only the tip of an iceberg of injustice. Instead of waiting for the verdict from the court, Dakota Access dug up the sites anyway, prompting the Judge to issue a too-little-too-late order of protection to stop construction. In other words, Dakota Access was rewarded for disrespecting the jurisdiction of the court and, as result, the law does not apply to the protection of those lands anymore as there is no longer anything to protect. Across the country, many thousands more have gathered in solidarity. For years, Gallup has shown more than 75 percent of Americans want more investment in renewable energy and fewer than 40 percent want continued investment in fossil fuels. Warren and his company Energy Transfer Partners are not simply ignoring the desires of activists and natives in defense of clean drinking water, but also that of most Americans. Bloomberg reported ETP scrapped plans for a new gas pipeline in Michigan after facing opposition from environmentalists. This time, however, Warren and ETP appear to be doubling down on the pipeline. As a publicly-traded company, one could even argue Dakota Access is living up to the legal mandate to provide profit for shareholders above all other factors. She was asked to leave the building by security and a formal complaint was lodged with Dallas Police Department. Bluehorse has high hopes for a change of heart and has petitioned him on the grounds of humanity. In the case of the Dakota Access pipeline, rivals appear to include not only competitors within Big Oil, but also protesters, journalists, and natives. One female filmmaker is facing a 45-year sentence for covering events at the camp. Many more journalists have been tased, attacked, and arrested. Arrest warrants were also issued for Green Party presidential and VP candidates Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka. A 25-year-old female activist and candidate for Congress was shot with a rubber bullet in the back at point-blank range at Sacred Stone camp while interviewing a protester on camera. When private security officials and Dakota Access construction workers sought extrajudicial crowd-control and vengeance, a pregnant woman and a child were victims to their acts of unlawful aggression. The profound lack of justice for Standing Rock was compounded when North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple declared a state of emergency and brought in the National Guard, armed with industrial pepper spray tanks, noise machines known to cause permanent hearing damage, tasers, and military vehicles. The influx of funding has increased the police presence; however, emergency services have failed to protect those exercising their First Amendment right to peaceably assemble. When a brush fire broke out near the Oceti Sakowin camp, Morton County Fire Department ignored the calls and sent no emergency vehicles. In late November, Governor Dalrymple ordered an emergency order of evacuation of thousands of protesters from the camp. As a result of the order, approximately 2,000 veterans joined protesters to offer protection and support under the banner: Veterans Stand for Standing Rock. The ongoing water crisis in Flint, Michigan, the lead-laced blood of East Chicago children, and the Dakota Access Pipeline have elevated environmental racism to public consciousness within the last year. Now with the rise of centralized, autocratic corporations, that legacy continues under a new guise and with the implied consent of the federal government through deafening silence from the White House and relevant federal agencies. The pipeline has wavered between court-ordered delays and approvals and the destiny of the sacred lands and environmental safety of Standing Rock are unknown. Standing Rock Chair Dave Archambault II has requested President Obama take action to reroute the pipeline before the presidency changes hands. While Obama ordered a temporary halt on construction, later rescinded, he has been accused of remaining altogether too removed from the issue. While the words display interest in fair representation for native nations, the mistreatment of protesters has been enabled to continue with inaction. Kelcy Warren has built Energy Transfer Partners into a 71,000 mile network of pipelines across the country. It is a matter of mere inconvenience for Warren that his dream comes at the expense of thousands of living nightmares. Early in December, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied Dakota Access an easement it needs to complete the pipeline. Almost on cue, the Belle Fourche pipeline ruptured 150 miles from the Sacred Stone camp in early December, dumping more than 130,000 gallons of oil into the Ash Coulee Creek along with more than 46,000 gallons of oil on nearby lands.
