Home Archive Native Nations Rise March: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Renae Ditmer by Rob Capriccioso Mar 13, 2017 Like any protest, the Native Nations Rise March had its ups and downs. And they resolved to keep highlighting and working on the issue as it continues to wind through the American court system. Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II and Chairman JoDe Goudy of the Yakama Nation put out statements as part of the march against the doctrine, making the point that the tribal fight for clean water is also a time to raise awareness about an antiquated system of dispute resolution utilized by the U.S. judicial branch that views tribes as lesser institutions under Christian principles. IEN was one of the co-organizers of the event, along with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Native Organizers Alliance, so Mossett would have easily been able to fill Marraco in on the not-too-hard-to-understand reasons for the march, if asked. Another bad thing that happened as part of the march had nothing to do with the press, but rather, the opinions of people who chose to boo Archambault as he spoke at one point during the event. Archambault has faced criticism from some protesters of the pipeline who feel he worked too hard to help shut down the protest camps. Archambault, though, has said that was not because he wanted to make it easier for the federal government to destroy the water of his people. He felt the job had been done on the ground, but once Trump secured the easement for the pipeline, the focus, he believed, had to turn to a new front. Booing is fair and free speech. Such is tribal politics, and such is American politics. And then there was the ugly that came as part of the march. Soon, many Native Americans were calling for punishment for Frates by her employer, and she was deluged with messages demanding for her to resign or be fired.
