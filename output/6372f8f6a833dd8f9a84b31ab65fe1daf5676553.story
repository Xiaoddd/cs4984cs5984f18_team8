Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault remained defiant, repeating his call for President Obama to stop the project. Share story By Lynda V. Mapes Seattle Times environment reporter The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is moving toward kicking protesters out of the main North Dakota camp they have used since last April to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline. The Corps will close access to a parcel of land it owns near the Missouri River on Dec. 5, the agency announced Friday. But all access to the present camp on the north side of the river will be closed. About the DAPL protest The Trump administration has advanced the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipeline projects. And here's what we're reading related to the controversy. March 28: What the completed Dakota Access pipeline means for key players. Feb. 22: Preparing to leave, Standing Rock protesters ceremonially burn camp. Feb. 1: Hundreds rally as the Seattle City Council considers divesting from Wells Fargo because of its role as a Dakota Access Pipeline lender. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says it will push back. Unaffected is the Camp of the Sacred Stones, which is on private land a short distance south. The tribe is fighting the completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which it says will endanger the drinking water of the tribe and millions of people downstream. The tribe also says sacred sites have been destroyed in construction and remain at risk if the project continues. He reiterated his call for President Obama to stop the project and deny an easement Dakota Access needs to compete the oil pipeline. Vowing to stay, many demonstrators had begun winterizing their camps. By some estimates there are as many as 5,000 people in the Oceti Sakowin camp, named for the Seven Council Fires of the Sioux, at this time. Numbers have fluctuated up and down throughout the resistance to the project. Campers can move to the new area provided by the Corps, wrote John W. Henderson, commander for the Omaha district. Archambault pushed back, stating that the best way to protect public safety is to deny completion of the project as the tribe has been insisting since it was presented to the tribal council in 2014. It has by now built the pipeline all the way to the edges of the easement it needs from the Corps of Engineers. The pipeline is planned from Bakken oil fields of North Dakota to Illinois, where it would tie in with an existing pipeline to refineries in the Midwest and on the Gulf coast. The project was never examined under an environmental impact review but instead was approved under a fast-track process that three federal agencies have stated was not adequate.
