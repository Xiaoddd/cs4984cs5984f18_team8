Philadelphia, July 27, 2016. Break the rules, creatively. Here in Austin, Texas, activists love to hold rallies at the state capitol building. Neither will petitions or angry letters. Instead, if we really want to disrupt this ongoing, dangerous political coup, we need to find new tools and more creative ways to use them. Make no mistake, the threats posed by the incoming fascist oligarchy are immense, and unique. In response, we have to come out by the 10,000s and be willing to act in ways that the state has never seen before. There is a front line waiting to be created outside of every Wells Fargo, outside of every Chase bank, and we can all be doing this. The bad publicity is as, or more important, than the actual financial cost of losing our business. Remember, the purpose of this bank action is to make continued investment in the Dakota Access Pipeline seem like a risky proposition.
