Sorry for the long break, it's been quite the year and my priorities had to shift for a while, but I'm back. What a time to be back... Like many of you, I have been emotional, scared, angry, and just riding a rollercoaster of feelings with this election cycle. The Women's March was the most uplifting, inspiring moment during a time of such turmoil. It brought me hope and a feeling of solidarity, and then it was over. This has made me so frustrated and angry that I started looking up ways to fight the changes I'm seeing. It seems that everything we have been fighting for during the last 8 years is going down the drain in a matter of days, and it is shaking me to my core. In college, as a biology major, I was taught the science of climate change. I was taught the importance of vaccination. I was taught how the peer review process works, and how to discriminate between fact and fiction. As children, we are taught not to discriminate, not to hate, and to generally be nice to our fellow humans, even if they disagree with us. This administration seems to counter each and every value that has ever been instilled in me. As far as the election, what's done is done. We have a President. We have marched and protested. Something to remember: change comes with each new administration. The blocking of funding to the EPA & USDA temporarily is not unheard of. Hope is not lost. For those hoping this administration will be better than it seems, maybe that will happen. Until we know, we have to hold them accountable and protect the advances we've made thus far. We have to protect each other and this country. We can protest peacefully and do an incredible job at getting our voices to be heard, but then we need to follow through and DO something about it. We haven't lost those rights, but we have forgotten how much of a difference each one of us can make. This is OUR government, go remind them. Be careful, be peaceful, and be safe. Caged Bird Related Poem Content Details BY MAYA ANGELOU A free bird leaps on the back of the wind and floats downstream till the current ends and dips his wing in the orange sun rays and dares to claim the sky. But a bird that stalks down his narrow cage can seldom see through his bars of rage his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing. The caged bird sings with a fearful trill of things unknown but longed for still and his tune is heard on the distant hill for the caged bird sings of freedom. The free bird thinks of another breeze and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn and he names the sky his own But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing. The caged bird sings with a fearful trill of things unknown but longed for still and his tune is heard on the distant hill for the caged bird sings of freedom. Theme images by merrymoonmary.
