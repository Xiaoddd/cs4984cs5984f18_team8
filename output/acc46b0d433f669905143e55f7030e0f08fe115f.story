Henderson Thanksgiving is the most beloved holiday of the year in my family, and perhaps in yours. In rural North Dakota, thousands of Native American water protectors and their non-native supporters are standing against state violence and corporate greed to defend their land and their water. There were more than five thousand people in the main encampment there as of yesterday, and perhaps more on the way. And thus the decision by the Morton County police to use water cannons against 400 men and women was especially vicious. They used pepper spray and flash grenades, and hundreds of people were injured. One young woman may lose her arm. To Energy Transfer Partners, a Fortune 500 corporation, the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline is worth any amount of pain it needs to inflict. The pipeline, if completed, will carry half a million barrels of crude oil daily. The pipeline was moved from its original path near Bismarck due to community opposition there, and in what surprises precisely no one, the new route now runs very close to the Standing Rock reservation and threatens the Missouri River. History has a way of repeating itself, and the US government breaking its word to native people, and destroying their land for profit, is nothing new. We can write a new story. The first Thanksgiving, as the legend goes, was a meal shared by Native Americans and British colonists in harmony. At that time, the Reservation covered a huge chunk of what is now South Dakota. This was just five years after President Lincoln established Thanksgiving as a National Holiday in 1863. The US broke that treaty fast, starting when General Custer found gold in 1874. In 1890, the US government violated a different treaty and broke the land into five smaller reservations. Pressure from settlers moving west was too much to allow such treaties to stand. It became a familiar process. Land slowly (or quickly) taken away. Always under color of law, but with almost no regard for justice. The fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline is another chapter in this sorry history. Science is clear. We must radically reduce the level of carbon extraction to avert catastrophic global climate change. And for that, we owe the water protectors at Standing Rock our greatest thanks on this Thanksgiving Day. This is the right and essential thing to do. This Thanksgiving, please join the entire WFP family in standing with Standing Rock. Give Working Families Party a round of applause.
