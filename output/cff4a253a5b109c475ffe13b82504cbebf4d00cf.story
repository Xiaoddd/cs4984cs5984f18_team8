Dakota Access Pipeline Add Interest The clash yesterday, which resulted in more than 100 arrests, came after months of demonstrations and an ongoing legal battle waged by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and others over the proposed 1,172-mile crude oil pipeline being built by Dakota Access, a subsidiary of the Texas-based company Energy Transfer Partners. Over a thousand protesters are still camped out near the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation in North Dakota. The push to block this pipeline has become one of the biggest Native American demonstrations in decades. The tribe argues that the pipeline will threaten the reservation's water supply and traverse culturally sacred sites. Jan. 25, 2016 Dakota Access announced in a statement that it had received permit approval by the North Dakota Public Service Commission, bringing the four-state crude oil pipeline a step closer to construction. Dakota Access wrote on its website that it hopes to have the pipeline in operation by the end of 2016, transporting 470,000 barrels of oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois. July 27, 2016 Attorneys for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe took their first legal action to block the pipeline to the courts on this day, officially filing a complaint against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over its process for granting permits to Dakota Access for the pipeline. Lawyers for the tribe also pressed charges against Dakota Access, and months of litigation followed. Most of the organized demonstrations and protesting began shortly after the tribe filed the lawsuit, and as the summer waned on activists and native groups from across the country began flocking to a camp set up in North Dakota near the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The environment is an important part of our lives and any threats to it impacts our families, ancestors and future generations. Sept. 3, 2016 Protesters and private security workers hired by Dakota Access clashed on this day. Witnesses say private security workers unleashed pepper spray and pit bulls on a crowd of men, women, and some children who were protesting the pipeline over the weekend. But local authorities say the protesters became aggressive, nearly overwhelming the workers and security at the construction site. Sept. 9, 2016 A federal judge denied the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's request for a temporary injunction but appeared sympathetic toward the tribe's plight in his ruling. The same day, however, three federal agencies intervened in an unprecedented manner, requesting that the pipeline company voluntarily halt construction of the pipeline near Lake Oahe. Therefore, construction of the pipeline on Army Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe will not go forward at this time. Sept. 26, 2016 President Obama weighed in on the growing movement to block the pipeline, and hosted more than 500 Native American leaders for his eighth and final White House Tribal Nations Conference as president. Oct. 9, 2016 In the evening hours the day before Columbus Day, a federal holiday many indigenous people find offensive, a federal appeals court denied the tribe's appeal of the Sept. 9 ruling.

Heavily armed law enforcement officials surrounded protesters and reportedly used pepper spray, tear gas and a sound cannon. The Morton County Sheriff's Department announced that 141 protesters were arrested, bringing the number of those arrested since the protests began to more than 400. 0 Shares Email Star Comments Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.
