Tweet Well, that went well. Donald Trump is only four days into presidency, yet he already has the usually-reticent American media questioning his veracity and sanctity of mind. Trump claims to have secret evidence that the White House is refusing to release, and even refusing to have the FBI investigate. Reporters at the briefing were incredulous. Of course, the answer is clear. Trump is either lying, crazy or both. The GOP motivated its base with their BS attack on Hillary over Benghazi. The more Trump acts up, the more we attack him, the more he acts up even more, the more his poll numbers drop, and the more Republicans in Congress start to distance themselves from Trump, lest his falling popularity hurt them in the next election. And all of that makes it increasingly difficult for Trump to further his agenda. 3. And so should you. Thanks. John Aravosis is the Executive Editor of AMERICAblog, which he founded in 2004.
