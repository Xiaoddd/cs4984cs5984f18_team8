As officers moved in, and protesters moved out, garbage wasn't the only thing abandoned. Two dogs and six puppies were found and rescued at the main Dakota Access Pipeline Camp by furry Friends Rockin Rescue. The rescue has been working hard to catch ALL the animals that were left behind at the camp, but Furry Friends Rockin Rescue isn't giving up on these abandoned pets. Officials continue to work against the clock to clean up the main Dakota Access Pipeline Camp. While protesters are gone, some family members are stuck behind. But we offer, Furry Friends offers hope. Furry Friends Rockin Rescue is planning on going back to the protest camps where they say they're having a hard time catching these animals because of the loud heavy machinery that's being used to clean up the area. They are planning to go back to the camps every weekend if they have enough volunteers and if they're able to get into the campsite. The two dogs that they've save have shown symptoms of being out in the North Dakotan weather with frost bit ears and patchy fur. Furry Friends says that their first priority is to keep these dogs warm and fed and to make sure they're healthy. You can go to furryfriendsrockinrescue.org to donate items. They need food, blankets, and money to help with the vet bills for these animals.
