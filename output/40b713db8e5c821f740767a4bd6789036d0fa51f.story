BREAKING: A critical portion of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota will be halted for the time being. This is a huge win (for now) for the Standing Rock Sioux and all the protesters who have stood with them against ATTACK DOGS, pepper spray, surveillance planes, and scores of police. The pipeline construction goes through sacred land and would threaten the water supply of millions of people. And much of the construction will continue on areas that are not federal land. Halting the pipeline is a big win for people facing off against massive corporate destruction of their land, but this fight is not over by a long shot. Keep fighting. Tulsa ,Okla. Many tribes and supporters together on the Guthrie Green at sundown. The anti-attack dogs were there too protesting the abuse of their fellows forced into service to violence. Seismic update: quake has been recalculated to 5.8-duraton 90 seconds ..a few more and we might have made our way to liquifaction . The oil could just rise to the top and no more need to drill or frack. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published. All Rights Reserved.
