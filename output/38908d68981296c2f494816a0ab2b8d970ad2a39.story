Emily Fuller posted Oct 31, 2016 There have been a lot of questions surrounding the influx of military style troops and equipment to the Standing Rock Sioux tribal area in North Dakota. In August, North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple declared a state of emergency in response to the growing Dakota Access pipeline protests, and Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier has invoked the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, calling on police resources from six surrounding states. On Thursday, police executed a particularly violent sweep of a camp. Across the nation, there have been solidarity actions to protest the police response. The campaign seeks to confuse police by flooding social media with check-ins from all across the globe. According to CNN today, hundreds of thousands of people have already done it; although the Morton County Sheriff's Department has denied using Facebook to monitor the camp. Here is a list of officials from the involved states, plus the county and city police confirmed by news reports, to have sent troops and equipment to North Dakota. Questions can be directed to these people. (This list was last updated on Nov. 23, 2016). Law enforcement agencies sending troops and support to Morton County as of Nov. 23: Troops from Minnesota, Wyoming, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Indiana have withdrawn. Petition to remove officers signed by 29,000 people was delivered to Gov. Pete Ricketts on Monday. No Paywall. No Ads. Just Readers Like You.
