In a lawsuit filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, the residents challenge the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to allow a private company like Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC, to confiscate property through eminent domain to build such a project. The Natural Gas Act, passed in 1938, allows the federal government to regulate the interstate transportation and sale of natural gas. A FERC spokesperson said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. Virginia landowners, environmentalists urge divestment to stop proposed natural gas pipeline New analysis identifies the top six banks financing the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The release of the final environmental review triggered a 90-day federal authorization decision deadline.

Oil Change International, an anti-fossil fuel research and advocacy group, released a report earlier this year that found the annual greenhouse gas emission caused by the Mountain Valley Pipeline would be almost 90 million metric tons, equivalent to the emissions from 26 average U.S. coal plants or over 19 million passenger vehicles. The pipeline project will be constructed and owned by Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC, a joint venture between EQT Midstream Partners LP, NextEra US Gas Assets LLC, Con Edison Transmission Inc., WGL Midstream, and RGC Midstream, LLC. EQT Midstream Partners will operate the pipeline and own a significant interest in the joint venture.

Eminent domain is the right of a government to expropriate private property for public use, usually with payment of compensation. In almost all cases, FERC has granted companies the right to use eminent domain to build their natural gas pipelines. FERC has largely relied on whether companies have demonstrated an intent to use the proposed pipeline to determine whether a pipeline is in the public interest. The agency does not seek to determine whether the residents who live along the pipeline or elsewhere in the region where the pipeline is located will benefit from its construction. In its final environmental review of the project, FERC failed to acknowledge the fact that 100 percent of the commitments to use the pipeline are by owner-affiliates of the pipeline, according to the lawsuit.
