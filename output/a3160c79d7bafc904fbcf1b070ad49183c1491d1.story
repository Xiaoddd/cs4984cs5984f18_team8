Censored News screen capture. Video by Henrietta. Frontline today. Winter conditions are intense, but spirits at camp are high. Everyone has been working together to get people to delegated warming spaces in camp and spaces on the reservation. Medics, security, and veterans have been going from shelter to shelter to do wellness checks on our water protectors. Women, children, elders and other folks who wish to leave camp are being evacuated with four wheel drive vehicles and operators who know how to use them. The road conditions are icy. Visibility is low; however, roads are passable with four wheel drive vehicles. As of 2:00PM CST, there have been no confirmed deaths or any critical care patients. There have been two cases of moderate hypothermia for whom the medics on the ground provided care. The main impediment to health is not the winter, but the state. The police roadblock on ND HWY 1806 is delaying the timely evacuation of patients and vulnerable populations. We have developed the capacity to keep the campers safe and warm, but are asking the state of North Dakota to cease its inhumane and unjustifiable blockade of highway 1806. We applaud the water protectors efforts to self-organize and care for each other, the medics & healers who have collectively held space here for months, the Standing Rock EMS for their coordination and expert care of patients, and all other groups working tirelessly to ensure the health and safety of the campers. Just goes to show that the local government continues it's racism and hatred. According to Century Code, it is illegal to obstruct a roadway. Halliburton dest...
