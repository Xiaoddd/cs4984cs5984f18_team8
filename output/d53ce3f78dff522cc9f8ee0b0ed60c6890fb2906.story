Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline, is under fire from federal and state regulators after triggering a massive spill, and seven other violations, during the first seven weeks of construction of a major gas pipeline in Ohio. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on Wednesday sent a letter to the Rover pipeline operator ordering it to not start construction on any new locations, as well as to stop construction at the site of the major wetlands spill and to hire an independent contractor to dig into what went wrong there. The same day the Ohio EPA reached out to the pipeline builder, it also asked FERC to step in. That's because state officials had previously encountered pushback from the company, which had argued that only federal regulators had jurisdiction to take action. The company also planned to restart drilling at the site of the big wetlands spill that day. Construction started around March 24, and the first violation occurred on March 30, involving the burning of construction debris less than 1,000 feet from a home near Toronto, Ohio, according to the Ohio EPA compliance letter to the company from May 5. An additional 17 incidents, seven of which resulted in violations, had occurred at various construction sites across the state by May 7. State officials said they learned of some of the incidents through the company and others through calls from the community. The mud coated the wetlands, smothering vegetation and aquatic life in an ecosystem that helps filter water between farmland and nearby waterways. Even after the surface spill was discovered, the company restarted construction there. This is the one site where cleanup is still ongoing. Both state and federal officials are monitoring the situation. Alexis Daniel, a spokesperson for Energy Transfer Partners, confirmed in an email to InsideClimate News that construction had stopped at the wetlands site. Sierra Club's dirty fuels organizer Cheryl Johncox, however, is skeptical about the company's compliance efforts. The company has also run into recent problems on the Dakota Access pipeline, which drew months of protests over its planned route near the Standing Rock Reservation and concerns over safety for the reservation's water supply. The pipeline leaked 84 gallons of crude oil at a South Dakota pump station in April.
