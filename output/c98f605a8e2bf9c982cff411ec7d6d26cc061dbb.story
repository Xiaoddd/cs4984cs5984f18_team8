A top foreign policy advisor to Donald Trump is part of a Western Montana campaign against the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT). Schmitz was named by Trump as one of five foreign policy advisors in mid-March. In September 2015, Joseph E. Schmitz joined Lawrence Kogan as co-counsel in Keenan et al v. Bay et al, a lawsuit filed on behalf of Montana State Senator Bob Keenan (R-Bigfork) and former state Senator Verdell Jackson (R-Kalispell). The lawsuit sought to block CSKT acquisition of the former Kerr Dam. Lawrence Kogan is closely allied with the anti-Indian Citizens Equal Rights Alliance (CERA). CERA aims to terminate tribes and abrogate treaties between the United States and Indian Nations. (See American Lands Council and the Anti-Indian Movement). Kogan and Willman have continued to press the CSKT-Muslim terrorist conspiracy theory in 2016 (See Bigoted Nationalism and CERA-allied Attorney Tours). Schmitz served as Inspector General for the Department of Defense under George W. Bush. This Florida-based online publication hosts writers that run the gamut from paleo-conservative Pat Buchanan to libertarian Ron Paul and neo-conservative Charles Krauthammer. In February 2016 Schmitz argued in a Newsmax article that people receiving public support should be barred from voting. The good news is that the states, through legislation or state constitutional amendments, can and should enact common sense laws to protect the integrity of the voting process. The right to vote in this state shall be conditioned on the citizens not being voluntarily dependent on public welfare. Schmitz is a Senior Fellow with the Center for Security Policy (CSP), a Washington, D.C-based think tank and leading force promoting the idea that Islamic sharia law is taking over the United States. Casting sharia as a singular and inherently evil set of ideas and practices is little more than a mask for bigotry and attacks on the civil and human rights of Muslims. Sharia is largely a system of personal religious and moral codes practiced by many Muslims. To date exactly zero U.S. jurisdictions have adopted sharia law. The same number can be expected to do so in the future. The reality TV star cum ultra-nationalist bigot has displayed anti-tribal leanings most prominently in attacks on tribal casinos. Trump has assailed the right of tribes to create casinos under the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). Casinos have a played an important role for many tribes in economic development and funding social programs. While forming a casino is an act of inherent tribal sovereignty, the IGRA actually constrained tribal rights by giving states some leverage in casino development processes. Newsmax.

He lives in Washington State where he researches and works to counter white nationalism and the anti-Indian and other far right social movements. And when Schmitz left the DOD, he became an executive at Blackwater. And he was an enthusiastic fan of Erik Prince and Blackwater, and he goes and he joins that company. He was a fanatical opponent of abortion. And, you know, I mean, Joseph Schmitz is, in many ways, in Washington a total clown and a joke because of his insane worldview that has no bearing in the modern world, and yet he continues to get government contracts.
