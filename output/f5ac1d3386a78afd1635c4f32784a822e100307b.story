There is always something needing to be done on the property several townhouses and families would have lived on back in Surrey. Between that and everything that has to be done the blog has taken a back seat while I am keeping track of whats going on in BC politics on my phone. That is, until I found out about this. And to be honest I was so upset when I read this I literally had to go whisper swear words into my pillow because the kids were sleeping. It just goes against every bone in our bodies. Well Merry Christmas Premier Clark. Happy New Year Ms. McDonald. Too late. Its been cleared. Would have made a nice park site to bring tourism into the region along with all the other amazing features in this area of the Peace but no, Premier Clarks vow to get the dam past the point of no return is more important than our collective history, or the Treaty 8 lands the dam infringes on. And now, people are losing their homes and land they have worked for generations and treaty rights are being ignored completely while a decision from the Supreme Court of Canada is waited on that has the capability of putting an end to all of this. The precedent set in the recent Enbridge case bolsters this case. But you will not hear of these expropriations on the evening news. You will hear about someone on instagram winning a KFC scented candle. You will see the latest Christmas fashions or the most tasty cocktails. But you will not hear about these people losing their homes and what Hydro did to get to this point. There will be no critical examination of why or how this dam was refused by the BCUC twice already, so the province exempted it from a third review under the guise of the Clean Energy plan. You will not hear that the power is not needed. Or some kind of bafflegab that inevitably goes unquestioned. Umm. Ok. And you will read Vaughn Palmer gloss over the very big geotechnical issues that have had Hydro execs fly up at a moments notice when the walls of the riverbanks start collapsing onto roads workers have been going up and down. Because the government ignored its own report that said the banks and geology was so unstable and prone to slides further development should be minimized.. Now Vaughn says this project is so advanced no government would kill it. And to be honest, that may be true. But I would remind Premier Clark , Horgan and Vaughn Palmer of the biggest boondoggle Newfoundland Labrador has ever seen, the dam project known as Muskrat Falls. You see, the history of Muskrat and Site C are so very similar. Governments wanting a big legacy project. They stymied their provincial regulator and did not give them all the info they needed. So the good people of Newfoundland Labrador were screwed. Here in BC the government exempted the same review. No independent body has ever examined the info Hydro has concocted and some of it has already been shown to be inaccurate. But the massive geotechnical issues that have resulted in work being redone over and over again, are going to blow a hole in that. And who knows what will happen in the years to come. Research shows mega dam projects often increase in cost to nearly double. On a dam you have to try to find a customer for.. and that no one has verified info on. Having said that, it is unseemly. Like Mike Duffy and Pamela Martin. For years we got faces implying neutrality but who, in the end, showed their bias in the extreme. And, as Laila says, the TRUTH HAS NO AGENDA. Went media-for-money. And then morphed DEEP GREEN. One of a kind. In fact it should have been done 5 years ago. December 9, 2016 12:37 pm at 12:37 pm randyhadland BC Hydro and the BC Liberals have done more damage to the BC economy with their efforts to build Site C than they have done to the valley environment as of yet. To do as much damage as she has and still smile is beyond sick and sociopathic, it borders on sadistic. She is practically salivating. They are the turkeys just before Thanksgiving anticipating the holidays to come. They are right to do so. December 9, 2016 8:39 am at 8:39 am Hugh Using clean hydro power to run natural gas and LNG plants means that the natural gas that would normally power the plant can then be exported and burned, releasing GHGs. There is SO much negative about this project and this government that its difficult to know where to start. My heart goes out to the Boons, but I suppose their case could be worse. With any luck the slopes will sluff in and the project will be aborted. Bet the Fort St. John hoteliers are not to happy with THAT competition. Best of the season to you. BC has indeed killed a project after money has been invested. And it was an NDP government that did it. Makes me even more determined to help the Peace Valley landowners and First Nations in their fight to stop this abomination. December 10, 2016 3:36 pm at 3:36 pm Lew Three questions immediately come to mind with me after reading the Vancouver Sun and New York Times articles. December 10, 2016 4:18 pm at 4:18 pm JDC Ever so slightly off topic, Lew. Apologies. whose business it is to mess in elections believe that the US election was messed with by the Russians. Instead we got the Alex Fraser bridge closure. Maybe a snow depth measurement. Marvel Comix gets closer to the truth than does POSTMEDIA . December 10, 2016 5:32 pm at 5:32 pm Lew Yes. This in the face of extensive evidence and expert opinion that the project is not required, and is not in the public interest for many reasons. And the Vancouver Sun (and most other local media) serves up coverage of it that would result in a failing grade if submitted as a paper in the first term at any school of journalism. Send in the clowns. Even if Horgan says nothing about Site-C, it is still designed to be NDP-toxic. The NDP has to be very, very careful on this issue as a result. A trap is laid at virtually every approach, just as planned from the beginning. Christy will do everything to keep it sloganeering, punchy-one-liners. Christy is very rude and has no qualm about interrupting and drowning opponents out with superior volume during these televised opportunities. Here is one of the places to detail the perfidy of Site-C. And to list all that, take all day. December 10, 2016 5:52 pm at 5:52 pm nonconfidencevote Well, well well. The trouble with this entire construction project is the lack of a budgetting process. car if I cant tell them what the car will cost. Its a violation of every basic accounting principle that large corporations are legally OBLIGATED to follow and most hold dear. Unfortunately this Dam will take years to complete and Clark will probaly walk away at the 11th hour and wipe her hands of the entire fiscal mess. Jail is too good for these lying, theiving scum. If the NDP come to power they should stop it in its tracks and AUDIT EVERYTHING. She deigned to visit our community exactly twice in all that time and sat there smiling and asking what the community volunteers had done. She acted like our proud mom, not our champion. They are willing accomplices. They are useless. They are getting paid to do nothing. A jellyfish has more of a spine that a career politician. Please go back to high school and learn how to write. December 17, 2016 8:04 pm at 8:04 pm Jdc Sorry, Astro. You are right. I tried to be too brief in my condemnation when only a tome would have a chance at describing their inadequacy. Mind you, it would take a small library to document the destructive evil manifest by the Liberals insatiable greed and corruption. Let me guess. Banishment forever is a likely result. Then let me make it easier for you. The current system as it stands is failing the voters. Hence the election of the lunatic fringe like Donald Trump. Voters are willing to try anything to shake up the status quo. Democracy is a joke, bought and paid for by special interests. But at least we get to toss out the ruling party every election unless the NDP squanders another election. We do not need the power, not even for LNG. It would not be enough anyway. December 18, 2016 1:27 pm at 1:27 pm John's Aghast JDC usually makes a lot of sense. Unfortunately, a lot this time. December 18, 2016 7:51 pm at 7:51 pm JDC You are partly right, Astro. My apologies. I was being too brief in my condemnation of the NDP where, really, a tome or multi-page indictment is required. One simply cannot write enough bad things regarding the opposition. They do such a poor job. The Liberals do evil and the NDP do nothing. I actually learn more from reading Laila. But thanks for the encouragement to keep on writing. December 18, 2016 1:49 pm at 1:49 pm Blake Newton Ah yes. Site C. Otherwise known as an electorally useful white elephant. December 11, 2016 3:36 pm at 3:36 pm Astro Thank you for another excellent article. It is very informative. December 11, 2016 9:52 pm at 9:52 pm Laila Yuile It gets better. Like I said, this is going to make the Fast Ferries look like candy store change in your pocket. They may have to twin a temporary bridge thanks to so many traffic delays. This will be the biggest boondoggle ever. EVER. There is a good reason the BCUC turned this down twice already. Not a bit. I only visit this site once a day and it gets downright disheartening. I can only imagine what it would be like to dwell on this and other similar problems all day every day. I notice Norm Farrell has been absent for a couple of months. December 13, 2016 6:49 pm at 6:49 pm e.a.f. Nothing is beyond the point of no return except perhaps death and even that has been reversed with new medical procedures and CPR. The building of a dam can stop at any time. Even if a dam has been built it can be de constructed, and the land left to recover. Horgan might want to get that message. Its a waste of money to build the whole thing. Better to take the financial hit now and get over it. The pro media has done a good job of keeping it out of the news. Oh, well one good shake might put it on the front page or a bunch of deaths of workers, but until then, It is doubtful they will say much about it. In my opinion this dam is not about electricity, its about a reservoir and being able to export water. a water pipeline would be a piece of cake. Its all about the water and not about the electricity. What is being done to the families on site C is no different than was done by the Socreds back in the days when they were building dams. In this case though it will be dam Christy clark. I hope its not the same boffleheads that neglected to locate a source for the armour rock and must now haul it from a distant source across a (for now) non existent bridge. I sometimes wonder if its still on budget. And then I wonder if Anyone knows. I mean, you must have budgets and schedules to proceed with a venture like this. Vaughn Palmer says they know to the exact hour some five or six years in the future when the reservoir will be full as well as some 5,500 steps in between. Okay, got that off my chest. Will try to get some sleep now. The United Canada Party (UCP) is opposed to the Site C Dam and needs candidates who oppose it too. December 15, 2016 5:40 pm at 5:40 pm Curt Site C is an expensive venture not needed. Not their money.
