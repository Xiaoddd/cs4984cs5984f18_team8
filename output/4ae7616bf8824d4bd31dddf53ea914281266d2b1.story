Thousands of anti-oil and gas protestors have camped at the confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri rivers in recent months trying to block the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The pipeline, which would carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois, is mostly finished except for a section that will run more than 90 feet beneath Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri River. Yesterday, a federal judge rejected a fresh bid by the Cheyenne River Sioux and the Standing Rock Sioux to block the project. More recently, abandoned vehicles have also become a concern. Ryan Hignight, a public affairs officer for the Corps, told Western Wire. Officials at the site are trying to identify how many vehicles still have owners and how many have been abandoned. Two weeks ago, the number of abandoned vehicles was estimated between 50 and 75, and at least one vehicle has already been found in the water, Keller told Western Wire. Pollution from abandoned vehicles adds to already serious environmental problems left behind by the protestors, he said. There is a bill in the North Dakota state legislature that would allow for unclaimed vehicles to be disposed of after 30 days instead of the current 90 days, he said.

For those cars left behind, the removal process will be challenging.
