There are 60 stations licensed to tribes or tribal entities in the United States. They stand to lose a lot if Trump cuts federal funding. KIDE station manager Joseph R. Orozco in the studio booth. Of the nearly 3,000 people living in the Hoopa Valley, approximately three-fourths are Native American. Since President Trump took office, his administration has kept the press on their toes. Now, according to The Hill, Trump may be setting his sights on funding cuts to organizations such as the CPB and the National Endowment for the Arts. Should cuts take effect, tribal stations stand to lose a lot, as they rely heavily on CPB grant funding. There are 60 stations licensed to tribes or tribal entities in the United States, including commercial and public radio stations. Loris A. Taylor, the president and CEO of Native Public Media, has kept a close eye on the developments. The worst-case scenario, according to Taylor, would be that small stations such as KIDE shut down without the CPB funding. KYAY, San Carlos Apache Nation, San Carlos, Arizona.

KIDE was one of the first tribal radio stations in California to have a hybridized solar power system, which has allowed the station to cut back on electricity costs by 60 percent. And recently the station has begun to stream its broadcast service through its website. Still, KIDE requires funding for basic operations. Communities with tribal stations place a lot of trust in and reliance on them. Orozco has plans for the future of KIDE and continues to apply for additional grants to improve community engagement and participation with all of Hoopa Valley. State funding to public radio stations has been cut by 50 percent over the past two years. This is more acutely felt in Alaska, says Jaclyn Sallee, president and CEO of Koahnic Broadcast Corporation and KNBA in Anchorage. Twelve of the 60 tribal stations in the United States are located in Alaska. They distribute programming through Native Voice One to more than 350 radio stations across the country. Sallee says Koahnic and KNBA receive three separate grants from the CPB. According to Sallee, state funding to public radio stations has been cut by 50 percent over the past two years. This is the case for KZPA-AM, Gwandak Public Broadcasting, Inc., which serves Fort Yukon, Alaska. Back in the Lower 48, Orozco likens the importance of funding for tribal stations to an oft-forgotten federal trust responsibility between tribes and the United States. In his eyes, the United States has not done enough to reestablish tribal communication systems through stations like his. The people need to have that balance. No Paywall. No Ads.
