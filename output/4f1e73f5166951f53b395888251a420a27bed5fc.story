It is often hard to tell how close popular movements are to success or whether they are even a threat to the status quo power structure. While it may be riskier for us when they fight back, it is a positive sign and means that the movement needs to escalate, build power and increase its pressure. One absurd example of suppression came from Los Angeles where police are enforcing an ordinance that makes it a crime to speak longer than your allotted time when testifying before the city council. Each person going to trial is facing 60 years in prison. Their collective sentence, if convicted, would total 12,000 years. Those going to trial were kettled by police during the J20 protest. The US Attorney for Washington, DC (since DC is not a state, it does not have a district attorney, but is prosecuted by the federal government) is prosecuting everyone, even if they were a legal observer, medic or reporter, in a collective punishment conspiracy. The police response against the J20 black bloc protests was extreme violence. Those arrested also described sexual assault by police. The Police Foundation has been criticized for its reports on police violence and abuse in Ferguson, MO and Charlotte, NC. In another example, Standing Rock Sioux tribal member Chase Iron Eyes is being prosecuted in South Dakota for his role in the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline. He is being charged with starting a riot. It was necessary for them to protest because there was no alternative. As protests increase and impact business interests and government policies, the people in power will use whatever tools they can to try and stop the resistance movement. This should not stop activists, but it is something to consider when developing protest tactics so that we are positioned to defend ourselves while still protesting effectively. Attacks on the Media and Internet Critical to the success of movement actions is drawing public attention to them. A goal of popular movements is to grow by attracting more people to the movement, and especially to divide power holders (e.g. political parties, elected officials, business people, the media) and bring them to support the movement. The corporate mass media has always been a problem for movements seeking transformational change. Now, that is under attack. Join our Protect The Internet campaign and take action at this critical time. Sign up here if you can come to DC to protest the vote. And it is accompanied by the installation of algorithms by Google, Facebook and Twitter that divert readers away from left-wing, progressive and anti-war websites . . Congress is playing its role in heightening fear in order to quiet criticism of the government on social media. They put foward the news from the perspective of the government and big corporations to support the concentration of wealth and militarism, among other issues. Signs from ResistJ20 Inauguration protest by Megan Cloherty for WTOP. Responsibility of the Movement These attacks on dissent in court and in the media are reasons for the movement to escalate. While they continue their policies of concentration of wealth, as well as environmental destruction and war, they know people are organizing, responding and resisting. When we plan our actions, we must expect criminal or civil prosecution and use tactics that protect us while still allowing the movement to proceed with aggressive, strategic and sustained actions. Everyone in the movement should know that they will not be alone when the power holders go after them. And, with the attacks on the media, it becomes an important political act to re-post an article from Popular Resistance and other sites. It becomes a political act to tweet or forward social media posts. Our job has always been to spread the word and actions of the movement, now that becomes even more important. Let these attacks by government and big business become reasons to grow and unify the movement. There are people in the government, including in law enforcement, as well as people who work for corporate interests, including corporate media, who will recognize these actions as going too far and defect. We must pull these people into the movement, urge them to join us and to use their position as an insider to expose what is occurring. Every attack on the popular movement is more reason for us to join together, grow and mobilize. Every attack must be turned into an opportunity for us to build the strength of people power. If you are a volunteer in any progressive group or organization you should know what the obstacles are in moving the org in an effective and winning direction. mwildfire as well as in imagining that if only the Left poured the rest of our resources down the rathole of electoral politics, we could win. Yes, the Right does and they sometimes win. All that they see as sops to the religious right, in return for their support of the right of the elite to exploit workers, resources, living things in the service of their grand overarching goal, their own further enrichment and control. Sure, with enough effort we can get a seat here and another one there, but then we gain a voice crying in the wilderness, unable to affect policy. Their STYLE is very different from that of the Republicans, they go to a lot more trouble to cover their tracks, but they still have to give their funders what they want. We have a SYSTEM that guarantees this, and the SCOTUS has blocked any efforts to change this. Even where the left has made some gains with Democrats in office, there is a strong movement pushing in that direction.
