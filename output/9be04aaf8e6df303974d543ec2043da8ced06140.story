Prolific TheRapper Breaking: Drilling under the river has started. Im no one to listen to but im going to share my opinion and how I feel now. I'm not panicked because I believe in the power of prayer, I've seen so many miracles happen through ceremony. I believe that what took place at Standing Rock was a VERY POWERFUL CEREMONY and that is why soo many people came, the power was undeniable. I believe that as long as we stay with the spiritual instructions we will win, though we will go through hardships and maybe even times like now where it looks like we lost. I also believe that if we break the instructions we will lose for sure and if this happens we will have to blame ourselves because we didn't listen. 3 different spiritual people who are not connected to each other have said similar things. That at some point the grandfather's, angels, spirits, however you want to think of them didn't want us to do anymore actions, that they were useful in the beginning but now it's time to rely on prayer. They said when something happened at an action the grandfather's had to spend their energy trying to keep people safe when they wanted to be out working with the minds of those who make decisions. They said in a sense some of our actions were working against our own prayers. Then another said they are waiting for us to get out of harms way so that they can do what was asked of them (answer our prayers). And I'm sitting here thinking as I type that perhaps that was the biggest lesson that Creator, God, the universe wants to teach humanity, that we need to return to prayer. I'm a warrior and I know that but I'm not heroic... I think sometimes a warrior comes up against battles that can only be won through prayer. Sometime I can't do it myself and I have to ask the universe for help. So I'm not worried about the drill pad and the drilling. I'm worried that some might not listen to the spiritual instructions and we might lose that way. Again I'm no one to listen to, I've been thinking about this for days but couldn't find the courage to say it because it's not a popular thing to say right now. For me right now the battle is with prayer, with faith, and with the courts. I love you all, prayers tonight for everyone and even for the men drilling this pipeline right now. Prolific TheRapper They often use salt water which will not freeze when they drill. It breaks my heart to see them destroying the river , so sad , Prolific TheRapper A really bad blizzard hit that push people out suddenly. There are still people at Camp cleaning.
