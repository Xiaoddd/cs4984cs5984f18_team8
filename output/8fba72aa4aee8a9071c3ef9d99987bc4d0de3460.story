When considering back in those days the preposterous prospect of a sci-fi future world, picturing people having to walk around with gas masks and not being able to drink the water, (there was no such thing as bottled water back then), very few at that time really took the words to this satirical song seriously. And millions of Americans (billions around the world) have no alternative, but to breathe unhealthy air with unprecedented levels of smog, comprised of toxic gases, hormone disrupting chemicals, and carcinogenic particulates. Industrial processes yield millions of tons of toxic industrial waste every day, year after year, and the careless handling and disposal of that waste is adding to the spread and the exponential accumulation of toxins. For 100 years, there were few federal rules against the proliferation or the dumping of toxics, and the state regulations were barely, if ever, enforced. Billions of tons of toxic waste were poured every year directly into our rivers, streams, lakes, and oceans, or deposited in unlined landfills, where there is no barrier to toxins leaching into our groundwater. And billions of tons of toxic gases, chemicals and particulates have been literally pouring from industrial smokestacks, and peppering our lungs, not to mention the peppering and melting of the ice caps and glaciers, with effects on our Climate. Two years before that topical song, Pollution, was written, recognizing that air pollution was a real threat, Congress enacted the first Clean Air Act of 1963. Also in 1972, the Environmental Protection Agency was established to regulate and enforce the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and all future environmental laws. Please read about this law in Chemistry Gone Wild, and how it is such an impotent law, that though it appoints the EPA to regulate chemicals, out of the 84,000 chemicals, only 5 chemicals have ever been regulated since the law was enacted in 1976. In 2016, with both Democrats and Republicans having recognized for years just how anemic the TSCA is, and that oversight must be improved, new versions of this toxics law are working through the Congress and Senate. But if any of these new versions emerge into law, it will almost certainly be equally catering to the business interests of the polluters, in defense of the status quo, at the expense of concern for our health. After the EPA was founded, there was much hope and some evidence that these new environmental laws were already doing some good. Some of the rivers that had previously been so toxic, the water was brown and smelled horrible, and in which nothing could live, we now heard of fish coming back. And perhaps one could imagine that the air quality was improving a bit. But now, since the time that these first environmental laws were enacted, after almost 50 years accumulation of billions of tons more, these toxins are increasingly rearing their ugly heads, showing up as Air Pollution, Water Pollution, and Soil Pollution.. Please note that these three types of pollution are not three separate subjects. The same chemicals and heavy metals that are emitted from a smokestack, and spread by the wind, are deposited into the rain and snow and get into the soil and water. Conversely, water pollution through evaporation pollutes the air. Anyone who has ever witnessed an oil spill will never forget the dizzyingly terrible stink of the oil as it pollutes the air, water (rivers, streams, lakes, oceans, and groundwater) and soil. The toxins in the oil, the carcinogenic EDCs, both liquid and gas, and the heavy metals, are recognized as toxic by the CDC, the NIH, the WHO, as well as the EPA, and they appear in every form, water, air, and soil pollution from the same oil spill, and there are tens of thousands of oil spills and drilling wastewater spills in the US and around the world every year, most of which you never hear. Oil spills are just one example of toxic spills, whether liquid, solid, or gas. And winds, jet streams, rain, snow, rivers, streams and ocean currents distribute many of these harmful pollutants globally, having them appear long distances from their points of generation. Heavy metals like Lead and Mercury in smoke from fossil fuel power generation and transportation can be found on the highest mountains and these heavy metals get into mountain streams and rivers polluting freshwater fish worldwide with Mercury, and not just the saltwater fish of which most of us are aware. And all vertebrates, even fish, have endocrine systems much like ours, and these heavy metals that are disrupting hormones are bio-magnified up the food chain. 2100 different chemicals have been found in water pollution and in our drinking water supplies. Humans and all animals absorb toxics through our mouths, our breathing, and through our skin. And there is no doubt that these toxics are harming our health . The incidence of chronic diseases and cancers (also notably in children) related to pollution is skyrocketing. We are poisoning ourselves and our children with lead and heavy metals, and with EDC chemicals, (like flame retardants in every piece of furniture in our homes and offices, and the chemicals in non-stick cookware in our kitchens) that are known to impair cognitive function. We can spend the most money on education, and have the best schools, teachers and curricula. Perhaps the toxins in some homes and communities are denying our children, to some degree, the ability to learn. Every one of the thousands of toxic spills reported each year, whether liquid, solid, or gas, threatens the health of hundreds, if not thousands of Americans, not just in cities, but now that we have industrialized the countryside, for example with tens of thousands of fracking wells, rural communities are as much threatened as city dwellers. The heartache and tragedy of a relative, your child, or a close friend, having their health potentially harmed by toxics is being faced by hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Americans each year, and seems to be growing exponentially. These toxic events are robbing many of us of our homes, our neighborhoods, our jobs, our schools, our churches, and our quality of life, and robbing many thousands of Americans of our life savings, when real estate values in our neighborhoods plummet, as a result of these tragic accidents, spills, and resulting water and air and soil pollution. We, the people, have no defense against this. Even if we protest, industry, protected by politicians and governmental agencies, with the assistance of law enforcement, usually prevails, and our safety is most often disregarded. And when the industry executives and politicians act contrite and surprised after a toxic event, while offering to extend prayers for the victims, they are often being disingenuous. Most workers in local factories and consequently many people in the community around the local factories, including the politicians, know something about, and sometimes fear, the toxic Chemicals inside those walls. In addition to this common knowledge of toxic chemicals in factories, the EPA, since a 1986 law was enacted, has required polluters to report to a national database, called the Toxics Release Inventory. All toxic releases into waterways, into the air, or into landfills must be recorded. This database reveals just how much of each toxic chemical is dumped, and where, and by whom. There are no secrets. Officials and the public alike have full access to the Toxics Release Inventory database, where among the top 15 polluters of our waterways are the US Department of Defense, Tyson Foods (pork producer), two oil companies and two chemical companies. Similar databases are maintained in Australia, the EU, etc. In some cases, US companies are required to get exemptions from the EPA before dumping poisons into drinking water aquifers, outrageous as that may sound, that the EPA, the agency charged with protecting us, would ever, under any circumstances, permit poisons to be dumped into drinking water aquifers. We call the toxic world in which we find ourselves, the Theater of the Absurd Status Quo , because it is absurd in more ways than one. First, the fact that we are poisoning our children, ourselves, and every animal on this planet, with thousands of toxic chemicals and heavy metals, and pouring more billions of tons of toxic chemicals and heavy metals into the environment each year, that will prove to ensure future generations will also be poisoned, is absolutely absurd. These are poisons. This is scientific proven fact, whether through the disciplines of toxicology or endocrinology. Independent animal testing has been conducted, in many cases with cancer tumors presented. Arsenic, a heavy metal, will kill you. We use it in rat poison. Yet, to make our poultry and pork pinker, we allow the feeding operations to put arsenic in the animal feed, for the food we eat. We know pesticides, from runoff into ponds, alter hormones, when we dissect a frog having both ovaries and testes. And we wonder why more male babies are being born with birth defects involving their penises, for just one example. But, there are thousands of examples equally as concerning and absurd. They use the reasoning that this is the only way we can compete in a global market, that if we would be forced to continue to comply with our troublesome regulations, which other nations are not, that this will always make us uncompetitive. If the regulations and their enforcement were working and sufficient, the US would not be experiencing so many toxic hazards. And the Poisoning goes on, in massive global proportions, and there seems to be no conscience or worry of liability. Everyone knows the toxic legacy of Monsanto, Dow, DuPont, Exxon, Shell, Union Carbide, etc. But there are many more examples of which few have heard. Dominion Colour Corporation, in Toronto, Canada, is still one of the largest lead paint exporters, despite common knowledge that lead poisoning should be regarded as a hazard. They and other lead paint manufacturers in the US (still to this day) and others around the world are responsible for the proliferation of toxic lead paint to India, Asia, and Africa, where children will eventually eat the lead paint chips and be poisoned, and that should be considered criminal. The town of Asbest in Russia is still shipping tons of Asbestos all over the world to be used in brake pads (still allowed in the US), and for use in new construction in many parts of the world, even though the WHO and most doctors in this world are well aware of the dangers of Mesothelioma. There are thousands more examples of toxic atrocities happening today all over the world, and right next door. The total disregard for public and worker health in most of these cases is tantamount to committing murder. These are homicidal crimes against humanity, and the criminals should be prosecuted, or at very least, be stopped. With many tens of thousands of troops, and full operations, lots of tons of garbage are generated. Besides the toxins that, everyone knows, come from burning plastic. Many soldiers, who dared to open their mouths, initially complained of eye irritation and burning, coughing and throat irritation, breathing difficulties, skin itching, and rashes. Now, many of these young brave veterans, are developing cancers, leukemia, and severe respiratory illnesses, and there is the fear of genotoxic damage yielding birth defects, as has been exhibited, along with the cancers and respiratory illnesses, in the local populations, (though this is not yet confirmed by the WHO). Over 50,000 US troops have registered in the Burn Pit Registry, though the Military has not yet taken responsibility. Remember, it took 27 years before the troops in the Agent Orange Registry were acknowledged and given any care or attention. Even if some of the KBR executives were not Americans, and this pertains to the Americans as well, every Boy Scout Handbook worldwide in every language instructs never to burn plastic, that it gives off poisonous gases. Everyone knows this. And many soldiers and officers who reenlisted and took multiple tours were exposed to these toxins repeatedly for years. Burning human feces at uneven temperatures creates an infectious aerosol. We could go on and on. They figured they were outside of US borders. They could do anything they liked So, they picked the cheapest way, in order to maximize their millions in profits. Part 3: Toxic Threats in Air, Water, and Soil Pollution The next section of this report will include, toxic category by toxic category, some of the information and a few of the thousands of relevant news stories that we feel must be mentioned. You may have no knowledge of some of these stories, as many of them have not yet been broken by mainstream media, but, though some of them will never make it into the news cycle, many are so big, that we believe you will hear of them eventually. In order to include as much and to be as brief as possible, we will only be able to touch on each of these stories, so we encourage you to pursue them further through your internet search engines. They are all there. Our reporting has been fact checked with multiple credible sources. That disaster, like many, is still ongoing. Any official or politician or news person who acts surprised about lead poisoning is being disingenuous. Thousands of years ago the ancient Romans pursued the concept of indoor plumbing using lead pipes, and became aware of the brain damaging dangers of lead, and for that reason banished lead mining and smelting to the provinces. The danger of lead is not new. Because of the car exhaust with the old leaded gasoline in most cities for many years, the strip of grass (or dirt, in many cases, because grass will not grow) in most cities between the sidewalk and the street the soil tests for lead at extremely high hazardous levels. They never get the warning. High levels of lead in the water have been reported in many cities for many years, recently in Jackson, MS, Newark, NJ, and Los Angeles, CA, but for many years also in Washington DC, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. Lead in the water of more Americans is being reported every day, many times threatened by lead plumbing pipes. We also found that regulatory officials in many States have been gaming the lead level tests, by running the water for 20 or 30 minutes, and removing the aerators, before taking samples. The State officials obviously are doing all they can to achieve the lowest lead levels in their tests, perhaps due to the prohibitive costs of changing the plumbing, and even with their cheating, high levels are often detected. Besides the dangers of lead paint and lead pipes, the environment is also being inundated with lead and other toxic heavy metals like Arsenic, Chromium, Cadmium, and Mercury from power generation, mining, and industry. This pollution is not just in Air Pollution from the burning of fossil fuels, but also gets into the water from the toxic Coal Ash that is stored in ponds behind every coal power station, and from Tailings Ponds behind every mine, many of them abandoned. These unlined ponds have been leaking toxic heavy metals into the ground and surface waters for decades. Also, imagine a Coal Ash or Tailings Pond, filled to overflowing with toxic chemicals and heavy metals, in the torrential downpour rains of climate change. People eat the fish they catch in these rivers and kids swim in them when it gets hot. This is careless recklessness. Toxic coal ash ponds and mine tailings ponds are a hazard all over the world. There been four major disasters in recent years involving breaches of these ponds with devastating results. (Coal Ash in 70 miles of the Dan River in North Carolina, the Mount Polley copper and gold tailings pond in Canada disaster, the Colorado River turned yellow from a gold mine breach disaster, and a recent Brazilian disaster that destroyed a huge ecosystem that reached all the way to the Atlantic Ocean.). And with hundreds of thousands of these ponds in the US and millions around the world, another terrible pond breach could happen at any moment. Many children have already shown symptoms and have tested high for lead. The dust with lead content in hot LA from the soil removal will be a major problem, with the environmental workers having to wear protective suits, and we are certain, the residents will need to be evacuated during the excavation. This is major, and we would surmise that there are many other lead battery recycling plants, and other industrial plants, that have spread lead and other heavy metal contaminants into the air, water and soil, in every major US city and elsewhere around the world. One such story is in beautiful Portland Oregon, where two glass factories have polluted the soil of a large swath of Portland with high levels of Arsenic. The suggestion was made to grow vegetables in Portland in raised gardens with fresh soil, and not in the Arsenic tainted soil. We have found instances of leafy vegetables grown in other parts of the US rejected for high Arsenic content, which also comes from pesticides. Mercury, originating in fossil fuel air pollution and from industrial processes, is a major threat to all who eat not only saltwater fish, but, as we recently discovered, freshwater fish, as well. It is bio magnified up the food chain, so that in the ocean tuna, for an example, is higher in Mercury than other fish, which is the reason we are all told to moderate our eating of tuna. Mercury is a threat to 2.6 billion people, who eat seafood as their principle source of protein, and more billions of us who eat fish occasionally. The more we burn fossil fuels, the more tons of Mercury will be deposited into our oceans, rivers, streams and lakes and the more will be absorbed by the fish. Accidents and leaks can happen along the entire chain from the mining of Uranium to the transportation, to the processing, to more transportation to the reactors, to storage, to more transportation or storage, to the waste disposal. Whether for peaceful power generation or for the nuclear bomb program, there are so many opportunities for life threatening radiation to escape. The aging Indian Point Nuclear Plant near NYC, among other accidents at that facility, recently spilled radioactive isotopes into the groundwater, and this type of accidental event has occurred in newer nuclear reactors, as well. Besides the worry that we could ever see a potential meltdown in any of our nuclear power plants in the US, there are five other radioactive hazards you should be aware of, happening right now in the US. The first is Radon, responsible for 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year. Yes, radioactivity is fatal, and though Radon comes directly from the Radium in the ground, it can also be found in all Natural Gas, particularly high in the Marcellus Shale, feeding many of the homes in the East. It can also be found inside many homes in the Marcellus Shale, especially during summer months, presumably through open windows, and this is most likely the case in other fracking field regions, especially in areas of higher Radon Potential. Every fracked oil well also produces Natural Gas that is most often vented or flared, and the flames of flaring do nothing to burn or reduce the Radon, a heavy radioactive inert gas that sinks to the ground, even from high gas flare towers. Please read about Radon, and why we need to test our homes. The second nuclear threat we feel we must discuss is Fracking. 15 million Americans live within 1 mile of a fracked oil or gas well. And the Natural Gas vented or flared from every oil or gas well must flow through Socks, that become radioactive with the particles it catches. These Socks and all Well Tailings are dangerously radioactive, and must be disposed of in landfills that are willing to accept radioactivity. Of course, the radioactivity can leach from landfills into groundwater. And over the years, besides wastewater injection deep into the earth (with earthquake risk), many trillions of gallons of toxic radioactive fracking and mining wastewater have been transported to municipal wastewater treatment plants, that do virtually nothing to remove or alter the Heavy Metals, EDC chemicals, and Radioactivity in the treatment they provide, before they deposit the tainted water into our rivers. Third, from the big rush to build atomic bombs and nuclear reactors, there are 15,000 Abandoned Uranium Mines in the West alone, with tons of highly radioactive tailings beside them. 4500 of these abandoned mines are in Navajo country and 2500 of them are in the state of Wyoming. Native American people have been plagued with a literal genocide, where the air at sacred sites and their groundwater is polluted with radioactivity. The genocide never ended. And the radioactive dust from these 15,000 mines, many on sacred sites, gets blown in the legendary Great Plains winds into the streams, and moves down our rivers into our lakes and ocean, and is carried to other parts of America and the world by the winds and jet stream. The fourth story is that high levels of nitrates in synthetic fertilizers from Big Agriculture have been leaching radioactivity from the natural Uranium in the Earth into the groundwater aquifers. The nitrates in the fertilizer are causing Uranium to become much more soluble in water causing the Ogallala Aquifer, the largest in the US, in the heartland of our country, and the Central Valley Aquifer in California, to test with elevated levels of radioactivity. Millions drink from these 2 aquifers, and many more millions eat vegetables fed by them. The major concern is that there are 9,000 tons of highly radioactive waste from the nuclear bomb program in that same landfill (with nearly 100,000 tons more in the adjacent West Lake Landfill, both designated as Superfund sites), leaching into groundwater from that landfill, with the dual threat that the fire is getting to within 1,000 feet of that nuclear waste. No one knows what might happen if the fire reaches the waste. Officials have predicted that only Radon and gases might flow, rather than a plume of radioactive particles and smoke. In any case, this is a potential disaster of vast proportions for millions of American citizens in Kansas and Missouri and beyond. Air Pollution is another major source of not just heavy metals, but also a myriad of chemicals. Most are toxic, but are in small enough doses that there is no apparent effect. Toxicologically, the dosage is most often deemed safe, but many of these EDC designer chemicals, synthesized (mostly from fossil fuels) in laboratories over the past 75 years, have been recognized as hormone disruptors. Although the dosage in blood is measured in parts per billion, or even parts per trillion, the toxicologists may call it a safe level, any doctor of endocrinology anywhere in this world will explain that even tiny doses of EDCs can throw off the delicate balance of sexual, thyroid, adrenal, etc., hormones with devastating health impacts, especially in children (prenatal through teen) in critical stages of development. Prominent scientists from every nation confirm that EDCs are dangerous toxic chemicals with abundant and severe health consequences, and yet we allow them to be used, with no testing or approval, in everyday consumer products in our homes, in our gardens, and in our food, and they get into our water, soil, and air. EDCs are no more a figment of our imagination than is the Science of Climate Change. The World Health Organization and our National Institute of Health are in agreement, that these everyday chemicals are dangerous, yet Industry, through their army of paid scientists and funded academics, would have you believe these chemicals are harmless. That is Fantasy Land. Meanwhile, 8 billion more pounds of this non-biodegradable synthetic substance are added into the environment each year. Also note that every paper dollar bill is coated with BPA from contact with receipts and lottery tickets. When you buy a parking meter ticket, or get a parking violation ticket, or a lottery ticket, or a boarding pass, or touch the label on your pharmaceutical drug bottles, etc., they are all printed on inkless printers using BPA (or BPA-free BPS, which is just as toxic per the NIH) to make an image on the paper without ink. When you put that parking ticket on your windshield, you are coating your windshield with BPA. When the ticket falls to the floor, you are coating your car carpets with BPA. As studied by the Environmental Defense Fund, the ingredient, Dermal Penetration Enhancer, allows 185 times more BPA to be absorbed into your skin from contact. Another dangerous EDC ingredient in Hand Sanitizers and in Disinfectants, Triclosan, is something that should be avoided. The point is these everyday chemicals in our food and consumer products have turned our world, our pockets, our purses, our wallets, our homes, and our bodies, into toxic dumps. These Perfluorinated EDC chemicals have been linked to birth defects, miscarriages, cancers, amongst other horrors. Water wells in 31 states for 15 million Americans were contaminated by 2003 with the now banned substance, MTBE, a toxic EDC gasoline antiknock additive, linked to leukemia and lymphoma. Persistent EDCs, like DDT, Dioxin, PCBs, PBDE (flame retardants), just like Lead and Mercury, remain in our bodies, but some EDCs, like BPA and Phthalates, are less persistent in our bodies, but not in the environment. All vertebrates, even fish, have endocrine systems, much like ours, and can be equally harmed by EDCs. Perchlorate, from rocket fuel, fireworks and explosives, is a dangerous listed EDC, and yet millions of Americans are drinking it without adequate warning. Perhaps the greatest EDC threat to humans and to every living organism on this planet, are the neurotoxic and estrogenic Pesticides and Herbicides (GMOs) sprayed on our crops (and in our gardens and on our lawns), that get into our food, our water, and our bodies, (and even harm our unborn children - for the benefit of the Right-To-Lifers). And studies have been done to prove Roundup, and other formulations with their additives, is 1,000 times more genotoxic, promoting birth defects, than the EDC, Glyphosate, alone. Other threats arising from the Agricultural Sector, (and also a common ingredient in processed foods) are the synthetic nitrates and phosphates from industrial fertilizers, that pollute our waters, and cause neurotoxin producing Algae Blooms and Dead Zones in our lakes and oceans (and even in our rivers, with the unprecedented case last summer of an Algae Bloom on 650 miles of the Ohio River). Mothers who live in areas of high nitrates are being warned never to feed that water to a baby under six months old. Nitrous Oxide is a greenhouse gas that is 400 times worse than CO2, and 4 times worse than Methane (CH4), as a promoter of Global Warming, and there is an possible alternative, Organic Agriculture. Finally, let us mention quickly several chemicals that are intentionally added to our water systems. Chlorine is used to keep down bacteria and viruses, though it does produce a toxic disinfection byproduct, Trihalomethane. Fluoride is another EDC additive to water that has been controversial for, at least, 60 years. Although some swear by it, it has been known to produce side effects, including Fluorosis, white spots on the teeth, and some communities have been lowering the levels of this not so benign chemical, that despite the claims of safety by its enthusiastic dental proponents, has side effects ranging from cognition problems and lower IQ to Cancer, and has been known to compromise health with thyroid problems, kidney disease, fractures, and more. We have seen thousands of examples of groundwater and well water contamination, including two in Wyoming and Pennsylvania that the EPA was until recently for 5 years too intimidated to determine that it definitely came from fracking. This is the water and the air we and our families and friends depend on every day to survive. Part 7: Toxic Gases and Particulates in Smog and Smoke Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), and Nitrous Oxide (N2O), are not just greenhouse gases, forming a blanket around the Earth to warm our planet; they are also toxic gases. Indoor concentrations greater than 700 have been found to have negative impacts on cognition, the ability to learn, and some rooms in schools have been tested at concentrations of CO2 greater than 1000 ppm. Carbon monoxide, another product of combustion, is lethal, and many other toxic gases regularly threaten our health. The subject of indoor air pollution is urgent, since it is one of the largest environmental disasters out there, causing one of the greatest numbers of environmental deaths. are the dangerous carcinogenic and or radioactive gases, Benzene, Toluene, Pentane, and Radon. (Radon alone is responsible for the lung cancer deaths of 21,000 Americans per year. Radon has a half-life of only 3.8 days, and then breaks down to Radioactive Lead and Polonium 210, that are not gases, but radioactive solids, and adhere to dust particles, that are inhaled deep into the lungs. Methyl Mercaptan, used as an additive to Natural Gas to make it stink like rotten eggs, is another danger associated with Natural Gas, because it is an EDC with side effects. Escalating Methane levels, from every well in every fracking field in the US and the world, as well as from natural causes due to man-made warming, like the melting of Permafrost and the warming of our Oceans, is out of control. Methane, Benzene, Radon and other toxic gases can also get into the water, as evidenced by well water being flammable, and set on fire right out of the faucet, after being contaminated by nearby fracking. We just heard of a river in Australia that is so 'carbonated' by methane from nearby fracking for Coal Seam Gas, that the river can be set on fire. Sulfur Dioxide (S02) from the burning of fossil fuels, a gas so corrosive, that it is actually eating into the metal in the subway system in New Delhi, India, is also corrosive to our lung tissue, skin and eyes. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) also from burning fossil fuels is another corrosive and inflammatory gas, when it gets into our lungs and eyes. Ozone (03), is a very corrosive toxic gas that is formed from by a reaction of nitrogen oxides from the burning of fossil fuels with ultraviolet light from the sun as the catalyst. It is a major cause of the bluish haze over fracking fields, and from traffic in our cities, and is very unhealthy to breathe. Dust masks may protect people from some of the larger particulates, but they do absolutely nothing to protect us from the toxic gases. And as dangerous as all these gases are to humans and to every living thing, the particulates in smoke and smog are even worse. All Smoke (is a result of incomplete combustion) and Smog, whether it be from the smoking of cigarettes or from the burning of fossil fuels, from wildfires, or fires set intentionally to clear land for Agriculture, are the same, in that they consist of an aerosol of particulates suspended in the air. A micron is one millionth of a meter. To give you an idea of just how small, a human hair is 60 microns in diameter. The composition of these particulates varies with the type of fuels burned, for examples, particulates from the combustion of Tarsands Oil and Diesel Fuel has more heavy metals than the burning of light crude oil, or derivatives such as gasoline. But even with smoke and brush fires, smoke contains particulates with a cocktail of dangerous EDC and carcinogenic chemicals. Wealthier people who raise families in cities are also not immune to the effects of air pollution. And now that fracking has brought heavy tractor-trailer traffic to the countryside, this damage to health from air pollution gases and particulates is not limited to our cities. Every fracking well for oil also produces natural gas, that is normally flared on the ground or from tall towers. They are so many, that they are visible in satellite photos, and each one is emitting an unending stream of tons of dangerous gases, including Ozone being formed by sunlight, and tons of particulates in the oily black carbon smoke from long plumes of fire. 15 million Americans live within 1 mile of a fracking well. In cities all over the world, Mexico City, Paris, London, worse in Beijing and other cities in China, and even worse in India, in New Delhi and Mumbai, the air pollution from traffic and other sources is so bad that you can see it. Therefore, in the table above, the different particle levels can be measured using either PM 10 or PM 2.5 monitors. We are filling our lungs, and the lungs of our children with this black gook, equivalent to the smoking of many packs of cigarettes. Besides the terrible health consequences (over 50 million deaths per year from air pollution), there is an element of terror in living for extended periods with smog or with the choking smoke and yellow skies of wildfires. Many people living in the Western US, Canada, and Siberia, and in 2016, in Kansas and Oklahoma in March and April, and in Indonesia and Malaysia, and all over the world, have been terrorized, often for weeks or months at a time, by smoke from the fires exacerbated by Climate Change and by smog from traffic and from the burning of fossil fuels. Part 8: Toxic Medicines in the Water Supply, Bio-hazards and Bio-pollution Instead of covering the thousands of infectious diseases, pathogens and medical conditions plaguing the human race, this article will focus on the toxic dangers presented by the medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, used to treat these diseases and conditions. Infectious diseases, bacterial, viral, or fungal, whether they are waterborne like Cholera, or food-borne like E. coli and Listeria, or airborne, like influenza and tuberculosis, or insect-borne, like the Zika virus, are not just medical threats, but also environmental threats, especially after floods and environmental disasters. Like Ebola, many of these diseases are lethal, but many more die each year of dehydration from infectious bacterial related dysentery, than from Ebola. Just like the toxic EDC chemicals discussed in the toxic chemicals section, they do get into our water supply, and all of these drugs have side effects and problems with combinations. An example of one such drug, that most consider harmless, is Tylenol, Acetaminophen, that can damage the liver of a person who drinks alcohol. The combination, not one or the other, is the hazard. All of these drugs have been found in the water millions are drinking from the relatively clean waters of Lake Michigan, for just one example arising from a 2013 water study. Yes, the concentrations are miniscule, ppm or ppb or even ppt (parts per trillion), but the combinations of these drugs are there nonetheless. Millions of people die each year from taking these pharmaceutical medicines, either by overdose, by lethal combination, and, perhaps more often, by taking them exactly as prescribed. All the pharmaceutical and over-the-counter drugs we take have side effects. These side effects are read aloud on every TV commercial for every new designer drug promoted. These drugs enter our groundwater (where we get the bottled spring water) and our lakes, rivers and streams, and eventually our municipal water systems (and remember, that includes about half of the bottled water, not labeled 'spring') from improper disposal and the leaching out of the landfills, but the bigger root is through feces and urine. And here we are ingesting minute quantities of multiple antibiotics in the water we drink and use to cook our food. Antimicrobial resistance, resistance to antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal drugs, is mutating infectious strains of otherwise curable diseases, and posing a real threat to humans and animals most often ending in death. MRSA, a multiple antibiotic strain of the Staphylococcus (Staph) germ that originally appeared mostly in hospitals and nursing homes but recently a larger number of antimicrobial resistant diseases are cropping up in the hospitals and elsewhere. Now, deadly superbugs, MRSA, VRE, ESBL, and CRE are presenting, with lethal strains of resistant E.coli and Salmonella bacteria threatening our food supply. (And antibiotic resistant microbes are not the only threats to our food supply. These antimicrobial drugs are being constantly force-fed to these animals in small maintenance doses in order to prevent diseases, and to promote rapid growth despite horrifying conditions, and in higher doses, when diseases present. This mismanagement of the health of these poor confined animals, in order to imitate the efficiencies of an industrial operation has side effects, and one of these is that antimicrobial resistant strains of bacteria, viruses, and fungi are proliferating and becoming a worse threat to human health. Not only are the resistant microbes escaping the CAFOs on the skin and clothing of people who work in them, but these dangerous resistant bacteria are being shipped to every supermarket in America, and have been detected broadly in packages of meat and poultry. But be careful of hygiene. If your loved one contracts an infectious disease that is resistant to multiple antibiotics, there is a chance that that loved one will die, even in the best hospitals in the US. Some expert medical professionals fear, with the current overuse of antimicrobials, this situation could explode. The fact that these diseases continue to mutate, and are becoming more prevalent, is the reason this subject is so urgent. Another threat presented by CAFOs is the massive quantities of waste produced.. Thousands or hundreds of thousands of animals under one roof being force-fed for rapid growth produce huge quantities of urine and feces. Mountains of feces could spontaneously combust, so instead, every CAFO has a man-made pond for putting all of this toxic waste, including growth hormones and other chemicals. These stinking toxic ponds overflow, especially in the torrential rains of Climate Change, or leach through torn liners (if there are any liners), and get into the groundwater, and into nearby streams, rivers and lakes, contaminating them with fecal bacteria, and quite probably with antibiotic resistant bacteria. A common practice to diminish the ponds is to spray the water up into the air, which forms a stinking aerosol that blows in the wind into nearby fields, woods, and neighborhoods. In any case, it is very unpleasant and a real hazard to live downwind or downstream of a CAFO. Yes, besides polluting the water, when the mud dries, bacteria, viruses and fungi, including resistant superbugs, can become airborne and be transported long distances on the dust. Dangerous fecal coliform bacteria, whether from humans or animals, present a threat when they are breathed into the lungs or blow into streams and lakes, whether or not the bacteria are drug-resistant. Millions around the world die each year from dysentery and related dehydration caused by microbes and parasites getting into the food and water. In many areas of the world, clean water, or any water at all, is a luxury. In most cities the plumbing and sewage infrastructure is old, corroded and leaky. Given the scenario of the torrential downpours of climate change and the resulting flooding, the pressure of all that floodwater is enough to push contaminants into those leaky pipes supplying homes with water. Pathogens and parasites, as well as other pollutants, can actually get into the water pipes. And people get sick, or are told to boil their water before using it. Because of the dangers presented by Prions and by antimicrobial resistant bacteria, viruses and fungi, the use of animal or human feces, or of sewage sludge, as fertilizer bears hazard. And because of the threat from Prions, the scheme of recycling urine into drinking water may not be advisable. Finally, the subject of medical waste must be brought up in the context of this article. But in practice, these medical waste disposal companies with billions of dollars of revenue operate for profit, and are not as thorough and safe as they should be, when the incoming trucks line up, the assembly line backs up, and the corporate bosses demand more productivity, and suddenly health and safety concerns goes out the window. The constant truckloads of medical waste include a vast, stinking assortment of body parts, organs, fetuses, soiled bandages, needles, syringes, intravenous tubes, colostomy bags, etc., much of which is plastic. You remember from the earlier segment in this report on the story of the Burn Pits of Iraq and Afghanistan poisoning our troops and the locals, that the burning of plastic produces Dioxin, a known carcinogen. If half of what was reported by EnviroTV is true, much of it revealed by an anonymous eyewitness whistleblower, the whole scheme is an utter nightmare, and a threat to the community and to anyone downwind, including all of us. When your house is flooded, you have no choice but to strip the interior down to the studs, and replace all the wallboard. Otherwise, there is no way to stop the growth of mold and mildew, risking the inhalation and ingestion of mold spores and mycotoxins. Some people are more sensitive to molds than others, but living with mold is never healthy. Not all black molds are as neurotoxic as the species, Stachyboros chartarum, known as Toxic Black Mold, which causes confusion and severe mental, neurological, respiratory, circulatory, and immune system problems. Most Americans think Asbestos is banned or illegal. Though Asbestos is banned in 50 nations, and though a US law was passed by a bipartisan Congress in 1989, the Asbestos Ban and Phase Out Rule, the same law was overturned by the Courts in 1991. These include brake pads and linings, transmissions and clutch facings, gaskets, cement sheets and shingles, clothing, Pipeline wrap, roofing coatings, and vinyl floor tiles, amongst others. There have been many documented cases of traffic cops who have died from Asbestos exposure, and all people who live or work near roads are at risk. Still to this day, Russia, one of the chief sources, is shipping Asbestos, not just to the US for brakes and other products, but also for use as sprayed building insulation, still being used mostly in Africa and Asia, to poison people and animals in these nations, until the remediation workers in their White Space Suits and Respirators arrive to remove it years from now, if we ever get that far. These are Crimes Against Humanity. Silica Sand Another major health threat is the Dust from Silica Sand, Respirable Crystalline Silica, like tiny shards of glass when breathed into the lungs of humans or animals. Silica sand in massive quantities is being mined and transported for the Fracking industry. Every time a well is fracked and 2 million gallons of water is injected while Fracking a well, in addition to hundreds of toxic chemicals, 8 to 10 million pounds of Silica Sand is mixed in and injected in order to prop open the fractures in the rock, which will allow them to yield Gas or Oil. For each Frack job, and most wells must be fracked multiple times in their lifetime, 40 to 50 hundred-ton rail cars of Silica Sand must be mined, transferred, and transported. From the rail transfer station to the well sites, all this Silica Sand must be loaded into 50,000 pound truckloads, roughly 160 to 200 truckloads per Frack job. Though the EPA and the DOT insist that the toxic dust generated by this transportation be minimized, OSHA in their published health documents is well aware of the hazards presented by Respirable Crystalline Silica, and the lethal Silicosis and Cancers that may result from inhaling it. Frack workers are at Ground Zero for breathing in this dust, but transportation and leakage during the transportation down our highways, railways, and roads, and by our homes, of these massive quantities of sand are threats to us all. No matter how well the rail cars and trucks are tarped, as prescribed by the EPA, some Silica dust always leaks, and at the transfer points massive amounts become airborne. With the hot dry winds of climate change, this dangerous dust is being blown long distances from sand mines, highways, railways, transfer points, and well pads all over America, and in this way, too, we all are in danger from Fracking. There is a Cancer risk from the PM10 crystalline particles to the lungs from inhalation, and to the ovaries from application for feminine hygiene. Johnson and Johnson, one of the largest producers, is alleged to have had prior knowledge of the hazards, and has already paid out large settlements. It is remarkable that a product we all considered so innocuous that we use it on our babies and ourselves, and has been used in barbershops for over 100 years, can present such a threat. We listed these A through L, just for reference, and not to be interpreted as sequence of action. We developed this list through our observations of hundreds of weather disasters, floods, fires, spills, explosions, mine tailings breaches, and so many natural disasters and anthropogenic catastrophes, including the lead poisoning of Flint, Michigan. Throughout this post we have reported briefly on many of these incidents, but each has its own stories and lessons to be learned. A. Trust Your Nose If it smells bad, it probably is. Smells are something we never forget. There are many poisonous gases that are odorless, but if you smell something bad, that is the time to evacuate the area if you are able to, even before the danger from exposure has been confirmed. And if you smell a bad or unusual scent in the water, be suspect. Perhaps the reason is that our noses are always available, and operative, unlike test equipment. If you smell something bad, or see something bad, despite what they tell you, that is the best time to evacuate, if you can, especially if you have young children to protect,. Waiting for the authorities to tell you what to do might be too late. D. Protect the Most Vulnerable It is especially urgent that we recognize that even if we have no alternative to exposing ourselves to toxics, that we make every effort not to expose children, pregnant women, the elderly, or the unhealthy. The repetition and length of time of exposure should also be limited if at all possible. For an example, if a person has respiratory problems, and they are exposed to smoke, it may restrict their ability to breathe. And the longer they are exposed, and this applies to healthy people as well, the more critical it may get. Especially when children are exposed to toxics in key stages of development, from the womb through teenager, they are often permanently harmed by toxics. Avoid Freak of Nature Foods - GMOs, Processed Foods, Junk Foods, and Fast Foods. And try to eat Organic Foods to reduce your exposure to toxic pesticides, herbicides, chemicals, and additives. Heavy metals and some EDC chemicals are persistent toxins, in that they remain in your body, but fortunately your liver and kidneys are very efficient at removing many of the toxic EDC chemicals from your blood, through bodily waste functions. Detox teas and detox regimens help you detox even more quickly and effectively. We understand that levels of BPA and BPS naturally lower significantly in just a few days of non-exposure. All these chemicals are dangerous EDCs, and besides these cosmetics and health and beauty aid products, there are so many others in everyday life. These chemicals are so prevalent that unless you consciously avoid them and stop re-dosing yourself and your children daily, blood levels of these toxins will vary, but, but overall they will remain constant, and the harm will also be constant. F. Demand Protective Gear and Equipment In many industrial, fracking, mining, or farming operations, protective gear is issued, but unless the wearing of it is enforced, many workers refrain from using it, due to the discomfort of wearing it, especially when temperatures and humidity are high. This is human nature, and can only be countered by education and enforcement. These are dangerous, often carcinogenic, toxins the workers may be breathing, ingesting, or absorbing through their skin. Any protection from toxins is better than no protection, when workers are exposed. Some respirators are more effective than others, but dust masks with, with or without exhalation valves, do absolutely nothing to protect workers or civilians from breathing dangerous PM 10 particulates deep into their lung tissue, and certainly they do nothing to reduce toxic gases. Water filters and air filters (or respirator filters for 1 example) are not effective beyond their expiration date. It is imperative that they be replaced and maintained. We have heard of schools, due to budget cuts, that have not maintained lead filters on drinking fountains for children, whose ability to learn can be harmed. This type of behavior is unconscionable and should be prosecuted. G. Test for Toxics Many toxins are not visible, are odorless, and are tasteless. The only way to really know that your water or air is safe is to have your water or air tested. We realize that most will be unable to afford the luxury of independent testing, but if you can afford to do it, we recommend it, and if the tests come out positive, but there is a filter or way to remediate the toxin, and if you can, we recommend you go ahead, and then re-test.. Even if the authorities assure you that the water or air has been tested, and are willing to show you the results of the tests, realize that the tests, or the reporting, may be skewed to show negative or lower results. Though the costs of independent testing are possibly too high for individuals to bear alone, they are not so prohibitive, that a group of families or the community might pay for them to verify or repudiate official testing. H. Vote Voting is not the only solution, and certainly the system and many politicians are corrupt, but whenever you live in a society, even if merely under the guise of democracy, it is better to vote, than to not vote. If enough people are educated to the evils of the Absurd Status Quo, and are able to get politicians into office, who, at least, give lip service to opposing it, and to backing progressive values, as opposed to right wing values, chances for laws favoring our health and safety improve. That is Fantasy land. If your friends and family hear it directly from you, they may actually pay attention, and be concerned about these toxic hazards. And please stress that these are not conspiracy theories, that these are real threats, confirmed by real, not corporate, scientists, and offer them this article, and the assistance of Google, or any search engine to back it up. Unless people become aware of where the hazards are, and what to try to avoid, they are defenseless. Without one on one communication, education programs are often largely ineffective. So you, and as many as possible, are key in the endeavor of educating the public. J. Support Political Action Unless more people are educated to the real and immediate threats of chemicals and pollution, there will never be enough activists for large enough scale political actions to make sufficient impact to effect real change. Get involved, and also encourage others to attend events, rallies, protests, and blockades, and to support the movement with donations. If you are gassed, besides milk and other ways to mitigate the pain, try to evacuate the area, so exposure time is shortest. CS gas is an endocrine disrupter. The longer and more often your exposure, the more potential there is for harm. Often protesters are penned in with no escape from the tear gas, as the militarized law enforcement did to protesters in Ferguson, Missouri. For these reasons, try to never allow the most vulnerable to be exposed. K. Support Legal Action Besides fighting the threat of toxics through education and political action in the streets, legal action can be very effective in our struggle. Despite the corruption, there are still laws and courts in the US, and in many nations, and occasionally Justice prevails. And though often the deck is stacked against us, and despite our good evidence and sure cases, the decisions end up against us, but still there continue to be victories. We applaud the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resource Defense Council, the Environmental Working Group, the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and many more fine organizations and the many attorneys, who in lieu of more lucrative opportunities, dedicate themselves to protecting our wildlife, our water, our air, our soil, and human health. You can be an essential part of this legal action by supporting these efforts through small donations. We are celebrating three recent climate victories in various parts of the US, where judges have acknowledged violations of trust by either the Nation or the State to our children and future generations by not protecting them from the harm presented by Climate Change. There were no clear settlements to any of these cases, but these victories could be become important precedents to future legal actions with more substantial effects. These suits are examples of the people, teenagers, taking the government to court, and winning on the basis of US Law and the Constitution. More and more of us are finding that we must subject ourselves to arrest, often mass arrests, by standing in the way of pipelines, oil trains, and any of the various polluters outlined in this article. It is fact that these disasters are statistically happening more often, more severely, and to more people, so it is important that we realize they can happen anywhere, even to us. And it is important for you and your family that you come up with a plan of how and where to meet, and possibly a land telephone line to leave messages, in case cell phones and Internet become unavailable. Whatever you do to prepare for whatever may come, it will be to your benefit. What makes these charts so remarkable is that they were plotted on an antique computer, the size of a room, with only a fraction of the processing power of your tiny laptop, on the campus of MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and printed on an antique dot matrix ink ribbon printer with the technology of the birth of the computer age. This chart and 11 more produced by the computer, ranging from environmental collapse to equilibrium were published in 1972 in a book titled, The Limits to Growth, a book that sold 12 million copies, and was translated to 37 languages, and is still to this day the best-selling environmental book ever published. The Volkswagen Foundation agreed to fund the project only after Dr. Jay Forrester of MIT, and the Founder of System Dynamics, the science that studies the interconnection of complex systems, put together a flow diagram on the interaction of global complex systems, and agreed to present a methodology for the research, based on the programming of computer models, that would yield these charts. To our knowledge, this was the first computer environmental model, and though it was very simple, compared to the sophisticated environmental models generated today, it is remarkable how closely this study reflects the environmental issues of today, including all of the same variables. But these young scientists endeavored to remain apolitical, and to base their findings strictly on the data and on the results of their computer modeling. Still, despite the gravity of their findings, they remained optimistic that the world would heed the warning presented by their study, and avoid catastrophe. The logical conclusion reached is that in a world of unlimited exponential growth, somewhere we will reach and overshoot sustainable capacity. But the Limits to Growth team would stress that Doomsday is only one scenario out of 12 presented in the computer models ranging from Doomsday to Equilibrium Technological advances in uncovering new deposits of natural resources and in the handling of pollution might mitigate some of the consequences of unbridled growth, but eventually we would get to the point of collapse, where even technology would not be able to save us. And we are seeing this in 2016, in the resulting air and water pollution from the huge growth in the burning of unconventionally produced fossil fuels. Book sales of the Limits to Growth were amazingly successful, but the book was maligned and panned by critics from the start. The New York Times Book Review Section was one of the first to criticize the book, starting a global controversy that continues to this day. The book was referred to by name and denounced by President Ronald Reagan, and was also mentioned as a false flag by George H. W. Bush. The book and the young scientists who worked on it, and who advocated it, were mocked and criticized. The reason politicians, businessmen and economists were, and still are, so enraged by this book is that it challenges everything they stand for. Growth has become a Creed, a Religion, in Economics. All businesses, stock markets, budgets and economic plans are built on the foundation of Growth. For the devotees, it would be unimaginable to have an Economy without Growth. This explains why the Limits to Growth was rejected, and just as Climate Change continues to this day to be denied by many (Republican, Brexit and other right-wing nationalist) politicians and leaders, the warnings contained in this 1972 book, about Carbon dioxide and Methane and Global Warming from the Greenhouse effect, were discounted and ignored. Remarkably, the young scientists on the Limits to Growth team were already aware in 1972 of Global Warming, and of the Chemical Burden of Progress in the form of Lead, Mercury and Heavy Metal Pollution and Air, Water, and Soil Pollution, and Soil Erosion, as it relates to Food Production. In 1972, they wrote about the concept of Sustainability, a subject in vogue today, and that the costs of mitigation of Toxic Pollution and Climate Change would also rise exponentially. Politics, Economics, and arguments as to whether the findings of the scientists were valid, along with the hope that Advanced Technology would eventually be there to save us, have delayed action, and whereas action 40 years ago would have been so much more effective and so much less expensive, we had better begin. And part of that must be an acknowledgment that organized managed decline in growth would be better than to allow Nature to take over, and force the population down, which would be horrible beyond anything imaginable. That could be our fate, if we keep our heads in the sand, deny the data in our models, and proceed to grow ourselves into Oblivion . Health is more valuable than any amount of wealth. Finally, it is essential that we realize that we are dangerously close to the Tipping Points of Toxic Pollution, as well as those of Climate Change. Just as the young scientists at MIT, already in 1972, included the increase in Carbon Dioxide, from the ramped up burning of fossil fuels, and its warming effect, into the single variable on their computer graph of Pollution, the threat of increased Toxic Pollution is equally as urgent as the threat of Climate Change, and every day, we are getting closer to the Tipping Points. In our article, Closer to the Tipping Point, in order to illustrate Abrupt Climate Change, we started with the story of a pond crossing its tipping point in a toxic algae bloom and dead zone and fish kill. Unless we do something about it, and guard against our demise, one by one, more sources and bodies of water, more ponds, and more ecosystems, will become polluted, and will reach their Tipping Points, and the health of individuals, and of more and more species, will reach their Tipping points, with Sickness, Cancer, and Death. But we can vow, from here forward to stop putting more poisons into the environment, and we can vow to stop allowing companies to profit by the homicidal poisoning of our children, each other, and future generations, as in the production and distribution of lead paint, asbestos, EDC chemicals, including herbicides and pesticides, and the unrelenting extraction and burning of more and more fossil fuels. This is Mass Murder. These are Crimes against Humanity. We have no choice but to fight on against the Absurd Status Quo, poisoning our babies, ourselves, and our Climate, that liberals and conservatives allow, not just in the US, but on every continent. On the Darkside, the opposite is true. There are Right Wing Nationalist Movements growing, not just in the US, with Trump and the Tea Party Republicans, but with Brexit in the UK, the Nazi party in France, the Right Wing resurgence in Australia, and around the globe. We described this phenomenon, and how their self avowed goal is to break down all regulations, all obstructions to trashing their own precious Nations with Pollution, and we include the liberal Duplicitous Democrats, who make lovely speeches, but accommodate the Status Quo as much as the Right Wingers. Unfortunately, in this case, the ends justify the means, though this has always been so with Revolutionaries. As difficult as many of you may find it to vote for Clinton, and I too, we urge you to vote for the elements of the Bernie Sanders Revolution that we worked so hard (and spent so much of our own money through donations) to have included in the Democratic Platform. I have friends from Northern Maine to Northern California that volunteered and donated time and time again to the Bernie Sanders Campaign. And these people had nothing. We apologize to our readers from other nations for concentrating this section on the US elections, but let me reiterate, the subjects in this discussion are relevant to the politics of all nations, where Right Wing groups are now gaining prominence, and we firmly believe that our Revolution against the Status Quo is urgent, for the sake of all human beings, our children, and future generations, and that it will only succeed, against the omnipotence of corporate power, if it is able to transcend national borders. Please regift them to your family, friends, and neighbors. The first book we are pleased to present is, The Limits to Growth, (211 pages), which since 1972 has become the best selling environmental book ever published, though it was maligned and criticized since the day it was printed, for challenging the concept of Growth, given the finite world in which we live. We covered this book in Part 11, the Final Thoughts section of this post. We especially urge you to read pages 69-87 (pages 71-89 in the PDF) on the issues of Pollution in our Air, Water, and Soil. It is remarkable that these 17 scientists responsible for this study, as early as 1972, were aware of, and took into account, Sustainability, and so many of the issues covered in this and our previous posts. Verse 202 on page 149 refers to our ability to make changes in our lifestyles toward a more sustainable future. The third book is Terra Viva, Our Soil, Our Commons, Our Future, A New Vision for Planetary Citizenship, (104 pages), by Dr. Vandana Shiva, the Mother of the Seed Freedom movement, and her colleagues. The reason this book was again included is that it presented a paradigm of a Circular Economy, rather than the unsustainable exponential Growth economy. This is what Dana Meadows, the author of The Limits To Growth, envisioned, and what a Bernie Sanders type of Revolution might look like, with priorities rearranged. This video could apply to much more than Flint, and also to the concept, illustrated by this lead poisoning tragedy, that Black Lives Matter. Third, we honor Erin Brockovich with the inclusion of a wonderful interview by Tavis Smiley of PBS, about her tireless activism, not just in a movie starring Julia Roberts, but for real, every day, as an advocate for citizens all over the US whose water has become contaminated. She is truly one of the heroes of this story. But, in addition to that, and also in addition to being a fine advocate and spokesman for the environmental movement, Mark has rolled up his shirt sleeves, and jumped right in, with the establishment of Water Defense, and with his partner, the superhero, Scott Smith, travels from one spill to another all over the country to test the water. Our fifth video, Final Warning: The Limits To Growth, is an excellent documentary with an intimate look into the people and the story behind the bestselling book, The Limits To Growth, from the perspective of 2012, 40 years later. This extraordinary book and the findings are highlighted in Part 11, our Final Thoughts section. Our seventh and final video, Circularity, explains the concept of a Circular Economy, as was described in our third Priceless Document, Terra Viva, and in Part 11 of this report, from the point of view of Sustainability experts. We thank our readers in Germany, France, Canada, Ireland, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates (our biggest audience outside the US), and we thank all of our US and international readers (from over 150 nations). We really do appreciate you taking the time to read our articles. And we extra-appreciate when you refer them to friends. Whether we really are able to forward the Revolution Against the Status Quo, that is poisoning our babies, ourselves, our future generations, our Climate, and all life on Earth, depends largely on whether we and others can get this story out, and make citizens of the world aware, and get them out to vote. We love getting feedback. For the sake of our people, our families, and Mother Earth, we encourage all of you, as charter members of Woodstock Earth, to spread the word and help get these stories out. Part 14: Priceless Documents 1. Lots of great information and inspiration, both of which we all need. Lots of great information and inspiration, both of which we all need. Thanks.
