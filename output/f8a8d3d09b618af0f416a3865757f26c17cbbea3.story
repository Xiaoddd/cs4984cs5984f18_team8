Though many of these leaks and spills have taken place within the US, fossil fuel infrastructure in other countries has also proven to be unsafe and unreliable in recent months. This dangerous company policy has led some politicians to call for an investigation. Within several hours, the fire was luckily under control and did not spread to other parts of the refinery, likely due to an internal safety system which thankfully worked. The cause of the fire is now being investigated and ambulances have responded to treat any health issues locals may have suffered to the inhalation of toxic fumes. The company claims it will monitor air quality around the refinery, though some have questioned whether or not they can be counted on to provide a reliable measure as the accident itself is known to be a result of company negligence. Frankly, oil and gas companies, regardless of their nationality, consistently put their profits over the safety of people and the environment, as evidenced by the ongoing fight over the Dakota Access pipeline as well as series of costly accidents around the world.
