On Sunday, December 4, 2016 afternoon, Standing Rock Sioux tribe members and their allies celebrated, crying tears of joy, over the fact the Dakota Access Pipeline project would be rerouted away from land that's deemed sacred. Protesters say they know the fight is not over and Sunday's decision is only a delay. That is why some have vowed to stay, despite the Standing Rock Chairman statement that people can return home for the winter. Some continue to stream into the camp, while others leave. People are bringing supplies like wood and winter clothing to keep protesters warm during the North Dakota cold.
