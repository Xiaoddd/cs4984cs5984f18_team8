What makes this even more concerning is that veterans, possibly numbering in the hundreds, have committed to join the protests on Dec. 5-7 to stop DAPL and defend water protectors. This multi-state force is only possible by abusing a law meant to aid states in times of natural disaster. It appears that at least some police departments are expecting to get reimbursed by the oil company, which would make them nothing more than mercenaries. Unicorn Riot has obtained emails from the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which call for an investigation into the money trail enabling the militarized police crackdown at DAPL. I figured I should have some formal form instead of writing hours on a napkin (smiley face). However, an interview with the CEO of Energy Transfer Partners earlier this month raises even more suspicion in light of the emails. All of this calls for further investigation into every penny of funding going into the militarized police crackdown at DAPL, which has inflicted serious injuries on protesters and arrested more than 400 people. As Unicorn Riot notes, the uncovered emails reveal that at least some of the cops indeed view themselves as mercenaries for a private oil company. In the interview, CEO Warren was absolutely sure their pipeline will be completed, even though the Corps of Engineers has delayed granting the easement to build under Lake Oahe. the drinking water source for the Standing Rock Sioux. Despite already losing tens of millions of dollars due to delays caused by the protests, his oil company is willing to give the cops millions more for their services in brutalizing and rounding up protesters.
