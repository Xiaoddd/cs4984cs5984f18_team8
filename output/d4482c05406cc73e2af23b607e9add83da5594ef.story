The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe is at the frontline of the current environmental crisis facing our nation. The Keystone XL pipeline has been approved to cross within two miles of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation. Although the Tribe exhausted its emergency efforts to convince the courts to stop the flow of oil in the Dakota Access litigation and has therefore voluntarily dismissed the appeal related to that effort, the merits of its environmental claims, its treaty claims, and its religious freedom claims have yet to be decided by the trial court. The Tribe believes its pending claims in the Dakota Access litigation are strong and the Tribe is committed to this fight and the fights on the horizon for the long term. Trump and big business should beware because together I know we will beat DAPL, Keystone, uranium mining, and every threat to Grandmother Earth.
