Our overheated world is amplifying drought and making megafire commonplace. The day breaks with an other-worldly orange hue, as the sun filters through a haze of smoke high in the atmosphere. Firesky has become a constant companion of summer in the west in the age of climate change. I woke up to firesky this morning in Portland, despite living some 350 miles from the Carr fire that has scorched 100,000 acres and killed six, including two firefighters. The Carr fire is already one of the most destructive in California history; and the history books are being rewritten. Of the 12 worst fires in the state, seven have now burned since 2015. A separate California blaze has forced the evacuation of Yosemite National Park, and killed eight, including a pair of firefighters. The Rolling Stone feature below was originally published in our September 24, 2015 issue, but it is terribly more timely than ever. By August, an inferno was stirring in the forests east of the Cascades. That blaze soon exploded into the worst wildfire in state history, charring more than 300,000 acres and destroying dozens of homes. As they raged, the wildfires in eastern Oregon and Washington devoured an area nearly the size of Delaware. The states called up more than 1,000 members of their National Guards, and the Army mobilized 200 active-duty troops to the fire lines. Ten Blackhawk helicopters and four C-130 Hercules aircraft deployed to help fight fire from the skies. This is the present, and the future, of climate change. Our overheated world is amplifying drought and making megafire commonplace. In California alone, the epic drought is up to 25 percent more severe than it would have been, absent climate change. Standing near fire lines in late August, Inslee vowed to extinguish the blazes in his state. But the governor also called on Americans to confront an enemy fiercer and more insidious than fire itself. The fiery future is upon us. Steep reductions in greenhouse pollution can lessen the danger going forward, as Inslee suggests. But the dark reality is that significant future burning has already been locked in. In parts of the West, very large fires will increase sixfold by midcentury, according to a new study from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Soaring temperatures and an early-melting snowpack have brought raging wildfires to landscapes that have not been kissed by flame for millennia. The tragedy of climate-driven megafire is that the fires themselves worsen global warming by pumping megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This is especially true north of the Arctic Circle. For the past 5,000 years, the Arctic Alaskan tundra was too frigid and too wet to support significant wildfire. The fire burned more than 400 square miles, not only charring a pristine landscape, but setting off a greenhouse bomb, igniting organic matter in the soil that had lain dormant for centuries. We never thought a big chunk of it would burn. This summer, Alaska was set to burn due to an unusually warm winter combined with a pitiful snowfall. With spring came soaring temperatures: more than seven degrees above average statewide. When lightning struck, Alaska blazed. As bad as wildfire has been in Alaska, it will only get worse, according to the National Climate Assessment, the 2014 federal report that gauges regional risks of climate change. As worldwide temperatures rise, wildfires will only increase. The problem, it turns out, was not a lack of water, but rather that so little of it fell as snow. This winter, temperatures soared 5.6 degrees above normal in the region, leading to record-low snowpack, and to stream runoff that peaked, in many places, in the dead of February. In March, Inslee declared a statewide drought emergency in Washington. gone. It has primed the region to burn. But in times of drought, this tax on the water system is significant and damaging. Joe Casola, deputy director of the Climate Impacts Group at the University of Washington, points to the future. According to current EPA projections, April snowpack in the Cascades will shrink by as much as 40 percent by 2040. By 2080, according to the National Climate Assessment, the median acreage burned in Pacific Northwest wildfires is likely to quadruple. Instead of a once-in-20-years event, the type of megafires now ravaging Oregon and Washington could be expected to occur one year out of every two. In 1995, it was only 16 percent. Ten years from now, the agency projects, these costs will balloon to become two-thirds of the budget. In its wisdom, Congress has set the Forest Service budget on the basis of a 10-year average cost. That formula worked well enough with a more stable climate. But the agency has been saddled with ever-increasing, and increasingly costly, megafire. With the Northwest ablaze, Congress is responding. The reform effort is championed by Western lawmakers, including, ironically, Republicans who have either denied climate change exists, like Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming, or fought controls on greenhouse gases, like Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho. Only one percent of blazes are now driving 30 percent of costs. The worst fire in the state record books, the October blaze reached into the suburbs of San Diego, burning more than 2,200 homes. In a small blessing, the record fire season in the Pacific Northwest this summer has been relatively limited in its human and financial costs. The affected region is sparsely populated forest and rangeland, separated from Seattle and Portland by a major mountain range. Indeed, Northern California skirted disaster in July. California Gov. Jerry Brown has recently been calling out the Republican presidential candidates who refuse to even acknowledge that climate change exists. At its most dangerous, warming-driven wildfire poses an existential threat. Sign up for our newsletter.
