Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: We are broadcasting from the COP 22 here in Marrakech, Morocco. This comes just over a week after Trump was elected president. AZIZ MEKOUAR: We call for all parties to strengthen and support efforts to eradicate poverty, ensure food security and to take stringent action to deal with climate change challenges in agriculture. We call for urgently raising ambition and strengthening cooperation amongst ourselves to close the gap between current emissions projectories and the pathway needed to meet the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. We call for an increase in the volume, flow and access to finance for climate projects, alongside improved capacity and technology, including from developed to developing countries. We unanimously call for further climate action and support, well in advance of 2020, taking into account the specific needs and special circumstances of developing countries, the least developed countries and those particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. We, who are parties to the Kyoto Protocol, encourage the ratification of the Doha Amendment. Tina Johnson is policy director at the U.S. Climate Action Network. So, yeah, I definitely think that the speeches over the last several days had that impact and effect on us as a civil society and over other countries, as well. AMY GOODMAN: Earlier this week, Frank Bainimarama, the prime minister of Fiji, appealed directly to President-elect Donald Trump. PRIME MINISTER FRANK BAINIMARAMA: I want to make a special appeal to the president-elect of the United States, Donald Trump, for a personal change of heart and a public change of policy on the issue of climate change. I am especially alarmed by reports that you intend to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which would be disastrous for every person on Earth. I appeal to you to show the leadership that the rest of the world expects the United States to take on this issue. Please take another look at the overwhelming scientific consensus on the man-made effects of global warming. Please come, as a matter of urgency, to see for yourself the devastating impact that rising sea levels and extreme weather events are already having on our peoples and our way of life. President-elect Trump, I formally invite you to Fiji and promise you the warmest of welcomes. I repeat, the world looks to America for leadership as we work together to confront this challenge to our survival and the well-being of our planet. Vinaka vaka levu. I thank you. Meanwhile, climate activists have staged a series of actions here at the U.N. summit calling on world leaders to do more to address the climate crisis. WINONA KISINO: Ixkwe aolep. This is in the North Pacific. Right now, my people are the front line. We are affected by climate change. The islands is barely two meters above sea level. I have two babies. AMY GOODMAN: On Thursday, climate activists also staged protests here targeting corporate sponsors of the U.N. climate summit. They began by staging a die-in at the U.N. climate summit inside a pavilion sponsored by the Moroccan phosphate giant OCP. PROTESTER: This action symbolizes indigenous and nonindigenous groups from both inside and outside of Morocco coming together to show the similarities of environmental atrocities communities around the world face. We wish to show how corporate sponsors of the COP contribute to greenwashing, while ignoring environmental racism and classism. At the same time, people who live in these corporate sacrifice zones sadly pay with their lives and livelihoods without ever experiencing the privilege to walk into this space and draw attention to the injustices committed against them. I come from the Navajo Nation, and I have been at Standing Rock, while we were attacked by dogs and attacked with pepper spray. And since we are here in Morocco and we are guests of the people here, we thought it would be appropriate if we draw attention to the corporate sponsors, OCP and Managem, who are also causing similar atrocities not far from where the COP is right now. Or for over here at Imider, where our brothers and sisters have been occupying a space 300 kilometers south of COP 22, because they are having their water drained in order to produce silver for an outside company, Managem. We would like everybody to please think of those people and think of their sovereignty and think of their rights, as they are sacrifice zones to corporate greed. Stay with us.
