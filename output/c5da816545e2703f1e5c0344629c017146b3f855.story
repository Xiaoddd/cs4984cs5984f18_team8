Her family, her fellow Indigenous rights activists at COPINH, and the international community is still watching and waiting for justice to be done. Facing mounting criticism and outrage, Honduran authorities were left with no choice but to act. But her family and her colleagues know that the trail does not end there. We at Oxfam continue to stand by them and demand that those behind her murder be found and brought to justice. Berta and her allies were taking on powerful, rich, and well-connected interests by opposing the Agua Zarca project. This kind of activism is dangerous and, as we saw with Berta, can be fatal. For women, the risks skyrocket. The rate of violence against women and girls in Honduras is intolerably high. Her murder remains unsolved. Berta was never deterred by the death threats she received. Likewise, her family refuses to live in fear and carries on her work to improve their country and the world. Inequality is inextricably linked with distribution of land and natural resources. Governments should take heed. In the United States, the Dakota Access Pipeline brought together thousands of activists who braved the freezing cold and stood in solidarity with Native American tribes opposing the project. Berta was murdered the day before her 45th birthday. She spent a great part of her life defending the rights of her people. Her cause is our cause. A year later, we honor her, and again demand justice for her, her family, and her people. This is the world we cover. Because of people like you, another world is possible.
