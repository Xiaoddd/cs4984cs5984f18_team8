The so-called experts were getting ready to shake their heads and sigh, to lament that once again a federal agency had failed to respond to a historic protest and had failed to protect the most vulnerable. And then the incredible happened. On Sunday afternoon, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers legally blocked the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, denying it a needed easement to drill beneath the Missouri River. It will specifically examine whether the pipeline should be moved or cancelled altogether. Energy Transfer Partners sought to avoid the acrimonious public battles that doomed the Keystone XL pipeline by running the Dakota Access pipeline entirely across private land. This freed the firm from seeking public permits in some states. The status of this treaty remains contested. Since the middle of the 20th century, the U.S. government has sought to allay broken treaties with all Native nations by compensating them for lost land. Since a 1980 Supreme Court decision, the U.S. government more or less officially considers the Sioux treaties to be settled. Energy Transfer Partners could correctly say they were building it on private land, not on the present-day Standing Rock Sioux reservation; but the Sioux could correctly refer to the contested ground as tribal or treaty land, referencing the 1851 agreement. Yet this is not even the principal legal dispute in the Standing Rock case. The first, the National Historic Preservation Act, allows the tribe to identify sacred land or cultural sites before the government allows construction that would destroy them. The second, the National Environmental Policy Act, forces the government to consider the environmental impact of any agency action. This became the salient question. The Standing Rock Sioux felt that they were essentially given no opportunity to consult as broadly and expansively as the law requires. In September, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg sided with the pipeline company on that argument. But the environmental-impact question proved thornier. The Army Corps of Engineers never conducted an environmental impact statement for the pipeline, instead approving it under a nationwide permit used only for short water crossings and wetlands preservation. It evidently agrees with the tribe. The Dakota Access pipeline will now be fully judged for its environmental impact. If this all seems complicated and mired in technocratic reasonableness, that's because it is. Yet the federal law is meant to ensure a kind of historical justice. The Standing Rock tribe succeeded because their argument was simple: As a sovereign nation, they had the right to control the integrity of their natural resources. The environmental-impact statement will take about two years to complete; no matter what it finds, it will almost certainly be followed by legal wrangling about what it requires. Because of an earlier Obama administration regulation, the Army Corps must also now consider how the pipeline will worsen climate change. The Trump administration could seek to abort the environmental-impact process, but it might require reaching far into the Department of Defense bureaucracy. The chief of the Army Corps of Engineers is not a political appointee. President-elect Trump supports the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline along the current route. According to multiple reports, he also owns stock in Energy Transfer Partners. He has said this does not affect his policy position. If the Trump administration were to reverse the decision, it might not even evade the same legal wrangling. The Army Corps of Engineers could be sued for arbitrarily reversing a previous agency decision. Energy Transfer Partners could possibly continue drilling under the river and open themselves up to hefty federal fines. In September, the company allegedly continued building the pipeline despite the fact that a federal court was considering an injunction. Even larger questions loom beyond a pipeline in North Dakota. As a rule, indigenous issues do not command mainstream progressive attention in the United States, as they do in Canada, New Zealand, and parts of Latin America. Historians say that the U.S. public has not been so involved in debates about Native rights since the 1960s and 1970s, when disputes over fishing rights in the Pacific Northwest opened a new front in the American civil-rights movement. She continued. There are tribes all over the country that fight off development projects that are harmful to them and their sacred land without this kind of national focus. The remarkable outcome of the Standing Rock protest may let us glimpse the coming years of the American environmental movement. A group of protesters upended their lives to defend the claim that the tribe should have a say over its natural resources. Against the odds and the expectations, the group swelled. It captured the sympathies of millions of people around the country and the globe. Eventually, it awoke the moral imagination of the federal regulatory state. The answer is indisputable. In great numbers, people put their bodies in the way to declare and defend their rights. In so doing, they revealed what legal rights are: not just idle promises, not just nice things to have, but the material guarantee of safe drinking water and community self-determination. In so doing, they forced a moral reckoning within the federal deep state, the multitude of administrators and civil servants who ensure the day-to-day functioning of the United States government.
