The blast of a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. natural gas pipeline sent a giant plume of fire into the air in a neighborhood in San Bruno, killing eight people and destroying 38 homes. On Monday, a federal charge officially halted construction around Lake Oahe, the site of a massive protest against the Dakota Access pipeline led by the Standing Rock Sioux, who have been joined by hundreds of other Native American tribes and indigenous groups. Elsewhere, however, expansion of U.S. fossil fuel infrastructure continues. In order to reduce its dependence on South American and Middle Eastern oil, the United States is turning to domestic energy sources that are especially toxic to the environment. A recent gas pipeline rupture in Alabama brought into sharp relief the threats the Dakota Access pipeline and many similar projects pose for crucial waterways and vulnerable ecosystems. In January, the North Dakota Public Service Commission, with approval from area tribes, granted permits to Sacagawea Pipeline Co. to build a crude oil pipeline that crosses Lake Sakakawea, an important reservoir in the state. The Sacagawea pipeline would transport 140,000 barrels of oil per day to a railway line owned by Phillips 66. In addition to pipelines, oil trains are also a major source of concern for environmental safety activists due to their potential for devastating and explosive derailments. On Sept. 6, the Lebanon Hills pipeline received final approval for construction to begin in Dakota County, Minnesota, south of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Bad news. The Sabal Trail Pipeline, a joint project of Spectra Energy Corp, NextEra Energy, Inc., and Duke Energy, is also sparking outcry from concerned residents and environmental justice activists. In October 2015, four congressmen from Georgia wrote a joint letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission expressing their concerns. By flooding markets with cheap oil and gas from sources like fracking, the United States has helped send global oil prices plummeting. A series of airstrikes killed at least 55 civilians and injured over 170 more at a busy fishermen market and hospital. Sign Up For The Best Of MintPress, Delivered To Your Daily Inbox.
