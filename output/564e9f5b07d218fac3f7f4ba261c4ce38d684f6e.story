Fonda was taking a new approach to protest the pipeline, fearing it will threaten air and water quality in many states and violate sacred Indian burial sites. For months, Native Americans have been very vocal about shutting the pipeline down. Fonda decided to hit her bank where she hopes it will hurt the most. The two companies that own it and run it, Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco. Her good friend, actress Lily Tomlin, did the same thing two weeks ago, and she's encouraging others to join them. Sixteen other financial institutions are also funding the project. A Wells Fargo spokesperson said the bank is committed to environmental sustainability and to human rights and it hopes all parties involved will work together to reach a peaceful resolution. Just a few weeks ago, the U.S. Army said no to giving the project a permit to bury the pipeline under the Missouri River, but things could change. President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration supports the pipeline.
