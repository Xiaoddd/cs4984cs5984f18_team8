The camp that drew tens of thousands of supporters from across the world, Oceti Sakowin, or the Seven Council Fires Camp, has been shut down. The sacred fire lit continuously since July has been extinguished, but a new fire has taken its place. The former camp is now known as All Nations Camp, according to attorney Chase Iron Eyes. Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II has asked everyone to leave, but more than a thousand remain, both at All Nations Camp and at the Sacred Stone Camp. Across Cannonball River at the Sacred Stone Camp, owner of the land LaDonna Tamakawastewin Allard said she plans to stay. She calls for help to survive the bitter Dakota winter ahead. Firewood is needed, as are plumbers, electricians, welders, and carpenters to make Sacred Stone Camp a more permanent community, she said. There is no one chief, Iron Eyes said, everyone is working during daylight hours to help each other survive the winter. Trump takes office in 41 days. Belle Fourche Pipeline Company manages the pipeline, and it has had a total of 14 leaks in their history in North Dakota. The cold weather has its drawbacks and benefits, he said. Ice slows mobility, but has also trapped much of the oil on top of the creek. While Standing Rock restructures, activists shut down a meeting held by Enbridge, Inc. at the Doubletree in Bemidji, Minnesota. Bemidji Police Department arrived and threatened nearly 150 people present to leave. She is also the executive director for Honor the Earth, a non-profit advocate for indigenous environmental support. Laduke asked questions directly to Enbridge personnel. She was ignored, and they walked out, she said. A lot of people wanted to know about North Dakota. She was met with silence. A police officer told her it was time to go. Friends grabbed her arms in support, making it clear they were not going anywhere, Laduke said. Activists yelled at police they should go apply to Morton County. Barrett planned to ask questions about abandoned pipelines, still leaking. The Enbridge pipeline, formerly known as the Sandpiper was routed to cut through Chippewa and Ojibwe treaty territory. Laduke said. We have to support our frontrunners. This is where we mobilize. This is where we continue the fight. News of an Enbridge meeting scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in Clearwater was announced to the activists present. A person at the end of the speech thanks the main speaker, naming him Matt. The Dakota Access Pipeline has been built on both sides of Lake Oahe up to the point where Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of the Dakota Access Pipeline, lacks approximately 1,100 feet from the federal government, and about 4,000 feet planned to go under the Missouri River at Lake Oahe. We always, always play by the rules. And he gets it. A 65-day drilling schedule remains to complete the 1,172-mile pipeline, depending on the weather. The pipeline plans to move up to 570,000 of sweet crude Bakken oil through a public utility. Much of the oil will be exported, according to analysts, and will not benefit American consumers. North Dakota politicians including Senator Heidi Heitkamp D-N.D., helped lead efforts to legalize increased exports of liquefied gas and crude oil in 2015. We feel like keeping our head down and doing what we do best, which is put this pipeline in the ground is the best thing we can do. Ramsey attacked live video feeds on social media websites such as Facebook as rumor mills. Earlier this week Governor Jack Dalrymple blamed Energy Transfer Partners for not standing up for themselves and defending their positions. Ramsey said. These are people who are pushing the all-fossil fuels in the ground at every angle. Notify me of new posts by email.
