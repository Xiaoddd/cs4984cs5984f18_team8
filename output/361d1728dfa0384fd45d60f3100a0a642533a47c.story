Prominent public health advocates have expressed outrage about these measures. Such censorship is a direct blow at the essence of science: accurately describing the physical world around us. Moreover, these measures will cause many more people to get sick and die. For instance, the homeopathy industry is a multibillion dollar business. While it has been debunked by hundreds of studies, people still want to believe in magical cures. Homeopathy is not harmless, yet despite the fact that it kills people every day, only recently has the federal government taken steps to address this problem. For another example, consider the false claim that vaccines cause autism. This belief is spread widely across the US, and leads to many people failing to vaccinate their children against diseases like measles. While measles was practically eliminated in the US by 2000, in recent years outbreaks of measles have been on the rise in the US, driven by parents failing to vaccinate their children in a number of communities. Simple: People will get sick and die. The diseases and deaths will come from among the most vulnerable. Hundreds of babies have already died due to taking homeopathic medications that were not vetted by the Food and Drug Administration. This year has seen the largest measles outbreak in the US, which mainly impacts children and babies. Many more children and babies will get sick and die as a direct result of the Trump administration's censorship of science. However, these deaths will not be visible, just like the hundreds of thousands of deaths from pollution every year in the US are not visible. Because it is very, very difficult to trace an individual's death to a specific polluter, the polluters get off scot-free with killing thousands of people every year. The Trump administration has already taken many steps that will result in thousands more people dying from pollution every year by rolling back government protections on pollution. Its steps in censoring the science on public health will result in many, many more children, babies and adults getting sick and dying. Yet because it will be incredibly difficult to trace a specific baby's death to the Trump administration's censorship, it will also get off scot-free. However, we can take steps to reverse this and other attacks on science that will cost many people their lives. --- Dr. Gleb Tsipursky is the author of The Truth-Seeker's Handbook: A Science-Based Guide.
