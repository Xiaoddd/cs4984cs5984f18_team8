The heightened awareness of the Dakota Access Pipeline draws attention to other pipeline projects throughout the United States. Across the country right now, over 20 proposed pipelines would run through indigenous land and endanger water sources, including wetlands and aquifers. Then, when spills happen, energy companies responsible for the pipelines may not take full responsibility for cause or cleanup. Here are six controversial pipeline projects to keep an eye on. Line 3 in Minnesota One of the largest inland oil spills in U.S. history happened along the Line 3 oil pipeline when it spilled 1.7 million gallons of crude oil near Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 1991 . Built between 1962 and 1967, this corroded pipeline is over five decades old and pumps 390,000 barrels of oil per day. Now, Canadian company Enbridge Energy plans to build a new pipeline to replace its old Line 3 oil pipeline, which would transport oil across northern Minnesota to Superior, Wisconsin, including through Ojibwe treaty territory. However, activists are organizing to persuade Minnesota officials to deny the permit for the pipeline and stop the project. The White Earth Nation, Red Lake Nation, Leech Lake Band, and Fond du Lac Ojibwe Band have been joined by activist groups to participate in public meetings about the pipeline. The company decided to reroute the pipeline around a wild rice lake used by tribes after the White Earth Nation voiced their concerns , but activists still say the pipeline poses a high risk for water pollution, as does the company's plan to leave the old, deteriorating pipeline in place even after the new one is constructed. More public hearings in front of an administrative law judge will take place in the fall , and the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission will make a final decision next April. If approved, the pipeline could operate by the end of 2019 and could carry up to 760,000 barrels of oil a day . Keystone XL in Nebraska, South Dakota, and Montana This project was previously blocked in 2015 by the Obama administration, but the Trump administration gave the green light to the Keystone XL by signing an executive order for its construction in January. Keystone XL still has a major obstacle though: Nebraska. The Keystone Pipeline runs from Canada to Texas, but Nebraska has yet to approve the proposed extension route of the Keystone XL, which would go through Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska. Protests, including a campaign to build solar panels in the pipeline's path, called Solar XL , have already emerged. This pipeline route would carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day. The State Department estimated that the project will lead to tens of thousands of temporary positions, but just 50 permanent jobs . Pilgrim Pipeline in New Jersey and New York The Ramapough Lenape Nation have been leading the fight against the Pilgrim Pipelines, a 178-mile pipeline that would run from Albany, New York, to Linden, New Jersey. Activists are concerned that the pipeline would contaminate drinking water, especially since the pipelines will be built along a fault line, which can increase risks for leaks. Last year, tribes started setting up teepees to protest the pipeline. So far, 28 towns have passed resolutions opposing the pipeline, and a Municipal Pipeline Group has formed to fight the pipeline and develop strategies, according to NorthJersey.com. Currently, the pipeline does not have a construction time frame because the company is working on finalizing the route and obtaining permits. This 713-mile pipeline is set to carry gas from West Virginia, western Pennsylvania, and eastern Ohio to Michigan, has already caused seven spills totaling over 50,000 barrels, including in wetlands. Right now, the pipeline is under fire with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. In April, the Ohio EPA found 2,500 square feet of wetlands filled with drilling fluid . Later that month, work crews found that fluid had settled on 500,000 acres of wetland . This fluid contains traces of toxic diesel fuel . A federal energy regulator has launched a public investigation on the pipeline, which may delay its planned completion on November 1. Part of the pipeline was supposed to open this month, but work has been stalled. Much of the construction takes place through farmland, causing residents to protest . On July 10, the Ohio EPA issued an order to Energy Partners to take numerous steps for protecting the environment. About 300 people showed up to their chapel dedication on July 9. Nuns from the Adorers of the Blood of Christ own a strip of land where the pipeline is supposed to run, and they say that the pipeline violates their values about the environment . This 183-mile pipeline would span across 10 counties in Pennsylvania. Forty organizations have urged the governor and the state Department of Environmental Protection to deny two environmental permits needed for the pipeline to be built. This 163-mile pipeline would carry up to 480,000 barrels of oil a day. Permits through the state Department of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are still pending .
