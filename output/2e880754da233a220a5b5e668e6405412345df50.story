Yessenia Funes Nov 28, 2016 12:43PM EST In a video by Fusion, actor Mark Ruffalo stands with other water protectors calling for the release of Red Fawn Fallis. Colorlines screenshot of Fusion video, taken on November 28, 2016. Police arrested her on October 27 (along with at least 140 others) during a raid on the short-lived 1851 Treaty Camp, or Sacred Ground Camp, in North Dakota. Shots were fired while she was pinned to the ground. However, water protectors say they can contest this allegation with video footage and eyewitness accounts. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier had previously said during a press conference that he could not confirm any demonstrator had fired a weapon. Today (November 28), Fallis was in court where documents on Twitter show that the state court has dismissed her case, placing her in federal custody. I see a prominent politician interviewing a former Marine and across the river from a rifle (you can hear the pop) she is dropped in pain by a rubber bullet. These are things that should not be happening to anyone here, anywhere. Now trumped up charges, with witnesses contradicting what a Sheriff has said. I have no doubt this woman should be free to go. is published by Race Forward, a national organization that advances racial justice through research, media and practice.
