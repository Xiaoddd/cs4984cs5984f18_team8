Over 1,000 people gathered in solidarity with the fighting spirit of Indigenous peoples, who continue to resist racist U.S. genocidal policies dating back to Christopher Columbus. That resistance lives on today, especially in Standing Rock, N.D., where hundreds of Native nations have united since last spring against the building of the multibillion-dollar Dakota Access Pipeline within a four-state radius. The DAPL threatens to poison the water supply of at least 18 million people and desecrate sacred burial lands. Another major focus for NDOM is the ongoing struggle to free beloved Native political prisoner Leonard Peltier, who sent a letter of solidarity to NDOM. The rally of all Indigenous speakers included UAINE co-chairs, Moonanum James (Aquinnah Wampanoag) and Mahtowin Munro (Lakota), Thalia Carroll Cachimuel (Kichwa), Juan Gonzalez (Maya), Bert Waters (Wampanoag), Deborah Spears Moorehead (Wampanoag) and the Nettukusqk Eastern Woodland Singers. Additional speakers were Billy Myers (Iahtehotas), Sister Bello (Mexicana), Tiokasin Ghosthorse (Cheyenne River Lakota Nation) and Elder Vanessa Meztli Inaru (Taino). Following the rally, a spirited march took place before everyone enjoyed a collective feast. free on the Web since 1994.
