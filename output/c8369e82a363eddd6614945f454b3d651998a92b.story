MIKE MCCLEARY, TRIBUNE Buy Now A portion of the Oceti Sakowin encampment is seen from this view looking east from Highway 1806 north of Cannonball on Thursday. The Dakota Access Pipeline protesters continue to build structures and fortify tents and teepees for the snow and extreme winter temperatures. MIKE MCCLEARY,TRIBUNE Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save After months of protests near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, the U.S. Army announced Sunday it would not approve an easement to allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross under the Lake Oahe section of the Missouri River. Among the considerations would be more information on the alternative routes, including the one crossing north of Bismarck, details on potential spills and impact on the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's water intake and the extent of the tribe's treaty rights in Lake Oahe. Darcy indicated the corps' prior reviews and actions had complied with legal requirements, but this case required more analysis. The corps' decision followed several months of protests by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, along with members of Native American tribes from across the country and supporters from the environmental movement. Since August, people have camped along the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and staged protests at pipeline construction sites and in the Bismarck-Mandan area. The company has said the pipeline is a safer and more efficient method of moving oil from the Bakken than trucks and trains used now. In a statement Sunday afternoon, Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II thanked the Obama administration and all of the groups that have supported the months-long protest. Archambault said he hoped Kelcy Warren, CEO of pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners, Gov. Jack Dalrymple and the incoming Trump administration would respect the corps' decision. Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer with Indigenous Environmental Network, could hardly contain his smile in a video posted to his Facebook page Sunday afternoon. Reaction from state politicians was swift and critical. The state politicians also quickly noted that the Trump administration could put any decision on the easement in question. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., and Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., criticized the decision and said it could jeopardize future infrastructure projects. Hoeven also renewed his call to the federal government to provide additional funding and law enforcement to back up local efforts. Morton County law enforcement took steps to de-escalate tensions Sunday afternoon by relocating farther away from protesters north of the Backwater Bridge, a move announced before the corps decision became public. The move requires protesters to follow certain conditions, including staying off the bridge. Forum News Service contributed to this report.
