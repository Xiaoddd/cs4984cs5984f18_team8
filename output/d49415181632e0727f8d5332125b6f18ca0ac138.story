At the hearing they will try to prove that Krow is on probation in Wisconsin, after which she can waive or continue to fight extradition. Though Krow has been released from jail since her arrest, this hearing will have a large impact on her future legal standing in North Dakota and potentially Wisconsin. Typically, those arrested in resistance movements receive a lot of support shortly after their arrest, but support tapers off after their case stops making headlines. This release was largely due to continued outside support, so thank you to everyone who helped make that happen. if you have questions about the hearing, how to support Krow, or other No DAPL prisoners.
