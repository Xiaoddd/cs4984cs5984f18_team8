He lied, again One oil spill from the Trans Mountain pipeline would destroy Squamish territory. Photograph: Alamy The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project is no ordinary pipeline. This project, which the government of Canada has just decided to nationalise, will travel more than 1,000km from northern Alberta through unspoiled wilderness to end at the port of Vancouver. The port is on the Salish Sea, part of the hereditary territory of the Squamish People. Majestic orcas swim in the waters and feed on the abundance. You may think all First Nations are against pipelines. Think again Read more You might remember Vancouver from the 2010 Winter Olympics: beautiful mountains, clear water and clean air. It defies common sense. Because there is an existing, much smaller pipeline there. The decision by the government of Canada to take over the Trans Mountain pipeline Expansion Project is yet another example of indigenous rights being ignored in Canada. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, promised to do things differently than his predecessors. He promised indigenous peoples that our rights would be respected, and he has broken that promise, yet again. He promised us he would put pipeline expansion through a brand-new review, and instead the government is spending billions of dollars to buy it and, if necessary, complete and operate it over our objections. Of the 117 indigenous groups who were a part of the consultation by the government, nearly two-thirds did not agree By the way, the original pipeline carried 150,000 barrels of oil per day, which was primarily for domestic use. Today it carries 300,000 barrels, achieved by adding more pumping stations and pushing through more oil. So when the megapipe, with an estimated daily load of 800,000 barrels, is built, that capacity is only the beginning: it could double in capacity, with very little anyone could do about it. That is the minimum number of oil tankers; it could be more. A single incident would render the beautiful beaches of the city, surrounding islands and Vancouver Island uninhabitable. It would kill the Salish Sea and destroy our Squamish territory. That is the reality no one wants to talk about. It will destroy the Salish sea. Alberta is already able to sell its oil through pipelines to the US. That oil is already being exported around the world, in ever-growing amounts, through US oil ports. We know that, if built, this is a 50- to 60-year risk. We know that financial constraints could make government or companies cut back on spill mitigation or prevention. In Canada we have seen cash-strapped governments close coast guard bases, lighthouses and weather stations, and allow search and rescue fleets and aircraft to age without being properly replaced. Governments cut back on oversight of all industries on a regular basis, only to express surprise when something goes wrong. And those are just the things we can control. Certainly, the Canadian government will never inspect them. If you know this port, it has a very narrow opening, aptly called First Narrows. Medium-sized cruise ships barely fit. The current is powerful and unpredictable. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Indigenous leaders demonstrate against the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project in Burnaby, British Columbia, in March. He has broken that promise. He promised us he would put the pipeline expansion through a brand-new review. He has broken that promise as well. And this same government promises it will have our best interests in mind if the pipeline proceeds. Out of the 117 indigenous groups who were a part of the consultation by the federal government, nearly two-thirds do not have any agreements with the company at all. Read more The Squamish Nation will continue to fight to protect our inlet, our communities and our economy. Regardless of who owns the project, our position has not changed. An expanded Trans Mountain pipeline would triple the capacity of diluted bitumen and is expected to increase the number of tankers from five to 35 each month. The tankers pass by three Squamish Nation communities on the Burrard Inlet. A single diluted bitumen marine spill would be catastrophic for our communities, our economy and our home as a Squamish people. We have a right to practice our culture, our way of life, and to continue our right to self-determination in our territories. This is a right that we have never surrendered, and it is a right we will continue to defend. Please choose your username under which you would like all your comments to show up.
