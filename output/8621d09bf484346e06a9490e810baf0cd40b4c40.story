Sophia is among the thousands of supporters who have been standing with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to protect their water from the Dakota Access pipeline. This was the latest assault in an escalated campaign of violence and intimidation by the police against those who have been asserting indigenous and human rights. These 300 injuries were the direct result of excessive force by police over the course of 10 hours. Additional Context from the Standing Rock Medic & Healer Council. Photos of Sophia: headshot, with West Roxbury pipeline co-defendants on June 29, 2016 (photo credit, Marla Marcum). Sophia appears third from left in this photo. In a historic moment of nonviolent resistance, thousands of people calling themselves protectors, not protestors, have gathered in North Dakota, to demand President Obama reject this dirty and dangerous proposal. This pipeline is a threat to Native heritage, their homes, and will be a climate disaster. They predictably end in people being hurt. This is not accidental. It is a deliberate policy of police chiefs at the national level to discourage protests. No matter what the organizers claim in the requests for people to join the demonstration, it will always include a few people who will throw things at the police to justify a police charge against the protesters. It makes no difference if these people are undercover agents or not; the end result will be the same. Protests should be a thing of the past. They have been de facto criminalized and anyone attending a so-called peaceful, non-violent protest is an fool. The establishment never changes a policy as a response to a protest. They see it as a police problem to be solved by hiring more police, giving them more power, and handing down harsher punishments. . FORGET PROTESTS and start thinking of other things to do.
