In a spirit of shared struggle against privatisation (in its many forms), this Thinkery will explore differences in approach and attitude in anti-privatisation struggles mobilized around water in Ireland, Italy, Spain and Standing Rock in the USA. For many, the privatisation of water is a contemporary enclosure of the commons, a continuation of a process of converting everything into property that began centuries ago with land enclosures. For some, to regard water as a commons is to see it as a publicly owned and managed resource, whereas for others it is a new way of living and governing, a way of people relating to each other and the natural world. Some talk of a commons of humankind, whereas for others commons are part and parcel of local territorial communities. Rather than flattening these and other differences, they will be the central focus of the Thinkery which aims to promote real and convivial dialogue and learning between people committed to anti-privatisation struggles, but with fundamentally different worldviews. before 16 June 2017.
