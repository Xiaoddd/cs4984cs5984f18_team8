The DAPL has backed down from their initial plan and Uncle Joe is at last See More 140 Characters Left Auto-shorten any URLs CANCEL UPDATE STATUS THE STORY: Meet Our Uncle Joe. My twin brother Ben and I have been blessed with his love and presence in our lives since we were two-years-old. Uncle Joe and his tiyospaye are in Standing Rock, ND with thousands of Indigenous People and others from around the world. Your donations will help pay for firewood, stove and heater parts, fresh produce, gas, mechanical repairs and the many other hidden costs of day to day life, especially as they prepare for the very cold North Dakota winter. No donation is too small, and all are accepted with much love & gratitude. We are grateful for your bravery. Thanks Hannah and Ben for organizing this.
