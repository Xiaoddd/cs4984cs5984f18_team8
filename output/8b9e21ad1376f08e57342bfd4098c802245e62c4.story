Activists also believe that its development may potentially contaminate the Missouri river and uproot sacred burial ground. Throughout the summer and fall, thousands of people from across the nation and around the world flocked to North Dakota to stand in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. This list includes well-known actors and actresses, such as Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, and Shailene Woodley. Until early December, tensions at the protest camps and nearby on the front lines only continued to increase. Mass arrests occurred, and many protestors were maced, hosed down with water canons in sub-freezing temperatures, and tased. Some were even shot with rubber bullets. A dramatic change took place over the first weekend in December of 2016, when over 2,000 veterans arrived at the Standing Rock protest camps. On December 4th, the U.S. Army Corps denied an easement to the parent company of the DAPL, Energy Transfer Partners. The victory was celebrated by activists present and elsewhere. However, a statement by the company soon made it clear that the oil company had no intention of re-routing the pipeline. Since the easement was denied, the world has heard little of the protestors or the DAPL. Once again, that changed just days after Donald Trump became the new President of the United States. The business tycoon-turned-politician signed an executive order that will allow the corporation to finish drilling across the Missouri river. The lack of regard for the environment or the indigenous people has once again inspired veterans to return to North Dakota. Reportedly, dozens if not hundreds of brave men and women are making plans to venture to the Sacred Stone camp to serve as human shields for those who are striving to preserve the Missouri River and its resources for future generations. Reportedly, they are hopeful that their presence makes it harder for police and government officials to try and remove hundreds of protesters who remain camped near the construction site.

This is because many regret their involvement in the Iraq war. In December, the arrival of the veterans proved to be a game-changer.
