If you are resident in NORTH DAKOTA, I suggest taking the time to call in your state representatives over this bill. Your senators: The Congressional switchboard number is: 202-224-3121 Press 1 for senators; you'll need to make two calls to contact both of them. A bill that state GOP Rep. Keith Kempenich introduced would exempt drivers from liability if they accidentally hit a pedestrian, according to the Bismarck Tribune. House Bill 1203 was written up in direct response to groups of protesters blocking roadways, Kempenich told the paper. He claims protesters were seen jumping out in front of vehicles. Jesus. A jury would acquit someone who could make a plausible case for honestly not intending to harm someone. This law would mean they wouldn't even have to have an excuse. Open season on protesters. And, more generally, fuck you for providing covering fire for the plutonomy's side in this discussion. There are two sides to this. And if you're still intentionally blinding yourself to this, you are part of the problem. Your stupid factional games where you pick a side and say everyone else is evil is why our government is in the most broken state it's ever been. You refuse to recognize the validity of any perspective except your own, neither do members of Congress, and now we have Donald-effing-Trump running the country in two days. Thank you for that. You, sir, are an antidisestablishmentarian, and absent some actual evidence-based argument to support your position, I have no use for you. Jan 18, 2017 Jake Weisz Demonstrated point: You're missing the injustice that you disagree with. Innocent uninvolved people protestors have drawn into this by running out in front of their cars. Who, at best, are horribly inconvenienced by these idiots, or at worst, may be traumatized for life when they accidentally hit and kill an idiot standing in the highway. You only see the injustices you want to. What is happening is that they are already on the road, in areas that are already cut off from normal public access due to the stand off. I think this has passed the point of useful conversation though, since you're willfully ignoring the political climate in ND right now. Jan 18, 2017 Commenting is disabled for this post. I hope they get their case heard. That is some true bullshit. I was referring to protesters' against the election results'. This is simply sane. They always have had. The incident was investigated and declared an accident and my friend wasn't charged. Highways do not allow pedestrian travel for a reason. It is dangerous and stupid to walk on a highway. It is more dangerous and more stupid to try and block a car with a human body on a highway. They can not stop for cars. People who know what they're talking about do not talk about trains colliding with cars, because the train did not cause the accident. A car impeded the path of an oncoming train. If you can find a case to definitively prove a vehicle on a highway intended specifically to hit a protestor, go for it. I don't know how fast it was traveling, but it doesn't have to be all that fast to do damage. I assume your friend can attest to this. Even when there's nothing you can do, you may never feel like you know for sure. They said not to block traffic, it's dangerous to be on a highway. People decided they didn't care, that the police just didn't want them protesting. Protesters don't wander out into fast-moving traffic. The specific protesters being targeted here are blocking slow-moving construction vehicles. A jury would acquit someone who could make a plausible case for honestly not intending to harm someone. This law would mean they wouldn't even have to have an excuse.
