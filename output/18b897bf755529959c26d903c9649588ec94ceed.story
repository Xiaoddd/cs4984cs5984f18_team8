The ad attacks JB Pritzker for having a partner interest in the pipeline, which faced opposition from encampments at Standing Rock and national solidarity protests. Additionally, a divestment campaign asked investors to pull out of the project. His endorsement by trade unions that build oil pipelines also makes him suspect to environmental voters. A Kennedy campaign spokesperson told me, and Kennedy repeated during a debate on WTTW, that his investments in other fossil fuel companies were part of a mutual fund he already divested from. The trouble for Daniel Biss is that he was in a position of power to help stop the Illinois portion of Dakota Access and did nothing. There were bills in the Iowa legislature to stop the pipeline and protect the rights of property owners along its path. Not in Illinois. I found no record of Biss speaking out or introducing legislation until long after the Illinois portion was completed. The only action taken by the legislature was a non-binding resolution introduced after Standing Rock became a national news story and the Illinois portion was finished. The pipeline builders, Energy Transfer Partners, did their best to avoid attention before the Illinois portion was built. Green groups with statehouse lobbyists chose to focus on other issues. Illinois continues to have an environmental justice problem with big green groups overlooking what happens in rural downstate. But, if Biss had been listening to the grassroots movement, he would have known to take action. Pritzker funded green tech research and renewable energy. Kennedy made Merchandise Mart a green building, and served on climate change commissions for Chicago and Cook county. He campaigns as a champion for the middle class, despite a poor labor record. Attacking middle class pensions was a major focus of his career. Running an ad about a pipeline he did nothing to stop is shameless. Give Will Reynolds a round of applause. From a quick cheer to a standing ovation, clap to show how much you enjoyed this story. 4 BlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Will Reynolds Illinois-based writer on the environment and politics. 4 Never miss a story from Will Reynolds, when you sign up for Medium. a divestment campaign asked investors to pull out of the project. trouble for Daniel Biss is that he was in a position of power to help stop the Illinois portion of Dakota Access and did nothing.
