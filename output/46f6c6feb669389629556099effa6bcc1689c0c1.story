That will effectively force a reroute of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a project that hundreds of protesters have been demonstrating against for months. Numerous Hawaii activists have been involved in the protests, braving cold, snow and ice to help force attention on the concerns of the Sioux that the pipeline poses a threat to drinking water supplies, among other issues.

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation is about a half-mile south of the planned pipeline crossing, also issued a statement expressing gratitude to the Obama administration for its decision.

The pipeline is 30 inches in diameter and is projected to transport approximately 470,000 barrels of oil per day, with a capacity as high as 570,000 barrels. The decision came as U.S. Rep Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii joined the protesters. She traveled to Standing Rock as part of a movement of veterans who had vowed to protect demonstrators from efforts to evict them as soon as Monday. Just two hours before the Army issued its statement, Gabbard stood on the wind-swept winter prairie, surrounded by dozens of U.S. veterans, some of them dressed in full fatigues. She talked about why it was important to fight alongside the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to block the construction of the pipeline.
