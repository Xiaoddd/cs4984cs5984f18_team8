However, Native Americans are receiving the longest prison sentences. Three of the protestors with the lengthiest prison sentences have accepted plea deals due to the likelihood of unfair trials. Its been over two years since the protests and the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline just half a mile from Sioux tribal land, but federal judges are just now handing down charges. The incident occurred in October of 2016 when Fallis was protesting the building of the pipeline and law enforcement officers tackled her. As she fell to the ground and struggled as officers attempted to handcuff her, three gunshots allegedly went off and no one was injured. Officers removed a gun from her hand and arrested her. In the end, she took a plea deal due to the fear that she would not receive a fair trial and she now faces over four years in federal prison. On Oct. 27, 2016 protestors had set up barricades made out of logs, tires, trucks and pallets. As the police approached, they set the barricades on fire. Giron was accused of being one of the protesters who started the fires. Giron also took a plea deal in which he had to state that he aided in civil disorder in exchange for only three years in prison instead of 10-15. He is scheduled for sentencing on Aug. 6. Out of 835 protestors who faced cases brought against them, 670 of them have moved forward with charges. However, most have not faced lengthy prison sentences. Brandy Toelupe is the president of the Water Protector Legal Collective, which is a National Lawyers Guild group that has been working with pipeline protestors who are facing charges. The thousands of Standing Rock protestors were not just Native Americans fighting for their land. At All.
