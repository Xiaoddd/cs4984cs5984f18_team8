Arable lands were hoarded by pineapple companies, hunting grounds were restricted by corporate landowners, and Native Hawaiians were marginalized by an imposing American system. As a young man Ritte successfully fought for Native Hawaiian access rights on Molokai. During this time, Ritte and his comrades encountered a world of hidden cultural knowledge held by a handful of kupuna (elders). This awakening has fueled Ritte's efforts through today. Walter and his family living off the land in remote Pelekunu Valley. Now in his 70s, Ritte is an icon among Hawaiian activists and is known far beyond the islands for his fiery persona and controversial stands. Ritte's activism has not been one solely of opposition. He is credited for playing major roles in the movement to rebuild ancient Hawaiian fishponds and to resurrect Hawaiian Makahiki traditions. The proposed 1-hour documentary will be an intimate portrait of his turbulent early years and his birth as an activist. By exploring deeply personal reflections and the recollections of his closest supporters and detractors, this film will give rare insight into the private life of an often contentious public figure. We are committed to working with and training Native Hawaiian filmmakers in the telling of this story. We currently have three additional Hawaiian crew members from the island of Molokai committed to the project. Post-production will likely take us through the Summer of 2018. We hope to have the world premiere late 2018 with PBS broadcast in 2019. Specifically, your donations will be used to shoot additional key interviews; dig deep into public and private archives for photos and videos that will help bring the story to life; and to develop a strong sample video that will be used to win funding from highly competitive documentary funding sources. This early phase of production is critical to the success of the film. Thanks to our fiscal sponsor, Molokai Arts Center, donations are tax-deductible. It will not be easy subject matter to represent. We are committed, however, to telling this story with as much objectivity and perspective as possible. We have a diverse team of seasoned filmmakers on-board to help maintain the integrity of the project. The timing to complete a film is always a challenge and is often dependent on a range of factors. Securing necessary funding to keep the project moving through each phase has the biggest influence on completion timing. Normally, funding is secured in steps and in portions from various funding sources. We have a seasoned team of producers behind this project that have developed a comprehensive funding strategy. We have already received R&D support form Pacific Islanders in Communications, a minority consortia member of CPB, and have multiple proposals out for additional PBS and private funding. While the timeline for completion could shift, we are confident that the project will be completed. The track record of our filmmaker team proves that we have the capability and experience to see this project through.
