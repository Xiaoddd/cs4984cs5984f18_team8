American president Barack Obama, meanwhile, hopes to stifle his own critics who insinuate that he is anti-Israel. In reality, however, the Obama administration has quietly punished Mr Netanyahu for his misbehaviour. Notably, Israel has been forced to promise not to approach Congress for extra funds. Israel will soon have to buy all its armaments from the US, ending what amounted to a subsidy to its own arms industry. But the US expects a return on its massive investment. A nuclear-armed Iraq or Syria would have deterred later US-backed moves at regime overthrow, as well as countering the strategic advantage Israel derives from its own nuclear arsenal. Public funds are siphoned off to let Israel buy goodies from American arms makers. That, in turn, serves as a shop window for other customers and spurs an endless and lucrative game of catch-up in the rest of the Middle East. It stood up to Mr Netanyahu over the Iran deal but will not risk a damaging clash over Palestinian statehood. Some believe that Mr Obama signed the aid package to win the credibility necessary to overcome his domestic Israel lobby and pull a rabbit from the hat: an initiative, unveiled shortly before he leaves office, that corners Mr Netanyahu into making peace. Hopes have been raised by an expected meeting at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday. But their first talks in 10 months are planned only to demonstrate unity to confound critics of the aid deal. If Mr Obama really wanted to pressure Mr Netanyahu, he would have used the aid agreement as leverage. Now Mr Netanyahu need not fear US financial retaliation, even as he intensifies effective annexation of the West Bank. They win every time at the expense of peace, equity and justice - imperial wars, corporate favoritism and police state viciousness assuring it. Oil pipelines notoriously leak, polluting the landscape and drinking water, harming public health and well-being. Just societies would prohibit them, renouncing fossil fuels and hugely dangerous nuclear power altogether, substituting clean, green, renewable energy. Challenging the power of politically connected Big Money assures a hugely unfair fight. On Sunday, militarized police attacked peaceful DAPL protesters violently, using water cannons in sub-freezing weather, tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber-coated steel bullets, mace, and sonic weapons blasting deafening sounds - vicious tactics like Israel uses against Palestinians. Confrontation lasted around six hours. 3 of those people are elders. 7 people have been hospitalized for severe head injuries. Other reported injuries so far include lung and eye irritations, at least two cases cardiac arrest, multiple cases of hypothermia, a young teenager shot in the face by rubber bullets, and a woman struck with a concussion grenade or other projectile. Rubber bullets. Mace. Flash grenades. In my family we never celebrated Thanksgiving. It was always a day of mourning for the day that genocide began on this continent. )from Kevin Gilbertt asked readers for donations to build winterized structures in a part of America experiencing severe winter cold.
