October 25, 2016. Originally published at MintPress News. Armored riot police attacked a march on Saturday with tear gas and arrested 83 people on charges ranging from assault on a peace officer to rioting and criminal trespass. Police also shot down two camera drones operated by Native American journalists. Activists report that harassment, strip searches and beatings at the hands of North Dakota police are becoming commonplace, but the assembled tribes remain determined to block the pipeline, which they say threatens both sacred lands and the water supply for millions of people. Broze will be reporting from the Standing Rock Reservation for MintPress News and on his personal Facebook pagethroughout the week. With construction nearing completion in North Dakota, the water protectors expanded to two new campsites on Sunday in order to more directly confront pipeline builders, police, and private security personnel. It is close to the site where private security employed by the pipeline company attacked activists with dogs and pepper spray on Labor Day. The Standing Rock Sioux claim the site is unceded tribal property, and they say they are reclaiming it for the tribe by eminent domain. In a statement issued on Sunday, tribal leaders said: This morning, at approximately 8am central, water protectors took back unceded territory affirmed in the 1851 Treaty of Ft. Laramie as sovereign land under the control of the Oceti Sakowin, erecting a frontline camp of several structures and tipis on Dakota Access property, just east of ND state highway 1806. This new established camp is 2.5 miles north of the Cannon Ball River, directly on the proposed path of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). This site is directly across the road from where DAPL security dogs attacked water protectors on September 3rd. The other new camp borders North Dakota Highway 1806, a key point of entry for both Standing Rock Sioux territory and nearby pipeline construction sites. Using vehicles, large objects, and their own bodies, the water protectors at this new camp temporarily shut down the highway on Sunday and blocked it again on Monday afternoon. The gathering of Native Americans representing almost 375 tribal nations and other non-Native American groups is unprecedented in modern history. Also, as a barrier of protection for our people. Siouxz and other sources have reported that surveillance planes frequently circle the encampment, day and night. Saying the camp and water protectors need more support, Siouxz urged more activists to travel to the reservation and to bring lumber and tools for building temporary shelters that will be able to withstand winter weather conditions.
