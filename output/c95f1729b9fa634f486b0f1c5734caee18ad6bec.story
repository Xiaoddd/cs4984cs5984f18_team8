Subscribe to our email newsletter The decision from the partners comes after receiving sufficient commitments to move ahead with their plans to lay out the 30inch diameter pipeline, which will transport crude oil sourced from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast region. The pipe diameter of the Permian Gulf Coast pipeline could be increased to enable capacity expansion depending on further shipper volume commitments received during the open season to be launched this week. The new crude oil pipeline system, which will have multiple Texas origins, including Wink, Midland and Crane, is anticipated to enter into service in mid-2020. The Permian Gulf Coast pipeline will be based on receipt of customary regulatory and board approvals of the respective companies.
