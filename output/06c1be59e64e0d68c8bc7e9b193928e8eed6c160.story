(Photo by The Baltimore Sun) New protests have erupted against the construction of a controversial oil pipeline in the US state of North Dakota, which has angered Native Americans and environmentalists. Protesters in Morton County, North Dakota, and Annapolis Harbor, Maryland, held fresh demonstrations Saturday, one day after 40 people were arrested at the construction site. About 500 demonstrators briefly blocked two entrances to a pipeline work yard in Morton County, forcing workers to leave the area. Keller said one protester was injured, but no one was arrested. More than 300 Maryland protesters also marched alongside Native American residents Saturday to show their support for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North Dakota. The protests against the pipeline construction have spread to other cities across the United States, with other tribes, environmentalists and advocates for Native Americans joining the movement. The federal government has twice requested the pipeline operator to voluntarily stop construction near the tribe's reservation while the project's route is being reconsidered by the authorities, however, courts have refused to order a halt.
