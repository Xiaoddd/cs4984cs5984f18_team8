Oglala Sioux Tribal President Scott Weston. Sen. Troy Heinert (D-Mission) plans to introduce a resolution against construction of the pipeline, according to Scott Weston, the Oglala Lakota president. Weston says a rally is planned for on the steps of the Capitol to back the resolution. Weston says he is unsatisfied with progress on talks with the Army Corps of Engineers and hinted that he could use the tribe's water pipeline -- with its intake valve at Ft. Pierre -- to apply some leverage to gain support in the state. Tribal leaders plan to be in Pierre next Thursday to rally support for the anti-Dakota Access Pipeline resolution.
