Sean Trembath, Saskatoon StarPhoenix Updated: September 16, 2015 Motivational speaker Alvin Law talks with students at Thomas B. Riley School in Calgary. Share Adjust Comment Print Alvin Law believes in the power of positive attitude. He has built a career out of telling people to live the best life they can with the cards they have been dealt, just as he does. Despite growing up in an era where there was much less awareness and infrastructure for people with disabilities, Law thrived in all aspects of life. Now in his life as a motivational speaker, he has brought his story to people on five continents. In Saskatchewan, he enjoys a near-celebrity status thanks to 21 appearances on Telemiracle. You might remember him playing the drums with his feet. During her pregnancy, his mother was given thalidomide, a drug used to ease nausea and other symptoms for expectant mothers. At the time, no one knew the consequences. Law and thousands more children worldwide were born deformed or with limbs missing. Law was given up for adoption at just five days old. They were very poor and had two other children to take care of. Also, had they not done so, he never would have fallen into the care of the Laws, a Yorkton couple who raised him to embrace the things he was capable of. From an early age, his adoptive parents forced him to learn self-sufficiency. They taught him to do almost anything with his feet. They also made sure he was a part of the community, making friends with other kids. The family lived across the street from a school in Yorkton, so it seemed natural he would go there. They were adamant he go to school with the rest of his friends, and be afforded the same opportunities. He did well in school. Even then, he chalks the teasing up to standard adolescent stuff. It passed quickly once he gained more confidence and showed what he could do. Law credits his father with teaching him that anger was never the right path. It was during his high school years that Law first came into the public spotlight. He was attending Camp Easter Seals, which caters to children with disabilities. A CBC television crew came out to do a news story and got footage of Law shooting a bow and arrow with his feet. As fate would have it, 1977 was the first year for Telemiracle. His work as a Timmy made him a natural choice for the program. People all over the province saw him play the drums alongside Brian Sklar and Prairie Fire. For a time, he thought he would become a musician. He was able to play trombone with the help of a special stand that attached to a desk, and was even selected as first chair for the all-star band at a national high school competition. There was interest from some American universities, and talk of scholarships. A conversation with Sherwin got him thinking in a different direction. He attended Mount Royal in Calgary, then moved to Regina and worked as a radio DJ, flipping vinyl records. He liked the job, but would soon switch careers and head down the path to the career he still has today. Law started working with the Saskatchewan Abilities Council in 1981. The UN had declared it the International Year of Disabled Persons, and Law was hired to speak at schools. As a former resident, Law was a natural choice for the program. His name started spreading. Finally, in 1988, Law decided to become a full-time professional speaker. He was successful enough to get by, but had some trouble with the business side of things. In an era before the Internet, he found it hard to co-ordinate everything while being on the road so much. A turning point came in 1991 when he met Darlene, who is now his wife. She had seen him speak at a conference in Alberta and was introduced when they were hanging out with mutual friends afterward. Thing moved quickly. They met in March, went on their first date in June and moved in together in October. They were married in 1993. Darlene, who describes herself as very organized, saw immediately that she could help Law with the business side of his career. She took over the management side and they have never looked back. Law went from speaking almost exclusively for students to teachers associations, then other associations, then corporations and conferences. They moved to Calgary in 2000 and Law joined the Canadian Association of Professional Speakers. Meanwhile he was working on writing his life story, an 11-year process he says was the hardest thing he has ever done. Here too, Darlene was instrumental. He gave her his first manuscript, which weighed in at 900 pages. Darlene encouraged him to find the same voice he uses on stage. Law says he has done more than 5,000 speaking engagements. He does around 120 a year and spends about 170 days a year travelling. Law tries to make his presentations less about his disability and more about positivity. He is sometimes self-conscious about the show-offiness of playing drums or the piano with his feet, but understands the value it provides for his message. He has no intention of slowing down. Travelling and speaking are what he loves to do. Although much of his program stays the same, there is polish and evolution that comes from his life experience. As long as he is able, Law hopes to use his personal story of perseverance to help others make the best of their own lives. A wine for the family dinner table Election most important for Sask.
