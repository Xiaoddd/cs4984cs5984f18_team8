The citizens group was using a drone to monitor pipeline construction sites for possible environmental issues.

As the drone hovered about 300 feet above the work site, Shelton watched the screen of a hand-held remote control that displayed what was being captured by a camera aboard the tiny helicopter. He and Hodges decided to file the information in a computer database, in case a more clear-cut violation of environmental rules shows up later. If that happens, a report will be sent to state regulators, courtesy of Mountain Valley Watch. More than 300 miles long and 42 inches in diameter, the buried steel pipe will cross mountainsides, rivers and streams as it follows a temporary construction right-of-way as wide as 10 interstate highway lanes. Spotting potential problems Since Mountain Valley Watch was formed in March, more than 65 volunteers have joined the group. At training sessions in Blacksburg, Newport and Bent Mountain, instructors schooled the volunteers on the proper techniques of controlling erosion and sediment at pipeline construction sites and how to spot potential flaws. What they have found so far is not pretty, he said. State regulators confirm that in some areas, muddy and sediment-laden water has been allowed to flow past silt fences and other barriers meant to stop runoff. Mountain Valley Watch has submitted about 25 reports of possible violations of erosion and sediment control regulations to DEQ. Mountain Valley spokeswoman Natalie Cox said the pipeline, a joint venture of six energy companies, is working closely with state and federal regulators. Before each drone flight, Shelton obtains permission from landowners. He also steers clear of any active construction zones. In February, when DEQ said it would be conducting the most vigilant compliance program for any pipeline in Virginia history, the agency said it would be hiring extra inspectors from a private company to assist its staffers. Yet it was not until last week that officials with MBP, a Fairfax-based consulting firm, joined DEQ inspectors in the field. Construction of the 303-mile pipeline from northern West Virginia to Pittsylvania County will proceed simultaneously along nine segments, or spreads, each one about 33 miles long. The plan is to have two representatives from MBP assigned to each spread in Virginia. The contractors will be augmented by DEQ employees, including two new compliance managers and a data coordinator, Regn said. Only Franklin County has agreed to do so. In a notice of violation issued April 25, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection said it found sediment-laden water that had flowed beyond the perimeters of a work site in Wetzel County, where the pipeline will originate. Out-of-control runoff from a hill on a second site caused part of the slope to give way, according to documents filed with FERC. The company has made similar statements about flooding May 18 in Franklin County, where severe erosion during heavy rains left about 8 inches of mud covering Cahas Mountain Road. The lead contractor hired by Mountain Valley for much of the work in Virginia is Precision Pipeline, a Wisconsin company that has been involved in at least three other pipeline projects that have been cited for failing to prevent muddy water and sediment dislodged by bulldozers and other earth-moving equipment from contaminating nearby streams. Although regulators in Pennsylvania and West Virginia cited the pipeline developers and not their contractor, Precision Pipeline was linked to the projects through inspection reports, notices of violations, lawsuits and other public records. The company is also named in the most recent inspection reports from West Virginia. Asked last week if Mountain Valley remains satisfied with the work of Precision Pipeline, Cox said it does. Legal challenges continue Keeping close tabs on construction is just one of several fronts on which pipeline opponents are waging their battle against Mountain Valley. About a half-dozen legal challenges of the project are also pending in three courts. Decisions in those cases are expected in the coming weeks. At the same time, the 4th Circuit is considering a motion to stay a key permit for the pipeline that was issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Sierra Club and four other conservation groups contend that the Corps approved four pipeline river crossings in West Virginia knowing that Mountain Valley could not complete them within the 72 hours required by state regulators. Shortly after the challenge was filed May 22, the Corps temporarily suspended work on the four river crossings. Even before the court filing, construction was not expected to start until late summer. If the appeals court were to invalidate the permits for work on the Elk, Gauley, Greenbrier and Meadow rivers, that could lead to a delay of the whole project. Yet construction continues at a pace that Mountain Valley says will have the pipeline in operation by late this year. Opponents say the greatest environmental risks will come this summer, when construction crews begin to blast through bedrock and dig trenches as deep as 10 feet along steep mountain slopes. Muddy water running off construction sites and into private wells and public water supplies is just one concern, they say. For now, the most obvious changes are the 125-foot swaths where Mountain Valley has cut trees and cleared land to make room for construction. After the pipe is in the ground, the company will maintain 50-foot rights of way to operate the project, which will transport natural gas at high pressure to markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions. One of the bare strips runs up the side of Sinking Creek Mountain, not far from where members of Mountain Valley Watch were conducting their surveillance last month in a scenic valley below. In between drone flights, Shingles remarked to fellow member Mannin Dodd on the beauty of their surroundings.
