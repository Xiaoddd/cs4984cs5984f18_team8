You must love science... And so do we. We don't like spam either. In anticipation of the merger, Tesla and SolarCity were already working together on several projects. We rely on that boat for everything, including importing diesel for the generators for all of our electricity. Once diesel gets low, we try to save it by using it only for mornings and afternoons.

Living on an island, you experience global warming firsthand. Beach erosions and other noticeable changes are a part of life here.
