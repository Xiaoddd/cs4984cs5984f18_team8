It turned out that this afternoon gig, along with an evening concert with full-grown punks in the audience, would be the Pistols' final UK appearance. In a few weeks the band would fly to America for a set of ill-fated gigs and then break up. Soon after that Sid Vicious would be dead. And his memory of the day is nothing but sweet. Fantastic. The ultimate reward. One of my all-time favourite gigs. 'Bodies' was from two different points of view. Everything else seems halfway into the Victorian period, whereas the Pistols seem very modern and aware of what's going to happen. Hopefully, there's resonance in the fuel bills and firemen's strikes of today. Even though it's a different planet, people face the same problems.
