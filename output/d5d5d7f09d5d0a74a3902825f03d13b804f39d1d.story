Thousands of Native American Indians, along with supporters, have been camping out there. They have been protesting the installation of an oil pipeline that gravely threatens the water that Native people and thousands of others in the area depend on, and violates Indian treaty rights. Hundreds have been arrested and hundreds more have stood up to beatings, macings, high-powered water hoses in sub-freezing weather, and unending harassment and insult. Now the Army of Corps of Engineers has vowed to arrest anyone who remains in the camp past Monday, December 5. The Native people cannot be left to face this alone. The environment cannot withstand yet another insult. Authored by Bob Avakian, and adopted by the Central Committee of the RCP Revolution Clubs should immediately choose representatives and organize solidarity delegations to go to Standing Rock. Once there, Club members should act as a unified force, standing with the people to prevent this towering injustice from going down. Clubs and Party supporters should step up in every city to work with and participate in solidarity demonstrations, especially but not only on the 5th and the days leading up to it. These must extend to religious communities, the campuses, and in the neighborhoods. Battles like the one in Standing Rock can be and must increasingly be built as part of strengthening the movement to make that revolution. And in the shadow of the looming fascism of Trump, the struggle for the basic justice of the demands of the water protectors in Standing Rock takes on even greater significance. The whole world will be watching to see what the people of this country are going to do. What happens in Standing Rock will set terms one way or the other going into perilous times. Be part of making sure they are the right terms. and Revolution Send us your comments. If you like this article, subscribe, donate to and sustain Revolution newspaper.
