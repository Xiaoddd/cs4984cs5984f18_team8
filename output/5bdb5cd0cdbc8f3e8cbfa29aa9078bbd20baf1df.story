Share story By Lynda V. Mapes Seattle Times environment reporter Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II has reiterated a plea to stand down at Standing Rock in the wake of 76 arrests of demonstrators Wednesday. The demonstrators had set up a new camp on private land, which police shut down the same day. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum also traveled to the reservation town of Cannon Ball on Wednesday night to meet with residents and tribal members to hear their concerns. Archambault urged those who remain at the main camp on Corps of Engineers land near the river to work together to clean and restore the land before floodwaters come. Work has been under way for days to pick up trash, old tents and more left behind from thousands of people who camped by the river during demonstrations that heated up beginning last August, and continued through winter. Several hundred people still remain in the main camp. The tribe is urging opponents to focus resistance to the oil pipeline project on the courts, where the tribe has vowed to sue to block any effort by the developer, Energy Transfer Partners, of Dallas, to continue construction while an environmental review of the project is under way. The tribe is also continuing its work in Washington, D.C., where a Native Nations March on Washington, Rise with Standing Rock, is planned for March 10. But the tribe wants no more standoffs with police. Meanwhile, the Seattle City Council will hear a bill Monday beginning at 2 p.m. to divest city funds from Wells Fargo Bank, a major lender to the pipeline project. The bill was passed by a council committee on a unanimous vote Wednesday. View Comments No personal attacks or insults, no hate speech, no profanity.
