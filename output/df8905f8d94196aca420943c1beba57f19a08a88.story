All remaining funds raised from this campaign will be left at Standing Rock to continue supporting the cause. Several veterans and good samaritans donated some heavy duty duffels full of winter sleeping bags, blankets, thermoses, and thermal wear. Thank you all who have contributed to this vital cause and please keep sharing this campaign so we can also replenish the Standing Rock medical supplies. As they attempted to clear Highway 1806 of a burned barricade which prevented emergency access into and out of camp, Water Protectors were hosed with water cannons and inundated with tear gas, concussion grenades, and rubber bullets aimed at heads and genitalia. Some of the severest injuries include a 21 year-old woman whose arm was completely blown open and shattered when she was struck with a concussion grenade while trying to bring water to fellow Water Protectors. Cardiac arrest from excessive tear gas exposure occurred in an elder man who had to be resuscitated on scene. Hundreds were injured, many lost consciousness and many more were hypothermic from being blasted with frigid water in 26 degree Fahrenheit weather. Temperatures have dropped to below freezing and the camps are in need of warm bedding, clothing, fire wood and medical supplies. Please donate and share this campaign with your friends.
