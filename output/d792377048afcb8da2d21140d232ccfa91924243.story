0 The months-long demonstrations over the Dakota Access Pipeline reached a new level of violence the week before Thanksgiving. 0 Police hosed environmentalists in the subfreezing cold and launched concussion grenades into crowds. One woman nearly had her arm blown off. Others were hospitalized for hypothermia. Even prior to that, deputies shipped in from the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office had swung batons to hit protesters in the head. Video footage of that use of force has been particularly disturbing to veterans trained in the proper use of military equipment. Some 2,000 veterans from all over the country will reinforce protesters at Standing Rock this weekend. Lucas Bratvold of Bemidji, a former Air Force staff sergeant, has been deployed to the Yokota Air Base in Japan, the Balad Air Base in Iraq, and the Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. Bratvold says when he saw reporter Erin Schrode knocked off her feet by a rubber bullet mid-interview in early November, he was furious. He believes videos from Standing Rock clearly show police mishandling their weapons by shooting nonlethal rounds at too close a range, or launching tear gas canisters headlong into crowds instead of lobbing them up into the air so the chemicals mist down. Bratvold hopes that if police and Energy Transfer guards use the same tactics against military veterans, who want to serve as human shields for the Sioux and other Native Americans protesting, the whole country will protest. Native Americans comprise 1.4 percent of the United States population, but 1.7 percent of the military. Natives serve at a higher rate than any other ethnic group. Natives are a relational people, he says. They relate to the earth and water, and name their family clans for the wildlife of their ancestral homes. The need to be a part of something bigger than themselves while defending their land makes them particularly amenable to the idea of enlisting in the military. Teasing apart the thinking of that makes it a really huge moment. In any case, Hill says his job will be to look after fellow veterans, as well as other protesters who have faced violence. Kay Carlson of St. Paul, the ride-sharing coordinator for Minnesotan veterans bound for Standing Rock, will head a roster of about 50 this weekend. Carlson left high school and enlisted at 17, spending a year in Iraq shuttling people from one camp to another while dodging IEDs. Camping in the extreme cold won't be a problem, she says, nor facing rubber bullets. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
