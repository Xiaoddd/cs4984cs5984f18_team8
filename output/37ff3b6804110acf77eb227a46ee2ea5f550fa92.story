Many of us are artists of color and working class artists. Communities of color are constantly being dispossessed of their dignity, livelihoods, neighborhoods and homes, and left without the resources to fight for them. From land grabs in DC to land grab in Standing Rock, what we are facing is nothing less than colonialism. We need to fight back. In this case, we take responsibility as residents on stolen land, and we are determined to do what we can to support the Indigenous-led fight against DAPL. We are stepping up as locally rooted artists in DC because our symbolic location provides a valuable platform for us to organize nationally. With local communities and artists taking the lead in each city, we hope to together raise awareness and elevate Native voices for Standing Rock, as well as for first nations worldwide, combining art and activism to achieve global social & environmental justice. We need help funding paint and event supplies, and transportation costs. We will use as much paint that we already have as we can. We will also use connections as much as possible for lodging.
