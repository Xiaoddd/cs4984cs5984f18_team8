I HOPE it was an answer, so you might LIVE . . . The Teachings of Thoth Not everyday is a good day, live anyway. Not all you love will love you back, love anyway. Not everyone will tell you the truth, be honest anyway. Not all deals are fair, play fair anyway. I will think of solutions, I will not let my worry control me. I will not let my stress level break me. I will simply breathe. And it will be okay. Look at the Reagan models. Email check failed, please try again Sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.
