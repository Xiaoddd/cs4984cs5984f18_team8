Close Writing the Ecocide-Genocide Knot: Indigenous Knowledge and Critical Theory in the Endgame By Gene Ray Here is a lesson: what happens to people and what happens to the land is the same thing. If Auschwitz and Hiroshima were demonstrations of genocidal tendencies unfolding within the logic of modernity, then the ecocidal character of the global social process is now also beyond doubt. But Indigenous voices are telling us, perhaps have always told us, that these processes are inseparable. Evidently, Indigenous peoples have understood the problem more clearly, and felt it more deeply, than the critical theorists. Speaking out, addressing us moderns directly, struggling massively to defend the biosphere, Indigenous peoples see the emergency and are resurgent, from Idle No More and the Indigenous Environmental Network to La Via Campesina.7 Few political developments anywhere today are as inspiring as this. Climate chaos, globalized toxicity, mass extinction. The names we choose shape the frame, imply what is possible, favor some pathways over others. Yet in naming the situation, every name invokes struggles and antagonists. This story line is still being edited. That phrase named the problem, the stakes, the enemy. Capital dominates the planet. This has not changed today. No, I think not. The fevered dreams of progress and techno-science, of forward leaning and qualitative leaping, are too implicated in the damage and loss. Capital cannot slip out: modernity is the world that capital and science, nation-states and transnational corporations, have brought into being. Modernity, as such: this gripping addiction to energy, consumption, novelty, speed; this blind adoration of technology and blind trust in science; this internalized allegiance to the dogmas of growth, development, and progress. All these, lived as unrelieved pressure, as headlock, as material force of terror. Enforced enjoyment under the social selection of globalized precarity, ecological as well as social. Alarmingly, this is the thing we need to stop, disarm, and leave behind. Now anyone can draw the conclusion. What would have been extreme, as words flowing from any mouth in any conversation, will soon be banal. Modernity: a permanent, dirty war on life. We have entered the endgame. If it is beginning to show itself, it does so in local reaches for things old as well as new. Even to approach these questions, I will have to risk leaving the conventions of critical theory, my comfort zone, and try to write differently. Such theory has been a powerful tool for exposing domination, for mapping the violence of social relations. It grasps these things without feeling them, without grieving, without keening. That refusal or incapacity, that very withholding, is precisely what is modern. Critical theory fights for justice with a rigor that is half-blind: while it sees the pain in the world, its deployments of reason rarely express or acknowledge its own feelings of pain about it. But full understanding requires, and cannot avoid, the ache and grief of what learning uncovers. This pain is integral to the pressure for change. But I doubt now that such a division of labor is justified. If mourning is to be a passage to political action, reason and feeling have to be engaged together. Even within critique, pain and grief need to flow and be shared. The fear of releases of feeling can lead to repressions of feeling that are equally blind. The models of critical theory developed in the wake of World War II are understandable in context, but were perhaps even then too emotionally restrictive. I could not, alone, have reached much clarity about the limits of my practice of critical theory. Yet the stakes are high, and I feel the need to try. This is a reach, an attempt to find out what a critical theory opened to Indigenous knowledge might begin to look like, at this decisive moment. Critical theory is a self-reflexive practice. In theory, it should be able to acknowledge and address its own shortcomings. And it has done so with some: with its implicatedness in the cultural and intellectual marketplace, and, to a lesser extent, in its complicity with structures of race, gender, and class privilege. But the problems I now recognize in my own practice will not be easy to work through. Together, these biases make it hard for critical theory to approach Indigenous knowledge with openness. Taboo on Feeling Healer Susie Jim Billie collecting fern leaves for medicinal use, Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation, Florida, 1985 A child of the Enlightenment and its reasoning, critical theory has nevertheless been radical enough to expose the untruth in both Western science and the Enlightenment humanist tradition. There are historical reasons for this. More recently, the Frankfurt critical theorists were deeply traumatized by the rise of Nazism, which they saw as a cynical and genocidal channeling of mass emotion, namely fear and resentment over actual conditions of individual powerlessness. As a result, they asserted a strong critical taboo against rituals and expressions of public feeling. Subsequent generations of critical theorists have tended to internalize this taboo as a reflex. I certainly did, for many years. Together, these propositions would seem to offer everything needed for critical theory to reflect both on the entanglement of ecocide and genocide, and on its own troubles with Indigenous knowledge. I mention them, and Dialectic of Enlightenment, only to show that the problem is not that critical theory cannot grasp or speak of the linkage between ecocide and genocide. It has done so. The problem, rather, is that the performance of analytic rigor has not been accompanied by a skillful abiding with the pain of loss. As the mind is guided to insight, so pain has to go through grief to find courage. If critical theory is a needed moment in working through the destruction wrought by modernity, then there are more needed moments after that moment. Or better: within that moment. Herons are fragile birds, and it is not unusual for them to die from stress. I think of them when hearing that Hmong men, forced to leave their country and rootless in America, die of no apparent cause while they are sleeping. I understand the loss that leads to despair and to death. In one paragraph that deftly opens the reader to the linking of ecocide and genocide without lapsing into excessive sentimentality, Hogan shows us the paucity of critical theory at this moment. Blocked and addicted, we moderns need to be confronted with the damage modernity is wreaking in the world. In the very next paragraph, without ever needing critical theory, Hogan picks up the knot. It began on this continent, with the genocide of tribal people, and with the ongoing war against the natural world. But the feeling that made the crowd roar at the rally in Nuremberg, or in any football stadium today, is not the sole measure of public or private emotion. The trauma of genocide and ecocide extends to all of us. But still, in the long view: the loss of any is a loss to all. That can be seen as the conclusion of a rational proof. But, I feel, it is not really understood until it is acknowledged as real pain. Today, in the Sixth Great Extinction, more is required. If critical theory cannot bring itself to participate in the sharing of this pain, then it should at least distinguish precisely between contexts of opening and awakening to the actuality of the knot, on the one hand, and manipulative public rituals aiming to mobilize support for more genocide and ecocide, on the other. It should save its condemnations for the latter, and for the hijacking of the former from above. Palpating the knot, exploring the borders between transformative emotion and the exploitation of feeling, a critical and decolonizing art may offer points of access to a more-than-rational understanding. I criticized the dogmas of infinite growth and economic development but blindly held on to a faith in constant intellectual and cultural change by qualitative leaping. The issue is not how old or new an idea is, but how relevant, helpful, and effective it is in the present context. The critique of modernity to be found in Indigenous thinking seems to me more decisive; overall, it has more heart, more reciprocity, and more respect for life. Over the course of my theoretical practice, I accepted a critical reflex against anything remotely suspected of regressing or going backward. It also enforces the academic and curatorial marketplace, always hungry for the next new thing. The refusal of modernity entails that dominant power structures be radically changed. But the cultural ideas and sources that inspire and support this change may very well be far older than modernity itself, even ancient, so long as they are true. It is about moving on from social forms and logics that are unsustainable and based on terror and inappropriate technologies toward social forms and logics that are sustainable, resilient, and supported by appropriate technologies. The value systems of Indigenous knowledge show us how such forms and logics have been grounded and rooted, and show us that we can gain more, substantively, in relationships, balance, and happiness, than we will lose by refusing the stresses of modernity. Suspicions about Place A mountain of bison skulls to be used as fertilizer, Rougeville, Michigan, ca. Every Indigenous people has its own places and histories, its own culture, traditions, and knowledge. It is too generalizing to speak of Indigenous knowledge as if it were a single, codified body. And yet, Indigenous scholars do speak of Indigenous knowledge, just as I speak of critical theory, which can be practiced in diverse ways. Not necessarily by every Indigenous culture everywhere, or by every Indigenous person; it is not a racial, biological, or categorical endowment that is claimed, but rather learned and transmitted cultural traditions that survive, that have been kept alive, despite being long under attack. To me, as a reader, it seems that something like a shared disposition emerges from diverse survival strategies, from deep contextual and relational knowledge of diverse landscapes and ecosystems. Older than contact with colonialism, Indigenous knowledge has endured experiences of colonization, and has pulled through those continuing traumas. It seems to be a shared understanding, or similar kinds of understanding, about the meaning and centrality of land and place. This emphatic respect for the life and power of place is what impresses me most. In the face of such loss, one thing our people could not surrender was the meaning of land. In the settler mind, land was property, real estate, capital, or natural resources. But to our people, it was everything: identity, the connection to our ancestors, the home of our nonhuman kinfolk, our pharmacy, our library, the source of all that sustained us. Our lands were where our responsibility to the world was enacted, sacred ground. It belonged to itself; it was a gift, not a commodity, so it could never be bought or sold. These are the meanings people took with them when they were forced from their ancient homelands to new places. Whether it was their homeland or the new land forced upon them, land held in common gave people strength; it gave them something to fight for. But therein lies the difference, the striking contrast with modernity: the land in this larger sense of sacred place and expanded community is the ultimate source of values, ethics, justice, and spirituality in Indigenous knowledge. In a land-centered and land-bonded ethic, what contributes to mutual flourishing finds support, whereas what damages or threatens the ecosystem is unacceptable. This ethical basis seems to me obviously superior to the value-system of modernity, which is sanctioning the unchecked ruination of the biosphere. Capitalist accumulation would seem to be, from the frame of Indigenous knowledge and ethics, nothing less than an atrocity. This feels right to me, profoundly right. Again, it has to be seen in the context of the reflection on Nazism and Auschwitz. Accordingly, in Nazi ideology, the Germans were a master race endowed with a special mystical bond with the German land. To keep the Fatherland pure, it was necessary to make all the Jews, Sinti, and Roma, and other undesired communities disappear, eventually into gas chambers and crematoria. And many Germans evidently embraced this self-flattering fantasy. Subsequently, in encountering any claim of a special bond or relation between a people or culture and their place, the reflex of critical theory has been to attack it as a kind of protofascism hiding the seeds of genocide. But all bonds to the land are not to be understood or enacted in this racialized way. By all accounts, the Indigenous peoples of North America certainly did not understand or enact it in this way. Critical theorists, applying no more than their own strictly rational critical tools, should be able to see and correct this problem. I believe some version of a land ethic must be a part of any viable resistance to the modernist knot of ecocide and genocide. Quite simply, you must know and love a place before you will live out a commitment to care for and defend it. There is no need at all to racialize this, or oppose it with worries about purported genocidal potentials. The genocide and ecocide are already going on. Anthropocentrism For modernists and evidently most moderns as well, only human life is granted intrinsic value. Ethical and political standing follow from intrinsic value. Animals and the natural environment have been merely means for human ends, the background for human activity. Anthropocentrism has been as central to modernity as the profit motive. Maybe it has been even more central, this fantasy of human exceptionalism, superiority, and control. Nature has value only for humans. Certainly these self-flattering and self-serving fantasies of superiority are hubristic. The real leap of awareness needed now, the leap of feeling as well as thinking and doing, is to a disposition to nature oriented toward mutual support. An ethic and politics of reciprocity would recognize the intrinsic value of life in all its diversity. The needs of the biosphere, not the manufactured social circuits of human desire, have to come first. In the end, in any case, there will be no escaping this fact. It has been here all along, in the kinship traditions and teachings of Indigenous knowledge. And Indigenous voices have been reminding us moderns of this for some time now. Consider, for example, the Kari-Oca Declaration of 1992, at the time of the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit. Indigenous leaders, teachers, and activists are addressing the world directly now because they understand the urgency. Having endured the genocidal and ecocidal violence of modernity for 500 years, Indigenous peoples know something about it. And the land-centered and land-bonded ethic of reciprocity they are expressing offers pathways for transformation in this time of meltdown and endgame. The anthropocentrism of the Western modernist tradition has been strongly criticized by scholars of environmental humanities and animal studies. Some critical theorists have supported the leap to an expanded sense of community and commitment. But these are exceptions. As far as I can gauge, critical theory in general has been hostile to these propositions. But I remain unconvinced. I do acknowledge that the deepening destruction of the biosphere will feed some tendencies toward fascism and similar capitalist emergency state and para-state formations. (One person is displaced by climate change every second now, we are told; no one can guess the corresponding figure for nonhuman climate refugees. But the task for critical theorists, in my view, would be to clarify the differences between such relapses into violence and the actual emerging movement to contain and abolish ecocide and genocide. It certainly should not be to collapse the differences between these two radically different ethical and political projects in order to smear them with the same brush. 1572 This should not remain a merely abstract discussion about the knot of ecocide and genocide. It needs to come to ground. And it will have to be personal, in contact with experience, social facts, emotion, and testimony. So let me try again to introduce myself. Like all people, and animals too, I learned protocols of greeting and introduction. Seeing others do it differently helps me to notice my own customs and conventions. Critical theory could not help me understand my own deepest feelings about the place I come from, but my encounters with Indigenous knowledge gradually showed me what the meanings of my feelings are. Many offer their name, and tribal and clan affiliations. Almost all, I notice, say where they come from. This made me think. I would not feel a need or obligation to do that. The presumption, in the protocols I learned, seems to be that where you are from is not very important. (Obviously, there are border regimes and rules in which your birthplace is the most important thing. Other things are considered more important to help others situate you, relate to you, and be open to what you may say. Generally, you are expected to say what you do, how you earn your living. Possibly also, in some contexts, where you are working and living, now. But not where you come from. This is telling. I would like to say that I am from a place, that I am rooted there, that I remain rooted. But modernity, with its training in restlessness, permanent hunger, and the shadows of terror, has uprooted me. Places, in modernity, are territories to be conquered, controlled, and plundered. Places are where moderns go to extract resources, to chase their addictions, to pursue so-called happiness. Indigeneity, that fierce bonding to the living land, the living air and waters of place, is an obstacle to modernist pursuits. Indigenous peoples, who have always been willing to defend the life of their places, are in the way. In order to be modern, no one is allowed to be Indigenous. In modernity Indigenous peoples are displaced, dispossessed, targeted for removal and elimination. Modernists call that progress. I would like to say that I was rooted, once, at least. Everyone grows up somewhere. The place where I grew up is not the place I was born. It is not the place where my mother and ancestors are buried. It is not the place where I live now. Still, I find that I know that place like I will never know any other. My body remembers that place, the skies, the light, the storms, the smells. Fire ant, paper wasp, green anole. Coontie, hawk moth, blue porterweed. Slash pine, saw palmetto, diamondback rattler. Pink muhly grass, purple lovegrass, shiny blueberry. Passionflower, sandspur, black-eyed Susan. Scrub jay, coral snake, gopher tortoise. Buttonwood, cocoplum, red and black mangrove. Great blue heron, osprey, roseate spoonbill. Cormorant, anhinga, white ibis. Alligator, mullet, snook. Coconut palm, royal palm, gumbo-limbo. Turkey vulture, bald eagle, swallow-tailed kite. Key lime, strangler fig, cabbage palmetto. Sea grape, sea oats, bay bean. Least tern, common tern, black skimmer. Lightning whelk, lettered olive, coffee bean trivia. Manatee, manta ray, bottlenose dolphin. Stone crab, tarpon, brown pelican. Sailfish, flying fish, hammerhead shark. Dolphinfish, wahoo, great barracuda. Thunderhead, tropical storm, hurricane. For no other place on earth could I invoke a litany like this. All these names are also, for me, place names. Each one calls back exact memories, real experiences in specific landscapes, in familiar yards or lots, pine savannahs or saw grass wetlands, on stretches of shore known intimately to my feet, or out at the edges of the Gulf Stream, on swells felt and remembered by my inner ears. Every name, and the life it names, places me in a region of memory where body and place are more real and vivid than my sense of passing time. These memories, these imprints, and the stories that circle them are, I find, incredibly important to me. They continue to connect me. I cannot imagine them ceasing to connect me. Memories are said to be fluid and evasive, slippery and shifty. And yet these feel durable, outside of time and change and the necessity of death. They are my memories. When I die, they will die, surely, as memories. But they will live, surely, as the echoing life of those places. I am unrooted, but I carry, I find, a deep, more-than-rational refusal of modernity. These names, memories, experiences are more than mine. They have their own force of life, call it energy, or spirit. So, the land, the air, the waters are, I find, alive as some have always said. They seethe and vibrate with life and energy and emotion. Through that place, where I am from, I retain something, some hint or hit or touch of its pulse, of a life that is more than me and more than any human. If I now say, in addition, that I am American, then you will guess: I am from South Florida. But this is still too fast, it does not yet say enough. There are many South Floridas. These questions trouble me. They spur me to think more about what I feel; they compel me to write more. South Florida is a land deeply wounded by genocide and ecocide, past and ongoing. To begin with, I need to acknowledge this: the Indigenous people of South Florida were wiped out by waves of colonial invasion, slaving raids, and European diseases. These groups were augmented by ex-slaves of African descent who had escaped from plantations in the southern states of the U.S. and by another influx of Creek refugees from the American invasion of the Mississippi Territory. The deeper origins of those wars go back to the slave trade in Indigenous peoples established by British colonists in the seventeenth century. In addition to the Seminole, Miccosukee, and African-descended peoples, there were also families of Cuban fisherfolk who intermarried with members of various tribal peoples and lived in small ranchos on the South Florida coasts and Keys. The United States took control of Florida in 1821 and promptly initiated the most racialized project of removal and elimination that land had yet seen. The Seminole, Miccosukee, and African-descended peoples resisted strongly. But small groups remained, unconquered, in the Everglades and Big Cypress. Ecologically, South Florida is fed by the warm sun and waters that fall from the skies nearly every afternoon from March to September. Historically, these waters used to flow across the land, down the southern peninsula to the sea, where they mixed with salt water in mangrove forests and tropical marine meadows protected by barrier islands. One of the main historic watersheds carried water from Lake Kissimmee south to Lake Okeechobee. As Okeechobee filled and overflowed in the summer rainy season, a sheet of shallow water would flow slowly south, through the sloughs of the Everglades, to Florida Bay. Hammocks of hardwood trees on small tear-shaped islands dot the saw grass wetlands. Between Shark River Slough and the Caloosahatchee River lies the Big Cypress Swamp, the most productive ecosystem on the peninsula. This mix fostered a diversity of wildlife, the abundance of which can hardly be imagined today. Under U.S. control, speculation-led development, industrial monoculture, and attempted manipulations of the water flow have been ecologically disastrous. On the East Coast, U.S. Highway 1 is a nonstop strip mall from Homestead to Jupiter. Most of the mangroves have been eliminated and replaced with concrete sea walls, and toxic runoff from streets, golf courses, and the grass lawns of residences has killed off most of the tropical marine meadows. Dredging and canal projects have mutilated the beautiful historic rivers and diverted the flow of water away from the Everglades. The Big Sugar corporations that control the land to the south of Lake Okeechobee suck up much of the water that is left, and what gets past the sugar fields is loaded with agricultural chemicals. Like the Florida panther, the manatee hangs on by a thread, and now the coral reefs are dying as carbon dioxide emissions turn the oceans acidic. Two nuclear power plants sit on the shores of South Florida, waiting for their superstorm. The land is resilient but can only take so much abuse before the webs of relations that sustain life unravel. I never saw the precolonial abundance of the region, but growing up, the land, waters, and skies seemed astonishingly full of life. Yet even I can see the signs of loss and damage now, everywhere, on every visit. Without question, I belong to the inflow of settlers that has ruined it. That is my culture, I have to admit, with shame and sadness. I grew up, was raised, as a modern. I cannot change that. But I can change, or try to, the way I live that background now. Founding Crimes of Settler-Colonialism The first, founding crimes of my overproud nation were the invasion, occupation, and settlement of this continent, through deliberate acts of genocide and ecocide. Lawyers can argue about the legal definitions of these terms, but I believe we know well enough what they mean: genocide is the destruction and elimination of human communities; ecocide is the destruction and elimination of ecological communities. The means and processes vary, but this is what they do. They are crimes against life, whether or not national or international law recognizes them as such. Human law and justice are not the last word here. That said, the law is one field where the struggle to defend the biosphere is being waged. Even worse, these processes continue in North America and throughout the world. We could speak of imperialism, colonization and neo-colonization, of globalization and neoliberalism. Settler-colonists come to stay, and the removal and elimination of Indigenous peoples is a necessary part of their project. I am further implicated by the fact that, in the time that I have been alive, the impoverishment, dispossession, and cultural genocide of Indigenous tribes across the United States has continued and still continues, officially, in my name, as a U.S. citizen. As I consider where and what I am from, I begin to understand that land cannot be owned in the modernist way, not without crime and atrocity, not without a war on life. It is not impossible to return stolen lands to the Indigenous peoples who held them in common before our ancestors arrived to remove them. For various public projects far less worthy, the government has often invoked eminent domain to take over land held by private owners, in return for compensation. Even within the regime of private property, then, there is a mechanism. Certainly much larger parts of native lands could and should be returned. Reparations, which are easier to perform, are also in order. A vigorous national debate about both, as well as about the restoration of full native self-determination, would be a start. I say this as a U.S. citizen who still has the right and duty to criticize my government; it is for Indigenous peoples themselves to say what they want and need, and what they expect from non-Indigenous supporters like me. What is clear is that modernity depends on bringing and keeping land under private property relations. But this is not the only way to inhabit places or grow food. The private holding of land is only a necessity so long as the logic of accumulation continues to dominate. Outside the headlock of modernity, the abundance of alternatives, many of them traditional, comes more vividly into view. From the one I remember and the one I cannot. From the one critical theory can indict, and the one it cannot fathom. From the one my settler-colonial, modern culture repeatedly violated and continues to abuse: the one dominated by sugar barons, real-estate speculators, bankers, offshore leaseholders, and all the other progeny of Andrew Jackson. From the one insulted by high-rises, trophy homes, gated communities, and spring breakers. From the one that remains outraged by the past killing and removal of so many Seminole and Miccosukee by my government. From the one that is yet enriched today by the presence of those descended from the Seminole, Miccosukee, and Black Seminole bands who were never conquered and never left. From the South Florida enriched by the descendants of enslaved Africans from all over the Caribbean. From the one swept by rains, storms, and hurricanes, and the one waiting and watching for the coming climate chaos. From the one in which the cultural and biological diversity of life stubbornly persists, despite all damage, loss, and diminishment. From the sacred ruins, then, where the land, air, and waters surge and thrum with the life of the living and the life of the undead.
