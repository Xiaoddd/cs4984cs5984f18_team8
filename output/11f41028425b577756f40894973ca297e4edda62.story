The Department of Mineral Resouces is reporting the largest barrel per day reduction in the state's history. Northwest North Dakota has seen nearly two feet of snow this winter, much of it in December. Three significant snowstorms closed roads to and from well sites and drill pads. In addition, high winds shut down work crews for half of the month. Workover rigs and hydraulic fracking crews can't work when wind speeds exceed 35 miles an hour, which was the case for half of December. Not only did oil production go down nine percent, but natural gas production went down 13 percent.
