All rights reserved. BEC CREW 9 MAY 2017 With the highly controversial Dakota Access Pipeline expected to start operations this week, the latest reports on the state's oil spill record do not bode well. According to the North Dakota Department of Health, they've experienced more than 700 oil spills in the past 12 months alone. According to Chris Clarke at KCET, if you averaged out all the oil spills in the state of North Dakota in the year ending on 1 May 2017, you'd have one spill every 11 hours and 45 minutes. And we're not talking small leaks here. That same event saw an additional 2,500 barrels (1 million gallons) of brine leak outside the facility. But here's the thing - if those figures sound alarming, they're nothing compared to the more recent oil spill that occurred in Billings County, just 2.5 hours away from where the Standing Rock protest took place. Back in December, it was reported that the Billings Country spill leaked 176,000 gallons of crude oil (4,200 barrels) into Ash Coulee Creek and the surrounding countryside, due to a fault in the Belle Fourche Pipeline. And that was five days after the leak had originally sprung. So yes, we're talking about more than half a million gallons of oil leaking out into privately owned land and US Forest Service grazing land, making it one of the largest oil spills in North Dakota history. The sad thing is this hasn't even been a particularly bad 12 months for North Dakota. The two largest even hit the 1 million gallons mark, with one spill resulting in 1 million gallons (23,800 barrels) of oil being leaked into the county of McKenzie in 2006, and it happened again in 2014, when McKenzie experienced a leak of 1,008,000 gallons of oil. One event on 29 September 2013 resulted in 20,600 barrels (865,200 gallons) of oil leaking from a pipeline in Mountrail County. That event also wasn't detected by the pipeline owners. The owner of a local wheatfield was the first notice when his crops had become so contaminated, he could smell the oil. 5 days ago Politics & Society Semi-Automatic Rifles Really Are More Deadly, New Study Clearly Shows Numbers don't lie. 6 days ago Politics & Society To Save Ourselves It's Time to Rethink Our Economic System, Warn Scientists The market is killing the planet. 4 hours ago PHYSICS Single Hydrogen Atoms Could Form Eerie 'Ghost Bonds' With Nothing, New Study Shows It shouldn't be possible. 15 hours ago SPACE SpaceX Has Announced The First Tourist to Go to The Moon - And Take Other People With Him Such a wild project. 15 hours ago NATURE Potentially Deadly Threats Are Now Lurking in Post-Hurricane Flood Waters Hurricane Florence isn't over yet.
