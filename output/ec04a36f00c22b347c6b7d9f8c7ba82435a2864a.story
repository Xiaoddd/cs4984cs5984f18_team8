In New York City, organizers plan to protest outside a Wells Fargo pipeline symposium on Tuesday. Protesters in Philadelphia Monday night said they planned to continue keeping pressure on banks that backed DAPL. Organizers circulated fliers with instruction on how to close bank accounts and open credit union accounts. The marchers also rallied outside the Philadelphia offices of the Army Corps of Engineers. Asked about the protests and the Army Corps decision, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney lauded the Obama administration's move, but sounded a cautionary note. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney expressed concern that the Trump administration could undo the decision by the Corps outside City Hall Monday night. A 17-page Trump administration memo obtained last week by the Associated Press made it clear that the incoming administration supported the construction of the DAPL project. Philadelphia police lined up as protesters briefly shut down streets in Center City on Monday. In October, a pipeline rupture in Pennsylvania spilled roughly 55,000 gallons of raw gasoline into a branch of the Susquehanna River. View the discussion thread.
