DNB announced in November that it would review its participation in the financing of the Energy Transfer Partners project after pressure from the Norwegian Indigenous Sami people. After meeting representatives from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, among others, as well as the pipeline company, DNB decided to pull out, it said. The remaining banks include Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, BayernLB, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Citibank, Credit Agricole, ICBC, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mizuho Bank, Natixis, Societe Generale, SMBC, SunTrust, TD Securities, and Wells Fargo. In February, law enforcement swept through an encampment occupied since August on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers property at the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, after President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the corps to grant an easement allowing the project to proceed. Since then efforts to convince banks and lenders to divest from the pipeline have been gaining momentum as four U.S. cities, San Francisco, Seattle, Davis and Santa Monica, have divested from Wells Fargo, one of the banks lending money to the Dakota Access pipeline. Standing Rock Sioux Tribe water protectors and their allies argue that the pipeline is being built on sacred land and could damage the area's water sources. The action against the pipeline attracted more than 300 Native American tribes from across the United States in a show of unity and force.
