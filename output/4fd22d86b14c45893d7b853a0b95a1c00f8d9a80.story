Judge Turner ordered Bayou Bridge Pipeline LLC to prepare an emergency response and evacuation plan before completing the project. The pipeline is a joint project between Phillips 66 and Energy Transfer Partners. The Bayou Bridge Pipeline is part of a larger pipeline network that branches out from the Dakota Access Pipeline. Its path runs from the Texas-Louisiana border through the Atchafalaya Basin in southern Louisiana to the town of St. James, where many pipelines already congregate. According to Jordan, there are a number of oil tanks, docks, and transportation stations already built in the town. Phillips 66 is proposing to build another pipeline in the area that will stretch from St. James to the refinery complexes closer to New Orleans. With residents living in such close proximity to the pipeline, plans to deal with construction- and operation-related emergencies should have been in place before the authorities issued the permit. While this is a small victory for the local residents, Bayou Bridge Pipeline LLC will likely file for an appeal. As the case against the pipeline bounces in and out of court, St. James residents have been feeling ignored by Energy Transfer Partners. The death this spring of a local environmental activist heightened concerns about the health consequences of living next to major oil, gas, and chemical plants. In March, St. James resident Keith Hunter, 60, died from respiratory failure. He had spent years fighting oil and energy companies from building their facilities in St. James. Protesters who are battling a different section of the same pipeline are anxiously waiting for a court decision on a lawsuit filed against Energy Transfer Partners. Wilson went to court earlier this month after Energy Transfer Partners appealed an injunction granted by a federal judge in February. Sign up for daily updates from Sierra magazine.
