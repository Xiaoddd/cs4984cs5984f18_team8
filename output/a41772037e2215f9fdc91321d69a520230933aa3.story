Winter is descending upon thousands of Native Americans camped out in North Dakota. For months, they have been protesting against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. The early snowstorms of the season are rolling across the prairie. Temperatures frequently drop below freezing at night. Since April 2016, when the campaign to stop the pipeline began, the indigenous protest camps have transformed into an organised community. The Sacred Stone Camp is dense, close to the Cannonball River, sheltered from the wind by a steep bank and clusters of trees. Oceti Sakowin Camp is sprawling, home to an estimated 4,000 people, huddled around sacred fires, chatting with friends, sheltering from the cold in trucks, tepees, tents and yurts.

Doctors, traditional healers and psychologists provide care free of charge in the Oceti Sakowin camp, out of a series of shelters close to the central fire pit. Storage tents, pinned down against the wind with tarpaulins, are piled high with donated gloves, hats and sleeping bags. Many of these developments have been funded by social media campaigns. Although the vast majority of Dakota Access oil pipeline has been built, the section closest to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation - which will pass beneath the Missouri River - is still awaiting federal permits and approval.

A permit was initially granted by the Army Corps of Engineers, but the Department of Justice and other agencies intervened to override the decision on 9 September. But the struggle between the coalition of over 200 indigenous tribes and the oil company Dakota Access LLC has intensified in recent weeks. On 25 November the US Army Corps of Engineers issued a letter calling for the Oceti Sakowin camp, which sits on federally owned land, be evacuated by 5 December. This was followed by a similar evacuation order from the governor of North Dakota.

The local Morten County police are being sued for excess force by a number of camp residents. Representatives of Dakota Access LLC have criticised the protest movement while stressing the company's cooperation with authorities. Pipeline workers have also been adversely affected.

Ron Ness, the Chairman of North Dakota's Petroleum Council, believes the disruption will soon be over. President-elect Trump, who will take office in January 2017, is assumed to be friendly to energy concerns and has a personal connection with the pipeline. In May 2016, the Republican's financial disclosures revealed he had investments in companies affiliated with the pipeline, though the Dallas Business Journal interviewed a spokeswoman from Trump's transition office who claimed he sold all or most of these assets in July 2016. Still, the protesters don't plan to give up. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.
