Sioux in the Dakota borderlands and thousands of their supporters are camped near the Dakota Access Pipeline construction site north of Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Authorities hope issuing fines for delivering supplies to the camp will end the siege, with the record-holding North Dakota winter in fresh chill (Fargo holds the contiguous US record for low temperature). The Army Corps of Engineers ordered the camp evacuated by Monday December 5, but says it has no plans to forcibly remove the protesters. Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault said the ride had political and spiritual significance. It was a striking sight, with flags fluttering and the horses pounding along, covering the soft damp ground at a quick pace. The workers on the pipeline feel threatened by protesters, probably in part because of the propaganda efforts of Energy Transfer Partners. Tapping the Bakken oil fields, an underground fossil fuel reserve covering roughly one-third of North Dakota, has been economically transformative for the state. This post is a work in progress, I will continue to add to it as learn more about the interests involved. Environmental activists have been on the offensive against pipelines and fracking developments, and the industry views it as a war. To regain public relations ground, companies formed coalitions, establishing news sites, social media accounts, as well undertaking more traditional lobbying efforts. The aim is two-fold: 1. downplay risks and promote benefits of pipeline construction, & 2. Discredit the opposition. InfoWars has even gotten in on the action. North Dakota Pipeline News claims to take no position, merely to present the facts. Port is also editor of the SayAnything blog, a political news site busy with criticism of the pipeline protest, and is a columnist for Forum News Service, whose parent Forum Communications owns a network of conservative print and online publications throughout the US, several in the Midwest which are steeped in pro-pipeline coverage. A ProDAPL Facebook page is also managed by Port. The Fact Checker is a project of the Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now, which according to its website is a partnership of entities from the agriculture, business, and labor sectors aimed at supporting the economic development and energy security benefits associated with infrastructure projects in the Midwest. Journals that have sprung up to cover the Bakken lode include Bakken Oil Business Journal, Bakken Magazine, and the Bakken Oil Report. No matter how essential the DAPL may be for fuel supply, which is questionable, there is no denying that police response to protests has often been brutal, as Amnesty and the UN have both observed. A hearing is scheduled before the Organization of American States December 9th. Give Kenneth Lipp a round of applause.
