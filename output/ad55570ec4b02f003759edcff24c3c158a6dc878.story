If FERC did not act, Williams rehearing request would have been deemed denied within 30 days from the date the request was made, which was Feb. 12. Williams argued New York waived its authority under the Clean Water Act to decide on the water quality certification for Constitution by failing to act within a reasonable period of time. Williams filed with FERC to build Constitution in 2013. FERC first approved construction of the project in 2014 and then again in 2016, conditional upon other approvals. Williams filed for water quality certification with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) in August 2013. If built, the 125-mile (201-km) pipeline would transport 0.65 billion cubic feet per day of shale gas. New York uses on average about 3.6 bcfd of gas. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. Williams said it would take about 10 to 12 months to build the pipeline after it receives the necessary approvals. Constitution is owned by subsidiaries of Williams, Cabot Oil & Gas, Duke Energy and WGL Holdings.
