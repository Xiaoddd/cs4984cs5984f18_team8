Market players said they expect this will hasten a revival of output from the Bakken region which fell sharply along with global oil prices during the past two years. The New York-based company has contracts to send roughly half its daily North Dakota output through DAPL. For 2017, Hess has said its Bakken production could grow more than 10 percent. Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP.N), which operates the 1,100 mile (1,770 km) long DAPL, has begun filling the line with crude and could reach full operating capacity by late April, based on industry estimates.

That should help level the playing field between Bakken producers and rivals in other U.S. shale plays, many of which are closer to refineries and other customers. By the end of the year, analysts expect the rig count to rise another 10 percent or more. OUTLOOK Transportation savings from DAPL are a key factor oil companies are considering when deciding whether to boost production, executives, analysts and investors said. Hess plans to triple the number of drilling rigs it operates in North Dakota this year. The company will move the 30 percent of its existing Bakken production from rail to pipeline once DAPL opens. Oasis Petroleum Inc (OAS.N), another large Bakken producer, said its 2017 output could rise more than 30 percent. But Continental expects DAPL to ease a transport bottleneck out of the state and open room on other pipelines, allowing it to stop using rail. Both Whiting and Continental have projected production to rise more than 20 percent this year. The companies did not respond to requests for comment. Another reason for rising production is that higher prices have prompted many companies to hedge, or sell forward, some of their output, which bolsters confidence. Whiting and Oasis, for example, have hedged more than half of 2017 production.
