The wind blew all through the cold night. The protective covering I rigged over our shared tent flapped frozen against the outside. I was too tired to even be bothered by it at all. Fortunately, the sleeping bag was designed for this climate. I hoped my tent partner, Jasmine, was warm enough as I covered her gently in an extra blanket. A person I have never met before from Brooklyn was sharing her tent. It was a warm space in a brutal North Dakota winter. In the early morning, the wind howled incessantly as the drums began. I was up early to place my corn pollen in prayer toward the rising sun. After a hardy breakfast, I charged up my cell phone on one of the many solar charging stations. The drone of the plane began as well. All day and long into the night, our receptions were disturbed. Other drums began beating as more voices awoke the camp. Bundled up figures emerged from each camp as morning greetings were exchanged. After chopping and stacking firewood, I made my way up to Media Hill to send out updates. These beautiful people gifted me with a sacred stone necklace made of jade. The hill to the north was lined with police and their armored vehicles. A show of force, taunting. We thrived with and in peace in that camp. Caravans were made to Bismarck to march in solidarity for all water users. The time I spent in the city was quite nice. I expected a bit of hostility but none materialized. We looked camping scruffy and brown, but met with little notice. I spoke with a young man doubting himself after witnessing the horror on the bridge the night before. His weight lifted. Everyone looks after the other. We prayed with the river. We knelt on the ice-crusted bank. I saw them on the ridge. The cold blew through you with ease. Music was almost constant, as pure as the love and support you felt from every person. Thanksgiving, as ironic a day it was, still fed us in spirit and body. The real words and songs from elders ushered in the serving of food. The elders, we were served first by the young ones. It was a great moment to be an elder. Though, I am introduced as the youngest elder. The medical camp also included herbal healing and massage yurts, where I received the most memorable bodywork as the Water Protectors crossed over en mass to Turtle Island. I chose to stay calm. I grinned at the irony. The freezing cold makes the body tire out completely. As the day of thanks ended, I was so exhausted from the cold and tryptophan. I believe everyone was fed the traditional Thanksgiving meal: Bison stew and other supporting cast of culinary delight. We did give gratitude to the great spirit of the Universal Kindness. Below the iron gaze of the police there on the hill, we gave our thanks not for the pilgrims, but for our strength, perseverance, and hopes for an outcome acknowledging our tribal sanctity. The bitter cold wind blew across the camp as the sun sat on another day at Oceti Sakowin, by the Cannonball River where we chose to take our stand. We fell into our tent and fell deeper into a well-earned slumber. The memories of faces and conversations of the day receded gently into calmness. The night crept into every habitat below the blanket of starry, starry night. We fell asleep undisturbed despite the noise of the flapping frozen tarp on our tent, despite the drums and the threats just over the hill. The howling wind blew all night. I dreamt warming dreams.
