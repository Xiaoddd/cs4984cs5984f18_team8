By law, U.S. companies are required to report attacks that compromise personal identifying information such as credit card numbers or medical records. But in the industrial sectors, there is no such requirement to report attacks on control and information technology systems. U.S. energy companies reported more than 350 cybersecurity incidents between 2011 and 2015 to the Department of Homeland Security.

U.S. federal agencies last month said hackers backed by the Russian government have targeted the U.S. energy industry and other sectors critical to running the economy in a wave of attacks that began iin March 2016, if not earlier. The alert, put out by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security on March 15, marked the first time the U.S. government had specifically blamed the Kremlin for online attacks against the nation's so-called critical infrastructure, which includes energy, nuclear, water, aviation and manufacturing facilities.
