They have also claimed that privatizing tribal lands would help tribes navigate more easily through the thick bureaucratic red tape they face if they want to exploit resources. Though some tribes have entered into mining and drilling deals with private companies in order to ease the poverty in their communities, they have still failed to fully enjoy the oil and gas boom the region saw over the last decade.
