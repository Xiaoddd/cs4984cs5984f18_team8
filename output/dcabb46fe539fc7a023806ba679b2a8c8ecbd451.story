She completed her backpacking trip, to spend four more days on the trail. Even the writer of the most violent television crime procedural could not imagine something so bloody or extraordinary. After her resignation a week later, they still do not have basic information. I predicted we would all forget about this murder after a week, but I did not take two things into account. First, Minneapolis mayor Betsy Hodges might fire Harteau. Second, the Australian government would do well to keep the issue in front of us, and the rest of the world. If we need our friends in Sydney to school us in proper policing, let it be done. If you hear a loud noise, shoot. If you see something move in the dark, shoot. Nothing, however, prevents the Minneapolis police department from firing him, and nothing prevents the district attorney from preparing charges against him. Noor has already indicated, through his attorney, that he will not cooperate with an investigation. So the police department does not lose anything if it places him outside the pale, and opens the only other avenue it has to gather information: indictment and trial. If the charges are mistaken, the district attorney can drop them. If the firing is mistaken, the department can rehire him. She acknowledges that Noor acted inappropriately, not according to procedure. She further acknowledges the officers should have had their cameras on. Do not expect officers to turn on cameras when they are in a tense situation. Reporters in the Damond case refer to police training. Yes, training is important, but even more so is police culture. Police have developed a culture of self-protection and aggressiveness that endangers people like Justine Damond. Most inner city residents who call 911 would not simply walk up to a police car in the dark, with a cell phone that looks like a gun in hand. The resident might not call 911 in the first place, for fear of what police might do to him. She lived in a wealthy neighborhood of south Minneapolis, right near Lake Harriet. She would not expect a police officer to shoot her in the stomach as she approached the car. She would expect the police officer to get out of the car to talk with her. Police officers are pumped up. Not all of them, but their adrenaline flows in situations where it should not. It results from a culture of fear and threat perception turned to aggressiveness, and use of firearms as a form of aggressive self-protection. It requires a lot of firm, even obstinate leadership in the other direction to change this culture, to turn police officers into public servants again.
