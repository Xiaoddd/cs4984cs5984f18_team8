Jeff Browaty is resigning from his position as chair of the Winnipeg Police Board, following a call from the board itself for his removal after he questioned the need for all city staff to receive education about the legacy of residential schools. Browaty released a statement announcing his decision to resign on Wednesday, two days after the board sent Mayor Brian Bowman a letter requesting the chair be turfed. Browaty's spot as police board chair safe for now, Bowman says In a letter dated Feb. 6, the board said Browaty lacks the understanding of Indigenous culture, rights, tradition and history that a chair needs to build strong relationships with the community. Browaty cited the board's request and his earlier comments in his resignation announcement, saying he meant no harm or offence. Mayor faces renewed pressure to remove Browaty from police board Browaty's announcement prompted Bowman to recant statements he had made on Monday that he wouldn't rule on the matter until he spoke to Browaty in person. December comments prompt call for removal The call for Browaty's resignation came as a response to comments the councillor made in December, criticizing the city's plan to mandate a half-day training session on residential schools for all city employees as part of Winnipeg's efforts to implement the 94 recommendations of the national Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Browaty quickly backpedalled and apologized for his comments, saying he would take the training himself in 2017. He did not back down from criticisms that the plan is not open and transparent, arguing that the cost of the classes remains unknown. The comments prompted Bowman and the Mayor's Indigenous Advisory council to discuss Browaty's future as chair. The group advised Bowman to allow Browaty to remain in the position. But following a late December meeting between Browaty and elders, the Indigenous Council on Policing and Crime Prevention told the police board it didn't feel Browaty should continue to serve as chair, and the board upheld the request in its letter to Bowman on Monday. Coming out of the meeting and in light of his comments, Fontaine said the council didn't feel Browaty had the education, training or awareness of Indigenous issues necessary for his role on the police board. Mynarski Coun. Ross Eadie responded to a CBC News request for comment on the issue, saying he hasn't lost respect for Browaty as a representative of his constituents.
