Sophia Wilansky, 21, already underwent an hours-long surgery at the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minnesota and is facing many more procedures to save her shattered left arm and hand, her father said on Tuesday afternoon. He was joined in a vigil and press conference there by the noted Indian activist Clyde Bellecourt. Unicorn Riot on livestream: Sophia Wilansky's Father Speaks Sophia Wilansky was injured on Sunday evening during a lengthy assault committed under the orders of Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier. Numerous witnesses said law enforcement used stinger grenades, water cannons, tear gas, rubber bullets and other less lethal weapons on a night when the average temperature dropped below the freezing point. Kirchmeier has denied using stinger grenades, instead suggesting that the young woman was injured by explosives he claimed were going to be used against his forces. Photos posted by Unicorn Riot on Twitter show numerous items that are only made available to law enforcement. Chairman Harold Frazier of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, who was present during the assault, also contradicted Kirchmeier's assertions. He said no one set any fires or explosions despite what the sheriff claimed on Facebook and what he told the media during a press conference on Monday. Kirchmeier isn't the only who has accused pipeline resisters of engaging in violence. But in their latest submission on Tuesday, Dakota Access ignored the crackdown altogether and focused instead on monetary issues. Dakota Access has filed a cross-claim that asserts it has the right to drill under the Missouri River despite lacking an easement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. She sustained severe injuries to her arm when a concussion grenade blew part of her arm away.
