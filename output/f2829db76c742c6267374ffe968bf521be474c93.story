By Adam Gopnik Illustration by Tom Bachtell Beate and Serge Klarsfeld, the couple who did so much to bear witness to the terrible truths of the Second World War, came to town last week to introduce their new memoir to an American audience. In it, there is a photograph that can only be called heartbreaking in its happiness, unbearable in its ordinariness. It shows an eight-year-old Serge with his sister and their Romanian-Jewish parents walking along a promenade in Nice, in 1943, still smiling, still feeling confident, even at that late date, that they are safe in their new French home. Within a few months, the children and their mother were hiding in a false closet, as Gestapo agents took their father to Auschwitz, and his death. What the photograph teaches is not that every tear in the fabric of civility opens a path to Auschwitz but that civilization is immeasurably fragile, and is easily turned to brutality and barbarism. The human capacity for hatred is terrifying in its volatility. Americans have a hard time internalizing that truth, but the first days of the Trump Administration have helped bring it home. Within two weeks of the Inauguration, the hysterical hyperventilators have come to seem more prescient in their fear of incipient autocratic fanaticism than the reassuring pooh-poohers. Regimes with an authoritarian ideology and a boss man on top always bend toward the extreme edge, because their only organizational principle is loyalty to the capo. Since the capo can be placated only by uncritical praise, the most fanatic of his lieutenants end up calling the shots. Loyalty to the boss is demonstrated by hatred directed against his enemies. This combination has produced a new note in our public life: chaotic cruelty. Some choose to find comfort in the belief that the incompetence will undermine the anti-Americanism. Autocratic regimes with a demagogic bent are nearly always inefficient, because they cannot create and extend the network of delegated trust that is essential to making any organization work smoothly. The chaos is characteristic. Pluralism is not a secondary or a decorative aspect of that idea. It is, instead, intended to counter the brutal logic of the playground. There is an alternative view, one long available and articulated, that America is not an idea but an ethnicity, that of the white Christian men who have dominated it, granting a grudging or probationary acceptance to women, or blacks, or immigrants. Until now, it has been the vision of those whom Trump would call the losers. With the near-complete abdication of even minimal moral courage in the Republican Party, and the strategic confusion of the Democrats, all that Americans can turn to is the instinct for shared defiance, and a coalition of conscience, the broader the better, to counter the chaotic cruelty. Resistance rises from the street, but also from within the system, as it should, with judicial stays and State Department dissenters. Dissent is not courageous or exceptional. Democratic civilization has turned out to be even more fragile than we imagined; the resources of civil society have turned out to be even deeper than we knew.

I normally live on the East Coast, but that year, unable to face another sweltering August, I decided to temporarily decamp to the West. This turned out to be strangely easy. Another friend was away for the summer and happy to loan me her pickup truck. Someone on Craigslist sold me a bike for next to nothing. then, mystifyingly, everything fell out of place. My first day in town, I left the keys to the truck on the counter of a coffee shop. The next day, I left the keys to the house in the front door. Prior to that summer, I should note, I had lost a wallet exactly once in my adult life: at gunpoint. got the wallet back, but the next day I lost the bike lock. Eventually, having spent an absurd amount of time looking for the lock and failing to find it, I gave up and drove the truck downtown instead. was a serious feat, a real bar-raising of thing-losing, not only because in general it is difficult to lose a truck but also because the truck in question was enormous. The friend to whom it belonged once worked as an ambulance driver; oversized vehicles do not faze her. It had tires that came up to my midriff, an extended cab, and a bed big enough to haul cetaceans. Oh, shit. The man who answered was wonderfully affable. It did not. But I did not. I could not. That is not, however, why I wanted to talk to her about my newly acquired propensity for losing things. My family members, otherwise a fairly similar bunch, are curiously divided down the middle in this respect. My mother and I, meanwhile, are busy organizing it by size and color. why I called her when I started uncharacteristically misplacing stuff myself. For one thing, I thought she might commiserate. For another, I thought she might help; given her extensive experience with losing things, I figured she must have developed a compensatory capacity for finding them. Once I recovered my phone and reached her, however, both hopes vanished as completely as the bike lock. The same basic dynamic applies to the countless Web sites devoted to recovering lost pets, which are largely useless when it comes to your missing Lab mix but surprisingly helpful when it comes to your missing ball python. tricks, while helpful, have their limitations. Then, there is the issue of passwords, which are to computers what socks are to washing machines. Data from one insurance-company survey suggest that the average person misplaces up to nine objects a day, which means that, by the time we turn sixty, we will have lost up to two hundred thousand things. explanations go, the scientific one is persuasive but uninteresting. It sheds no light on how it feels to lose something, and provides only the most abstract and impractical notion of how not to do so. Maybe the doting mother who lost her toddler at the mall was secretly fed up with the demands of motherhood. Maybe my sister loses her wallet so often owing to a deep-seated discomfort with capitalism. Freud would stand by such propositions, and no doubt some losses really are occasioned by subconscious emotion, or at least can be convincingly explained that way after the fact. But experience tells us that such cases are unusual, if they exist at all. The better explanation, most of the time, is simply that life is complicated and minds are limited. Although that book is ultimately concerned with far more serious losses, Smith pauses midway through to describe the experience of losing a beloved black coat that a friend gave her, off his own back, on her fifty-seventh birthday. we lose something, our first reaction, naturally enough, is to want to know where it is. Such questions matter because they can help direct our search. You will act differently if you think you left your coat in a taxi or believe you boxed it up and put it in the basement. Just as important, the answers can provide us with that much coveted condition known as closure. This is how a problem with an object turns into a problem with a person. possibility, considerably less likely but equally self-sparing, is that your missing object engineered its own vanishing, alone or in conjunction with other occult forces. Such explanations are more common than you might think. In the micro-drama of loss, in other words, we are nearly always both villain and victim. That goes some way toward explaining why people often say that losing things drives them crazy. At best, our failure to locate something that we ourselves last handled suggests that our memory is shot; at worst, it calls into question the very nature and continuity of selfhood. entanglement becomes more fraught as we grow older. Beyond a certain age, every act of losing gets subjected to an extra layer of scrutiny, in case what you have actually lost is your mind. wonder losing things, even trivial things, can be so upsetting. the face of it, such losses fit in poorly with lesser ones. It is one thing to lose a wedding ring, something else entirely to lose a spouse. With objects, loss implies the possibility of recovery; in theory, at least, nearly every missing possession can be restored to its owner. With people, by contrast, loss is not a transitional state but a terminal one. Outside of an afterlife, for those who believe in one, it leaves us with nothing to hope for and nothing to do. father, in addition to being scatterbrained and mismatched and menschy and brilliant, is dead. I lost him, as we say, in the third week of September, just before the autumn equinox. Since then, the days have darkened, and I, too, have been lost: adrift, disoriented, absent. For nearly a decade, his health had been poor, almost impressively so. In addition to suffering from many of the usual complaints of contemporary aging (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, kidney disease, congestive heart failure), he had endured illnesses unusual for any age and era: viral meningitis, West Nile encephalitis, an autoimmune disorder whose identity evaded the best doctors at the Cleveland Clinic. From there, the list spread outward in all directions of physiology and severity. He had fallen and torn a rotator cuff beyond recovery, and obliterated a patellar tendon by missing a step one Fourth of July. His breathing was often labored despite no evident respiratory problem; an errant nerve in his neck sometimes zapped him into temporary near-paralysis. was, in short, a shambles. More to the point, against considerable odds, he just kept on being alive. Intellectually, I knew that no one could manage such a serious disease burden forever. a result, I was not overly alarmed when my mother called one morning toward the end of the summer to say that my father had been hospitalized with a bout of atrial fibrillation. Nor was I surprised, when my partner and I got to town that night, to learn that his heart rhythm had stabilized. The doctors were keeping him in the hospital chiefly for observation, they told us, and also because his white-bloodcell count was mysteriously high. was on a Wednesday. Over the next two days, the garrulousness declined into incoherence; then, on Saturday, my father lapsed into unresponsiveness. Somewhere below his silence lurked six languages, the result of being born in Tel Aviv to parents who had fled pogroms in Poland, relocating at age seven to Germany (an unusual reverse exodus for a family of Jews in 1948, precipitated by limited travel options and violence in what was then still Palestine), and arriving in the United States, on a refugee visa, at the age of twelve. English, French, German, Polish, Yiddish, Hebrew: of these, my father acquired the first one last, and spoke it with Nabokovian fluency and panache. During the years of medical crises, I had seen my father racked and raving with fever. I had seen him in a dozen kinds of pain. I had seen him cast about in a mind temporarily compromised by illness and catch only strange, dark, pelagic creatures, unknown and fearsome to the rest of us. In all that time, under all those varied conditions, I had never known him to lack for words. But now, for five days, he held his silence. On the sixth, he lurched back into sound, but not into himself; there followed an awful night of struggle and agitation. His last voluntary movement, which he retained almost until the end, was the ability to kiss my mother. Whenever she leaned in close to brush his lips, he puckered up and returned the same brief, adoring gesture that I had seen all my days. I had always regarded my family as close, so it was startling to realize how much closer we could get, how near we drew around his dying flame. The room we were in was a cube of white, lit up like the aisle of a grocery store, yet in my memory that night is as dark and vibrant as a Rembrandt painting. We talked only of love; there was nothing else to say. My father, mute but alert, looked from one face to the next as we spoke, eyes shining with tears. I had always dreaded seeing him cry, and rarely did, but for once I was grateful. Still, the cave is a cave. We had by then spent two vertiginous, elongated, atemporal weeks in the I.C.U. At no point during that time did we have a diagnosis, still less a prognosis. At every point, we were besieged with new possibilities, new tests, new doctors, new hopes, new fears. Every night, we arrived home exhausted, many hours past dark, and talked through what had happened, as if doing so might guide us through the following day. we decided that my father would not recover, and so, instead of continuing to try to stave off death, we unbarred the door and began to wait. To my surprise, I found it comforting to be with him during that time, to sit by his side and hold his hand and watch his chest rise and fall with a familiar little riffle of snore. I thought, as it turns out mistakenly, that what I was doing during those days was making my peace with his death. She looked bereft, beautiful, unimaginably calm. He did not yet look dead. He looked like my father. I could not stop picturing the way he used to push his glasses up onto his forehead to read. Three weeks after my father died, so did another family member, of cancer. a dysfunctional form of love, which to some extent it is, grief has no boundaries; seldom this fall could I distinguish my distress over these later losses from my sadness about my father. I had maintained my composure during his memorial service, even while delivering the eulogy. But when, at the second funeral, the son of the deceased stood up to speak, I wept. The morning after the election, I cried again, missing my refugee father, missing the future I had thought would unfold. weeks, I slogged on like this, through waves of actual and anticipatory grief. I had lost, along with everything else, all motivation; day after day, I did as close as humanly possible to nothing. In part, this was because I dreaded getting farther away from the time when my father was still alive. Although I had spent a decade worrying about losing my father, I had never once thought about what would come next. I found some consolation in poetry, but otherwise, for the first time in my life, I did not care to read. I stretched out for as long as I could the small acts that felt easy and right (calling my mother and my sister, curling up with my partner, playing with the cats), but these alone could not occupy the days. Some days, I merely said to myself that I wanted to get out of the house; other days, I set about searching for him as deliberately as one would go look for a missing glove. Because I find peace and clarity in nature, I did this searching outdoors, sometimes while walking, sometimes while out on a run. I did not expect, of course, that along the way I would encounter my father again in his physical form. (This, too, turns out to be common among the grieving. experiences, to be clear, do not comport with my understanding of death. first time, I turned around after five minutes; I have seldom tried anything that felt so futile. After he lost his wife, C. S. Lewis, who had likewise previously felt the dead to be near at hand, looked up at the night sky and, to his dismay, knew that he would never find her anywhere. do I feel about my father. I try to sense some intimation of his presence and feel nothing. Grieving him is like holding one of those homemade tin-can telephones with no tin can on the other end of the string. that turns out not to be true. It comes from an Old English word meaning to perish, which comes from a still more ancient word meaning to separate or cut apart. In the sixteenth century, we began to lose our minds; in the seventeenth century, our hearts. The circle of what we can lose, in other words, began with our own lives and one another and has been steadily expanding ever since. yet, if anything, our problem is not that we put too many things into the category of loss but that we leave too many out. In it, Walt Whitman leans against the railing of a ship, exalting in all he sees. just like that, my sense of loss suddenly revealed itself as terribly narrow. What I miss about my father, as much as anything, is life as it looked filtered through him, held up and considered against his inner lights. When we are experiencing it, loss often feels like an anomaly, a disruption in the usual order of things. Entropy, mortality, extinction: the entire plan of the universe consists of losing, and life amounts to a reverse savings account in which we are eventually robbed of everything. precious little solace for this, and zero redress; we will lose everything we love in the end. By definition, we do not live in the end: we live all along the way. You meet a stranger passing through your town and know within days you will marry her. You lose your job at fifty-five and shock yourself by finding a new calling ten years later. You have a thought and find the words. No matter what goes missing, the wallet or the father, the lessons are the same. Disappearance reminds us to notice, transience to cherish, fragility to defend. Loss is a kind of external conscience, urging us to make better use of our finite days. As Whitman knew, our brief crossing is best spent attending to all that we see: honoring what we find noble, denouncing what we cannot abide, recognizing that we are inseparably connected to all of it, including what is not yet upon us, including what is already gone.

Sometimes he looks like a graceful queen, as he sits, poised, his back erect with grand indulgence or tolerance or love. His expressive hands cut through the air during this or that interview, speaking a wordless language of their own, as the former boy preacher from Harlem, small, dark, and compact, talks and talks about race, sounding like no one else on earth. One of the chief pleasures of the movie is watching Baldwin, who died in 1987, appear on talk shows and in public forums: he had an extraordinary physical presence, of a piece with his singular mind. Then, as a blues tune plays, Peck, rather predictably, cuts to still photographs of recent demonstrations: blood and rage in Ferguson, Baltimore, and elsewhere. He saw, on the front page of a newspaper, a photograph of Dorothy Counts, the fifteen-year-old daughter of a professor of theology and philosophy and the first black student admitted to Harry Harding High School, in Charlotte, under the Pearsall Plan to Save Our Schools. was harassed and stoned, and she withdrew from the school after four days. Moviegoing began as a family affair; Baldwin shared its pleasures with his mother or an aunt. and took me to see plays and films, plays and films to which no one else would have dreamed of taking a ten-year-old boy. decade ago, as an undergraduate, my colleagues and I spent hours poring over the works of James Baldwin. but the event does not call for rejoicing. In fact it brings forth not a little pain, for this work teems with a passion that is all reflex, and an anger that is unfocused and almost cynical. It is as if Baldwin were wound up and then let loose to attack the hypocritical core of this nation. frustration is, by necessity, personal. From the beginning of his career, Baldwin longed to make movies. To my knowledge, Baldwin never satisfied that desire (morbid, perhaps, because he knew of the herculean effort that goes into getting any movie made), but he never stopped yearning to be a filmmaker. Baldwin and Avedon had worked together on their high-school newspaper and stayed in touch. This may be the only way to watch TV. I certainly saw some remarkable sights. was able to create images while describing them. He eventually walked away from the project, and twenty years later the subject was still considered so difficult to represent on film that Spike Lee had to fight for the right to do so: a white director, Norman Jewison, was originally chosen for the project. Because he has remained such a star in the firmament of black arts and letters, there is almost no way for an admirer not to vie with his legend. His first experience of kindness, outside his family, was with his white teacher Bill. Later, at DeWitt Clinton High School, in the Bronx, where some white boys mocked his teen-age evangelism, there were others, such as Avedon and the writer Emile Capouya, who defended him. Avedon once told me that, when they were in school, Baldwin had come to visit him at home and been instructed by the doorman to use the back entrance. was Capouya who pushed Baldwin to leave the church, since he no longer believed in it. leaving the church and letting white friends love him, Baldwin separated himself from his stepfather (the only father he had) and gained access to a kind of power that his stepfather would never know. He found other fathers. In it, Baldwin smokes his ever-present Bette Davis cigarette and takes America to task for its wrongs and its failures. But I can see now that I am trying to produce my own movie. He was awarded a Guggenheim for creative writing in 2000 and the George Jean Nathan Award for Dramatic Criticism for 2002-03.

We have, in other words, surpassed peak speakeasy. Where there was light, there is inky, elegant darkness. Where there was bright chatter, there are jazz records spun at a volume that underpins conversation without overtaking it. That fascination pervades Karasu, where even a whiskey neat is crafted with a many-stepped ritual. In quiet moments, a bartender may walk you out after you settle up. Even if your order is simply a can of Orion beer, the bartender carefully turns the label to face you. So, the logic goes, one must endeavor to make every interaction last. Later that evening, a patron stepped out into the falling snow only to hear someone calling her name. It was Cisneros, dashing onto the sidewalk. We fixate on its virtues and faults, as though the subway lines were our children. We want so much for them, and yet they so often disappoint. When their latest report cards arrived, just after Christmas, the top grades went to the 1 line, the 7, and the L. The goats were the 5 and the A. The A train at least has an anthem, and the vestigial grandeur of connecting old Harlem to Bed-Stuy. Along with the 4, it provides express service up and down Lexington Avenue. It also provides the routine rush-hour humiliation of getting stalled between stations as the 6, the Lexington Avenue local, rattles past on a parallel track. subway-line rankings, based on such categories as cleanliness, crowding, and frequency of service, come from the Straphangers Campaign, a project underwritten by the New York Public Interest Research Group. Straphangers also issues year-end top-ten worst and best lists. By its lights, the tenth worst public-transportation event in 2016 was the release, by a performance artist aboard the D train, of a box of live crickets, which caused another passenger to pull the emergency brake, stranding the train for half an hour on the Manhattan Bridge. The ten-best list was perhaps harder to pull together, there being a shallower pool. Hats off to more Wi-Fi service and countdown clocks, and a fleet of newly designed cars. It is the biggest addition to the New York City subway system in several generations. this Second Avenue subway is just a stunted version of the one that was originally envisaged. This is the terminus of Phase I. As for Phases III and IV, which would extend the line downtown, to lower Manhattan, those are probably decades away. Here, for our delectation, was an unlikely gleaming specimen, a municipal unicorn. first morning of 2017, a crowd of citizens gathered at the station entrance on the southwest corner of Ninety-sixth Street and Second Avenue. Just before noon, Governor Andrew Cuomo, who in recent months had made its completion an obsession and a point of pride, spoke briefly, and then the barricades came down, a cheer went up, and the crowd, phones aloft, streamed onto an escalator and a stairway. Downstairs, transit workers waved them through the turnstiles (a free ride, no less) and down one more flight to an immaculate platform and a waiting train, which was not itself new but which was covered, inside and out, with art work and advertising celebrating the new line. The mood aboard was giddy, too. crowd was waiting to board at Eighty-sixth Street, and then at Seventy-second Street. Nonetheless, many passengers got off at Sixty-third Street to have a look around the new platform and then ride the next Q back uptown. Those boarding a car in the middle of the train encountered a transient passed out across the seats, a coat over his head and, on the floor next to him, a mess of chicken and rice spilling from a partially crushed Styrofoam clamshell. Ten minutes in, and the city had asserted itself. He got on in midtown. The stations, in caverns deep below the surface, are vast and airy, with spacious mezzanines and high ceilings. One could linger over the clean, rat-free track bed or a drain grate reminiscent of a coat of arms. Wi-Fi, climate control, an uncharacteristic hush. Each station has a permanent installation of mosaics or ceramic tile work by a prominent artist. The art, no way around it, is beautiful, accessible, and indigenous, especially the giant Chuck Close mosaics of New York artists like Lou Reed, Cindy Sherman, and Philip Glass (and himself) and the life-size Vik Muniz mosaics of regular New Yorkers (and himself). well-represented constituency, not much interested in the art, were the train buffs. Metrophiles clustered by the openings to the tunnels and filmed the trains coming in. As passengers, they tended to congregate in the front car. He had a photographic memory, he said, and, to prove it, recited all the stops on the Q line. This is the term for a fork in the track, with the alternative branch a dead end. It was an intimation of Phase III, there for whatever distant day when the line would continue south along Second Avenue rather than turning west. Still, he found a lot to like: the deep cut, the quiet ride, the station design, which reminded him of the E, though, truth be told, he was a little put off by the new typeface, a kind of squished-together, overlapping version of the old Helvetica. were railfan families.

City-built but leased to private enterprise, the system grew fast, and then more or less stopped growing before the Second World War began, when the city took control. We all know about the seventies: the system went to pieces, ridership and revenue plunged, and the Warriors came out to play. In the nineties, boom times, better governance and policing, new equipment, and the introduction of the MetroCard reversed the trend. Lucius Riccio, a former transportation commissioner, told me that New York will need a new subway line every ten years for the next hundred years just to keep up. prophecies, and talk of a Second Avenue panacea, go back a century. In 1920, a city engineer named Daniel L. Turner proposed a citywide rail expansion, which came to include a six-track subway under Second Avenue from the Bronx to lower Manhattan. Gradually, indeed: a modified version of the plan, approved in 1929, was quickly undone by the Depression, and then by the war. In 1965, as the era of Robert Moses and his car-centric building schemes wound down, Governor Nelson Rockefeller created the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority. Mayor John Lindsay supported the so-called Program for Action, or the Grand Design, an ambitious regional rail plan, conceived by the M.T.A., which imagined an array of new subway lines, including forty miles of new track in Queens and the revival of the Second Avenue idea. This iteration would run from the Bronx to the Battery, and be ready to roll by 1982. Phase I would cost two hundred and twenty million dollars. Construction commenced on three tunnel segments in 1972 but was soon halted, because of the fiscal crisis. Second Avenue subway persisted, like a fungus. Governor George Pataki took it up in the nineties, pushing for the so-called East Side Access project. (East Side Access, our Big Dig, is made up of a new East River tunnel and a new subterminal at Grand Central to allow the Long Island Rail Road, which terminates at Penn Station, access to the East Side. Transportation planners knew that an L.I.R.R. station would add even more riders to the Lexington line. This was hard to do. The M.T.A. built half-block-long muck houses to contain the debris and the fumes from the dynamite blasts, and the spoils as they were loaded onto supertrucks and borne away from Manhattan. a courtly civil engineer who was born in Romania and later fought with the Israeli Army in the Six-Day War, took up the cause of community relations. He became something of a Second Avenue subway celebrity, known to all as Michael H., a bow tie among the hardhats and the lapel pins. The four-hundred-and-eighty-five-ton tunnel-boring machine was named after his granddaughter, Adi. Ninety-sixth Street station, situated in shallower ground, was cut and cover. The ground in a tunnel section just south of it was too soft for the boring machine, which was engineered for schist, so to solidify the ground the engineers had to freeze it, which they did by drilling holes and inserting a web of more than a hundred refrigeration tubes, averaging around seventy feet long. This took four or five months. contortions came at a steep price. Phase II, though shorter in distance and with the advantage of some tunnel segments left over from the false start in the seventies, has been projected to cost even more: six billion dollars. There are many culprits: population density, the nature of the schist, the desire to appease the neighbors, the size of the stations, which the M.T.A. attributes to ever more stringent fire and safety regulations. You could write a treatise on the convoluted inanities and inefficiencies of state-run construction projects. In this one, for example, each station had a different contractor, who in turn, and often obliviously, tapped the same subcontractors and suppliers, leading to shortages, logistical headaches, and, yes, delays. One imagines cheaper options. Benjamin Kabak, the author of the blog Second Ave. distances himself from the outlay, if not the goods. These are legitimate questions. The Second Avenue subway has a very austere construction. Only thing you can point to as extravagant is the public art. The hands-on approach can have other, hidden costs. By this past fall, Cuomo was holding weekly meetings with contractors and subs. It was the complexity of integrating various computerized systems in the stations, and the vexing nature of vertical transportation: that is, the elevators and escalators. The Governor, in weekly meetings, went around the room grilling the vertical-transportation contractors. This fall, it came to light that someone had forgotten to order a required elevator-safety device called a shunt trip breaker. He casts himself not only as a bulwark of progressivism in the age of Trump but also as a master builder, in the tradition of Robert Moses. He has some big projects under way (a new Tappan Zee Bridge, a new Penn Station, a new LaGuardia Airport, the East Side Access) and some others in mind (a new J.F.K., a freight tunnel under New York Harbor), any one of which, some speculate, might one day bear the name of his father, if not the son. The authorities, the infrastructure entities initially devised to transcend politics, spread accountability so thin that the elected officials who stack them with appointees get to bob and weave. When an L.I.R.R. train derailed last month while entering a station in Brooklyn, it was almost comical to watch Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio try to outmaneuver each other for political advantage. Though fellow Democrats and Clintonites, they have nevertheless carried on a long-running feud that can only partly be explained by customary tensions between city and state. It was hard to see much beyond personal pique that led them (and their staffs) to squabble in December over the jurisdiction of a stray deer that turned up in a Harlem housing project. had to wonder if one of the reasons Cuomo spent so much time peacocking on Second Avenue was to stick it to de Blasio in his own back yard. Technically, the state runs the subways, so his deferral to Cuomo makes sense in terms of structure, if not exposure. The Mayor has so far declined to work the Q into his commute to City Hall. This is in large part because he chooses to travel most mornings by chauffeured S.U.V., under police escort, from the Upper East Side to the Y.M.C.A. in his old neighborhood of Park Slope, Brooklyn, in order to work out. Afterward, he is driven back across the East River to City Hall. His exercise regimen is reportedly a half hour on a stationary bike. The geographical illogic smarts. It will be interesting to see if these other neighborhoods get the same consideration, when it comes time to cut and cover, or shoot and blast. The line went where the people were. By the end of January, it was taking on a hundred and fifty-five thousand riders a day. It not only follows density; it creates it. One of the main rationales for expanding subway lines is to foster economic development, which, really, means new and bigger buildings. This is why the Second Avenue subway has always been popular with real-estate developers and construction unions. Certain portions of the route are maximized, more or less, but the upper end, near the current terminus at Ninety-sixth Street, is still in flux. an odd, semi-gentrified corner of the city, a mix of giant apartment towers and older tenements. Barack Obama lived in a drug-infested tenement on Ninety-fourth Street between First and Second when he attended Columbia, in the early eighties. Just to the west of the station is Normandie Court, a block-square apartment megalith of some three dozen stories, once known as Dormandie Court, for the postcollegiate settlers who keg-partied there, during the great yuppie migration of the eighties and nineties. Monday morning, a little before nine, TV-news trucks were parked there, in pursuit of reactions to the mosque shooting in Quebec. Pedestrians, paying little mind, flowed toward the Q, a fresh tributary of the old familiar flow to Lex. On Track 2, a train was slowly filling up: seats for all. L.E.D. signs indicated that the time between departures, known as the headway, was eight minutes. No more exultation: New Yorkers on a workday, amid crappy news, their own meshugaas, and the doldrums of winter. By Seventy-second Street, the train was full, though not sardinishly so, in the manner of the Lexington line. It was just another train, neither new nor old. People got on and off. Nothing moved. From 2000 to 2005, he was the deputy editor of The Talk of the Town, to which he regularly contributes. is good news, since the X-Men, a byzantine superhero mythology that launched, in 1963, as a comic-book series, has always intimidated me. All we know is that they are beautiful, the colors and shapes treated as visual rhymes. The first season of that series was visually dazzling but ultimately nihilistic, an exercise in hollow machismo; the second season was original and ambitious, a darkly funny exploration of domestic evil. When FX asked him to adapt a Marvel property, he selected Legion, a character so disturbing that, in 1991, one of the X-Men comic-book writers refused to write him in, judging him too dysfunctional for the team. Hawley finds contemporary ways to explore ancient, potentially hokey ideas, particularly the notion that sanity and madness are not that far apart. such stories are about solidarity, about finding the people with whom one might team up to fight fascism or evil. But these mythologies are equally about the craving to be healed. This is true whether you are a naturally gifted orphan whose parents were killed by Voldemort or a homeless assassin who used to drill people to death for SD-6. But the woodland facility is also run by psychiatrists, just a more benign set. But tactically the order has a lot in common with more day-to-day policies, especially his plan to slash federal spending. Both rely on scapegoats (immigrants, on the one hand; on the other, things like foreign aid and legal assistance for the poor). the campaign, Trump made promises that he has no way of keeping. Right-wing media have claimed that he wants to cut the budgets of executive departments by ten per cent and payrolls by as much as twenty per cent. Kellyanne Conway said that the President would call for converting Medicaid to a block-grant system. Most federal spending is nondiscretionary, meaning that it goes to entitlements (such as Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance) and to pay the interest on the national debt. for Trump, most voters have no real idea how the government spends its money, and plenty of his supporters believe that you can balance the budget by just hiring fewer people, making government more efficient, and getting rid of the odd department. For decades, the G.O.P. and right-wing media have been saying that the government is riddled with fraud and wastes money on handouts. on Tuesday, February 20, 1962, John F. Kennedy was on the phone congratulating John Glenn, who had just completed three orbits of Earth. boy had been seriously ill, probably from typhoid fever, for more than two weeks. On the evening of February 5th, the Lincolns had shuttled between his upstairs sickbed and the East Room. Signs of improvement several days later engendered only false hope. After his death, both mother and father tended to view him as having been a sort of extraterrestrial visitor. The novel that has resulted is anything but a quiet tableau. premise of the book is like many that give rise to historical fiction: intriguing and a little shaky. A printer with an enormous penis, he was, back in the eighteen-forties, just beginning to experience the joy of bedding his much younger wife when a ceiling beam fell and killed him. during this extramural errand do Vollman and Bevins realize that Lincoln is the President, five or six chief executives after Tyler and Polk, the incumbents they remember. A number of authentic-feeling ringers have also been mixed in. The first is essentially a spy yarn involving a Virginia slaveholder and Confederate agent named Miss Ford, who manages to insinuate herself into the Lincoln White House and then fall in love with the President. Cross-dressing, racial disguise, and suicide reduce Fort Sumter and Bull Run to minor matters. An invented character, the poet Cage Weatherby, serves as a sort of Nick Carraway to a rising and rather slippery Lincoln during his early days in New Salem and Springfield. By deciding not to get too close, Harrigan effects a tentative advance toward greater, if still speculative, understanding. The shrewd, careful talker he presents, ethically ambiguous but credibly breathing, feels very much an extension of the epistolary Lincoln. In that novel, the crucial points of view radiate from apostles and antagonists instead of Lincoln himself. Keckley pushed a chair in place so that Lincoln might sit. As he lowered himself into the chair, Hay saw that the tears had begun to flow down leathery cheeks that looked as if they had never before known such moisture. And yet it is a mistake. You are sure to be happy again. To know this, which is certainly true, will make you some less miserable now. Go ahead. historical evidence for such cause and effect is debatable. But Saunders is giving us an imaginative truth in keeping with a number of startling and benevolent short stories he has written, ones that end with characters reaching a low point and then pulling themselves back up. They had a lot to catch up on. The Trump era, just eleven days old, had thrown the Gelernts into the highest-profile litigation of their careers. But at ten that night Lee got a text: a few Iraqis were being held at J.F.K. and threatened with deportation. coming. The A.C.L.U. agreed to co-counsel the case. Their father, Irwin Gelernt, a surgeon at Mount Sinai, died in 1996. Their mother, Lois, recently retired, was a teacher and administrator at the Manhattan Country School, which she helped found, in 1966, and which the Gelernt children attended. checked his phone for an e-mail from the Department of Justice, which had promised to send a list of everyone who was still detained. A week later, her brother Lee argued with the A.C.L.U. A week later, her brother Lee argued with the A.C.L.U. A week later, her brother Lee argued with the A.C.L.U. Page very much admired the American authors whose work she gave voice to through her imagination. He was awarded a Guggenheim for creative writing in 2000 and the George Jean Nathan Award for Dramatic Criticism for 2002-03. Gooch narrates their friendship as a love story gone awry: Rumi releases his most uninhibited poetic self only after Shams disappears. In this memoir of the fifties and sixties, a biographer of Hollywood stars recounts her early life as a Broadway and film actress. Although she comes across as a fiercely ambitious and restless young woman, she emphasizes the role of luck, good and bad; she won a movie role as a nun on the strength of a photo, but had to prepare for the part while recovering from a black-market abortion. Full of archaisms, the language has a neo-Nabokovian extravagance, occasionally overindulgent. Whether they wield real power is a different question. Julia Hahn, the twenty-five-year-old Breitbart News reporter who has just been named a special assistant to the President, could be a test case. She excelled at mock trial, and organized a fund-raiser to bring orphan children from other countries to live with American host families. She majored in philosophy at the University of Chicago and studied in Paris. At around this time, a Chicago classmate who worked at a think tank saw Hahn at a party; Hahn said that she was a producer for Laura Ingraham, a fixture of far-right talk radio. I thought, O.K., there are two possibilities. Hahn and Sims remain close, though they often disagree. Once upon a time, the quaint bend in this serpentine alley (previously known, unsubtly, as the Blood Angle) abetted all manner of ambushes and skullduggery during gang warfare. Tuxedo is in a former opera house, and a certain theatrical allure extends to the parade of well-heeled patrons who glide into its dim, capacious parlor. unassumingly named crispy eggplant plumbs the depths of the Sichuanese classic eggplant with garlic sauce, and delivers a delectable original, fried to a flavorful crunch and tossed to a glistening plum gold in a peanut-soy-garlic caramel. The best dumplings on the menu are called raviolis, but are actually enveloped in translucent wonton skins. are scarce in most East Asian cuisines, but here the roasted-duck-and-Chinese-celery dish is a knockout. Still inventive but less inspired is the mapo lo mein, a cross between the Sichuanese staple mapo tofu and spaghetti Bolognese: a tad too salty without the complex heat of a traditional mapo. The baby bass, the second-most-expensive item on offer, is more perfunctory than memorable. Not every dish that upends expectations can exceed them. At Tuxedo, at least, the past is distilled well (and often) enough on the plate that it pays to take a chance on its latest iteration. The expat retains an identity as he retains his citizenship, his privileges; the refugee loses his identity amid the anonymity of many others like him. Born in 1971, he is, by self-description, the son of Vietnamese refugees, and he has been a refugee himself; he has married a refugee, a fellow-writer named Lan Duong. And so his peripheral status confers certain advantages, for he is in a position to see what others do not. Perhaps not surprisingly, I am also a man of two minds. I am not some misunderstood mutant from a comic book or a horror movie, although some have treated me as such. I am simply able to see any issue from both sides. existence, to the death-haunted, is populated by ghosts. These are not ideas of ghosts, or poetic metaphors. These are ghosts who leave behind damp carpets and the brine-soaked clothing in which, twenty-five years before, they drowned while escaping a war-torn homeland. They are family ghosts: a fifteen-year-old boy, for instance, who had traded his life to save a sister threatened with kidnapping and rape by pirates. there was a reporter who said the government tortured the people in prison. Although the professor comes to realize that his mind is going, his memories of the mysterious Yen become obsessive. Today she insisted I call her by another name. She would read with measured breath, to the very end. His characters are emotional convalescents, groping their way to an understanding of their woundedness. you were, of course, could be a matter of context. Her visit is a grand occasion for the family. Nguyen leaves us with a harrowing vision of the sprawling tragedies of wartime, and of the moral duplicities of which we are capable. In native parlance, the word denotes Manhattan below Fourteenth Street. cause was the burning new significance, for the art world, of uptown. The Abstract Expressionists had burst upon fame and fortune in galleries there. Paintings barely dry were trucked up the avenues. Money and gossip flowed down. is most compelling is the vicarious sense of judgments made on the fly, according to the standard that shapes any art scene not distorted by marketing: the esteem of peers. Each cluster of works represents an ephemeral gang, with an alpha, a beta, and members embraced or, at least, tolerated by their associates. To peruse them is to imagine the smoky air and enthused or barbed repartee at clannish openings, which of course still occur (with less smoke) in nether and outer reaches of the city. For Ruth Williams (Rosamund Pike) and Seretse Khama (David Oyelowo), the sighting occurs in London, in 1947. That must never, if humanly possible, be that, according to plenty of people in Britain and elsewhere. He has been studying in England in preparation for a return to his homeland, there to assume his regal duties. A mixed-race royal marriage, just across the border, would not merely enrage the South Africans but might inspire them to annex the country, upon which they have always harbored designs. It is one of those films which are more beguiling to ponder in retrospect, perhaps, than to watch at the time. Though a typical African in build and features, he has assimilated, to a great extent, the manners and thoughts of an Oxford undergraduate. He speaks English well and is obviously quick to appreciate, even if he may not agree with, the European point of view. I had my doubts early on. Well, the new film confirms that Oyelowo is one of those rare actors who can unleash a formal speech before a crowd, fortissimo, without seeming hammy or haranguing. Quite delightful. The setting is an unregarded nook of northern Europe, in May, 1945. The German occupiers, anticipating invasion, laid more than two million land mines on the west coast of Denmark. Now that the country has been freed by the Allies, moral logic (and simple practicality) demands that the defeated forces should be the ones to unearth the mines and defuse them. The movie narrows its focus to a dozen or so weary German prisoners, most of them teen-agers, tossed into the front line in the dying months of the conflict. historical reasons unexplained in the film, Rasmussen wears the uniform and cap of the British Parachute Regiment; by a loyal coincidence, he also resembles Field Marshal Montgomery, who led the liberating troops into Denmark. Rasmussen begins the film in an unmilitary fury, assailing the enemy with the wildness of an animal newly released from its cage. Slowly, as he gets to know his youthful squad, his wrath recedes. Their task, after all, is a perilous one: to make safe a strand of coastline, where forty-five thousand mines lie buried. The sand must be probed with metal rods. viewers may have to watch this through their fingers, although it must be said that, as time crawls by, you start to foresee the unforeseen. Even a hair trigger can become predictable. Nor is Zandvliet a master of character; as individuals, the Germans make scant impression, aside from a pair of supposedly inseparable twins, played by Emil and Oskar Belton, and Sebastian (Louis Hofmann), the decent conscience of the group. You might expect that one of them, at least, would bear a lingering trace of Nazi defiance, but no. Caspar David Friedrich once painted a similar seascape, with a monk gazing oceanward and contemplating the infinite. In 2001, his reviews received the National Magazine Award for Reviews and Criticism. A family friend, Mrs. Krakow, says that she lost more than twenty family members in the Holocaust. Frankel admits that, as a German child, he looked longingly at a parade of Brown Shirts from which he was, of course, excluded. Some cite deference to authority as the reason that many Jews hesitated to leave Germany. Some of the survivors in the Kirchheimer circle remain, at the time of the film, vehemently unforgiving of Germans. Others think that many Germans acted against their will under government pressure, and many interviewees tell of Germans who courageously defied Nazi law to help them. It was just smug, drab stuff.
