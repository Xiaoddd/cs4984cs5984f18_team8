Tom Stromme, TRIBUNE Buy Now City of Bismarck snowplow operator Tim Schiermeister clears Fifth Street of snow on Thursday morning. In the back is a snowblower clearing sidewalks on the state Capitol grounds. Snowplow crews do four sweeps of the streets on average, giving them 1,400 miles to clean. Reflecting Bismarck-Mandan's unprecedented growth in both population and borders, snowstorm cleanup and street upkeep costs have spiked. Four more staff members were also added to Heintz's department over the last decade, bringing the total to 34 people to maintain roads and streets. The figure includes year-round expenses for the department, including non-snow upkeep. Even with a flurry of winter storms bringing 43.5 inches of snow to the area, Heintz said he has not exceeded the 2016 street maintenance budget and doesn't expect to. Mandan is another story. City Administrator Jim Neubauer said the city has nearly used up its 2016 street maintenance budget and will have to use reserves to keep up with costs. In heavier storms, Bismarck also pulls staff from other departments like forestry and the landfill to help with the cleanup. Three private contractors were hired to provide 10 more front end loaders to move snow as allowed through the city's emergency ordinance clause. Buying more equipment and hiring more staff is not feasible for infrequent large events, Heintz said. There are seven zones to plow throughout the city. Each plow gets a front end loader, motor grader and sander. Each zone involves clearing 200 miles each with multiple sweeps. Heintz said he is gauging at what point more equipment and more staff would be needed. Heintz said, as the city has grown outward, there are drifting problems in the fringe areas, like 43rd Avenue, where the city abuts against more spacious rural developments. To help compensate for this, city planning staff often require commercial developers, including apartment housing, to create vegetative barriers to snow, but these take years to grow. The city also uses snow ridges as barriers to keep the snow from drifting in open areas. Looking to other cities, Fargo has purchased a snow melter, but Heintz said this is not warranted for Bismarck snow cleanup yet. It is more viable for communities that have fewer places to haul snow. It also requires a great deal of fuel and the city would need a larger stormwater capacity to drain the melted snow away. Hauling snow away in order to widen driving lanes will start next week and continue for at least three more weeks, he said Thursday. But the Dec. 25 blizzard has been even more difficult. It's a lot of snow. Plowing this is not normal. Normally, you just drive down the street and plow down with the snow off to the side. Your notification has been saved.
