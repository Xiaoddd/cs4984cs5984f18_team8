It scares me to think that I might have missed this. We get up at dawn. Four hundred people walk slowly in a light snow to the river by the camp. A teacher is talking. His headdress is a crisscrossing of long, narrow feathers. He is of the Havasupai, the people who live by the blue-green waterfalls at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. He calls out across the river. They run around in the mud and ice. There are 80 tribes here. Some say many more. The Earth-force is represented by this river and these eagles and these water protectors. We see the Money-force, standing over there on the bridge, just a couple hundred feet from the edge of long meadow of white tipis along the Cannonball River. Few of us, though, face the police like the freedom-fighters of old. As environmentalists we fall back on soft confrontation dominated by data. Data is bloodless. Lobbying, position papers, endless graphics and electronic petitions might as well be abandoned in the age of Trump. Evidence points to the need for a quasi-religious transformation of cultural values. I think of Wangari Maathai and her billion trees, Edward Abbey and Earth First and the dreams of freeing western rivers of their dams, Judi Bonds and Larry Gibson in their danger-filled opposition to mountaintop removal coal mining. The transformation of Standing Rock needs to be carried to many towns and cities. Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter and Standing Rock. Here is where activists cared for each other and shared food, clothing and medicine. The force that upsets entrenched power the most is this compassionate living, this community in plain sight. We must face the Devil. It is life and death. And living actively in a time of life and death must be a spiritual act.
