View this email in your browser Last night the police and National Guard violently attacked peaceful water protectors at Standing Rock. Police used tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper spray, sound grenades, and sprayed them with water cannons in subfreezing conditions, hundreds of people were injured. Our solidarity efforts are needed now more than ever. The financial footing of the Dakota Access Pipeline is in jeopardy if they do not complete the project by January 1st. If this deadline is missed, a majority of the stakeholders with contracts to ship oil through the pipeline will be able to renegotiate or cancel their contracts. This could be devastating to Energy Transfer Partners and the other pipeline companies behind DAPL. Solidarity actions are having a measurable impact and Dakota Access is facing a major deadline. With its vulnerabilities exposed, our solidarity efforts are needed now more than ever. We are calling for a week of action beginning on November 25th culminating with a Global Day of Action on December 1st. We are asking people to target the banks funding Dakota Access Pipeline and the Sheriff Departments that have been brutalizing peaceful water protectors. Click here to locate a target near you. Please help us spread the word about this Global Day of Action by sharing this meme on Facebook, and retweeting this image. Taking Action Against the Banks We are calling for direct actions, demonstrations and other disruptions targeting the banks behind the pipeline. We also ask that people use this date to close their accounts with these banks. Here is a guide on how to close and switch your bank account. This means that there is still time for the banks involved in this loan to cut their line of credit. TD Bank and Citi Bank are two of the main banks on this loan, but we need to target all of the lenders involved: If you are organizing a public action, please register it. Find targets in your area using our targets map. Pressure Sheriff Departments to Withdraw from Standing Rock Sheriff Departments and Police Departments from across the Midwest have sent officers to violently attack and suppress Water Protectors. We are calling on these Departments to permanently withdraw their officers from Standing Rock. We looking forward to continuing to build with you and making December 1st a memorable day.
