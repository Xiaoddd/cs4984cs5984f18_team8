Climate change is the biggest threat to life on Earth. When it comes down to it, the environment impacts everyone. Because of the social structure human beings built, the environment discriminates based on class, race, gender, disability, and other identifiers. Having lived in the United States for most of my life, I will focus on environmental health impact in America and what has been done to lessen the effects of climate change. This has global impact, but the environmental injustice within the country must not be ignored. In order to address how climate change has impacted human health, I must clarify what definition of health I choose to analyze climate impact. The environment disproportionately impacts vulnerable communities, but this is not simply based in environmental science. Societal processes responding to environmental incidences affect marginalized groups the greatest. While I will examine the effects of human health in the dimensions of race, gender, and disability discrimination, all identities are connected and disproportionate impact based on one identity affects impact based on another. Indigenous people and minorities are more likely to be impoverished and, living in rural communities, have less access to education and health services. Disabled people within these communities are likely to be more impoverished than able-bodied members. Based on poverty, access to food, healthcare, and housing, and the violence in their community, minorities are at greater risk of becoming disabled. Indigenous people are the most likely racial group to killed by law enforcement and African Americans are killed at three times the rate of whites. Traditional communities also treat disabled members differently. Some have supportive attitudes toward disability and others prioritize the rights of disabled people after those of able-bodied individuals when it comes to resources. Gender discrimination is worsened by their vulnerability to environmental impact. Women make up more of the global poor population and rely on natural resources more than men because their health is impacted more by food shortage compared to men. Women are regularly ignored in decisions of land accessibility and resource allocation. When women do not have economic and social rights equal to men, women are more likely to die during natural disasters. There were clearly more women than men at the Hurricane Katrina shelters, and this is not only because of their gender role as the main caregivers for children but also because American women are more likely to be impoverished than men. When I discuss communities struggling from environmental racism, women face more challenges because of their personal health and the primary caregiver responsibility they usually take on for their families. Having taken responsibility for managing the household, strategized to deal with environmental change, and actively worked with their communities, women have great expertise to offer when planning for climate change mitigation. Their knowledge is a great asset for handling environmental health effects in a community or family. Lessons from Hurricane Katrina I moved to the United States in 2005. In August of that year, Hurricane Katrina blew through, leaving New Orleans extremely unequipped to handle the costliest natural disaster in American history. My elementary school class collected canned goods and made pillows to support those affected by the hurricane and I had no idea how disparate the experiences of white, middle class residents and low-income African American residents were. Levees were built to regulate the flow of the Mississippi river and flooding from Lake Pontchartrain. These levees redirected toward protective wetlands and caused parts of the city to be below sea level. Any heavy rainfall required a pumping system to avoid flooding and Katrina broke the levees. Housing segregation became prominent in the mid-20th century as more African American families moved to New Orleans. Like in other cities, they were living in the least preferred sections of the city, such as near industrial buildings which pollute the air. Job growth was difficult as residents of the inner city area and they were stuck with poor education options and access to resources. Having little resources and food and no help from the government, those who were most vulnerable during the hurricane were left to fend for themselves and find their own shelter. The structure of cities, such as public transportation and concentrated buildings, does not lend itself easily to a disaster plan. Rebuilding this city to be prepared for extreme natural disasters means providing resources to vulnerable communities, altering the housing system to make evacuation easier, and creating jobs to improve the economy. Some things for African Americans especially have actually gotten worse. The Lower Ninth is more protected against natural disasters by the closing of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet and the surge barrier, but the community is doing worse than before the hurricane. White communities are actually doing better, in contrast, because of good housing development and businesses. New Orleans had one of the oldest public hospitals, Charity, and University Medical Center New Orleans was built ten years after Katrina to replace it. Most of the patients who went to Charity would not be assisted in UMC or any New Orleans hospital because they are all private hospitals today. Federal grant programs were used to support the healthcare of the working poor after the hurricane and they are also being used to start expanding Medicaid in New Orleans. The Greater New Orleans Community Health Connection (GNOCHC) started in July and is providing free health insurance to those slightly above the poverty line and covers primary care and certain lab work. Another issue is that GNOCHC members can only get on to Medicaid if they have a working address, excluding homeless people who require medical and mental health care more than average. Medicaid expansion sets up New Orleans to continue to improve healthcare because the state saves money with more medicaid insured residents and the focus on primary care access could reduce the relatively high rates of diabetes and obesity. However, there is a long way to go and the system must account for the health needs of all residents. African Americans appear to reject mental health care as an option and use alcohol, cigarettes, and illicit drugs to cope. New Orleans organizations are addressing this issue by providing free group support sessions and transportation to sessions so that residents can get the help they need. Disabled people are often ignored in discrimination discourse. The system was not prepared to handle a major hurricane let alone to transport disabled people to safety. RadioLab made a podcast detailing the experience at Memorial Hospital in New Orleans during the hurricane. The power went out, throwing the organization into an emergency situation, with medical professionals struggling to help patients who relied on machines to survive. This prioritization is used in war zone triage, attempting to save the most lives and the most years of life among the patients. The healthiest patients were expected to be discharged soon, after an appendectomy for example. One patient, Emmett Everett, was paralyzed due to a spinal cord stroke and was overweight. He was stable and even fed himself breakfast that morning, but due to his paralysis he was considered one of the sickest patients while expected to live relatively long. Emmett was on a floor with no elevator and it would have required a lot of people and time to get him to a floor that allowed him to be transported out of the hospital. Around 17 of the sickest patients, including Emmett, were injected with morphine or a sedative meant to cause a quick and painless death. If better measures were prepared to quickly transport patients with any sorts of needs, such as ventilators, 45 patients would have had an actual chance of being rescued. Rooted in Rights, a project of Disability Rights Washington, raises awareness about disability rights issues through media. Every human must have access to safety during an emergency and during Hurricane Katrina, many disabled individuals did not have evacuation options. Disability rights advocates brought up how vital it is to access food, medication, communication devices, and transportation to safe spaces where people can stay comfortably during a natural disaster. New York City, among other cities, was sued for neglecting protection of disabled people during tropical storm Irene and Hurricane Sandy, violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. Nonprofits representing two disabled individuals made the lawsuit, and after the ruling, they needed to work with the city to settle on the correct measures to support people with disabilities. The city committed to have resources set up by the summer of 2017 to assess needs of disabled residents, develop high rise evacuation plans, and provide shelters and transportation. These efforts can provide the right to be rescued to all vulnerable communities, including the homeless and the elderly, that previously had no comprehensive system setup to protect them. The Massachusetts Office on Disability (MOD) Personal Emergency Preparedness Program has been receiving positive feedback on the trainings that connect disabled people and local emergency preparedness professionals. People with disabilities learn what they materials and protocols they might need during an environmental emergency. The website provides a few testimonials that show how necessary these measures are because three of them refer to emergencies that people were prepared for thanks to the trainings. Environmental Racism December 14th, 2016 marks the one year anniversary of the Flint, Michigan mayor declaring a state of emergency for the city based on the lead contamination of the drinking water. Donations were plentiful initially and, as with other issues, have dropped with time. Despite the national coverage and government assistance, the water has been unsafe since three years ago, when the Flint water source was switched to Flint River and poor water treatment resulted in damaging the lead pipes. Before the state of emergency declaration, Flint officials assured residents that the water was fine. One woman stated that taking a shower for more than five minutes makes her body feel scaly and itchy. This distrust is warranted, especially because the basis for considering the water safe is testing done on a percentage of high-risk homes. Activist Melissa Mays says she wants all homes tested in order to get solid evidence for the true risks of drinking Flint water. The majority of Flint residents are African American and low-income individuals. The crisis in Flint is a significant problem that arose from how African Americans, latinos, Native Americans, and other minorities are generally treated. African American children have higher rates of asthma because they are more likely to be close to hazardous facilities that release toxins. Flint residents worked together to show how state and city officials are misrepresenting how serious the lead levels still are. Curt Guyette, an investigative reporter, worked with residents to test their lead levels at home with sample kits analyzed at Virginia Tech. Some households had levels as high as 13,200 parts per billion, and the federal lead standard is 15 parts per billion. Some residents are clearly taking charge of their situation and people must continue pushing for additional funding and action to fix the system for good. The Global North refers to developed countries, such as European and North American countries. It is important to include the colonial injustice certain parts of the Global North experience because privileged citizens of developed countries tend to ignore the problems within their country. One of the biggest issues within the US is how colonialism has been harming Native Americans since the arrival of Columbus. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is a particularly relevant example of climate colonialism because of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) construction proposed to go through their land. Over the years, the US has gone against the treaty and reduced the Sioux Reservation land without consultation. This was done mainly in support of extractive industries, which need the land for mining and transporting fossil fuels. More resources on environmental racism, colonialism, and indigenous rights are in the Standing Rock syllabus. They believe their land is necessary for their cultural identity and well-being. In July 2016, DAPL was approved to go along the planned route and within a few weeks, the Standing Rock Sioux sued the Army Corps to withdraw the last permit needed for approval and the Army Corps responded by suing them for blocking construction. At the end of November 2016, the protesters, who call themselves water protectors to focus on their fight for resources, were starting to be violently attacked by dogs and pepper spray. The police later attacked the protectors with water cannons and rubber bullets in freezing weather. After the Army Corps demanded that the water protectors vacate the premise by December 5th, more people directly supported the issue, including the 2,000 U.S. veterans who went to Standing Rock. On December 4th, 2016, the Army Corps denied the easement allowing the pipeline to cross Lake Oahu. The treatment of Native Americans who are working against DAPL is a direct attack on their health. On top of the Army Corps blatantly going against the Fort Laramie Treaty and avoiding the necessary Environmental Impact Statement that would point out the actual negative effect on water supply and environment, the police are using offensive methods that instill fear in and endanger the lives of Native Americans. One woman may need to have her arm amputated after a concussion grenade attack. I am shocked at how the protectors were directly attacked with water, the substance they must preserve, as if the law enforcement were offending their cause even more. Natural resources are weaponized, and it seems that it includes not only fossil fuels but also water. While the pipeline would have endangered the livelihood of tribal members, who depend on their land for basic needs, their attempt to protect their resources is costing them their lives and health today. For more information about local pipeline developments, refer to the Pipelines and Colonialism document for a good introduction. It is meant to provide the climate colonialism background to understand the Algonquin Pipeline Expansion meant to transport fracked gas through New England and certain indigenous land. The pipeline is still being constructed after months of protest. The document also mentions other examples of indigenous communities being disrespected by the fossil fuel industry, such as the now rejected Keystone XL (KXL) pipeline proposed to go through Lakota land and the two coal mines in Navajo land. With an ever-changing political climate, the US government may prevent any permanent protection of native land by possibly approving KXL or DAPL. This lack of stability is clear when considering how other pipelines are being built with little media coverage and communities are left unable stand in opposition with enough power to fight fossil fuel industries. The DAPL water protectors just became successful, at least temporarily, and that came after months of national coverage and thousands of people urging the Army Corps and President Obama to stop construction. Even with Standing Rock avoiding the pipeline, it can still be rerouted and impact other areas. Pipelines spill or break regularly, which is why environmental harm due to pipelines is not simply a risk but a given. Working with communities and learning about local and national activism against pipelines is the best way to hinder the seemingly invincible fossil fuel industry. Climate Activism Katrina, Flint, DAPL and other incidences of environmental racism exemplify the consequences of neglecting to care for vulnerable communities. There may be a temporary win for the people of Standing Rock and Native Americans, but DAPL is already being rerouted through private land in Des Moines on the basis of eminent domain. These events must be discussed and fought for until all residents are cared for. The intersectional impact of climate change demands that people address injustice directly. As other movements have done, environmental movements push people to call or write to legislators to make policy changes in addition to protesting and rallying. These strategies work and KXL and DAPL are recent victories that show the power of insisting on policy change and making our voices heard. Even if they are temporary wins, the resistance to these pipelines and other unjust systems allow people to gain more control over new developments. One major act against climate change and environmental health impact is fossil fuel divestment. Colleges, religious institutions, pension funds, cities, and even countries have campaigns to remove investments in fossil fuel companies because they are actively contributing to CO2 emissions and hindering the essential transition to renewable energy. Because of the direct climate change impact, everyone has a stake in acting against climate change. With Mount Holyoke Climate Justice Coalition, I fight to divest our endowment out of fossil fuel companies. As more and more people stigmatize the industry by choosing to defund the industry because of its unjust practices, the fossil fuel industry loses political, social, and economic power. This will lead to the end of new pipeline infrastructure, an increase in renewable energy usage, and generally better climate action that can keep the global rise in temperature below catastrophic levels. Just as there is no perfect way to begin discussing the impacts of climate change, there is no perfect way to fix every issue caused by the environment. It is often disheartening to fight for causes that are ignored by the public and media. This is why being part of a group working toward the same goals of well-being is essential to making change. Actions evolve as the organizers discuss new ideas and challenge one another. By considering the intersectional impact locally and globally of your particular cause, you can garner support from people focused on other issues and have a greater presence. Contacting legislators is generally manageable to pursue, but to be more directly involved, you have to start building connections and sharing your ideas. Talk to people and share resources about what you are concerned about. Whether it leads to participating in a social justice movement, appealing for a policy change, or understanding the potential of climate change impact on your living situation, you will be supporting the basic need of all humans: health.
