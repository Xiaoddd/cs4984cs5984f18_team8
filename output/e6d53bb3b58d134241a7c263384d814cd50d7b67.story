Bigelow spoke at an afternoon press conference held in the large central dome used as a gathering and meeting hall by protesters in the Oceti Sakowin camp based at the confluence between the Missouri and Cannonball rivers north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. He also doubted the Trump administration would apply punitive action if Energy Transfer Partners defied the Corps and drilled beneath its intended route below the Lake Oahe reservoir on the Missouri River without an easement. A statement from Energy Transfer Partners issued in response to the Corps decision stated the denial will not change its plans and the company will not consider rerouting the pipeline. Earlier Monday, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault said protesters should leave the camps, Reuters reported. Archambault anticipated that no additional construction work would go forward over the winter season and said he would focus efforts on communications with Trump. Volunteers have distributed insulating bales of straw around the camp, though not all of the living spaces are so equipped. Stovepipes rise above most of the bigger tents and propane heaters have become commonplace. To address some of the risk of the heating methods, carbon monoxide detectors are included with the various cold-weather supplies distributed to protestors in the camp. As day turned to night Monday, 40 mph winds and driving snow created white-out conditions. Temperatures are expected to fall into the single digits later this week Glenn Scott, a member of the Chippewa tribe and a native of Wausau, Wis., was among the protesters gathered in the falling snow around noon at the camp's central fire, a site used for ritual and prayer. Scott, a military veteran who served in the Vietnam War era, said he felt drawn to camp from early on but had been spurred to action by the recent call to veterans. He came bearing a staff and eagle feathers in honor of his brother. Wentz's recent struggles can be attributed to many things, but this issue stands above the rest, pundits say Despite the easement denial and the suggestion from Archambault, Scott said protesters were holding their ground. Other protesters echoed that sentiment. Still, he said non-Sioux protesters should heed the wishes of Archambault and the tribe if asked to leave. Jeremiah Soft, an enrolled member of the Standing Rock Tribe who lives in Minnesota, said he wasn't certain what the future of the camp will hold. Soft was happy with the welcome he'd received at camp and said volunteers have been helpful and kind in ensuring the comfort of new arrivals. He wasn't sure how he felt about Archambault's suggestion that non-Sioux protesters should leave the camp. He attended the University of Wisconsin in Madison, where he studied journalism, political science and international studies. He previously worked at the Dickinson Press.
