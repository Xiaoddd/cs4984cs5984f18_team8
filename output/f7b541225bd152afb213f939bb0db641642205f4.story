More than 13 million Americans are at risk with a 6ft (1.8-meter) rise in sea level. The research, published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, references past climatic conditions, recent observations and future models to warn the melting of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets will contribute to a far worse sea level increase than previously thought. A separate study, released in February, warned that New York, London, Rio de Janeiro and Shanghai will be among the cities at risk from flooding by 2100. The IPCC has predicted a sea level rise of up to one meter by 2100, if emissions are not constrained. Some scientists have questioned the assumptions made by Hansen and the soaring rate of sea level rise envisioned by his research, which has now been peer-reviewed and published. Facebook Twitter Pinterest James Hansen argues that the effects of melting glaciers, such as this one near Ilulissat, Greenland, could be devastating. Hansen reiterated his call for a global tax on carbon, denying that the roles of scientist and advocate for change are conflicted. Scientists recently expressed alarm at the record heat that has baked the planet in the first few months of 2016, which follows a year that was the warmest on record. Recent figures show the world emitted 32.1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide from energy in 2015, on a par with 2014, while accelerating the shift to renewable energy. Nevertheless, humanity is still pumping out CO2 into the atmosphere at a rate 10 times faster than at any point in the past 66m years, with the resulting sea level rises, extreme weather events, coral bleaching and drought already evidenced around the globe.
