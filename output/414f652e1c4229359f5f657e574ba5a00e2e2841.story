Scott understood. More approvals are needed from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, which the governor oversees.

Scott acquired his Spectra shares via his blind trust. DCM is a natural gas limited partnership 50 percent owned by Spectra Energy. Scott disclosed his portfolio last month after he closed his original blind trust, then immediately opened a new one and placed all of his assets back into it. Neither the governor nor anyone on his staff agreed to be interviewed about his investments. The maneuver served to insulate Scott from criticism about financial transparency amid his re-election campaign against former Gov. Charlie Crist. Florida Gas Transmission is also a major state vendor. Those companies and their limited partnerships jointly own and operate Palmetto-based Gulfstream Natural Gas System LLC. The Public Service Commission later approved several individual natural gas vehicle programs. The law also exempts natural gas fuel from state fuel, sales and use taxes for five years. Pipelines bring virtually all of that gas to Florida. SABAL TRAIL TO POWER FPL PLANTS The Sabal Trail underground pipeline is to run through 13 Florida counties. Documents state that it is intended to provide Florida Power & Light with a dedicated supply of natural gas for power generation needs and other purposes starting in May 2017. Much of that new supply is to come from natural gas fracked from shale. In April, the Environmental Protection Agency sent a 17-page letter to FERC that questioned the need for Sabal Trail and suggested alternatives, like improved energy conservation measures, that would allow FPL to otherwise meet the power needs of its customers. Later this year, the Public Service Commission will consider plans by Duke Energy Florida to build a new, combined-cycle natural gas plant near Crystal River in Citrus County that would be a major customer of the new pipeline.
