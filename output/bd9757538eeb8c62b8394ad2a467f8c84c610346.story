The Morton County Sheriff's Department says protesters seemed to be wearing face masks and body armor. Why would they be doing that if you are peaceful. More than 100 protesters also gathered at the intersection of East Main and Memorial Highway in Mandan this morning. Authorities say two people were arrested after refusing to leave. This morning law enforcement issued a phone alert to residents, warning them about the presence of protesters.
