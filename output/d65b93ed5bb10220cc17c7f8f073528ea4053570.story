Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) was granted formal permission to proceed with laying the pipeline under a North Dakota reservoir on Wednesday. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says the pipeline endangers its drinking water. Also on Thursday, the Cheyenne River Sioux filed a legal challenge, asking a federal judge to stall the project's completion while a lawsuit against the pipeline continues. The final section of the project is a crossing under Lake Oahe that would carry North Dakota oil through the pipeline to Illinois. Entry and exit holes had already been drilled into the pipeline and oil was stored inside in anticipation of the project's completion. The Army had begun further study of the river crossing after contamination fears raised by the Standing Rock tribe, but it notified Congress on Tuesday that it would stop the study and grant ETP permission to continue work. The decision came after Donald Trump formally backed the project last month in one of his first acts as US president. Thousands of predominantly Native American protesters have boycotted the pipeline's construction in the state of North Dakota. The 1,172 mile (1,886km), four-state project is almost finished except for the one-mile stretch under Lake Oahe, where demonstrators have set up protest encampments. The Obama administration announced in September that it would not allow the project to proceed, but Mr Trump overturned the decision.

Nearly 700 people have been arrested since protests first began last year, according to law enforcement officials. The Army Corps told protesters who remain at the encampment that the government-owned land will be closed on 22 February. But Payu Harris, one of the demonstrators, said a new camp is being built on private land. We are here to stay. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.
