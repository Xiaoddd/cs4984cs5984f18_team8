Shortly before announcing his candidacy for the U.S. House earlier this year Democrat Chase Iron Eyes deleted the entirety of his prodigious social media presence. Those who followed Iron Eyes prior to his campaign knew why he did that. But now, just a couple of weeks after the campaign ended, Iron Eyes seems to be going back to his old ways. Not the least is attempting to block railroad tracks with a burning pickup truck. There are plentiful avenues available for the peaceful reform of our laws, and through those is how change must be effected. I would hope that North Dakota Democrats would condemn Iron Eyes for these words. They are unhelpful as we North Dakotans try to find a peaceful path forward on this issue.
