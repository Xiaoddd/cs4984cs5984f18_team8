Mizuho Bank and the Sumitomo-Mitsui Banking Corporation have also invested in the Dakota Access Pipeline. For their part, Dewey and Kincaid spoke to the SNA immediately after the meeting as they were leaving the building. The following is a transcript of their comments in the video above. Transcript Myron Dewey: My name is Myron Dewey. I am here in Japan to see if we can unify with the Japanese citizens and indigenous peoples over here in a coalition to protect our water, globally. I also let them know that I need to take this message back. So we wanted a timeline as well, and we will be following up with that timeline here with our allies here in Japan. William Patrick Kincaid: Lip-service, really. With my background being law and science, I wanted to share with them the violations the bank has of their equator principles and their association with the Dakota Access Pipeline, and back that up with hard science. As men, we are born into water; we know that were also drinking from the same water on this planet, which is what we consider our mother earth. William Patrick Kincaid: I think what we have to realize here is that were starting to see a real division between the corporate individual wealth, and us normal citizens. If the banks want to fund these acts of genocide, we as citizens can unify and divest. I remember just fifteen years ago, my water was pristine too, and thats no longer the case; and it will never be in my lifetime. Protect the water, and the Earth. Water protectors and land defenders, in a good way. Pesha u. Thank you. Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment. All rights reserved.
