It is astounding how little thought we give to the safety of our water, even though it makes up 60 percent of our bodies. Somehow we just assume that our government will ensure our water is safe. Just this year, we discovered that countless children in Flint, Michigan, suffered permanent brain damage from contaminated drinking water. Add to this the warning of climate scientists that we must keep 85 percent of already discovered reserves in the ground. Unless we do so, they say, Iowans will face extended droughts, outbreaks of tropical diseases, and a catastrophic increase in floods and tornadoes, to mention nothing of billion-dollar losses for our farmers and manufacturers. Of course, Dakota Access wants to marginalize those of us sounding these alarms as tree-huggers, but I believe Iowans are too smart to fall for this kind of diversionary divide and conquer tactic. It is time we recognize that Big Business has only one purpose: to make as much money as it can, regardless of the harm it creates for our children or for our planet. Citizen volunteer groups like the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, and the Bakken Pipeline Resistance Coalition are far from being tree-huggers. In fact, when it comes to protecting our safety and well-being, they are the best friends we have. Search for: Contact the Bakken Pipeline Resistance Coalition here.
