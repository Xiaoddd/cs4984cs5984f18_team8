As Donald Trump amps up attacks on the Clinton Foundation, Democrats are pointing out that Trump himself has given to the nonprofit he now calls a pay-to-play operation. Trump did not make any personal contributions to his foundations during this time. During the first GOP primary debate in August 2015, Trump voluntarily brought up his giving to the Clinton Foundation when asked about his previous donations to Hillary Clinton. I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good. A few months later, Trump gave pretty similar answers when he was asked to explain the Forbes article on his charitable giving record in late January. What I didn't know is they'd be using it for private aircraft and things like that. The Clinton Foundation was helping with Haiti and with lots of other things and I thought it was going to do some good work. But Trump himself acknowledges the donation.
