It is inescapable. Our Christian values have not stood the scrutiny of our actions. I have been ashamed of my state in ways I never imagined I could be. North Dakota State Legislature has proposed and recently passed an unholy trinity of draconian bills targeting protests -- a fundamental right protected by the First Amendment. The bills were amended by the Senate and will return to the House for a final vote. A bill that would have essentially legalized murder by car against protesters was killed mid-February. Scott P. Garman of Unity-USA said in an editorial. Using binoculars, she watched as police moved into the camps on February 22 and 23. Fear of the unknown, fear of things not understood, fear of change, which leaves few options how to react: learn or reject. On the day before the main camps were evicted, he took a moment to share his personal experiences during the long months since April 2016. He conquered his fears after two masked white men threatened to attack him outside a Bismarck hotel, he said: repression leads only to resistance. Dozens of police cars lined both sides of Highway 1806, closed off months before to the north. Some police are silent, leaving piles of sunflower seed shells on the pavement.

In early February, a masked activist released a video to Shaun King of the New York Daily News. We will not stop until the black snake is defeated. Tensions are high right now on both sides, and that much is very obvious. As the policy director for the ACLU of North Dakota, Cook is familiar with most of the incidents that have occurred lately in North Dakota. The best tool to combat hatred is education, she said. Cultural competency training, community outreach programs, social cultural events, and advocacy to state and law enforcement leaders must occur in order help define what appropriate behavior is. When all else fails, the ACLU turns to litigation to help change state and federal regulations. The idea that women are not funny never entered my mind. Editorial Wisdom from a forgotten flagpole by Sabrina Hornung Photo by Sabrina HornungI had a little bit of gravel-road therapy this weekend, found myself cruising rural Burleigh County and made a pit stop at Lake Mitchell. Participants were judged on creativity, flavor, and presentation; and this year we added a new category. I suffer from acute scoliosis in my lower back, and pain radiates from this area on a daily basis.
