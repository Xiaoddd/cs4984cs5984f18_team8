An estimated 130,200 gallons of oil spilled into the creek, and another 46,200 gallons leaked onto a hillside, Suess told Forum News Service in a separate interview. The spill dirtied private and federal land along the waterway, but no drinking water sources were affected, Suess said. Electronic monitoring equipment failed to detect the leak, according to Owen, who said the pipeline may have ruptured when the hillside slumped. The Dakota Access pipeline is 30 inches in diameter and could transport more than 500,000 barrels of oil daily. True Companies has a history of oil spills in the region, reporting three dozen spills totaling 320,000 gallons of oil since 2006, according to the AP. A representative from True Companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. More from Morning Mix: Police fatally shoot unarmed 73-year-old Calif.
