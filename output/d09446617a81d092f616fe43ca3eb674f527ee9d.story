More than 100 protesters marched in wintry conditions Thursdayfrom the Polk County Courthouse through downtown Des Moines streets to nearby Cowles Commons to rally in opposition to an underground oil pipeline project being built to link the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota with a shipping hub in Illinois by passing in a diagonal 346-mile line through 18 Iowa counties. However, Sierra Club attorney Wally Taylor said IUB officials ignored relevant evidence refuting the service and public use aspects of a project that was transporting oil for a private business from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to a shipping terminal in Illinois with no direct benefits to Iowans. Likewise, Bill Hanigan, a Des Moines attorney representing landowners in six counties, said Dakota Access should not have been allowed to force landowners to sell easements by condemning the land against their will in a way that runs contrary to a 2006 Iowa law and recent court rulings in other states. Dublinske said the Sierra Club does not have standing as an intervenor in the legal case and Farrell should reject the landowners' faulty legal arguments, but Hanigan predicted the case would end up in the Iowa Supreme Court and maybe the U.S. Supreme Court before the matter is settled. If the landowners prevail, Hanigan said, the pipeline should be viewed as a trespass and oil passing through the pipe would be a continual trespass that could result in monetary compensation or removal depending on future rulings by judges in the counties were condemnations were wrongly ordered. The project also has been the focus of protests and arrests in Iowa. More than 100 opponents crowded into an overflow courtroom Thursday and then marched to a nearby downtown park for a rally in protest of the project going forward.
