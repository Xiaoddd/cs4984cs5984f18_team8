On March 3, 84 gallons spilled from a leak in Watford City, North Dakota, where two sections of the pipeline connect. A smaller leak of 20 gallons occurred two days later, on March 5. The second leak happened in rural Mercer County, North Dakota, the result of an above-ground valve malfunction. The two leaks preceded the most widely-known incident to date, which occurred April 4 at a pump station north of Crandon, South Dakota. The April leak spilled 84 gallons of oil before officials contained it, again with no damage being done to the local environment. Water protectors protest the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. But they go a long way toward validating the concerns expressed by local indigenous tribes and their allies over the past year. Demonstrators objected to the dangers posed by a section that was slated to burrow under Lake Oahe, a section of the Missouri River, from which the Standing Rock tribe draws drinking water. Protesters argued that the oil could spill and endanger the water. No spills have been reported in the Lake Oahe section of the pipeline, but with three spills occurring elsewhere before the pipeline is even fully operational, it has been an inauspicious beginning so far. Nevertheless, Trump has remained a staunch supporter of the project. Under former President Barack Obama's U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, construction of the pipeline was halted in December 2016 pending an environmental impact statement that would have assessed how great a danger the project posed to locals. Trump scrapped the delay as soon as he took office. In an executive action, he ordered the project to continue as planned, effective immediately. The Dakota Access pipeline runs 1,172 miles through North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. All rights reserved.
