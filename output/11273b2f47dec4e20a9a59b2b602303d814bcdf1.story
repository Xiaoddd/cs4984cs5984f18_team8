The Collapse of the Bakken Oil Fields Benjamin Goulet Benjamin Goulet is a freelance writer based in Twentynine Palms, CA. He has written about a variety of topics for both local and national publications. As activists traveled to the site throughout much of the year, battles waged both on the ground and in the courts with opponents demanding that the project be halted, citing environmental and tribal concerns. In November of 2016, President Obama announced his Administration would look at possibly re-routing the pipeline. But in one of his first acts as president, Donald Trump signed an executive order green-lighting the project. New well performance has deteriorated, gas-oil ratios have increased and water cuts are rising. According to Berman, despite a recent, short-lived increase in production, well-levels at Bakken (the amount of oil available to extract from the specific area) are in decline, dropping over 33 percent in production between 2012 and 2015. In addition to well levels, Berman attributes the shift at Bakken to the fact that the reservoir is dropping in pressure. As the pressure drops, the cost to extract goes up, leading to a higher cost per barrel of oil. Over time, extraction makes less and less financial sense for companies doing the work, as energy costs to extract the oil spiral up. Each drains its own watershed, a part of the larger Mississippi River watershed. Lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, and reservoirs Lands either held or claimed by Native nations Discovered in the 1950s, 4 billion barrels of oil in this Great Plains deposit were cheaper to extract when fracking became possible. That led to the push for DAPL. The 1,172-mile Dakota Access Pipeline would carry up to 450,000 barrels of oil per day through four states, crossing rivers that provide water for 17 million people downstream. Places with population densities higher than 1,000 per square mile To be sure, there are a lot of esoteric, highly technical considerations when assessing oil production, including price fluctuations, OPEC policy and unseen international events.

The answer is unclear. In an age where the influence of data, science and reason all seem to be in the same decline as sweet crude, activists and experts face a new, dangerous foe: a public highly skeptical of basic facts. Oil, as an energy source, is in decline. Poster art, T-shirts, and photographs demonstrate the immediacy of the protests and conflicts as they have unfolded, while a video art piece by the Native collaborators of Winter Count and a historical tour explore the broader meanings of these events.
