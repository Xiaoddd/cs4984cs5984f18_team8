HolyElk Lafferty, MniCoujou, Oglala and Sicangu Lakota; Tim Mentz, Pa Baksa Dakota and Hunkpapa Lakota member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, of Makoche Wowapi, Mentz-Wilson Consultants, LLC, and Angela Bibens, Esq., Santee Dakota, of Red Owl Law participated in three days of Nobel Institute events. It was a shock to each of us to learn, on the morning of December 12th, just before the start of the second day of invite only private dialogue, that the Chair of the Morton County Commission, Cody Schulz had also been in Olso, Norway for the Forum. Unbeknownst to any of us, Mr. Schulz was among the other five hundred ticketed guests for the first day of High Level Dialogue where Ms. Lafferty and other notable indigenous panelists spoke. Apparently, Ms. Smith had reassured Ms. Torry this was acceptable to us when, in fact, Ms. Smith had not consulted with any of us prior to our arrival in Oslo. What Ms. Smith had hoped for anyone to gain from such a setup is beyond my comprehension. Had I known in advance that her intention was to force such an inappropriate dialogue, I would have declined the invitation, as it puts me in a vulnerable and potentially dangerous position legally and emotionally. I still have pending charges in Morton County after being arrested while in prayer, as well as active daily trauma that is a direct result of the inhumane actions of Morton County. With over 300 criminal cases still pending, these violations are on-going. We sent a letter to the Nobel Institute documenting our concerns on December 13, 2017. In no way do we wish for the important dialogue highlighted at the Forum in Oslo to be tainted by this misstep. We hope to have the ongoing support of the Nobel Institute as we continue to strengthen our connections with other indigenous communities and nation states, and with our allies around the world who understand that our rights to protect our aboriginal homelands and sacred sites and to preserve our languages and cultures, are, like our responsibility to protect water as the source of all life, issues of global significance. Angela Bibens, Esq. Chief Arvol Looking Horse Responds To Whom It May Concern, I would like to state that I am very disappointed to learn of how my friends and relatives were treated in Oslo, Norway. My understanding was that there was going to be dialogue concerning Sacred Sites and a panel discussion on human rights. Stephanie Hope Smith had encouraged me to attend this conference, but I had already committed myself to other obligations. Upon return of the delegation it was brought to my attention that the Chair of the Morton County Commission, Cody Schultz, had been invited by Stephanie to attend this conference. This uncomfortable situation has jeopardized the reputation and safety of my friends and relatives that attended, as well as myself. I was not made aware of the plans for any kind of panel discussion involving political figures, which has now been publicized in American media. The media has portrayed the situation to look as if this meeting in Oslo had been planned with all parties in agreement and with prior knowledge, when that was not the case. I have been informed by the delegates that they were taken by surprise at the announcement of his presence. The situation was addressed and Cody Schultz was excluded from any interaction or dialogue with the delegates. I am very disappointed that the event was not what I been informed it would be. Sacred Sites and Human Rights are the focus of my peace work. I am a spiritual leader, I am not a political person to be in agreement with any government official in creating discussion about any issue that pertains to Standing Rock. On 11 December the Nobel Peace Prize Forum Oslo convenes a high-level internationally broadcast two-hour discussion. The Forum brings together a unique constellation of Nobel Peace Prize Laureates and other thought leaders; representatives of governments and international organizations; scholars; international civil society leaders and activists, including those building peace in fragile, conflict and post-conflict situations, business and private sector actors; journalists; and youth across the globe, including students. The discussion will focus on two recent examples of intrastate conflict involving indigenous peoples over energy and environmental resources. More specifically, the speakers will discuss and compare the Standing Rock conflict, which led to war-zone like conditions within the United States from September 2016 to February 2017, and a somewhat similar conflict between the indigenous Sami population in Arctic Norway and the Norwegian state. Both the Dakota tribe and the Sami people will be represented on the panel. We expect an audience of up to 500 people with a variety of backgrounds. The Forum will be broadcast live by NRK, the leading Norwegian radio and TV network, and possibly by another leading international news network. The Forum will be streamed live by Nobel Media, the global digital outreach unit of the Nobel Foundation, and made accessible across the world on YouTube. We also expect extensive coverage by international news media, present in Oslo to cover the Nobel Peace Prize Award Ceremony on 10 December.
