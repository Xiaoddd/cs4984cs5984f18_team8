The photograph of her is beautiful. You cannot imagine what this can mean to an artist, but you are welcome to look through my posts (all public) to get some idea of what it means to me and to see the growth my patrons have allowed me. The second year I started seeing definite jumps in skill level. The third year I was able to complete more artworks than before. I am so excited about this fourth year because I cannot wait to see what is ahead. I complete one portrait a month and the occasional bonus art when I have extra time. The more patrons I have supporting my art journey, the more time I can allot to art. It is my dream goal to be making art every day. The photograph of her is beautiful. You determine the value of my art to you and you will receive all the following: My eternal gratitude for your patronage and random social media shoutouts of appreciation. Early access to sketches, line art, WIP, and finished color artworks and access to all previous months' artworks. Only 75 spots remaining.
