This is another small victory in defeating the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline. The fight, however, is still not over. This notice opens the public scoping phase and invites anyone interested to help them to identify potential issues, concerns, and reasonable alternatives that should be considered in an EIS. While the EIS is exactly what we called for, we must ensure that it fully takes into consideration tribal treaty rights, natural resources, cultural and sacred places, socio-economical concerns, environmental justice, and the health and wellbeing of those downstream who rely on our drinking water. We need your continued support as this process moves forward. Embed This Letter Campaign Copy this code to embed this letter campaign on any website, similar to how you embed a YouTube video.
