US Politics Reno Berkeley Since the Dakota Access Pipeline protests heated up in September, opponents of the pipeline have warned that Donald Trump has a vested interest in Energy Transfer Partners, and therefore, wants to see the pipeline completed. In recent days, however, conflicting reports have surfaced that Trump has divested himself of any DAPL investments. On November 23, the Washington Post reported that Trump dumped his stock in the DAPL over the summer. Experts say that's not enough. The Dakota Access Pipeline was originally slated to flow through Bismarck, North Dakota, but the route was scrapped after residents of the city raised concerns about potential water contamination. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe has said that the Army Corps of Engineers failed to consult the tribe before approving the new route through reservation lands which cuts through a sacred burial ground. Several other tribal reservations have also said that they were not consulted, either. Energy Transfer Partners also ignored a request by the Corps of Engineers to stop drilling until it could assess the environmental impact and possible reroutes. Hamm is a billionaire whose company, Continental Resources, controls a large portion of the Bakken Formation, which is where the DAPL originates. In other words, Hamm has a direct interest in getting the pipeline built despite the outcry from opponents. In a June 2016 story, the Washington Post describes his relationship with Hamm, a fellow billionaire, whom Trump relied on for energy policy advice. What matters most is whom Trump chooses to install in his cabinet, and so far, instead of draining the swamp, he seems to be filling it to overflowing.
