A project which already underwent years of excruciating state and federal review and was on the verge of being completed before President Obama inserted political obstruction into the process. You can read the full document below. At this point, which just days left in his last term in office, President Obama knows he cannot unilaterally stop the pipeline. By initiating this process now, environmental extremist groups can argue in court that it would somehow be illegal for Trump to allow the project to be completed until it plays out. Creating a full-on EIS is a process that can take years. Meanwhile, the Dakota Access Pipeline company wants the federal courts to stop the Obama administration from publishing this notice. The side effect of this is that, absent new pipelines, old pipelines (and other more risky forms of transportation) are used to bring oil to market.
