First it was the dogs, next the pepper spray, then the rubber bullets, and the water cannons in sub-freezing temperatures. This is an appalling violation of human rights. The world is witnessing this injustice. We must continue our call for the demilitarization of the protest sites. The time is now to demand an end to the acts of violence against Indigenous peoples and their allies. We are leaving you with the words from Tribal Chairman David Archambault II. We people of faith, believers in the word, pray that administration will take all the right and necessary steps to protect these people. If you take action and have not already registered, you will receive periodic updates and communications from Sojourners. Indigenous peoples of this nation throughout history have always suffered at the hands of harmful decisions of others. The United States must do better for Indigenous peoples and their rights. As people of faith, we have a moral and social responsibility to care for the earth that is God's creation and to protect the people that care for the earth. The peaceful fight of the Standing Rock Sioux has not gone unnoticed by the faith community and many others around the world. As people of faith, stewards of creation, and defenders of justice, we urge local, state, and federal officials to take immediate and direct action to stop all violence toward the water protectors. We call on you to immediately end the blockade of goods delivered to Standing Rock and remove all militarized police forces from the camps. Your actions are an appalling violation of human rights. The world is witnessing this injustice. We are leaving you with the words from Tribal Chairman David Archambault II. We people of faith, believers in the word, pray that administration will take all the right and necessary steps to protect these people.
