The pick is a curious one: During a Republican presidential primary debate in 2011, Perry completely blanked on the department's name. But that's not the only reason the pick has incited some concern. Perry's interest in the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline has also given some reason to pause. Perry is on the Energy Transfer Partners board of directors Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced earlier this month that the Dakota pipeline would be indefinitely suspended pending a review of alternative routes, there is still the possibility that the Dakota Access pipeline could be built near the previously proposed site under a Trump administration. Those that stand against DAPL, as the pipeline is commonly known, are likely upset with the selection of Rick Perry to lead the Department of Energy. Perry is on the board of directors of the company that is attempting to build the pipeline, joining Energy Transfer Partners in February 2015 just weeks after he stepped away from the Texas governorship. Perry sits on the board of the company that stands to profit from the Dakota Access pipeline. In 2015 Congress passed a bill that lifted a decades-old ban on crude oil exports. Perry did his part in helping ETP to lobby in support of the bill. The help goes both ways. He once vowed to dismantle the agency he will now lead While the gaffe in which he forgot the name of the agency is making headlines, it's the context of the statement that raises the real red flags. It was while answering a question about which departments he would dismantle as president that he fumbled. Let's see. Later in the debate Perry recovered and was able to name the Department of Energy as the third he'd dismantle if elected president. Rick Perry has supported some green ideas in the past. In 2011, he threatened to veto a proposed bill in the Texas legislature that would have required an additional 500 megawatts of non-wind renewable energy in his state. All rights reserved.
