Heavy crude from a ruptured pipe oozed into a creek feeding the Kalamazoo River in July 2010, a disaster compounded when Enbridge control centre personnel in Canada misread alarms and boosted the flow. It took 17 hours for the company to realize what was happening. Nearly 65 kilometres of the river, shorelines and wetlands were polluted. The company said over three million litres of oil were released, while EPA put the total at more than three-point-seven million.

The company would use tools that could detect cracks, corrosion and other flaws inside pipes. But EPA and a third-party monitor working with the government concluded that six inspections conducted last year did not meet the time frame under the settlement. Enbridge denied violating the agreement, saying there was an honest dispute over when the clock had started. The internal checks were finished and no safety concerns found, spokesman Michael Barnes said Thursday. Spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle of the U.S. Department of Justice, which represented EPA, declined to comment on the settlement, which was filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for Western Michigan. Two of the inspections were of sections of Line 5, which runs between Superior, Wis., and Sarnia, Ont. Neither involved a nearly eight-kilometre-long underwater segment in the Straits of Mackinac, the channel that connects Lakes Michigan and Huron, which received several dents from a suspected tugboat anchor strike last month and is the subject of public debate over its safety. It said the company would work with vendors to develop a model that could better detect cracks and determine their size. Please read our Commenting Policy first.
