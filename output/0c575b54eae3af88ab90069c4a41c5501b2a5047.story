Or for meteors to be less discriminating in where they strike. In reality, OZY Fest is another lukewarm neoliberal think-festival. It featured luminaries of the modern brainflesh like Steven Pinker, Common, and the once-was-future President of these United States, Madam Secretary Hillary Clinton. But probably most of you are curious why this lineup is a Big Deal. Here's why: this lineup reads like satire. I hadn't heard of OZY Fest until last week. I fully expected this festival to be a prank; I would've guessed that this sign was cooked up by some photoshop-savvy member of the left. But no. Here we are. It's uncanny, absolutely unnerving how close this veers to parody. It's so beyond parody, it lumbers into a hyper-parody at the margins. These are people who make their bread co-opting living, grassroots movements. They take the temperature of the room. Then they yoke mildly rebellious personalities to profitable ventures. And they fundraise off of it. That's literally how the centrist wing of the Democratic Party works. Take Michelle Wolf, who is a genuinely gifted, funny, insightful comedian. That's not a slam against Wolf, but a comment on the depth of the thought behind OZY Fest. Take Rose McGowan: a brave, passionate celebrity and fighter for truth. More power to whatever platform she stands on. But it's an odd fit, McGowan and OZY Fest. That fact was noted by Libby Torres in her Daily Beast review: Attendees dutifully booed whenever Trump's name or policies were mentioned, but when McGowan accused the Democratic party of shielding her abuser Harvey Weinstein, you could have heard a pin drop. The OZY Fest is the best demonstration of how intellectually fragile the center is. For God's sake, Alex Rodriguez, a steroid-binging narcissist, ran an entrepreneur panel. The man has the business acumen of your dorm-neighbor Adderall dealer. Tom Steyer, who is probably related in some way to whatever underworld demon has oversight over neoliberal capitalism, spoke. Norquist is probably the shithead who's most responsible for our current be-doomed state of affairs. Davos happens every year, after all. Neoliberal capitalism is like any powerful system: it requires a class of intellectual and cultural defenders. Places like OZY Fest, and Davos, and the Aspen Ideas Festival, are where the public relations arm of the Establishment sells its wares to marks and rubes. The long alliance between rich people and technicians has been strained in recent years. These get-togethers exist to convince the activists, media types, and influencers that the Trump years are a trifling bump in the good and glorious road upwards. That the spineless, incremental center knows best. Other writers have commented on the surreal, bloodless horror of OZY Fest. Humans are endlessly inventive. But mostly, we prefer to do the same twelve things over and over again. We do what we know. It just takes a little courage. Not much. Sometimes, necessity suffices. To survive is to adapt, and to adapt is to change. But no. It explains why the Clintons will never alter their course, why the Democratic Party is stuck in the mud, why white fragility is such a commonplace. TED Talks meets Coachella. We do what works. At All.
