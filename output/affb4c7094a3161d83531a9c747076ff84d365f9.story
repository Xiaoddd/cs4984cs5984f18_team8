Sure, they make critical, consequential decisions, but they are fundamentally compelled to do so by an impersonal, amoral, destructive systemic force largely beyond their personal control: the dynamic of capitalism itself. Those conditions created a transitional context to shift out of a regulated state-interventionist capitalism into the aggressive, free-market neoliberal variety lasting more than 30 years, leading us to the precipice of the present. Easy. Tomasky furthers his point by detailing the familiar grotesqueness of present day realities: staggering economic inequality, lack of job prospects, an opioid epidemic claiming far too many lives, dwindling investment in infrastructure and education, and on and on. In those years, capitalism was delivering the goods. The resulting booming prosperity created the social conditions which birthed a civil rights movement (however, the struggle for equality was deemed radical and extremist by many deferent to the status quo), forcing our country to finally attempt to live up to its founding ideals (at least domestically). The Pentagon, US navy, US air force, DARPA, and the National Institutes of Health brought us computers, semiconductors, aircraft, the Internet, and pharmaceuticals, respectively. Only years later were private companies allowed to profit from publically funded innovation. Nearly a century ago, before the Golden Age, the trauma inflicted by the Great Depression awakened many to the cyclical nature of the capitalist system. Glass-Steagall legislation in 1933 created a barrier between investment banking and commercial banking, and gave working people the bank deposit insurance system to protect them from bank failures. Eventually, however, through boom and bust, the dynamic force of capitalism compels the capitalist, wherever they are in the world. In 1973, when OPEC countries created the first oil shock by colluding to raise the price of oil many times over, inflation skyrocketed. And, over the next few years, as prices were rising (inflation), the economy stagnated, creating a whole new economic perplexity called stagflation. The Golden Age waned in the 70s, and by the second oil shock in 1979, it was over. The capitalist dynamic on an international scale (the OPEC cartel in this case) wrought enough stress domestically (and in Great Britain) to fuel narratives of a new way forward, justifying a far more deregulated capitalism known as neoliberalism, beginning in the early 80s. The reigns of regulation were stripped away so that a new era of growth and prosperity could be unleashed, so we were told. Specifically, so the argument goes, cut the taxes of high-income earners so they can make more money off their investments; by taking home a greater share, they would spend more, in turn creating jobs and more income for everyone. Trickle-down has essentially been American economic policy for over 30 years now. The aforementioned Golden Age and the current conditions of malaise and alienation have to do with the structural configurations of our capitalist system, not the moral compass of the ruling elite at a given time. There are more self-described democratic socialists today because the Cold War is over and millennials were handed an economy in the worst recession since the Great Depression. Fundamentally, global capitalism, which has stretched its tentacles to every corner of the Earth in its quest for value and infinite growth and expansion in a world of finite resources, poses an existential threat to planetary life. And it is the reason socialism will never cease to exist as an alternative, because it is bound to capitalism in a dialectical embrace. Socialism is the other side of the coin. Capitalists and policymakers can do whatever they like to mitigate the injustices of the present configuration of the system, but socialism will become an afterthought when the same can be said of capitalism.
