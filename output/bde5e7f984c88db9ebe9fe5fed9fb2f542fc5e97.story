This was an unprovoked attack upon unarmed, peacefully gathered people, on their own land, by militarized police forces, on behalf of a corporation. We will discuss what happened, and the aftermath, as well. We will also discuss what we had originally planned to cover on the show - how to protect yourself as an empath in a world that has gone insane. These things, and more, will be on this LIVE episode of Open Eyes. PLEASE join in, and share this with your friends. You WILL NOT HEAR about the Standing Rock issue on the mainstream media.
