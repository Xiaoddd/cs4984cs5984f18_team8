Please show up by making phone calls. I've written a script for anyone who needs it (at the bottom) and am reposting this call for action from last evening: They're shooting our unarmed people again at Standing Rock with tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannons, in 24-degree bitter weather. Call 202-761-7690. Asap. I just did and left a message without yelling or swearing it wasn't easy. - This shouldn't be happening. Morton County Police and DAPL officials are putting lives at risk by aiming water cannons at peaceful protectors in below freezing conditions. The Water Protectors are simply trying to ensure clean drinking water for over 18 million Americans and further protection for our planet. Ethereal theme. Theme images by badins. Powered by Blogger.
