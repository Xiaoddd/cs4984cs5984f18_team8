In a show of solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux, Maya representatives from the Mam and Ixil peoples of Guatemala came to the Oceti Sakowin Camp to sit down with the members of the Standing Rock Tribal Council to share the pain of their own experiences. The video below shows Phil Little Thunder offering prayer and song to the Mayan elders in a ceremony at the Oceti Sakowin Camp. Latin America, activists from Mexico, Central America, and all the way down to the Ecuadorian Amazon have put their lives on the line in defense of their lands and dignity over the past years. And far too often, their lives have been taken for their work. Few indigenous groups know the pain of losing friends, loves ones, and entire communities in defense of tribal lands as acutely as the Mayan ethnic groups of Guatemala. So when a group of Mayan Ancestral Authorities from western Guatemala made the trip to Standing Rock to show their solidarity with the protesters, the symbolic resonance of the meeting was deeply powerful. In addition to Mayans, Aztec dancers, as well as Maori warriors, have come to Standing Rock to show solidarity with the Oceti Sakowin struggle to protect sacred water.

We feel that PIVX is this system. PIVX takes the control the banking elite has over money and gives it back to the people. It is the ultimate weapon in the battle against the money changers and information controllers because PIVX is the only cryptocurrency in existence that allows for completely anonymous storage while simultaneously paying interest.
