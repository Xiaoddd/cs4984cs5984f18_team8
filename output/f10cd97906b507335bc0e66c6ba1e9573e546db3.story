DAPL protesters: Trump's executive order violates the law 02:35 Story highlights Pipeline company says it is ready to finish the project Army Corps decides no need for environmental impact study (CNN)The US Army Corps of Engineers has granted an easement in North Dakota for the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline, allowing the project to move toward completion despite the protests of Native Americans and environmentalists. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which has long opposed the part of the project near its home, has promised a legal fight. It didn't immediately respond to CNN's request Wednesday for comment. Trump executive action Read More Just a few weeks ago, President Donald Trump signed executive actions to advance approval of this pipeline and others, casting aside efforts by President Barack Obama's administration to block construction. Acting Secretary of the Army Robert Speer's moves to grant the easement and stop the preparation of an environmental impact statement were anticipated. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said Tuesday the Obama administration had determined other locations for the pipeline should be looked into by the Army. The Standing Rock Sioux said they will argue in court that the environmental impact statement process was wrongfully terminated.

The decision gives the pipeline's developer -- Dakota Access, a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners -- right-of-way through government land at Lake Oahe Dam and Reservoir in North Dakota. The tribe has been concerned that digging the pipeline under Lake Oahe -- a section of the Missouri River in North Dakota -- would affect the area's drinking water, as well as the supply for 17 million people living downstream. The proposed underground route at Lake Oahe is half a mile upstream from the tribe's reservation. The sacred land at the center of the Dakota pipeline dispute The tribe and its allies have protested in North Dakota for months, blocking the path of the pipeline during peaceful demonstrations and clashes that have sometimes turned violent. Greenpeace said the President was looking out for the rich. The pipeline will stretch 1,172 miles through four states -- from North Dakota into South Dakota, winding through Iowa and ending in southern Illinois -- moving 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day across the Midwest. It is completed, except for the contested portion under Lake Oahe. Not all the Standing Rock Sioux are protesting the pipeline Like Dakota Access, the Keystone XL Pipeline had been the subject of environmental concern from activists, residents and indigenous tribes who worried that the pipeline would pollute as many as 2,500 aquifers. But pipeline supporters touted the jobs it would create and other economic benefits. In November 2015, Obama nixed the proposed pipeline, virtually ending the fight over the project that had gone on for much of his presidency. But Trump's executive actions on both pipelines signal how his administration will take a different approach to energy and environmental issues.
