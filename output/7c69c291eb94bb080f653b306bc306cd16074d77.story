Since then, a cottage industry of spreadsheet-diving journalists has worked itself into a lather trying to peg his real net worth. Despite the all-caps figures Trump has dispensed, most estimates from the established financial-media outlets have been lower, FAR LOWER. In response to these wanton guesstimates, Trump instinctually fired back at the guesstimators. But the real sulfuric acid was reserved for the lowballers over at Bloomberg. In November, Trump was elected president of the United States in a shocking turn of events. Last month, Republican strategists were quietly sweating the likelihood that the party would not only lose control of Congress in November, but that Donald Trump himself had sealed their fate by denying the probability of a Democratic blue wave. Among those who describe themselves as strong supporters of the president, the proportion of doubters increases to 57 percent. Another is that the issues soft Republicans care about most are ones involving government spending and are typically associated with Democrats. As ever, the White House is trying to keep Trump in semi-presidential mode for at least part of the day, arranging for him to attend a memorial of the Flight 93 victims in Pennsylvania. Subordinates ignore his orders, steal documents off of his desk, and, for all we know, bring in a Donald Trump mimic to make the important phone calls. Naturally, all of this has launched a thousand posts, not to mention set off a frantic hunt within the executive branch for Deputy Undersecretary Judas. We already knew that Trump is terrible to work for, impulsive in decision-making, and borderline incoherent. We also knew that a lot of people who work for Trump hate it. The question turns on what you hope from the Trump administration. If you think Defense Secretary James Mattis and Chief of Staff John Kelly are forces for good, even just relatively speaking, then you should be encouraged. This sort of thing happens in the White House, with presidents saying something in anger and then walking it back. As much as Trump blusters about libel laws and maligns journalists, the press is doing just fine. A truly dangerous president would cloak his aims in high principles and ask Congress to pass new laws. Some are good and some are bad. But all of this is, again, one more confirmation of what we already knew: Trump talks tougher than he acts. He also struggles to get his way, everywhere. Trump knows how to stoke his base, and he has started to reshape the G.O.P., but he has had a hell of a time implementing his campaign promises. Trump chose these people. No one made him bring on Steven Mnuchin or Reince Priebus or Nikki Haley or Cohn. Like the cartoon of an oil prospector propelled into the air by a sudden gusher, Trump was knocked off his feet by the power of his own message. The man who insulted Goldman Sachs and Saudi princes and promised infrastructure and walls instead hired Goldman Sachs, did the bidding of Saudi princes, and stuck to tax cuts. Well, it was only a matter of time before Donald Trump weighed in on possibly the dumbest film controversy of the year. And now, in an interview with the Daily Caller, the president has given his two cents. First Man recently premiered at the Venice Film Festival, where critics found it technically dazzling, if a little boring. Of course, it celebrates an American achievement. Yesterday, JPMorgan C.E.O. According to new documents obtained by The Guardian, Spicer was forced to call the National Park Service repeatedly on January 21, the day after the inauguration, to ask for more flattering photographs of the crowd on the mall. Like your crazy uncle who spends his days yelling at the TV from the chair that no one else is allowed to sit in, Donald Trump is a man of many convictions. One of them is that climate change is a hoax created by China in order to hurt the United States. Another, that government regulations serve no purpose other than to eat into corporate profits. In August, his Environmental Protection Agency proposed letting cars and trucks release an additional 321 million to 931 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The same agency unveiled a proposal to allow coal-burning plants to regulate themselves, and around the same time, we learned that the administration wants to make asbestos, that cancer-causing material much beloved by the president, great again. Speaking of November . . A separate Washington Post-ABC News poll documents the same phenomenon: while most voters told that survey that the economy was doing well, nearly half of those who were upbeat about the economy still voiced opposition to the president. A Top Goldman Banker Raised Ethics Concerns. Then He Was Gone. With the midterm elections less than two months away, the West Wing is girding for Republicans to lose the House and even the Senate, sources said. Ivanka Trump is even worried about impeachment, a source close to her told me. Plans to administer polygraph tests to staff have seemingly died. Besides family, one of the only people Trump continues to trust is Stephen Miller. The West Wing is bracing for the climate to worsen. Ivanka and Jared Kushner, meanwhile, continue to agitate for Trump to replace Chief of Staff John Kelly with a more pliable manager. Ivanka recently asked a friend about Republican political adviser and former lobbyist Wayne Berman, a source briefed on the conversation said. Most recently, Sherman served as national-affairs editor at New York magazine, and he is a regular contributor to NBC News and MSNBC. Most recently, Sherman served as national-affairs editor at New York magazine, and he is a regular contributor to NBC News and MSNBC. Trump has maintained this same level of swagger for most of the summer, defiantly smacking down talk of Democrats winning the House in the midterms as more mainstream-media nonsense. In doing so, of course, he may have pacified the same voters Republican operatives are eager to rev up. In public, Trump maintains his reality distortion field. But behind the scenes, a grim fatalism seems to be sinking in. Democrats are preparing to make life a living hell for Trump, if they take back one or both houses of Congress. Governance would become, if possible, even more unworkable. Whether or not he has that possibility in mind, Trump has already found a scapegoat. Mueller circles the White House, Trump has a crucial decision to make: prioritize a topflight legal professional to handle potential impeachment proceedings, or choose a loyalist whose lodestar is Trump. But much has changed in the two weeks since that announcement. If Trump was prioritizing legal experience before, now he may be prioritizing loyalty. With the House likely to fall into Democratic hands after the midterm elections, Trump will need a steady hand to navigate a two-front war against the special counsel and Democrats in Congress. For Trump, however, there are now additional, personal factors to consider. He has, after all, routinely been burned by trusted advisers, including his longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen, Apprentice-era ally Omarosa Manigault Newman, and former chief economic adviser Gary Cohn. Many in Trumpworld fear that McGahn, too, might have fingered the president when he offered extensive cooperation with Mueller, sitting for more than 30 hours of interviews across several sessions with the special counsel. Given his justifiable fear of further betrayal, it is entirely possible that Trump will spurn Flood for a less notable, more dutiful attorney. In the wake of his outbursts, White House officials have discussed whether Trump would listen to his closest New York City friends in an effort to rein him in. But Trump refused to take the meeting, sources said. (Spokespeople for LeFrak and Lorber say they have no knowledge of a meeting. More than ever, Trump is acting by feeling and instinct. Even Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are unsettled that Trump is so gleefully acting on his most self-destructive impulses as his legal peril grows. According to a source, Jared and Ivanka told Trump that stripping security clearances from former intelligence officials would backfire, but Trump ignored them. Allen Weisselberg and National Enquirer publisher David Pecker are cooperating with federal prosecutors, have rattled Trump like few other turns in the investigation have, sources said. By the weekend, though, his anger had returned. According to sources, the president feels cornered with no clear way out. Privately, according to two sources, Trump attorneys suggested that a strategy for dealing with the issue could be for Trump to admit to having affairs with women and paying hush money to them for years. Trump, according to the sources, rejected this advice. Inside the West Wing, a sense of numbness and dread has set in among senior advisers as they gird for what Trump will do next. Two sources told me that Trump continues to raise the possibility of a pardon for Manafort, his former campaign chairman. Trump has been clashing with White House counsel Don McGahn, who, sources said, is strongly against granting Manafort a pardon. Is Nuts. Most recently, Sherman served as national-affairs editor at New York magazine, and he is a regular contributor to NBC News and MSNBC. Most recently, Sherman served as national-affairs editor at New York magazine, and he is a regular contributor to NBC News and MSNBC. For more than 18 months, U.S. officials have been leaking to the media on background, painting a picture of Trump as unhinged and out of his depth. The somewhat jaded reaction inside Washington underscores a terrifying reality for the president: as remarkable as the Times op-ed was, it could have been written by just about anyone. Anthony Scaramucci said Wednesday that he warned the president of saboteurs during his short-lived tenure as White House communications director last year. With Robert Mueller circling and Democrats smelling blood in the water, Trump has grown increasingly frenzied in recent weeks, barely containing his more autocratic impulses on Twitter and during campaign-style rallies. The perfect storm of the Times op-ed, the subterfuge described by Woodward, and the revelation that former Trump aide Omarosa Manigault Newman secretly recorded hundreds of hours of audio during her time in the White House, can only fuel that paranoia. It may also hasten the expected departures of administration officials including Chief of Staff John Kelly and Defense Secretary James Mattis. The result is likely to be a shrinking circle of loyalists that Trump feels he can rely on. Already, the president has lost confidants Hope Hicks and Keith Schiller. Other close allies, including his former lawyer Michael Cohen, National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, and Trump Organization C.F.O. Allen Weisselberg, have cut deals and are talking to federal prosecutors. One Trump friend told the Post that the president is concerned that now, following the Times op-ed, the only people he can trust are his children. Obama had appeared tired, irritated, on the defensive. So did the liberal media, perhaps feeling betrayed by the vanishing act of their heretofore cheerleader in chief. But Obama, an indefatigable basketball fan, soon turned it around and flashed his competitive side. He roundly beat Romney in the second and third debates, before soaring through November and concluding one of the most quietly accomplished portfolios of any president in the modern era: auto-industry bailout, Wall Street reforms, new fuel-efficiency standards, increased aid to veterans, expanded F.D.A. food-safety oversight, gay marriage, getting private lenders out of the federal student-loan program, the Iran deal, and of course, the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare. Finally, in March, Obama put an end to the guessing game: the family will remain in Washington at least until youngest daughter Sasha graduates from high school in 2019. Wherever they are, the windows are likely to be open. She even made Barack Obama laugh, inspiring a legendary set of photos of the former president doubled up in the Oval Office. Aretha Franklin was the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. For 40 years, she held the record for the most songs on the Billboard Hot 100, dethroned by Nicki Minaj in 2017. Franklin, whose mother died when Aretha was 10, was raised primarily by her father, C.L. Franklin, a Baptist minister and a civil-rights activist that organized the 1963 Detroit Walk to Freedom, which was the largest civil-rights demonstration in U.S. history until the March on Washington displaced it two months later. I'm looking at the miles it covered. You had people everywhere in every corner and on every side and that went on for a very, very long way down Woodward. Franklin spent the turbulent 60s building her career, and in 1967 released her most famous song, and one that became inextricably linked to the civil rights and feminist movements of the time. Franklin, who Elle noted had it written into her contract in the 60s that she would never perform for a segregated audience, was glad that the song became linked to feminist and civil-rights movements. We are very resourceful. Women absolutely deserve respect. Though Franklin didn't participate in civil disobedience herself, she lent very public support to at least one person who did. In 1970, famous feminist activist, scholar, and a then-avowed member of the Communist Party Angela Davis was arrested at the Howard Johnson Motor Lodge in Midtown Manhattan and incarcerated for 16 months for what were found to be wrongful kidnapping and murder charges. Angela Davis must go free. Black people must be free. . . . Jail is hell to be in. Will Smith is even spotted scrubbing down the hood of a car while Azealia Banks perches in the branches of a tree. The video also includes tributes to artists who have died, including a reference to XXXtenacion, Michael Jackson, and Whitney Houston. She was a great woman, with a wonderful gift from God, her voice. But you can break the glass only once. has yet to declare some sort of emergency, as many on the left would like him to do. But you can break the glass only once. Many Americans would love for Obama to don a pink pussy hat and go full Olbermann on his successor. Others would like him to go away. To review, some of the moves of post-presidential Obama have surprised people. A temporary rental has become a full-fledged purchase, and the Obamas are installing a backyard pool, the sort of improvement that suggests a longer-term stay. When he and Michelle socialize at home, it tends to be with a small set of elite black Washingtonians. Things are low-key. It was a plea for the preservation of the liberal international order that readers mined mainly for digs at Donald Trump. The former primarily has to do with seemliness. The latter has to do with effectiveness. Fortunately for Obama, though, when it comes to buckraking, he stands on the shoulders of giants. Gerald Ford was the first ex-president to start cashing in with paid speeches, but Bill Clinton was the first to see its full potential, like Les Paul with the electric guitar. They also allowed Clinton Foundation work and government work to bleed into one another in notably lackadaisical fashion. His statements of principle and policy have never lined up consistently with his real-world actions. Obama could speak the language of working-class disaffection over trade or immigration, but he never acted much on either. He spoke of restraint and moderation when it came to race and gender, but his administration in practice took a heavy-handed approach on most civil-rights matters in which it could intervene, from school discipline and local policing to Title IX guidance on gender. He spoke often of transparency, but his administration fell short on that front, and even the Obama library will not house his records. On this, Americans are more divided. Some want him yelling through a bullhorn, while others prefer that he stay as quiet as George H.W. Bush did after Bill Clinton came to office. But, here, the grade for Obama rises much higher. When the Democratic Party seemed likely to choose Sanders supporter Keith Ellison to lead it, Obama stepped in behind the scenes to put a thumb on the scale for his labor secretary Tom Perez. When Obama released a list of 81 Democrats for state and federal office whom he is endorsing in the mid-term elections later this year, he omitted, among others, rising star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self-proclaimed socialist. Nothing about this is unethical, but it suggests that Obama sees a party lurch to the left as a threat to its future, while others argue that such a move provides its salvation. But you can break the glass only once. If Trump threatens our existence and requires extraordinary intervention, Obama will undoubtedly say so, probably in concert with his predecessors. Sitting presidents can do a lot to replenish their political capital, but ex-presidents must make do with an exhaustible supply. Republicans are opponents, not deplorables. Trump is a worrisome buffoon, not a Mussolini. The meetings with adversaries are flawed diplomacy, not capitulations to evil. Russia is a troublemaker, not a new Third Reich. His take should mean something. They trusted him, just as they distrust Trump. They assumed the best of the choices Obama was making and checked out, just as they now assume the worst of Trump and constantly check in. But you can break the glass only once. But you can break the glass only once. He famously went kitesurfing in the British Virgin Islands, took a nostalgic trip to his onetime childhood home of Indonesia, where he whitewater rafted, and was seen around New York City having lunch with Bono. A year later, 44 is still having just as much fun. Obama, who now has the time between book projects to attend these kinds of far-flung family functions, came to the opening of the Sauti Kuu Foundation, a resource center Auma founded. Here, the avid presidential dancer got to his feet and danced. He can be seen helping his step-grandmother to her feet as well. US President, Barack Obama gestures as he makes an address on July 16, 2018 in front of a projected backdrop showing a view of his father's home village, the hamlet of Nyang'oma in Kogelo, during the opening of the Sauti Kuu Resource Centre founded by his half-sister, at Kogelo in Siaya county, western Kenya. - Obama is in the east african nation for the first time since he left the US presidency and met with President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga in Nairobi.

Texas is Texas, after all. It has no impact. I want to do what excites me. Cruz, too, is working hard and not taking the race for granted. And he has a point: in modern times, no Democratic candidate has hit more than 42 percent in a statewide election. For a midterm candidate. Because Democrats want to hear about both, and it would be silly to pretend otherwise. His communications director, Chris Evans, live-streamed shaky, grainy video of the whole event, as he does with every town hall, as the crowd rose with applause. There were college kids and veterans and old women standing up out of their wheelchairs to catch a glimpse of him. One woman cried at the touch of his hand. It seemed like a silly question. I was in Iowa in 2007. The Legend of Beto is growing bigger than Texas. Bernie Sanders is perhaps the only other name that comes to mind, but Sanders was also unable to dispatch Hillary Clinton, one of the most unpopular candidates in American campaign history, in the last presidential race. Sanders is also 76. And his fellow putative front-runners, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden, will also be in their 70s if they decide to run next year. History also bears out an important pattern: since Vietnam, Democrats have only captured the White House by nominating youthful outsiders who offered a clean break from their predecessor. You hear that a lot from Democrats these days. They look uneasily at the current crop of potential candidates, and keep waiting for their Obama-like savior to surface. That might be true. Since 2008, there is simply no evidence that voters in either party care more about ladder-climbing credentials than personality and vision. Nothing feels practiced. offers not just a path to victory in Texas but an antidote to the entire stupid artifice of American politics in the Trump era. At the 2016 Democratic Convention, just months before Donald Trump was elected to office, Michelle Obama delivered a searing but compassionate address to her fellow party members, urging the left to be better than bullies on the right. In the febrile early months of the Trump White House, shortly after the president took office, a mysterious memo began to circulate among West Wing staffers and the National Security Council. Until John Kelly was hired as chief of staff, Trump regularly received news in the form of Breitbart and Daily Caller articles. Like most ex-presidents, Barack Obama adheres to the longstanding tradition of refraining from criticizing his successor by name. The result is that Obama is under more pressure to act than most former presidents, particularly from a certain subset of the Democratic base that would love to see him tear Trump a new one. During his 90-minute speech at the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture in South Africa on Tuesday, Obama stuck to his practice of not saying the T-word, but made a strong case against the rise of disturbing global trends that could theoretically result in a world leader much like Trump. The free press is under attack. Censorship and state control of media is on the rise. Though his words were strong, and his speech peppered with exhortations of hope, Obama seemed unwilling to use an excursion abroad to launch a grueling ideological battle at home. Inside Washington, it was assumed that Donald Trump would try to change the conversation after his debilitating diplomatic performance with Vladimir Putin last week. The bloodcurdling message that followed was spelled out with all capitalized letters. An exasperated press corps was firmly reproached by White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday. And to a degree, it worked. But Iran, a strategic petro-state with a sprawling network of influence throughout the Middle East, understands better than most how to thrive in the shadows. Unlike with North Korea, where there was little appetite for nuclear war in East Asia, the Republican Party is brimming with hard-liners hungry for regime change in Iran. U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and National Security Adviser John Bolton, meanwhile, are all infamously hawkish on Iran. Outside of the neoconservative bubble, meanwhile, fear and consternation are rising. Insiders doubt that another glossy, high-profile summit can fix the problem, especially as relations with North Korea grow increasingly strained. The worst case, these people say, is a world in which Trump ultimately triggers a nuclear-arms race across the region. The Trump Organization, in which he retains a financial stake, is run by his two sons, one of whom has told the press he gives his father quarterly financial reports. Trump regularly hosts foreign heads of state at his for-profit club Mar-a-Lago, where the initiation fee doubled shortly before the inauguration, and where the presidential seal is printed on golf markers. The Chinese government has granted Trump dozens of trademarks. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, for one, seems to think the threat is total bulls--t. McCabe, of course, had his security clearance revoked when he left the F.B.I. in January. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. As seen on Full Frontal Wednesday, Samantha Bee and her merry band of correspondents have devoted themselves to trolling Spicer throughout his book tour, where Spicer has been hawking The Briefing: Politics, the Press, and the President. As one might expect, Harkin did not get a particularly satisfying answer. Then the show followed Spicer to another stop in his hometown of Barrington, Rhode Island. searching for post-Trump success tend to fall into one of two extremes: either they carefully distance themselves from the president, or they lean into the partisan bloodletting. As his successor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was being kicked out of a restaurant in Virginia, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer was getting ready to throw himself a party. For months, the career D.C. flack had been working to rehabilitate his image after being jettisoned from the West Wing last summer. Katie Pavlich. He landed a gig with a paid speaking firm. And he has been working on a pilot for a somewhat jejune talk show called Common Ground, in which he would sit down with people across the political spectrum for a friendly chat over coffee or a pint. For the most part, Spicer has been lucky enough to avoid the worst fallout from the Trump administration, leaving before the Charlottesville catastrophe, and surviving an awkward Emmys appearance with only minor tut-tutting from the left. Fox News, the most obvious home for a former Trump staffer, did not offer Spicer a contract as a commentator. People like Dina Powell, who left the White House on her own terms to rejoin Goldman Sachs, and Gary Cohn, who still has pull on Wall Street, fall into the former group. Spicer, one of the few traditional Republican operatives to join the administration, falls somewhere in between. In the two decades before he joined the Trump administration, Spicer built a reputation in Washington as an acerbic but trustworthy communications official, inclined to chatting amicably with reporters and getting charity haircuts with his Democratic counterpart. An excerpt published by Axios makes it abundantly clear that The Briefing is no scorched-earth memoir in the vein of Fire and Fury, or even A Higher Loyalty. Early reviews have not been kind. Mackowiak asked, rhetorically. If Spicer can stick the landing this week, Mackowiak predicted, he may just survive. Trump, of course, ultimately left Spicer off the guest list when he went to the Vatican, leaving Spicer to fume to colleagues over the slight. The tensions inherent in this project would test the faith of a lesser man. Spicer, in such cases, turns to religion. Spicer, in the hot seat, quickly returned to the unconvincing rhetorical style that ultimately cost him his job. Perkins seemed defeated. The hypocrisy is perhaps most pronounced with rank and file values voters, themselves. As I reported in May, even deeply religious Trump voters mostly feel in line in the wake of the Daniels scandal. The siege mentality, as Spicer vividly illustrated on Thursday morning, can be used to excuse a multitude of sins. Donald Trump fights. Devotees of the political tell-all have their work cut out for them this season. While some have fared better than others, there still seems to be an appetite for more. Judith Giuliani claimed that an affair with a hospital administrator precipitated their pending divorce, an affair that Rudy Giuliani has denied. The soon-to-be-former Mrs. Giuliani already tipped her hand with a sit-down interview to New York magazine from a sushi restaurant in Southhampton just last week. No publishing house has officially bitten yet, and the leak to Page Six, as the gossip sheet notes, could be a tactic deployed to shore up leverage as the divorce get underway in earnest. The Trump brothers love a good book party. The couple started dating shortly after it was announced that Trump and his wife Vanessa had filed for divorce. Guilfoyle was previously married to Gavin Newsom, while he was mayor of San Francisco. The couple divorced in 2006, and she went on to marry furniture heir Eric Villency later that year. Look at arguably two of the most powerful women in Europe: Theresa May and Angela Merkel. The First is set in New Orleans in 2031. There is no scene that is interested in drawing on gender stereotypes. She and her co-stars also met and shared meals with real-life astronauts. A Simple Favor has similar themes; it revolves around Stephanie, a devoted mommy vlogger (Kendrick) and her best friend Emily (Lively), a mysterious, sartorially blessed P.R. exec who up and disappears one day. Which is to say, it loses its mind and takes the audience on a crazy, flashy journey, amping up each plot twist with a bigger, wilder plot twist. The girls grew up in a strict household with a manic father, and one day they snap and set one wing of their giant house on fire, killing him. The story gets picked up in the local news, with folks wondering what happened to the girls. The answer is always money. As Emily explains early on in the film, she and Sean are a little broke. Sean works at a nearby university. She still has her exec job. If anything, they should have found a way to off the house and get some insurance money. Oh, you sweet sucker. Against their better judgment, Stephanie and Sean start hooking up, which makes Emily furious as she watches (somehow) from afar. Emily and Sean meet face-to-face at their beautiful, unsellable house, where he asks all manner of why-would-yous and how-could-yous, hoping to tease a clean, audible confession for the police listening on mic nearby. Then Stephanie turns up wielding a gun and giving Emily her best crazy eyes, trying not so much to tease, but to straight up cudgel a confession. She even shoots Sean in the chest and it looks pretty convincing, with fake blood quickly pooling his chest. Yeah, Emily called them and, putting on her best Stephanie voice, convinced them the meet-up had been changed to another location. Then, she pulls out a surprise gun and actually shoots Sean in the chest. Thus, the moral of the story is that one should never cross Blake Lively . . But it is within the realm of possibility in A Simple Favor, which contains all realms and all possibilities. It was a typical Bannon move, both tonally and strategically. For any other ex-Trump employee, this would seems like overkill. As my colleague Gabriel Sherman recently reported, Bannon has also put together an informal group of people exiled from the inner circle by Chief of Staff John Kelly. Bannon has also worked hard to get to the head of the populist parade in other places. But his reputation stateside has come back to haunt him. Still, even as they forge their separate paths, there will be always be a synergy between Bannon and Trump. First, she parlayed her tenure in the White House into a return to TV via Celebrity Big Brother, where she dropped tantalizingly ominous hints about her time in the administration before using her exit to promote her new tell-all. It also talked about my childhood. Later, though, Noah did note that Trump had frequently made racist comments in the past, about Mexicans, Muslims, and football players, to name just a few. Much like her coy sit-down with Stephen Colbert in March, Omarosa proved that for the most part, she views everything as a branding opportunity. According to new documents obtained by The Guardian, Spicer was forced to call the National Park Service repeatedly on January 21, the day after the inauguration, to ask for more flattering photographs of the crowd on the mall. Common Ground is just the latest in a string of media projects from Spicer, including a podcast and a book, The Briefing: Politics, the Press, and the President, which will be released on July 24. A documentary crew is expected to follow Spicer throughout his book tour as well, the Times reports. Over the past few days, the idea of civility has become a contentious topic, largely thanks to a tweet from current White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders about a restaurant that politely asked her to leave. Especially when those men are Leonardo DiCaprio, Gerard Butler, Jamie Foxx, and Tobey Maguire. As TMZ pointed out, DiCaprio has spent his summer playing volleyball with a crew of celebrities. He was first photographed hitting the court over Fourth of July, during a party that he co-hosted with Sean Penn. The next week, Ansel Elgort was his opponent. Of course, his actual assets are both immaterial and immeasurable. Growing up in a hardscrabble housing block in St. Petersburg, Putin is believed to have taken up judo after he kept getting in fights with bigger kids. When the pro-Russian president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, was overthrown by pro-Western protesters in 2014, Putin quietly deployed masked, unmarked troops to the Crimean peninsula, seized control, and forced the region to hold a referendum declaring Crimea independent. Within two months, a large portion of the country had been annexed by the Russian Federation. The West was stunned again when Putin repeated his shadow war in Eastern Ukraine, engineering a separatist rebellion that was actually backed by thousands of undeclared Russian forces. Despite facing punishing U.S.-led sanctions for his repeated military incursions into Europe, Putin challenged Obama a third time by launching a successful military intervention in 2015 on behalf of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, cooperating with Iranian forces to wipe out the U.S.-backed opposition under the guise of driving back ISIS. Russia, which has been alternatively controlled by Putin as prime minister and president since 1999, experienced a massive increase in living standards during his first presidency, from 2000 to 2008, before the world economic crisis, and later Western sanctions, brought the country to a standstill. The claim could create additional legal headaches for the president and his attorney general. Papadopoulos was hired to the Trump campaign in March 2016. To prove his worth to the campaign, and fueled by this new knowledge and new Russian-connected contacts, Papadopoulos subsequently offered to broker a meeting between Trump and Putin. Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty last year to one count of lying to F.B.I. investigators regarding his contacts with Russian officials, is seeking leniency in sentencing. His lawyers are asking for him to receive the probation that he has already served in the year since his plea last October. In August 2017, the California Democratic candidate reportedly received a fake Microsoft Office e-mail prompting him to enter his password. He did so, but quickly realized the e-mail had been malicious, and advised his staffers to take the appropriate precautions. In a vacuum, the attacks would be cause for concern. Separate attempts at meddling have occurred on social-media sites. A few weeks ago, Facebook announced that it had discovered new, malicious accounts on Facebook and Instagram designed to influence elections by targeting divisive social issues, similar to the effort put forth by the Russia-linked Internet Research Agency in advance of the 2016 election. Yet the Trump administration has done painfully little to prevent these attacks.

In early April, the United States announced it would impose a highly aggressive set of sanctions against Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch and close ally of Vladimir Putin, and his aluminum company, Rusal. Hive on Cheddar. Previously, he was an editor at MSNBC and a policy analyst at the Century Foundation. Previously, he was an editor at MSNBC and a policy analyst at the Century Foundation. Actor, martial artist, and Vladimir Putin bromance partner Steven Seagal has a new honor from Russia. Since then, relations between the U.S. and Russia have hit a little bit of a slide, compounded by an investigation into Russian hackers employed by the Kremlin that influenced the election of Donald Trump in 2016. He regularly ALL CAPS tweets at world leaders, in a style more befitting a crazy, old man yelling at his microwave than the leader of the most powerful country in the world. He frequently refers to himself in the third person. He claims to have invented a phrase that have been in use for nearly a century. The list, obviously, goes on. Bolton, an uncompromising hawk, was expected to become an authoritative figure in the White House. Fearing a repeat at the upcoming NATO summit, Bolton reportedly led a contingent of senior administration officials in an effort to finalize a formal policy agreement with allies before Trump arrived at the forum. The president reportedly did not read the 23-page NATO declaration in full. Of course, the ongoing efforts of administration officials to control the president are only ever effective for so long. Within a week of the NATO summit, Trump called into question his commitment to Article 5 of the NATO charter, the principle that an attack on one alliance member is an attack on all. When Fox News host Tucker Carlson asked the president during an interview why he would send his son to defend Montenegro, Trump responded sympathetically. As Donald Trump pleads with the war-mongering media to give peace a chance with Russia, the right-wing intellectual apparatus surrounding his presidency is preparing for a more titanic clash of civilizations. Bannon, of course, has been fixated on the threat arising in the East for years. So has Trump, who has been ranting about shifty Asian interlopers since the 1980s. Both, after all, represent potent geopolitical risks to the United States. For years, Moscow has waged a covert campaign to disrupt democratic institutions in Europe and the United States, propped up abhorrent regimes in the Middle East, and thwarted U.S. diplomatic efforts around the world. China has quickly become a muscular economic power seeking to project its influence across Asia and into Africa. For Bannon, China and the former Ottoman Empire, as he calls it, are civilizational threats. Bannon, who has spent the year since his eviction from the White House supporting proto-fascist movements throughout Europe, neatly elucidated the importance of this alliance in a 2014 talk at the Vatican. This mind-meld is more than philosophical. As Jeet Heer notes in The New Republic, the ideology underpinning a potential geopolitical re-alignment is also racial. Still, there is a rich irony in the way Trump and the Bannonites have gone about trying to establish this new world order. Bannon, however, seems to have a longer game in mind. That movement, until recently, had been mostly kept at bay. But a new era of mass immigration, Islamophobia, and a rising China could change the equation. and former U.S. officials were stunned. Back in Washington, officials braced for the worst. Onlookers across the political spectrum were stunned. It was nothing short of cowardly for Trump to effectively side with Putin against our intelligence and law-enforcement communities . . . Even so, the spectacle that followed was flabbergasting. Others on Capitol Hill and within the diplomatic community were at a loss for words. Another sent me a video animation of a man motioning that his mind was blown. But at least one administration official I spoke with was slightly optimistic in their assessment of the Helsinki summit. But neither Putin nor Trump offered specific examples of what this new camaraderie would entail. And for Putin, it certainly was a win. A former K.G.B. officer, Putin managed to appear stoic throughout much of the press conference, deftly spinning Trump with a combination of flattery and disdainful remarks that went over his head. He appeared to suppress a laugh after a reporter asked whether Russia had compromising information about Trump. Back in Washington, the backlash from both sides of the aisle was intense and immediate. Shortly after the Trump-Putin train wreck, I spoke with Robert Grant, a former top F.B.I. agent and colleague of Robert Mueller. This would not have been done in a vacuum. He should have defended his own intelligence community. hook line and sinker . . . He is a clear & present danger to America. Republicans can no longer be quiet. Putin, of course, has outwardly denied everything (though his literal giggle when asked whether Russia has dirt on Trump may have been something of a giveaway). He did so again during a follow-up interview with Chris Wallace, during which the Fox News host raised several theories as to why the 45th president is seemingly scared to cross him. He was in the construction business. He organized the beauty pageants. I treat President Trump with utmost respect. And yet, even here Trump has proven unusually hesitant to contradict his Russian B.F.F. Expectations had been low following a disastrous G7 summit in Canada last month, during which the American president threw candies at Angela Merkel, left early, refused to sign a joint communique, and spent his departing flight tweeting insults at Justin Trudeau, before arriving in Singapore for a chummy photo op with Kim Jong Un. More worrisome for NATO veterans was the perception that the U.S. president had gone into the meeting planning to derail the summit. Departing Brussels on Thursday for London, where he promptly ignited a diplomatic row with Theresa May, Trump congratulated himself on his performance. It was not immediately clear, however, what new commitments had been extracted. It seems unlikely the bluster will be effective. They simply stopped caring and have been trying to work around him. . . . Worse, Burns said, Trump undermined his own negotiating power with Putin ahead of their summit on Monday. Trump, for his part, appeared unbothered by these potential ramifications as the NATO summit was winding down. During the news conference on Thursday, Trump left open the possibility that he would recognize the Crimean peninsula, which Putin invaded in 2014, as part of Russia.
