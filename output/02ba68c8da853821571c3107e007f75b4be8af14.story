High near 70F. Winds NW at 10 to 15 mph.. Tonight Partly cloudy skies. Slight chance of a rain shower. Low 38F. Winds ENE at 5 to 10 mph. An early thaw turned their campsite into a muddy cesspool. The local tribes were concerned that snowmelt would inevitably wash tons of garbage and waste into the Cannonball River. Of course, it's impossible to remove every drop and particle of waste. The Missouri River downstream from the Cannonball is almost certainly polluted. The Sierra Club and Greenpeace were among the organizations that compensated them. Among environmentalists, these organizations are respected and considered responsible. The Dakota Access protest is reported to have provided inspiration and a blueprint for protests against pipelines elsewhere. If future protests don't include facilities for waste disposal, they will do only harm. In the spirit of good environmentalism, recycle bins should also be provided. They know how to handle oil spills and will respond immediately. Oil doesn't mix with water like sewage does. Cheap energy from fossil fuels now supplies 86 percent of the world's energy and has kept seven billion people from starving. It's good reading. Stop watching this discussion.

Report Add Reply H Miller Apr 18, 2017 1:33pm I watched the video because I am open to any new facts to get to the truth. The way everyone should be. Unfortunately, the video is completely ambiguous to what is actually happening, and it states this at the end of your article that you cited, but failed to include with your comment. But of course they didn't ask the questions. And that is from a far left website. But the trash is from the protesters. For all his talking on the video, he never went up and asked the people what they were doing. That is all he had to do. But instead he just sat in his truck and speculated. That is not concrete evidence. It is him providing his own narrative without the facts. (That are sitting right in front of him) This is not proof of anything other than getting all the trash collected in one spot. And the narrator isn't sure or not if one truck full of trash is from the protesters. But he never said it wasn't their trash. Because he knows they left a big garbage mess, as he pans his shot across mounds of other garbage he knows came from them. After seeing the video, I believe more now that they left a terrible garbage problem. You are doing the same thing you are accusing Mr. Ferguson of doing. And no, I have never read or listened to breitbart ever. When I looked online for more concrete information, I found almost only postings from virulently alt-right websites that make the John Birch Society look like a PTA meeting, and various outlets of Fox Fraudcasting. This does not fill me with confidence and credulity. I located another information source that presented contradictory material, and provided some pretty specific detail. I posted that material and cited the source so readers could make their own determination of credibility. You argue that source is not credible, but you did not refute even one of the statements made there. Then, when refuted, you huff and puff in self-righteous indignation, while just repeating the same ridiculous fabrications all over again. Rather, it just makes your arguments look silly. They're just lies. Report Add Reply H Miller Apr 19, 2017 2:37pm FB- I was about to give in to your complete and utter false claims, but then I had a moment of clarity to take one minute to search for myself. Yes, Mr. Ferguson should have cited sources and I should have done my own search first. You are either completely inept at research or are purposely lying to this audience. My paragrahs 2,3,and 4 are all filled with refuting your statements. Paragraph 2 is straight out of your own source, refuting your statements. On the other hand, you have refuted none, I repeat, none of my statements I made. Again that is none, did you understand that. And none of these are personal insults, like your entire paragraph 3 is and accusing me of fabrications (which I take very seriously). Instead of creative writing, I think you needed debate, because your statements have been proven to be completely and utterly false. Your defense of this garbage mess is essentially a fraud. But of course they didn't ask the questions. And that is from a far left website. But the trash is from the protesters. For all his talking on the video, he never went up and asked the people what they were doing. That is all he had to do. But instead he just sat in his truck and speculated.

Because he knows they left a big garbage mess, as he pans his shot across mounds of other garbage he knows came from them. After seeing the video, I believe more now that they left a terrible garbage problem. You looked for sources that said what you wanted to hear, and found them almost entirely on the far right. Report H Miller Apr 20, 2017 9:19am To FB comment below - You neglected to mention Northcountry NPR, that is NPR, National Public Radio, or don't you know about them. It is one of my staples for news information, and everyone on the left of the political spectrum. I can't believe you even believe what you think. Even when the truth is pushed right in your face. You should have just said, they screwed up and I hope they learn from it. And this has nothing to do with the pipeline. I liked how you tossed that in their to distract from the real issue. That outlet is located in upstate New York, and anything they broadcast wouldn't be from direct reporting. Semi trucks have been hauling debris out of camp and people here are piling garbage into bags. I'd bet you were one who swallowed the criminally fraudulent edited video of Planned Parenthood. You really should be a little less gullible about the fake news coming out of those alt-right sources that you let do your thinking for you. Report Dale Ferguson May 23, 2017 3:17am I wanted to add a lot more material, including citing sources, but the Valley Journal limits letters to 350 words. My primary source was the Washington Times for Monday March 17, 2017. And it was the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who did the cleanup, not Morton County Sheriff's Department. That is the progressive movement in a nutshell. Progressives look down on us hippies, but it is the hippies that have the higher ground here and they always will. Maybe the progressives could learn something in this aftermath, but that would take them understanding there are other opinions that matter. They will never admit they made a mistake, and they shout down anyone who doesn't agree. They constitute anarchy, not even close to democracy. Truly pathetic Chris. Again, you have nothing relevant to say. So you say nothing of relevance. Lets hear your defense of this letter to the editor, instead of just one more personal attack. Hit to close to home. Since you didn't condemn what they left at the protest site, you have just endorsed it. It should have been easy for you to say this was wrong to do to the land. Sort of reminds me of something I have said before. And your exclamation points just top it off. I laughed for a good 5 seconds. thanks. Because they will do nothing that doesn't get media attention. Get out there and start cleaning chris. Report Add Reply Dori Skrukrud Apr 18, 2017 1:44pm Relax and cut with the tension. It was a joke. I thought about the argument but opted for the joke instead. If you like it fine, if not oh well. . . . . CHRIS HARRIS Report H Miller Apr 19, 2017 1:40pm CH below - I don't have strong opinion one way or another about DAPL. But I do have a strong opinion about keeping the environment clean. If I misread your intent I apologize. The destruction to the land with the leftover garbage should have never happened. I am not a true hippy, but can identify with their main ideals, heard about the Rainbow Family previously and went for a day outside Dillon. A bunch of media attention happened, tv and paper, about the possible land degredation. And it proved to be no worries. Now DAPL leaves this mess and it is barely reported, and it took me all of 1 minute to find reputable news media that had reported it. (see response to FB above) Report Welcome to the discussion.
