President Trump on Thursday used Twitter to rip into the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which quickly returned fire as Republicans turned on one another a week after the collapse of their ObamaCare repeal plan. No shame, Mr. President. Almost everyone succumbs to the D.C. Establishment. it's a swamp not a hot tub. We both came here to drain it. Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said nothing as he sprinted onto the House floor for the final votes of the week. Labrador later responded to Trump on Twitter. Remember who your real friends are. The public infighting is unlikely to help Republicans get back on track with their agenda. While Ryan said at a news conference that he understood why the president was frustrated, in a separate interview he broke with Trump by stating that he did not want to work with Democrats on healthcare. Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), a Trump ally and member of the centrist Tuesday Group, affirmed at a meeting Wednesday that it will not meet with the Freedom Caucus to negotiate changes to an ObamaCare replacement bill. This week there have been suggestions, particularly from conservative rank-and-file Republicans, that the party should return to healthcare. But there has been no signs of progress in bridging differences between the center and right of the GOP, and Ryan on Thursday said a pause was likely necessary. Some conservative media outlets have blamed Ryan and GOP leaders for mishandling the ObamaCare fight. Several Freedom Caucus members echoed arguments that they were protecting Trump from an unpopular bill. Franks refused to criticize Trump for whipping support for the bill or attacking conservatives for its failure. Noticeably absent from the meeting were any representatives from four outside conservative groups that opposed the healthcare bill: FreedomWorks, Club for Growth, Heritage Action and Americans for Prosperity.
