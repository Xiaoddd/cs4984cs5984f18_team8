Instead, this story is about something else entirely, as you will see. Moving their money to a credit union is a strong moral statement, and one that should be the front and center of this story. I was honored to be asked to accompany them as they went to Citizens to close their accounts. There is a bank inside the building on the first floor, so we went inside and sat down. I asked. Having processed this new information, the man turned to me and Anusha. I asked. Just outside please. In the lobby. I asked. All right. I asked, referring to Anusha. This was ridiculous, since I had my Nikon camera around my neck and I was only taking pictures of M and Anusha, and being quite obvious about it when I did so. I also felt bad, because Citizens is obviously not paying its bank employees enough if they also have to work selling cellphones. I asked, gesturing to my camera. You know that as well as I do. I walked out into the lobby of Citizens Plaza, followed by the Man from Citizens, where two uniformed Providence Police Officers were waiting. Anusha and M were still inside the bank. I asked, surprised. The officer sighed. The officer was getting annoyed now. I asked. I asked. More annoyance. I waited a while in the lobby with the officers. Then I saw Anusha and M outside, their transactions completed. I went outside to take their pictures. They left and I waited outside for a half an hour as the police stood inside the lobby of One Citizens Plaza. I thought we were all waiting for someone show up and deliver the paper that would show that I had been cited for trespass. I was on the phone with my editor Bob Plain when I realized that the cops had left the scene through the opposite door. I never got my notice of trespass.
