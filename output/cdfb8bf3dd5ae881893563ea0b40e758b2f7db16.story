Although the climbers were eventually arrested, they were up in the rafters for over two hours before descending, as their message was broadcast not only to the tens of thousands in the stadium, but also to the hundreds of thousands more watching the game at home. The game was attended by 66,872 people and viewed by many more watching at home, not to mention the widespread coverage the action garnered as the media reacted to the ongoing protest. Some boos were audible over the TV microphones, but Zimmerman said reception in the stadium was largely positive. When we were dabbing and stuff and rappelling down, people were excited about that. I also heard reactions from a lot of people that there was sort of a delayed response. When the banner came down, people were saying it looked so official that they thought, oh, this is part of the stadium or part of the game. More importantly, Zimmerman said he has heard of many people who have closed their accounts with US Bank since the protest. Many sports fans still respond negatively towards any attempt to bring social issues into the arena. I asked Zimmerman about his response to the accusation that actions like his are imposing on what some fans consider to be a safe space. The native people who are affected by this pipeline, who are having sacred sites bulldozed and having their land taken away, the health of their water threatened, and treaties not recognized. As a sports fans, I want to know that this is happening. Zimmerman suggested there are two ways to truly end the fight. Zimmerman and Holiday were both arrested for trespassing, and a third person, Carolyn Feldman, was arrested for obstructing the legal process. In the meantime, the fight continues. We encourage people to take action and get involved. They can visit our website or organize actions of their own. They can encourage friends and family to pull their money out of their US Bank accounts. With President Trump in office and already working to advance the pipeline despite the potential ecological disaster and the violations of treaties with the Standing Rock Sioux, the fight may be just beginning. I asked Zimmerman if he thought sporting events offered promise as a future staging area for protests, whether for the movement against the Dakota Access Pipeline or other causes. And lots of positive coverage. That includes positive response from many many people before the game. Zimmerman was there for Standing Rock, but his inner Vikings fan took delight at the events of January 1st as well, a 38-10 domination of the rival Chicago Bears. Sports in America, particularly football, reach broad swaths of the general population in a way few cultural avenues can match. As Zimmerman and Holiday showed on January 1, that reach can do wonders in advancing a valuable cause like the one against the Dakota Access Pipeline. It will be well worth watching if others follow their example in the future.
