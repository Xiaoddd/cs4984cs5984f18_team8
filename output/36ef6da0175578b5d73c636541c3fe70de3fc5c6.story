Jack Dalyrmple The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning that will bring heavy snow through Wednesday to the area. Last Friday, the U.S Army Corps of Engineers sent a letter to Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II saying all campers must vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp by December 5, 2016. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Jack Dalrymple, Governor of the State of North Dakota, order a mandatory evacuation of all persons located in areas under the proprietary jurisdiction of the United States Army Corps of Engineers located in Morton County, and defined as a prohibited area in Exhibit A of the United States Army Corps of Engineers memorandum provided to the Morton County Sheriff on November 25th, 2016 and attached to this order. This definition of the evacuation area shall remain in effect even if the United States Army Corps of Engineers redefines or removes these prohibited areas. These persons are ordered to leave the evacuation area immediately, and are further ordered not to return to the evacuation area. All persons in the evacuation area shall take all their possessions with them upon their evacuation. Any action or inaction taken by any party which encourages persons to enter, reenter, or remain in the evacuation area will be subject to penalties as defined in law. Any person who chooses to enter, reenter, or stay in the evacuation does so at their own risk, and assumes any and all corresponding liabilities for their unlawful presence and occupation of the evacuation area. N.D.C.C. with authority to direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or threatened area within the state if the governor deems this action necessary for the preservation of life or other disaster or emergency mitigation, response, or recovery; and A coordinated and effective effort of all state departments is required to minimize the impact of disasters and emergencies in this state. This order is effective immediately, and it shall remain in effect until rescinded. Executed at Bismarck, North Dakota, this 28th day of November, 2016.

Enid Lessne 2 years ago Ms. DeWeese, I have written Senators Wyden & Merkley (Oregon), Senator Sanders (Vermont) and Congressman DeFazio (Oregon) the following email message. I do not know if they will do as I asked, but it is worth a shot. I intend to go to Standing Rock, Lake Oahe on December 4th when Our Veterans will be arriving. I want to offer my support of NODAPL and be available if Medical Assistance is needed. You care about your Constituents and the people of The United States. It would also deny the water protectors access to emergency vehicles and incoming supplies as well as the refusal to allow new water protectors into that area. It is Sioux sacred land that was given to them in the treaties signed by the U. S. Government and the Sioux Nation. And, that portion of the pipeline would run under Lake Oahe and then continue to the Missouri River. Enid Lessne, R. N., B. S. N. (Retired) Lena Toledo 2 years ago Very good intentions Enid. Should the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe have completed their Integrated Resources Management Plan (IRMP) when President Clinton provided it to all federally-recognized tribes across Indian Country under his Executive Order 12898 (1994 a comprehensive plan). The tribal members of Standing Rock would have had massive employment opportunities as never before, more than adequate housing needed now more than ever, road improvement needed desperately especially now for the outlying family homes, vast improvement of needed infrastructure repairs, quality health care headed by medical personnel instead of a councilmember related sibling who has absolutely no medical background etc. Most vital this IRMP provided designation of every parcel of land that is to be protected from any intrusion e.g. DAPL inclusive of sacred burial grounds and cultural sites. Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has had 22 years to have completed it although the year 2004 marked the deadline, however, could have been extended. The tribal membership has suffered under 30 years of tribal governing tyranny and has finally resulted into this embarrassing FUBAR protest. Indian tribes were provided their own way of governing in 1934 and Standing Rock is showing its corrupt pattern of practice. Enid Lessne 2 years ago Ms. Toledo, Thank you for replying to my post. I am not a Native American Indian, so I was not aware of the legislation that you mentioned. Because of this fact, I had some difficulty following your explanations. They are not stupid and ignorant people. If the weather gets worse the children, elders, will be removed if they wish to be. I think the State of North Dakota has pushed their tyranny way to far. And still the President refuses to act. A true believer to the end. izopnyde Mary Miskanis 2 years ago He can say what he wants and order what he wants but the TREATY over-rides anything the state orders. IT is in the constitution. look at the 1st amendment 2nd clause of the amendment- Look up the Supremacy Clause in the US constitution 2nd clause- IT specifically talks about TREATY land which is FEDERAL and that the state has NO control and in fact the FEDERAL MARSHALS should be there protecting these AMERICANS because of what has happened- The black snake will die Angel 2 years ago Good point, among many. This is pure evil vs. good people with rights. Hard to comprehend. Enid Lessne 2 years ago Ms. Miskanis, Thank you for the information you provided. I have written to both of my State Senators, my State Congressman and Senator Sanders in regards to interceding in this matter. I have already received a response from Senator Merkley. I strongly suggest that ALL OF US WRITE TO OUR SENATORS, REPRESENTATIVES AND THE POTUS. There IS strength in numbers. My immediate concern is the 2016-8 evacuation order by North Dakota Governor Dalrymple for December 5th. The area in question is presently deemed Federal property, not State property. The Governor does not have the authority to put an evacuation order into place, nor does he have the power to block roadways leading to that area preventing emergency accessibility or Private Citizens from entering that area- that authority would only come from the USACE themselves, the POTUS or the SCOTUS. Also, the original site for that piece of the DAPL was to run underground in Bismark, North Dakota. Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, in her infinite wisdom, urged that it be moved to the Oceti Sakowin site instead. Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II did speak with some officials of the DAPL as well as the USACE, and he gave them an alternative site for the DAPL which diverted the pipeline away from the Oceti Sakowin site (by a SMALL logistical degree). His suggestion was COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN by both of them. There is a videotape of that formal meeting. I do not know the date of that meeting, but you can easily get it from Chairman Archambault II. The Sioux Nation does not wish to stop the DAPL totally (though they should, due to significant environmental concerns). What the Sioux Nation is asking for is a diversion of the pipeline away from the Standing Rock, Lake Oache parcel. The request made by Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II was and is a reasonable as well as a viable alternative to the present plan of construction. If DAPL were willing to accept that alternative and re-route the pipeline in that particular area, the proposed diversion plan could be put into play quickly. It has also come to my attention that both Senator Heitkamp (responding to pressure from Bismarck residents and possible kickbacks from the DAPL owners) and Governor Dalrymple (who has personal funds invested in DAPL) has vested interests on the DAPL moving ahead according to its current plan without delay. Senator Merkley, again I urge you (if not beg you) to please get this matter corrected- STARTING WITH THE IMMEDIATE REVERSAL OF EVACUATION ORDER 2016-8 WHICH IS TO GO INTO AFFECT ON DECEMBER 5TH. Thank you in advance for taking the time to listen to my concerns, and acting in good faith on behalf of the Sioux Sovereign Nation as well as the Entire U. S. of America. Seriously, thank you for all you are doing. Beverly Samples 2 years ago I think the only way you are going to get people to leave there is to LISTEN to them. Problem solved. The Sioux have been around longer than this country was and they know how to survive, but taking away more of their rights is just downright inhuman. Arby 2 years ago This is what a corporate fascist police state looks like. TribalMember and Proud of it. 2 years ago Whereas, he needs to go back to the 1851 Treaty and educate himself on it. INTERNATIONAL LAWS. So he has no jurisdiction in this. Also, I bet the ones building the pipeline would still continue the construction of the pipeline despite the weather. Drink no poisoned water . . . izopnyde 2 years ago Agreement with the Indians. TribalMember and Proud of it. Meaning what that oil company is doing , is EXACTLY THAT, attempting to INVALIDATE the Fort Laramie TREATY OF 1851 Please site that source of where you read this document. Thank you. To the Editor of the web site, would you please have to Chairman and Tribal Council read these comments. This can help the cause, as it states the facts the tribe has been brining to the attention of the governor and the DOJ. This needs to be read on the 8th when they discuss the Treaty of 1851 at the White House. THIS IS IMPORTANT. Judith 2 years ago Good try to play God, Governor, but God is legally and morally on the side of Native People. Cannot buy them off with diseased blankets and plastic beads. For heavens sake treat these people with respect and consider the good of all, not the company you hope to make profits. Too many in positions with conflicts of interests. Good luck next election. izopnyde 2 years ago If you like this. Drink no poisoned water. . . I stand with The People of Standing Rock. I stand with The People of Puerto Rico. I stand with The People of the Aleutian Islands. . . . Stand up and dance izopnyde izopnyde 2 years ago That particular quote was found in the Cornell law website. Also, If you like that. Drink no poisoned water. . . I stand with The People of Standing Rock. I stand with The People of Puerto Rico. I stand with The People of the Aleutian Islands. . . . Enid Lessne 2 years ago Ms. Mahan, Neither the N. D. Governor or President-Elect Trump have any motivation for helping the Sovereign Native American Nations on this issue. The REASON- the N. D. Governor, has financial interests in the DA. Help support Native News Online by clicking on our sponsors' advertisements.
