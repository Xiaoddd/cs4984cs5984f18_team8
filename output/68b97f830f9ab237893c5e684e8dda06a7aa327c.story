Block Kavanaugh's nomination. Things has calmed down when I arrived, but still definitely tense, since police were still macing water protectors. And then, I heard the gun pop off, and the woman a few feet from me was the one who got hit. Her name is Erin Schrode. I have never seen anything like it.... Pictures and videos... do not do justice.... The majority of America is seeing boiled down clips... this stand-off goes on and on and on.... it is totally insane... totally, totally insane and wrong. If she is still around, I will try to get an interview and update again. Militarized police fired at me from point blank range with a rubber bullet on the front lines of Standing Rock. My body will be okay, but I am hurting, I am incensed, I am weeping, I am scared. Peaceful, prayerful, unarmed, nonviolent people on one side of a river; militarized police with armed vehicles and assault weapons occupying treaty land on the other, where sacred burial grounds have already been destroyed. What is happening here in North Dakota is li ... ke nothing I have ever seen in my life, anywhere in the world. This is a fight to protect and defend the water for 17 million people in the watershed downstream to the Gulf, for a livable planet, for Native and human rights, for the lifeforce of us all. We are at the confluence of the movements for civil rights, for the environment, for peace, for justice. Standing Rock represents the exploitation of a long-oppressed people, illegal land seizure, crude oil transport, media censorship, national security threat, public health crises, and more human rights violations than I can count. It is unjustifiable for the Attorney General to not be here. It is unconscionable for mainstream media to not cover this. It is indefensible for all politicians to not condemn what is occurring here. It is disgraceful for more people to not speak out and show up to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. Pray for the water protectors, for justice, for our people and our world.
