Instead, the US Army Corps of Engineers will look at alternative routes, a statement by the campaigners said. The Sioux have been protesting since April against the pipeline which is near a reservation. The multi-billion dollar pipeline, which runs close to the Standing Rock Sioux Native American Indian reservation, is nearly 1,200 miles (1,900km) long. It is nearly complete except for the lake section. The Dakota Pipeline stand-off explained The Sioux, along with other Native Americans, oppose the pipeline because they fear it will contaminate drinking water and run over sacred burial sites. Hundreds of US military veterans joined the activists last week. The campaigners, who have numbered thousands, have endured bitter temperatures and had been ordered to leave the area by Monday.

But he denies his policy is related to any financial interest. The protests, on federal land, have seen clashes between the demonstrators and law enforcement.
