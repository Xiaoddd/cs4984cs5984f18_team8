URGENT Message from Standing Rock as Police Surround Their Camp Video sent to Shaun King from Standing Rock on February 21, 2017. URGENT. My friends in Standing Rock just sent this to me & asked me to share it. They are surrounded by militarized police RIGHT NOW. A heroic battle by the Standing Rock Sioux, some 200 other Native American peoples, and many thousands of others has blocked completion of DAPL for nearly a year. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum claimed the state was issued the order to evacuate Oceti Sakowin camp because rising floodwaters could endanger people there and threaten to contaminate the waters of the Missouri because of debris and waste supposedly left in the camp. Most outrageously, the biggest environmental danger is the pipeline itself, which is scheduled to carry 470,000 barrels of Earth-killing oil a day. Photo: AP. Little more than a week later, the Corps dropped its promised environmental impact study of the pipeline and instead granted an easement to Energy Transfer Partners, the conglomerate building the pipeline, to finish it. This easement allows construction of one of the sections of DAPL which most directly threatens the Standing Rock Sioux and the environment: the 1.25-mile section under Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri River, just north of the current boundaries of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation (and through lands and waters granted to the Sioux nation under an 1851 treaty). North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum claimed the state had issued the order to evacuate Oceti Sakowin camp because rising floodwaters could endanger people there and threaten to contaminate the waters of the Missouri because of debris and waste supposedly left in the camp. This outrageous statement twists truth beyond recognition. First, while this camp is on Army Corps of Engineers land, that land was granted to the Sioux by treaty in 1851 and subsequently stolen by the U.S. government. Pipeline leaks would threaten the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux, and the 27 tribes and 18 million people downriver who depend on water from the Missouri. On February 1, over 70 water protectors were arrested in a vicious and unjustified government assault. Now these assaults are intensifying, not just aimed at completing the pipeline, but also breaking the powerful resistance that has emerged at Standing Rock against the crimes this system is carrying out against Native peoples, and the accelerating climate crisis, driven in large part by the burning of the fossil fuels DAPL will be carrying. This resistance has resonated with and inspired millions across the U.S. and globally. New bills are being introduced and debated in the North Dakota legislature to increase criminal penalties against those who refuse to leave the protest camp or continue to resist DAPL. Journalists have been targeted, arrested, in some cases strip-searched, and hit with serious charges simply for covering the resistance. There are reports that militarized police are being positioned on high ground near the camp. A different world IS possible. Check out and order online the Constitution for the New Socialist Republic in North America (Draft Proposal). Ominously, the Guardian (February 10) reported that an FBI anti-terrorism task force was investigating Standing Rock activists and that at least six face serious federal charges. Water Protectors Vow to Continue the Battle Hundreds of resisters are still at Standing Rock, new encampments are being set up, and many are vowing to stay and continue the fight. Others, including military veterans, are returning to defend the water protectors. People at Standing Rock have called for nationwide actions in support of their struggle. There have already been a number of important actions, including demonstrations, benefit concerts, and other events. This call from the resisters at Standing Rock needs to be taken up even more broadly, urgently, and energetically. The battle at Standing Rock is a key battle against oppression and environmental destruction.
