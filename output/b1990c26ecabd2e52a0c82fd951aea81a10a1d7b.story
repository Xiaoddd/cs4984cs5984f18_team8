FULL TRANSCRIPT: (Please note - this transcript was copied from an electronic captioning service. We might have insight into those answers tonight. Ryan Rauschenberger may have found a way to use the tax code. Finally, some way to use the tax code to figure out who is paying the dapl protesters and how much they are being paid. The Dakota access pipeline could have oil running through it as early as next week. Commissioner, great to see you, thank so much, sir. I hear you've been doing your own investigative journalism to use the tax code to find out who is paying these protesters and how much. We are looking to the paid protest activity that occurred last few months in North Dakota. We're looking at not only those who might have been paid to perform protest activities o here in the state, but also those who have paid them. We're looking at 10 the 99 enforcement, like you should be paying a contractor who performs work in the state and basically those protesters were here, if they were paid, they were here performing work for somebody. That is key. It doesn't matter who you're performing services for. If you are earning income you should be paying income taxes here in North Dakota. So we're working on those enforcement efforts right now. You were saying if they were paid. RR: Well, that's a great question. That's really the first step is to find out one, if the protesters were paid. And if so, who was paying them. We are allocating some time, doing some work to find out, who was being paid and who provided that compensation. It is a tedious compliance process, but when you think about it, you know, the filing season isn't even done until April 15th. So we have until then to see who is fighting, who is not filing, and then later in the year we have more information to see who issued 1099s and who essentially has been complying with the state tax laws and who has not. It is an instantaneous great I have occasion when it comes to tax compliance as much as we wish it was. We have more information, compiling information about who may have been paying the protesters who were paid to be here. And then going from there. So there is a lot of upfront work. RR: Well, that is one of the things we're looking into. That's a great point. I've made a lot of different comments about the fact that when it comes to the GoFundMe account, that's where the money is at, millions of dollars have flowed through those. We're looking into, one, who actually was contributing to those accounts, and who received them and were those dollars being used in the way they were intended to be used. There's a lot of money flowing through those GoFundMe accounts. It's a little more gray area when it comes to tax compliance as opposed to a direct check from a contractor like a 1099. That's where most of the money went. We're looking into IRS guidance. They do have vague guidance on how that money should be treated. Sometimes it depends on how it was contributed. So we really have to look at it on a case by case basis, which is very work intensive, unfortunately. There is no one size fits all when it comes to IRS guidance, that's for sure. When you think about it, we do have to look at big dollar amounts, who was contributing and where they were going. CB: Obviously you can tack on late fees if they don't file 1099s. RR: That is one of the tough lines. We have a lot of information off of social media, Craigslist, where they're soliciting for people to be paid and receive payment. So there's a lot of evidence leading up to that. I don't like to get into all of the different compliance techniques we have. When it comes to auditing and tax collecting, we don't like to play every card we have at one time but we are looking into it, I can say that and we are making headway. CB: That obviously is great news, maybe WikiLeaks can give you software to help out. That's a joke. Many people are insinuating that the railroads were paying protesters. There's no proof of that. RR: Well, it's a great point that basically when oil is taxed in North Dakota, it is on the gross value of a barely of oil. But less the amount for transportation. Barrel. That's the only deduction in law that oil producers get when selling oil. That's a huge deal of property tax relief. Those are all dedicated revenue syndromes. That's just on oil tax alone. CB: Commissioner, that is huge, huge news, I don't think anybody has talked about it. I've got 30 seconds left. I want to get your initial thoughts -- the forecast is coming out tomorrow. RR: I'll tell you that there's a lot of positive aspects in the forecast. However, we're in a new economic norm in North Dakota, so whole see some reductions in revenues for what the legislature has to base their appropriation. You can expect more cuts from the legislature based on -- CB: Wow. RR: Well, when you think about it the legislature came in just below where the executive came in last November. RR: Absolutely. Thanks for having me on.
