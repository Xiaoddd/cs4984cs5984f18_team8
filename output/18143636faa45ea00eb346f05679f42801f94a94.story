Advocate for people, ready to work, ready to serve. I was making my way to the front lines carrying a backpack with goggles, water, ear plugs, hand warmers, a blanket and many other items that have become necessary in fighting against a militarized force that only protects the interests of an oil pipeline. I saw a medic in a minivan yelling for people to get out of the way as she transported this young man in the crowded back seat. So I jumped into the front seat to help him. I told him, the van making its way through the bumpy road as I leaned from the front seat to the back. yelled Holly, a first responder in her everyday life. I assured him as we made our way down the hundreds of flags that make up the entrance of the camp. A whirlwind of thoughts swirled through my mind on our current immigration system, the incoming president, the thousands detained in detention centers, the fight for justice and what that fight looks like across this county. Just so many thoughts as I reassured this young man as he cried out in pain. Soon, we were at the medic tent and he was taken in. Holly and I grabbed masks to pass out and we headed back in. A medic helps a woman hit by tear gas. I saw grandmothers crying from pain, grown men in tears throwing up from the toxic fumes, young women shivering from the cold temperatures after being blasted with a water cannon. I stood there almost frozen with my backpack as people rushed in front of me in chaos. It was a state of war. A war being fought in our own land over the protection of water. At some point after helping multiple people suffering from hypothermia, nausea, and gas, I got caught up in a blast of three tear gas bombs. I looked up and realized how close I was to the barb wire and the physical front line. I closed my eyes immediately and tried to control my breath. I felt the gas come into my lungs, fast, hot and toxic. I opened my eyes for a moment and felt the sting hit. I gagged. I heard all those around me gag, yell in pain and cry out. I kept my eyes shut, I held my breath. At that moment, I remembered the tunnel games, hold your breath Wendy, you can do this. I remember pretending to be the Little Mermaid and if she could swim to the surface, so could I. In this moment, this random things I did as a child, seem to have a purpose. Small breath, count to ten, stay calm. Blindly I kept walking, hearing the shuffling of people around. I heard someone yell out. When I felt we had walked a safe distance, I opened my eyes again. I was fine, I caught my breath, feeling the cold crisp air fill my lungs. I exhaled. I coughed for a good minute. Around me, people were crying, their eyes yellow from the gas. I thought of my own family and my own mother who worries so much. Some twenty minutes later, a flash grenade went off and I felt a slew of tiny pellets hit the left side of my face. No longer at the very front of the lines, I kept helping as much as I could. Some people had blankets, someone brought more water and someone else passed some bread. I reached in to my pocket and realized in the mayhem, I lost my phone. A medic shared that at least 167 people were injured tonight. Those are the ones that are counted. Never in my life have I experienced such raw and vicious human rights abuses. A police held a water cannon directly behind a friends head, it could have given him a concussion. Flash grenades where shot directly at people. They are scared. They are scared of the power of prayer, the power of people. That is why they treated us the way they did. A tear gas canister is thrown by police into the crowd. Not true. The fires were started by tear gas canisters thrown by police that hit dry brush. Plain and simple.
