This week, NoDAPL activists at the Lakota Law Project released what is perhaps the most direct appeal to that second arena to date: A short, emotionally stirring TV commercial that highlights not only the potential environmental risks posed by the oil pipeline, but the blatant hypocrisy of those who argued to move its path away from a city at the expense of the neighboring Standing Rock tribe. Please join us in keeping the eyes of the world on Standing Rock. Nevertheless, the path ahead for anti-pipeline activists is not an easy one. Still, Iron Eyes and other Standing Rock activists are ready for the long fight ahead.
