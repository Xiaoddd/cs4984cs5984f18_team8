Harjo told the Tribune that the tribe never gave up its rights under the treaty. There have been many broken treaties between the U.S. and the Native American tribes. Paul Carlson, a Texas Tech historian, told ATTN: that it's important to place broken treaties into context. He wrote that as the U.S. government gained power and resources, the outcomes for Native Americans worsened. Here are three other broken agreements between the federal government and Native American tribes you should know: 1. Treaty of Canandaigua The Treaty of Canandaigua, also known as the Treaty of Pickering, was an agreement between the federal government and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy (Iroquois) of New York. The treaty was signed on Nov. 11, 1794 after a war between the Iroquois tribes and U.S. settlers. After the Iroquois sided with Great Britain during the American Revolutionary War, President George Washington tried to wipe them out, according to Indian Country. Years of bloody battles between the Iroquois, the U.S. government, and U.S. settlers ensued. Eventually the two sides entered negotiations. The treaty returned millions of acres of land to the Native American tribes. but it didn't last. The territory has been greatly reduced over the years, according to NPR. 2. The Gold Rush treaties. The promises in Gold Rush-era treaties, like Treaty K, were broken soon after they were signed. The treaties would have made reservations for Native American tribes in California. There were 18 Gold Rush-era treaties signed by government officials and Native American leaders but never ratified, according to NPR. State lawmakers in California petitioned the U.S. Senate to stop the treaties for a simple reason: they wanted the gold on Native land. And if it's not silver, it's copper. At the time, the U.S. had not yet greatly expanded beyond the Mississippi River. The aim was to remove Native Americans from eastern U.S. territory by making exchanges for western land. However, the treaties were more like forced ultimatums. Indian Tribes east of the Mississippi could either give up their land on the east, in exchange for land in the west, or stay in the east and become U.S. citizens. The tribes that refused to leave were forcibly removed over the course of nearly 30 years. About 4,000 of the 15,000 Native Americans forced to make the hard journey died, according to PBS.
