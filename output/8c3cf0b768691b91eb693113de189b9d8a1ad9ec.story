But soon those police actions will be closer to home and more pressing for all of us. States have been quietly enacting legislation that serves to strengthen the power of police officers and change the language that defines a protest. But the right to peaceably assemble is just as important, if not more important because it allows every individual to have equal input. People across the country have recently been moved to action by the 2016 Presidential Campaign and subsequent election to vocalize their concerns. These efforts have been rewarded with increased visibility for causes that affect the most vulnerable. The immediate judicial response shows the power and importance of protesting as a means of making sure the voice of the people is heard. In a time where the influence of money in politics has overshadowed the will of the populace, the right to protest is arguably the last defense left to us. Placing stiff penalties on those who participate, essentially narrowing the definition of protesting by labeling certain actions as dangerous thus giving way for more police intervention. In May of 2016, Louisiana Governor Edwards signed the Blue Lives Matter law and it went into effect in August of 2016. The bill upgrades resisting arrest to hate crime and felony. We have become so inured by the cries of Hitler, Nazi, and Fascist it has rendered us nearly incapable of the reality of those things in our present situation. We must stay aware and vigilant.
