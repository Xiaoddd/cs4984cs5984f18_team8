Dept. of Army Approves DAPL Easement Tuesday February 7, the US Army Corps gave notice of intent to grant the final easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross the Mni Sose (Missouri River). The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe will likely sue and ask for a temporary restraining order to halt construction while the legality of this decision is reviewed in court. The Indigenous Coalition at Standing Rock is calling for an international day of emergency actions to disrupt business as usual and unleash a global intersectional resistance to fossil fuels and fascism. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has consistently asked for people to go home, and we understand this. We encourage groups across the globe to connect our prayers for the water with other fights against fascism and the domination of people and Mother Earth (deportations, Muslim ban, attacks on labor, deregulation of Wall Street, other fossil fuel projects, censorship of the press and academia, etc) Choose the target that is most strategic for building long-term collaborative resistance in your local area.
