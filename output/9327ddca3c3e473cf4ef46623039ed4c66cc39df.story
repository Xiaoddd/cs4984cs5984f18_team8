I found a nice spot on the construction crew for the last few days. People are winterizing a lot of the structures and tents at Oceti Sakowin, the biggest camp at Standing Rock. I walk to the bridge one last time to snap a few pictures, have a moment of reflection, and perhaps utter something like a prayer, a well-wish, on top of the hill before I depart. One of them is an armored vehicle equipped with a water cannon. Another one is an LRAD, an acoustic sound cannon capable of stunning people at a 162 decibels, which is well above the pain threshold, and would probably cause permanent hearing damage if used at that volume. (Knowing about the LRAD in advance prompted me to take a hearing test the day before I departed for Standing Rock. The relative peace is suddenly broken by a blue semi truck racing toward the barricade. Backwards. At shockingly high speed. A small crew appears. No more than 10 people, and starts connecting some chains to the burned out truck blocking the bridge on the left. A minute later, the semi tries to pull the barricade apart, but the chains break before the barricade even budges. The truck backs up again, and a new attempt is made. Same result, over and over again. By now, the police force (that is staged out of sight over the hills behind the barricades) start rushing in. I believe this is when the first rubber bullets are fired at the small crew and the truck driver. I hear the police on the bullhorn address one of the guys on the bridge by name. A thick curtain of smoke now blocks the view between the police and the small crew, most likely smoke deployed by the crew to make it possible to keep working without getting shot. At 5:30 PM, the semi manages to pull the barricade apart. By 5:45, the semi manages to pull the barricade all the way across the bridge and off to the side of the road. This is when the protectors show up. At first, a slow trickle, by 6:15 a steady parade, growing in numbers by the minute. In hindsight, I now understand this was meticulously planned by the crew working on the bridge, had there been people on the bridge earlier, they could have been crushed by the semi pulling the barricade. Half an hour later, after nearly two hours of tear gas and rubber bullets, the police now begin using the water cannon on the crowd. This is a peaceful, non-violent stance, for clean water, against the DAPL, with our Native Brothers and Sisters. And, everything changes again.The police, without warning, deploy a barrage of tear gas, targeting everyone on the bridge, front to back. They launch tear gas all the way at the end of the bridge. No escape. Screams of panic and pain, the sound of people throwing up and uncontrollably coughing, grows louder, as rubber bullets fire at the crowd in the front. People call out for medics, fall, walk around blinded, in pain. I was planning on leaving hours ago. The plan was to be well on my way back home, to my warm house and sweet family in sunny Los Angeles. I run down to help the people that are hurting. On the bridge, people are vomiting, blinded, wounded, in pain. I try to help as many people as possible. Finding my headlamp in my pocket, I search for people that needed medical attention in a haze of tear gas. Find the person that needs help, and get them to a medic. The medics are amazing. All over the place. Many of the calls for help come from the front, where people are being hit by rubber bullets. It seems to calm down. The police stop firing for a few minutes. Even more people this time. More determined. Stronger. Plastic container lids are being used as shields. Ambulances rush in and out of camp, taking the injured to local hospitals. The rubber bullets keep coming, the water cannon never stops. I go back to taking pictures. I walk around in a daze. Taking pictures. Most of them out of focus and blurred. My senses feel numbed, but at the same time I am hyper-aware. I take a picture of an intimidating looking man on the left side of the bridge. He looks straight at me, walks over to an officer holding a rubber bullet gun, and gives the slightest nod in my direction. I feel it in my gut. They separate, and I watch the officer with the rubber bullet gun, now 10 feet to my right, take direct aim at me. There is no one else around. I duck, run, and find the barrier on the bridge without getting hit. I tell myself to stay calm. I walk, eyes closed, coughing uncontrollably, through a thick cloud of tear gas, when a huge explosion stuns me. A concussion grenade has exploded next to me. Hands grab me and walk me back. I have nothing left. Nothing. I am broken. Done. Six hours. Four of them on the bridge. I do notice a line of blinking lights, and feel upset that someone brought in a light show. I get in my car, hide my memory cards, and drive. Alone. Not only did some brave protectors manage to throw the canisters back, or into the river, they also had to put out all these fires. Sometimes by rolling their bodies over the flames. There was one deliberate fire on the bridge, built to help people warm up, to help the people with hypothermia. There were two fires started on the mud banks, far away from any vegetation. Built for the same reason. We are the water and land protectors. Second: This was a non-violent, peaceful action. We took a beating. We took all of this without retaliating. A few people broke from this a couple of times and reacted to the non-stop violence. They threw plastic water bottles at the police. I can count the amount of times this happened, over all these hours, on my fingers and toes. And every time someone did this, the crowd would check them and stop them. None. Afterword. I told him I was fine. He got mad and said I would get sick from the tear gas exposure and the cold water. He was right. I have a fever, and bronchitis from the exposure. My ears are still ringing. PS. I ran into this water protector at the hotel in Bismarck. About Ravishly Welcome to Ravishly, where we celebrate the mess of being human. We laugh. We cry. We do it all together.
