The Oceti Sakowin camp is the largest encampment of water protectors where have been camping. The best way to protect people during the winter, and reduce the risk of conflict between water protectors and militarized police, is to deny the easement for the Oahe crossing, and deny it now. We ask that everyone who can appeal to President Obama and the Army Corps of Engineers to consider the future of our people and rescind all permits, and deny the easement to cross the Missouri River just north of our Reservation and straight through our treaty lands. When the Dakota Access Pipeline chose this route, they did not consider our strong opposition. Our concerns were clearly articulated directly to them in a tribal council meeting held on Sept. 30, 2014, where DAPL and the ND Public Service Commission came to us with this route. We have released the audio recording from that meeting. Again, we ask that the United States stop the pipeline and move it outside our ancestral and treaty lands. Although the news is saddening, it is not at all surprising given the last 500 years of the mistreatment of our people. We continue to fight for these rights, which continue to be eroded.

Unfortunately prayers will just have to continue from a distance. Again, it is in the best interest of the SAFETY OF ALL PEOPLE INVOLVED. So for that reason, it is good to hear of the upcoming date, December 5th, to move people back from the area of conflict. G-d helps those who help themselves. Please let me know where and when I can be of assistance to you and your proud tribe. I have already written to Our POTUS and the U. S. Corps of Engineers. Sincerely, Enid Lessne (Otchi Chornia on FB). TribalMember and Proud of it. 2 years ago Enid Lessne, first of all thank you kindly for your reply to my comments. I would like to share with you that I grew up going to a Baptist church. On a personal level I respect others spiritual beliefs. I find myself agreeing with what you say about action must be taken not just prayers. As I know very well about the story of the person at sea, stranded and was sent help in several forms yet refused it for one reason or another. Finally asking why was help not given. The answer was not something they wanted to hear. Yet it was fact. So is, actions alone. So my main priority is prayer. It gives the guidance that we all seek. However, in the end it must not be our own will but OUR CREATORS WILL ALONE. There are other personal spiritual attributes in my life, however, they will be kept to my tribe and I. As some gifts are sacred. If you sincerely care to offer your help, please feel free to contact the Standing Rock Sioux tribe on their Facebook page, their number to the offices is listed there. So the Army corps. A logistical nightmare, as the Army Corps. well knows. His silence in this matter is not golden. Mr. Obama, you should be ashamed of yourself. TribalMember and Proud of it. 2 years ago It may sound ironic but I just want to say thank you for not celebrating a day of mass genocide against my Ancestors. I did not eat on that day. Instead I watched a Native film for children and I can honestly say it moved me. I would recommend it. For not advertising to others, I will just say it is named after a girl and pronounced in their language. Stay strong Richard. Ben 2 years ago Thank you for doing what you do. Just like all other presidents. Just like all other presidents. Dr. Amy Eisenberg 2 years ago Dear President Obama We urgently request your presence at Standing Rock where peaceful and prayerful UNARMED Native American water protectors and supporters have been harmed. This violates our constitution and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Dakota Access Pipelines is violating NEPA by not having a lawful and properly conducted SIA and EIA. Government to government consultation must be genuinely carried out according to UNDRIP, which you endorsed. Your absence amid these terrible human rights violations at Standing Rock by Morton County Police and the Dakota Access Pipeline Security and Personnel is deeply disconcerting. We voted for you. The abuses have escalated and this must be addressed urgently. This is an emergency. Native American lives matter. Please help. We need your immediate attention and presence at Standing Rock. Mni wiconi. How amazing. WHAT a way to end his tenure. He really meant was to satisfy his own personal egomaniacal prison. Like I said just how far will the Trump administration take us back (legalized inquisition style 15th century, with metaphor of boiling lead poured down the gullet to seal us up perhaps). In any case, with this outrageous stance he has proven himself no longer worthy of honor as a man, I still respect the office but the man has a hollow soul and I weep for him. I weep for America. I weep for the World. I weep for the planet. With radical weather we are partly there but in a couple of years there WILL BE FOOD SHORTAGES, MASS MIGRATION including entire citys filled with HOMELESS and POLICE RIOTS to match. It will take a thousand years for the Earth to right itself. In the near future, they will be like mad dogs and we shall see all of this military might used in Standing Rock is about to be turn on the American public. We can now go back to our own path. Our response must be to start turning out QUALITY TRAINED Citizen Journalist if we want to live. They own the narrative. When it comes to indebtedness, only difference between the two parties is one of degrees. Drink no poisoned water . . . I stand with The People of Standing Rock. I stand with The People of Puerto Rico. I stand with The People of the Aleutian Islands. izopnyde Gene 2 years ago It appears from the letter (Signed by Colonel Henderson) that the Seven Council Fires Camp is the one the Corps wants cleared, with everyone moving down to the Rosebud Camp (still on Corps property) or to the Standing Rock Reservation land south of that. I wonder who will enforce this. So far the feds have largely withheld law enforcement support. Eviction scenarios: 1. Occupy Wall Street eviction ordered by billionaire New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg. NYPD cleared the camp. No fatalities. 2. Branch Davidian Cult siege in Waco, Texas. Ordered by Attorney General Janet Reno under President Bill Clinton. FBI, ATF & military Special Forces were used. 3. Peru, Bagua massacre of 2009. Peruvian President Alan Garcia still refused to meet with the indigenous coalition AIDESEP. The storm troops opened up with live fire. I am about to write to POTUS Obama and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers urging them to change the direction of the pipeline in North Dakota. U. S. Veterans are going to North Dakota. Ann 2 years ago Seems like emails are ineffective. I also was wondering if there is a petition already in process Standing Rock has a legal defense fund. Lisa R. Smith 2 years ago I have been researching where to send donations and have found that there is at least one website saying to send things to them, not to the Oceti Sakowin Camp. Also, I have heard that there is at least one fraudulent Amazon account for donations. I am sure that I am not the only person who wants to help by spreading the word of goods and moneys needed. However without knowing who or what organization is the correct one it is frustrating. I have a source who has been sharing live feeds on Facebook who has send me the correct information as of this evening but she is leaving camp soon. Someone please do a story on this so we who cannot be there in person will know who is not defrauding this great work. Thank you. Best regards, Lisa R. Smith Eloise Vega 2 years ago I want to know the best group in N. Dakota to send money to. Help support Native News Online by clicking on our sponsors' advertisements.
