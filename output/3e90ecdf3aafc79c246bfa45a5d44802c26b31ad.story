Humanity's Future Standing with Standing Rock Courtesy Jane Fonda By Jane Fonda December 1, 2016 IDEAS Fonda is an Oscar-winning actress, writer and activist. I was at Standing Rock Sioux Reservation near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, during the Thanksgiving holiday supporting Indigenous Peoples, the Water Protectors, from over 300 tribes and their allies from around the world. Thousands of people, with 2,000 veterans from Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan about to join them. Their aim is to stop Sunoco Logistics and its Dakota Access Pipeline from crossing Standing Rock ancestral lands and drilling beneath the Missouri River. I came away with the belief that what is happening at Standing Rock is an existential confrontation between two opposing world views. One is represented by the Indigenous Water Protectors and their allies who believe our future depends on respecting the land and water on which human life depends. The people on the front lines are very brave. They stand, carrying their banners, chanting, and praying with arms reaching toward the sky. They are unarmed as they face the Morton County Police. They have all been trained in non-violent civil disobedience. No weapons of any kind. And no drugs or alcohol are allowed in the camps. The aggressor side, with militarized police defending their interests, is represented by those who insist on unfettered extraction of non-renewable fossil fuels no matter the consequences. Greed versus a habitable planet. Because of where we find ourselves at this precarious moment in history, with the reality of climate change close to its tipping point, if the short-term, profit-oriented view is allowed to prevail, it could actually spell the end of human life as we know it. This is the existential crossroad. The choice is ours to make and it must be done quickly. Extraction and transportation of oil and gas is a dirty business. According to the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, since 2010 there have been oil spills in the U.S. amounting to more than 7 million gallons of crude. But within that dirty business, the vast network of pipelines operated by Sunoco Logistics (which recently announced intentions to buy Energy Transfer Partners, which is building the pipeline), holds the record. It has leaked more than 200 times since 2010, making it the company with the worst spill record in the US, according to a Reuters analysis of government data. It is no coincidence that Energy Transfer Partner (ETP) and its poor environmental record is complemented by egregious treatment of communities impacted by its operations. Their tactics have escalated from attack dogs and pepper spray to mace, rubber bullets and water cannons in freezing temperatures. False information is broadcast to justify their brutal tactics. Journalists are intimidated and censored. The Indigenous Peoples who are defending the lands and water are descendants of cultures with powerful identities stretching back for centuries, long before white European settlers arrived. They had alphabets. You must make him understand the value of property, and the benefits of its separate ownership. Great tribal nations were uprooted from their ancestral lands and deported to reservations. Smallpox-infected blankets were given to native peoples, wiping out entire tribes. The immense herds of Great Plains Bison, which tribes relied on for food, clothing and shelter, were killed off. The number of bison dropped from over 50 million to fewer than 800. Nearly 400 treaties were negotiated, almost none of them honored by the US. Sixty percent of the land supposedly designated for Indians ended up being owned by whites. Robbed of their lands, their hunting grounds, their central means of subsistence, their cultural basis of life, a sizable portion of Indigenous Peoples were ultimately forced to adopt the way of the white colonizers on whom they became dependent for food, supplies, shelter, entirely losing their self-reliance. We have witnessed the sad results as Indigenous Peoples left their reservations and tried to assimilate, moving into cities to find work and education. But they bore the deep, traumatic wounds of colonization and too many turned to drugs and spirits to fill the emptiness once inhabited by the Spirit. Generations of men and women lost their traditional ceremonies, songs, even their native languages. I met Alayna Eagle Shield at Standing Rock. She and her children have learned to speak their native Lakota. Generations of Indigenous Peoples grew up ashamed of who they were. Guided by the true tribal elders who refused to give up their ways, there has been a return to traditional language, prayer and ceremonies in many parts of Indian Country. Some say this movement began during the occupation of the former prison Island of Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay from November 20, 1969, to June 11, 1971. Young Indian students from the Bay Area were the first occupiers. When I went to witness the occupation for myself in June, 1970, elders from different tribes had joined them. The late Wilma Mankiller was a young woman on Alcatraz when she first met the great Thomas Banyacya, the traditional elder chosen by the Hopi Tribe as an interpreter of Hopi prophecies which have long warned of threats to the natural balance of the earth and its creatures. Wilma later told me that this encounter changed her life. She went on to become the very powerful first female chief of the Cherokee Nation. They began to see that often, through prayer and ceremony, people could begin to heal, to get clean and sober. It has been 45 years since the Occupation of Alcatraz. At Standing Rock we are witnessing the flowering of the seeds that were planted there and, again, it is the youth who seem to be leading the way. At Standing Rock, it is the youth who decided the focus needed to be on water. The astonishing courage of their run was what first brought public attention to the impending crisis in Standing Rock. Oceti Sakowin is the largest camp. The Lakota are part of a confederation of seven related Sioux tribes which once lived across the vast plains of North America. Over time, the U.S. government took more and more Sioux land breaking up the reservation into smaller ones such as Pine Ridge, Rosebud and Standing Rock. What is happening at Standing Rock is historic. This is the first time since Little Big Horn in 1876 that Oceti Sakowin have come together in peace as one family. As I walked through the camp I heard Lakota prayers, saw the ceremonial fires burning, the sweat lodges where people go regularly to pray. I saw people treating each other with kindness, helping each other to chop and share firewood, food, clothing and shelter. I have never been hugged so much in my life. We must do all we can to make sure the Water Protectors are victorious. These are people fighting not simply against their oppressors but also for the earth and all its creatures including us. If we can do this it will represent an historic turning point. There are immediate things we can do. For one, help children with school supplies. Or support the International indigenous youth council. Or fund self-reporting from within the camps. Then there are the longer-term things that need to happen. We are all interconnected, interdependent, but the fabric of our common tapestry is starting to unravel. We must rapidly cure ourselves of this disease or it will take us all down.
