Things are ending peacefully as many left the camps in anticipation of the forces that hovered but some remain and sing peacefully in the face of riot gear and weapons. They still remain, they continue to sing, they burn sage, they are women, they are men, their hearts are heavy, but they will continue to pray peacefully. This battle began when the Bush administration laid the foundation for the project and gained permission from the Tribal Powers back then to build. What compounded the issue in present time, was the betrayal of the Tribal Council to allow the Police on the land who then brutally attacked the Native people as they stood in prayer militarizing the zone. The Private Police force hired by ETP used Concussion Grenades thrown within feet of targets tearing skin from flesh, and flesh from bone. When the Police arrested hundreds of our strongest warriors and threw them into dog kennels, our warriors rose and their souls would not be quelled like the ceremonial flames that burn as we speak: they continued to rise. When children were stolen from the streets, when women were abused by the man camps that came with the black snake, when girls disappeared and never came back: the youth and women united to stand EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE FACE OF CERTAIN ADVERSITY AND THEY DID NOT FALTER. People have come from across the world to stand with the Sioux, by water, by land, by plane, from all over the world: ALL of the people are with us. No. We absolutely must focus on what HAS happened. We raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in just days to help fund the Water Protectors when they needed transportation. We helped bring food and medical supplies when camp needed them. My friends, my brothers and sisters: the answer is never. This is my journey. I agree that a war is not often won with one battle, but one battle can turn the side of the war. Standing Rock has brought illumination to the world. We see differently. We act differently. We talk differently. We see hope even in defeat. Because we see love. We feel love. Love of ALL creation. It is the beginning of everything.

To be refined and shipped overseas. If interested you may contact me.
