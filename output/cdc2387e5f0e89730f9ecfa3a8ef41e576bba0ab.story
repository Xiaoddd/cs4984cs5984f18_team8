Photo courtesy of The Canadian Press Previous story Former pipeline engineer and whistleblower Evan Vokes is calling for a public inquiry into the operations and engineering of all Canadian oil and gas companies after Husky Energy altered a report about its response to the Saskatchewan oil spill. Vokes, who blew the whistle on TransCanada in 2012, said Canadians deserve answers about why pipelines are leaking and blowing up, despite industry claims that its infrastructure is safe. He said an inquiry could help shed light on some of the mysteries, much like the recent public hearings in Quebec held to root out corruption in the construction industry. Calgary-based Husky Energy initially reported it had detected the pipeline leak that spilled around 1,572 barrels of oil into the North Saskatchewan River about 14 hours before responding to the disaster and informing provincial authorities. On Thursday, it submitted a new report saying it only discovered the leak about 30 minutes before it notified the provincial regulator. The spill has caused major economic and environmental damage, particularly for two central Saskatchewan towns, Prince Albert and North Battleford, that rely on the river for drinking water and are now scrambling to supply residents. It is also elevating public concern about other major pipeline proposals such as TransCanada's 4,600-kilometre Energy East project that would carry more than a million barrels of oil per day between Alberta and New Brunswick crossing several major waterways such as the Saint Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers. Pipeline perception Russ Girling, CEO of TransCanada, told The Canadian Press in an interview that he understands why the public is getting worried about pipelines. Vokes has long alleged that many energy companies are cutting corners on engineering rules, putting public safety at risk. The federal regulator, the National Energy Board (NEB) confirmed in 2014 that several of his allegations of violations at TransCanada were valid. Obviously someone is not telling the truth.

Authorities have already identified several wildlife casualties from the Husky spill, including birds. He said in other recent pipeline catastrophes have shown that companies don't always respond to warning signs. He said the NEB has also offered to help Environment and Climate Change Canada with its investigation. Girling, the TransCanada CEO, said his company will be keen to learn from the Husky incident to improve pipeline safety. Subscribe Share this article. Damn, its manufacturer must have a very convincing sales team, OR, pipeline companies are incredibly stupid. My money is on the pipeline companies. IT's just to risky. We cannot trust the pipeline companies to build and monitor these pipelines adequately. Even if they did. There still will be oil spills. Let's move forward away from fossil fuel. reply Well, there's some risk here. Whether the risk is less than the reward, we'll just let the NEB decide for us.
