For the Standing Rock Sioux, Indian country more broadly, and their allies in the environmental movement, things had gone too far. It followed a pattern that has emerged in the past few years, where the climate justice movement is increasingly led by Indigenous peoples in North America and beyond, and highlights the inseparability of environmental and climate justice. But there are distinctions to be made with regard to environmental justice (EJ) battles when it comes to Indigenous peoples. The EJ movement started, unsurprisingly, not as an academic discipline, but as activism in communities where toxic industries and other discriminatory practices were disproportionately occurring in low-income areas (which tended to be communities of color), resulting in increased health problems. The definition focuses on a framework of equality. Equality in a democracy means that all people, regardless of ethnicity or race, have equal opportunity to enjoy the potential advantages available to them; a comfortable life based on financial security, fair wages, a clean environment, education, etc. In other words, equality is based on material or economically-based values. We would call this a distributive model of justice. Native Americans as individuals are U.S. citizens, but they are also citizens of Indigenous nations, not ethnic minorities. As individuals, they are subject to normal American laws. As nations, however, they are subject to a completely separate legal regime, constructed on the basis of the pre-existing sovereignty acknowledged by treaties and the U.S. Constitution, which exist in perpetuity (forever), in addition to the laws of their particular nations. That extremely complex legal regime, among other things, delineates and affirms the sovereignty of Indian lands and the treaty rights they still retain on lands that were ceded to the United States (such as the lands at Standing Rock where the DAPL pipeline was designed to go, just outside reservation borders and under Lake Oahe). Even abstract ideas like the right to a clean environment reflect this commodification when seen in light of property values (for example, property values go down in polluted neighborhoods, or neighborhoods near noxious facilities). Those views are not based on monetary value, but are invariably characterized as relationships. In Indigenous value systems humans are seen as part of interrelated networks in much the same way human families are interrelated networks. Relationships mean obligations to responsibility for the quality of those relationships, a sense of reciprocity, in the context of continuity with place. Sacred site protection on non-tribally controlled lands is particularly problematic because what few laws there are to protect them are weak at best, and completely ineffectual at worst. Consider two particularly high profile cases, the San Francisco Peaks and Oak Flat controversies. In the years-long San Francisco Peaks battle in Arizona, numerous tribes failed to stop the expansion of a ski resort on National Forest Service land which would make snow with recycled wastewater, on what is considered holy ground to Navajo, Hopi, and other Pueblo peoples. In 1979 a dam break released 93 million gallons of radioactive wastewater from a New Mexico uranium mine into the Rio Puerco, an important water source for the Navajo people. Cleanup and health effects continue almost four decades later. The same is true in the DAPL case. But a couple of recent victories demonstrate the effectiveness of creative organizing by Native peoples with few other options in protecting sites. In 2008 the United Coalition to Protect Panhe (UCPP), aligned with numerous other organizations like the Sierra Club, the Surfrider Foundation, and the San Onofre Foundation, successfully stopped the building of a toll road that threatened the famed surf break Trestles. Surfers and environmentalists focused on the devastating effects the road would likely have on wave quality and wildlife habitats, while Native peoples feared the destruction of their sacred site, which is also eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. However, as the example of Standing Rock painfully illustrates, those rights are far too fragile seen in the light of a political system that can change with the shifting winds of elections. So much of the work accomplished by decades of progressive vision to protect the environment appears to be unraveling in one administration run predominantly by fossil fuel crony capitalists. Indian country is further vulnerable to political volatility due to the plenary power doctrine, which gives Congress ultimate authority over Indian affairs. Until then, EJ will continue to be haphazard and uneven. Show your support with a tax-deductible contribution to KCET. After all, public media is meant for the public. It belongs to all of us.
