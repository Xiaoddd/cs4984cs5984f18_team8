United States Wants Local Banks to Invest in Community-Shared Solar Henry Litman October 10, 2016 Topics: Solar Finance Community-Shared Solar Economic Opportunity The United States Department of Energy (DOE) announced this July that it plans to host an event to bring together local bankers and regulators to discuss expanding community-shared solar nationally. With only a few months remaining in 2016, the federal administration is taking small actions that may last long after President Obama leaves office. Elaine Ulrich, program manager at the DOE, said she believes community-shared solar is worth supporting. The government and local banks can play important roles. Community-shared solar spreads the benefits of clean electricity to lower-income United States citizens. It can also drive economic growth. A federal study shows that less than 25 percent of the combined residential rooftop area is eligible for onsite solar systems. Community-shared solar projects can expand that market. Ulrich said one area that is prime for growth is the MUSH market. This market includes municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals. Many MUSH customers lack financing options. According to Ulrich, minor government activity can spur investment. In theory, a convening could encourage banks to make more cash available. A Financing Challenge Financing is the main barrier for community-shared solar, Ulrich said. Three underlying factors drive this lack of financing: complexity, size and misinformation. The challenges of the MUSH market illustrate how these factors slow growth. As nonprofit organizations, MUSH customers cannot use the investment tax credit without tax equity. But only a few banks offer this financing. As a result, most MUSH projects are too small for investment. Ulrich said smaller banks are not there yet. The Federal Plan The administration wants to commoditize community-shared solar financing. If more banks offer financing, their financial products will become more efficient and competitive. Loans will become less expensive. Ulrich said she hopes a convening can advance this agenda. It could educate local banks about the risks of community-shared solar, signal regulator support for community solar, and raise awareness of incentives. Banks make loans after evaluating risks, so information about these risks is important. According to Ulrich, local banks will finance community-shared solar projects if they understand the risks. Ulrich said she hopes that local banks will learn enough at this event to start financing projects. Over time, banks will collect data on community-shared solar loans and improve their processes. Local banks also consider how regulators will respond to new lending categories. Banks prefer lending for conventional projects rather than innovative ones. The DOE will communicate during the event that financial regulators support community-shared solar. Finally, Ulrich said she would like to see this event make local bankers more aware of incentive programs available for community-shared solar. Federal and state incentives exist, but most are underutilized. According to Ulrich, disseminating information is an important DOE responsibility. This convening will teach banks about resources available for community-shared solar. Join our LinkedIn group to discuss this article. You may also email the author directly using our contact form. Within a few years, the United States will be facing the sunset of a large number of solar installations. In response, Washington, California, and New York are making plans to incentivize solar-panel recycling.

Integrating renewable energy into existing electric grids continues to be a difficult hurdle for many electricity markets. When utilities face intermittent renewable energy generation, energy imbalance markets (EIMs) have been developed to mitigate the gaps between production and demand.
