In 1966, my father held Senate hearings to investigate violent attacks by growers against pickers in the produce fields surrounding Delano, California. A young United Farmworkers organizer, Cesar Chavez, was orchestrating peaceful protests by Filipino and Chicano farmworkers against meager pay and brutal working conditions. My father only reluctantly attended the hearings. The prospect of law enforcement officials deploying the states police power on behalf of lawbreaking corporations against law abiding citizens whose only crime was their poverty and powerlessness made him steam. My father despised bullies and believed in rule of law. He gaveled the morning session to a close. That afternoon, he joined the farmworkers on their picket line. Chavez became his closest political and moral ally. Anthropologist Nancy Scheper-Hughes has observed that Genocide is a continuum that runs for years, decades or centuries. It begins with marginalization and dehumanization of an identifiable minority, the theft of their lands and property, their slaughter and decimation, and the gradual squeezing of remnant populations. Similar letters to the Sioux preceded the evictions that reliably followed their various treaties with the American government in 1825, 1837, 1851 and 1868. Eight years after we signed that last treaty, the Sioux received their most devastating removal letter from the Army Corps; Trespassing prospectors had discovered gold in the Black Hills, the sacred lands and critical hunting grounds where the Sioux wintered away from the frigid, barren plains that are uninhabitable during the cold months. In direct violation of the treaty, Colonel George Custer rode into the Black Hills to evict the justifiably angry Sioux to make way for the illegal mines. There is no question that the 1,200 mile pipeline meets both criteria. The Corp considers a catastrophic water poisoning pipeline failure, so likely, that following protests by Bismarck residents, Henderson agreed to move the pipeline away from its more direct route across the Bismarck water supply and into Indian country. Indian Country regards DAPL as an existential threat; for the tribes the outlaw enterprise, forced upon them at gunpoint, represents the extension of their 500 year genocide into a new millennium. The juxtaposition of forces at Standing Rock is Orwellian; on one side are the Sioux and their supporters. The Sioux have been highly disciplined about maintaining the respectful and non-violent character of their demonstration. Tribal committees train and screen protesters and restrict access to the protest sites to those who can be trusted to maintain prayerful and peaceful protest in the face of ferocious police violence. These demonstrations mainly consist of quiet prayer ceremonies. The Sioux have been highly disciplined about maintaining the respectful and non-violent character of their demonstration.

To make way for an outlaw company, highly militarized police and private security forces have unleashed the awesome military might of state police power against law abiding American citizens. The police and corporate security brigades appear to be testing a suite of high-tech and often savage, crowd control equipment now in the possession of our militarized police forces. I experienced the jarring barrage of acoustic cannons. The state and private security forces deployed water cannons against protesters in sub-freezing weather endangering their lives, tear gas bombs, pepper spray, flash bang grenades which might cost one protester her arm, and plastic bullets which felled a Sioux elder the day I left. Largely out of sight of the national press, the police employ terror tactics and behave like savage animals. The Obama administration has the power to end this conflict, overnight, simply by declaring that the pipeline company comply with existing federal law and complete an environmental impact statement before DAPL is allowed to proceed. The American people would see, through all the smoke and mirrors, that this project is a 1,200-mile boondoggle designed to allow billionaire investors like Donald Trump to make themselves richer by impoverishing other Americans. Like the Keystone XL pipeline, DAPL is unlikely to produce even 100 long term jobs while jeopardizing the water supply for 18 million people and the breadbasket of American food production. If Obama were to order an Environmental Impact Statement, our incoming president, Donald Trump, would be powerless to reverse that determination. In the meantime, Americans who care about freedom and justice are flocking to Standing Rock to support the Sioux, just as justice loving Americans of an earlier generation went to Selma, to Jackson and to Delano. TecumsehUnfaced We need U.N. troops protecting Standing Rock against this onslaught of savage capitalist barbarians. tibetan cowboy The UN is owned by Amerika. Forget relying on the UN for anything except worldwide genocide. TecumsehUnfaced I forgot to use the sarcasm font. David Schultz I do like Jill Stein but RFK, Jr. would be great at the top of the Green ticket in 2020. David Schultz RFK, Jr. could best shake things up by declaring as a Green early for the 2010 NY senate seat. The Democrats would be forced to bow out. stephenverchinski If you go this week today and tomorrow will be likely the only two good work days for the tepee and yurt construction. The 6th is due for another abrupt temperature swing with high temperatures at about 6 to 10 degrees F. I still remember Occupy Santa Fe where folks could access warm shops not too far away. This is WAY different. That said, gear up, and do what you can to support the Water Protectors. David, you may be on to something millions and millions could support. My admiration of him as environmentalist has been immense. We must send our thoughts and prayers of protection to him and all the remarkably brave people at Standing Rock. David Schultz Robert is the real thing. It appears his trip up there was rewarded with a victory. The Army Corp is not going to approve the DAPL Environmental Assessment and is going to require a full Environmental Impact Statement. That will at least set the project back a year and route it away from the reservoir. and chilling. We, as a nation, are long passed due for a paradigm shift. This time the retired troops will remarkably be on the right side of history. Personally, I thank them from the bottom of my heart. They can justifiably be considered heroes. Yes, the news is good today. Gary Kent My great grandfather was deployed by the Army Corp of Engineers in 1902 as part of the American effort to suppress the popular uprising after we replaced Spain as the colonial power to the Philippine Islands after the Spanish American War. He kept a diary of the spies that he managed. Before there was the Central Intelligence Agency, there was the Army Corp of Engineers, innocuous names for deeply violent organizations promoting economic empires both in the expanding territories of the United States and around the world. He served in the 7th cavalry about a generation after the time of Colonel Custer. A couple of years after arriving in the Philippine Islands, he married a Philippine woman and had a daughter who immigrated back to the United States with him when he return. That daughter was my grandmother, whom I loved dearly. We must all discover our common humanity and our common interests as human beings to honor and respect the Earth and one another always. Monetary interests make this very problematic. The monetary market system is the great divider at a time when unity for humanity is critical to our very survival. I believe most racism arises from the roots of economic competition. Human civilization is fragmented by an economic system that pits every person against every other for their very survival. The consequences are deadly for everyone. Popular Resistance provides a daily stream of resistance news from across the United States and around the world.
