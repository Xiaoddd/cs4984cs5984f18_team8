The president made the announcement at the White House. The removal of one big obstacle in Washington still leaves several sprinkled around the American Midwest, where opponents still hope to trip up the project with protests and lawsuits. The likely epicentre of the coming battle is Nebraska, the very place where opposition to Keystone began years ago. TransCanada must still reach deals with some landowners there, it lacks a state permit and faces possible court challenges there and in South Dakota. Keystone opponents swiftly linked their cause to the broader anti-Trump movement. Trump, meanwhile, has been eager to talk about projects like Keystone. His young presidency has been consumed by problematic issues lately: a failed health reform and Russian election-meddling. Even as he made the Keystone announcement, reporters in the Oval Office shouted questions about the collapse of his health bill. Trump says he wants to move onto jobs and the economy. Keystone XL would mean thousands of temporary construction jobs and a permanent, annual boost in tax revenues for communities along the route, which would stretch from Canada to an already completed southern portion now pumping oil to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. He welcomed the U.S. announcement, but pointed out the process is far from over. He declined to say whether a completed Keystone would enter the calculus of whether the country needs another, larger project from TransCanada. Carr said the Energy East plan to move oil to the Atlantic Coast is undergoing an independent review. U.S. regulators conducted their own, favourable reviews before politicians stepped in. But opponents disputed the conclusion. Hearing this pressure from the political left, Barack Obama rejected the project. In response, TransCanada filed a challenge under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, alleging the U.S. government breached its legal commitments under NAFTA. That challenge has been dropped, TransCanada said Friday. That included Trump, who had often discussed the Keystone approval as a fait accompli, telegraphing intentions that the market received long ago.
