The pipeline, built in 1953, currently carries 300,000 barrels of heavy tar sands oil daily from Alberta to British Columbia and refineries in Washington state. Kinder Morgan halted most construction work in April and threatened to abandon the controversial expansion by May 31 in the face of opposition from provincial and tribal governments in British Columbia. Protests have spread to Washington as well. Anti-pipeline protesters have repeatedly occupied Seattle bank branches of key pipeline funder JPMorgan Chase. They took to kayaks in May to block a Kinder Morgan fueling dock at the Port of Seattle. Forsman said Washington tribes would keep supporting First Nations (as indigenous groups are called in Canada) in their protests and lawsuits against the project. Local environmentalists are also alarmed by the threat posed by increased oil tankers in the shipping lanes that twist around the San Juan Islands. Alberta tar sands oil also puts out even more climate-altering carbon dioxide than typical oil does. Canadian officials said expanding the Trans Mountain pipeline is in the national interest. The sale is expected to close in August. Construction on the stalled megaproject is set to resume immediately. The Natural Resources Defense Council threatened to sue Kinder Morgan in May to prevent increased tanker noise or spilled oil from harming endangered orcas. Jay Inslee told KUOW. He said the federal government preempts most state regulation on oil tanker safety. Under legislation passed this year, state officials will be discussing strategies for reducing the risk of oil spills, including stationing an emergency response tug boat in the San Juan Islands.
