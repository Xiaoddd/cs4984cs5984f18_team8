Sunday, October 23, 2016 REVOLUTION FROM THE TOXIC STATUS QUO Graphic courtesy of Google Images The Bernie Sanders Revolution lives on, even after his candidacy for President is over, because it has to. We have no choice but to fight on against the Absurd Status Quo poisoning our babies, ourselves, and our Climate, that conservatives and liberals allow, not just in the US, but on every continent. On the Darkside, the opposite is true. There are Right Wing Nationalist Movements growing, not just in the US, with Trump and the Tea Party Republicans, but with Brexit in the UK, the Nazi party in France, the Right Wing resurgence in Australia, and around the globe. We described this phenomenon, and how their self avowed goal is to break down all regulations, all obstructions to trashing their own precious nations with Pollution for Profit, and we include the liberal Duplicitous Democrats, who make lovely speeches, but accommodate the Status Quo as much as the Right Wingers. Unfortunately, in this case, the ends justify the means, though this has always been the case with Revolutionaries. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a do-over, when it comes to elections. As difficult as many of you may find it to vote for Clinton, and I too, we urge you to vote for the elements of the Bernie Sanders Revolution that we worked so hard (and spent so much of our own money through donations) to successfully have included in the Democratic Platform. I have friends from Northern Maine to Northern California that volunteered their time, and donated hard earned money time and time again to the Bernie Sanders Campaign. And these people had nothing. We hope our international readers can understand our focus on the US elections. But let me assure you, the subjects in this discussion are relevant to the politics of all nations, where right wing groups are now gaining prominence. And we firmly believe that our Revolution against the Status Quo is urgent, and that immediate action is necessary, for the sake of all human beings, for our children, and for future generations, and that it will only succeed against the omnipotence of corporate power, if it is able to transcend national borders. Message to our Readers This post was originally published as Part 12 of a larger, comprehensive Woodstock Earth report on the subject of Pollution entitled, Living in a Toxic World. Rather than break down the discussion by the three types, Air Pollution, Water Pollution, and Soil Pollution, we decided to break it down by the same Toxins found in all forms of Pollution. Please read Part 1 of the article, where we introduce our thesis, and any parts that may interest you. We really do appreciate you taking the time to read our articles. And we extra-appreciate when you refer them to friends. Whether we really are able to forward the Revolution Against the Status Quo, that is poisoning our babies, ourselves, our future generations, our Climate, and all life on Earth, depends largely on whether we and others can get this story out, and make citizens of the world aware, and get them out to vote. We love getting feedback. For the sake of our people, our families, and Mother Earth, we encourage all of you, as charter members of Woodstock Earth, to spread the word and help get these stories out.
