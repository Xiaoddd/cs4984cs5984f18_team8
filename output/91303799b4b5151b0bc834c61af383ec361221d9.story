Hopi Indian tribe of Arizona is one of her favorite subjects. Also great for gifting. Microwave and dishwasher safe. Available in 11oz and 15oz size. I have a passion for art and have immersed myself over the years in drawing, painting and reading art history. I attended The School of the Art Institute of Chicago and New York University. For the last twelve years, I've been teaching specialized glazing techniques to students who have never painted or those who have a background in painting the traditional way. I enjoy seeing the progression of a student's work. I created custom hand-painted silk fabrics and designed the fabric for the interiors of private jets and estates in the Los Angeles area.
