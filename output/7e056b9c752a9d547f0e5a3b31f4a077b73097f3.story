Vincent Viola went from a humble immigrant background to the founder of a highly-successful financial firm in New York. A huge legal, political and public relations challenge will be facing Viola should be confirmed as Secretary of the Army. Officially, the project is on hold in order for the Army Corps to conduct a more thorough review of the final portion of the pipeline in response to concerns raised by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and its many allies. But the process has yet to begin, more than two weeks after Jo-Ellen Darcy, who is the outgoing Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, announced the December 4 decision on the easement. With Trump coming on board in just a month, the Army Corps doesn't have much time to get the ball rolling. It's crucial for the review to start soon because it would be difficult -- though not impossible -- for the incoming administration to change course. (With footage from AdaMedia Med Mera) . . . . . Resistance. His people. Because Sitting Bull understood who he was, who his people were, and where he belonged in this world. Just as Sitting Bull did, we continue to stand with those same thoughts, ideas and memories. We see the same thing today. They walked out to his cabin, pounded on the door and demanded for him to get up. The people could hear all the motions, the horses and the people moving so they all started getting out of their tents and began gathering. As they were gathering the people stood in front of the cabin and as Sitting Bull came out, Officer Red Tomahawk was on one side, Lt. Bull Head on another side with Shaved Head in the back. Even before winning the November 8 election, Trump made no secret of his support for large scale infrastructure projects like Dakota Access. He's now stacking his team with pro-development figures, including former Texas governor Rick Perry, his pick to lead the Department of Energy. Perry sits on the board of directors for Energy Transfer Partners, the firm behind the pipeline. Though he comes from a business background, Viola doesn't come with similar baggage or preconceptions about pipelines. At the same time, he doesn't have any experience with Indian Country either and the Army Corps' handling of Dakota Access has been seen as a failure of its tribal policy. Separate from the pending environmental review, the Army Corps has to defend itself from a cross-claim filed by the wealthy backers of Dakota Access. The firm argues that it has a right to drill under the Missouri River, less than a half-mile north of Standing Rock, despite lacking the easement that was denied this month. The agency is facing a January 6, 2017, deadline -- before Trump is sworn into office -- to submit crucial papers in court on the issue. The Department of Justice, which will soon be under new leadership, plans to contest the cross-claim, an attorney said at a December 9 hearing in D.C. Judge James E. Boasberg agreed to the request as he prepares for a hearing in early February on the easement. By that time, though, Trump will be in office. Beyond the legal and political realms, the new Trump administration will have to face the public, which has rallied behind Indian Country in its effort to stop the pipeline from crossing the Missouri River. We will not stop. A string of brutal winter storms has prompted many to leave, with promises to return once conditions improve. Earlier this month, the population there swelled to 10,000 with the arrival of nearly 4,000 veterans and other supporters. During the late summer and early fall, anywhere between 5,000 to 7,000 people were regular visitors and workers to the camps, located on land promised to the Sioux Nation by treaty.
