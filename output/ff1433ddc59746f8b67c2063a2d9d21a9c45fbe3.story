On Sunday, demonstrators set up a new camp, called Winter Camp, in the pathway of pipeline construction, on what they consider unceded territory belonging to them under the 1851 Laramie Treaty. Police said on Wednesday that they are prepared to carry out that threat. Journalists were also arrested, and had their equipment confiscated. Video footage showed people standing together, backing up as police approached. On Sunday, the Morton County Sheriff called for additional law-enforcement personnel from outside North Dakota. State and local officials also requested, and received, temporary flight restrictions from the Federal Aviation Administration in a seven-mile radius around the protest camps, which may be an attempt to keep away news helicopters, as it was during the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri. And they need to be commensurate with the crime. The department has repeatedly emphasized that protesters are violent, though there is little evidence to back up its claim. In September, for instance, Kirchmeier spread a rumor that demonstrators were threatening to use pipe bombs against officers. She said the response from North Dakota officials fits a pattern of increasing militarization of law enforcement across the country, but that it also echoes a long history of official, state-sanctioned violence against indigenous people. Law enforcement officials have said that they are only responding to illegal activity on private property. It took nearly two months for them to reach that conclusion.
