Lake Michigan pipeline has spilled twice as much as was previously thought Apr 26, 2017 8:54am PDT by Walter Einenkel, Daily Kos Staff 16 39 Please log in or sign up to continue. A new study released Tuesday, using federal data, says that over its 64-year lifespan, the Enbridge Energy Line 5 pipeline has leaked over a million gallons of oil and gas liquids into Lake Michigan. According to the Chicago Sun Times this is about twice as much as was believed to be the case. Over the years, pressure inside the pipeline, which is split into two separate pipes as it goes under the straits, has been increased so that it can move more oil. A massive leak in this area could affect the drinking water of millions of people and destroy the commercial fishing and tourism industries of the area. At the very least, this study shows that oil has been consistently leaking into waterways for decades now, completely underreported. Line 5 carries as much as 540,000 barrels of fossil fuels each day from Superior, Wisconsin, through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario, and is owned by Canadian pipeline giant Enbridge. It passes under the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet, which has provoked concerns that if the pipeline were to leak, it could contaminate the Great Lakes. Just last month, Enbridge acknowledged that the outer casing of underwater pipeline in that area had fallen off in 18 places. Trump and company have pushed forward with cutting funding from the Great Lakes restoration project under the guise of infrastructure project expediency.
