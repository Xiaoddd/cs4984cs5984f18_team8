Activists are gearing up. A high-stakes battle is underway on multiple front lines across America, as Native American and climate change activists square off against oil and pipeline companies racing to lay as much infrastructure into the ground as quickly as possible. The U.S. oil industry is enjoying a surge in production, which has shot up 86 percent since 2008. Unshackled by Congress and enabled by the most oil-friendly president in decades, the industry aims to transform the American landscape with tens of billions of dollars in new pipelines, storage depots, and export terminals. That includes the Dakota Access pipeline, scene of the yearlong protests at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which was slated to begin transporting oil on Sunday. Yet despite oft-repeated claims by politicians and oil executives about the danger of relying on foreign oil, this U.S. petroleum renaissance never was designed to make America energy self-sufficient: A growing amount of that oil will end up in China, Japan, the Netherlands, even Venezuela. Oil production in the U.S. might break records next year. The number of drilling rigs is nearly double that of a year ago. All of this was unthinkable a decade ago, when the shale revolution turned parts of North Dakota and Texas into megaproducers of oil with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Then, at the end of 2015, Congress lifted the 40-year ban on exporting American crude oil. In the year after the export ban was lifted, companies across the U.S. added some 24 million barrels of storage, according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration analyst. An additional 40 million barrels of Gulf Coast crude oil storage are in the works, much of it in export terminals. Some 4,800 miles of new North American crude oil pipelines are in the works in 2017, according to an analysis by Oil and Gas Journal, about half of it in the U.S. In addition, 24,000 miles of new natural gas pipelines are forecast through 2035, according to a survey by the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. The precise number of pipelines is often difficult to calculate, say industry analysts and activists, because there is no centralized source of data. Nevertheless, pipeline battles are shaping up in more than a dozen states, including South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana and Florida. The rush to drill and build comes at a pivotal time for U.S. energy policy, too. Demand for oil is flattening here and renewable energy sources are becoming economically viable, even as U.S. commitments in the Paris climate accords are under threat. The buildout takes place even as some oil companies recognize the threat posed by global warming. Foytlin, 44, an indigenous activist, has six kids, five of them at home in Rayne, near Lafayette in the Louisiana bayou. Foytlin pulls up where a gravel road meets the softly lapping waters of the bayou. It is one of some 700 bodies of water the pipeline would cross in southern Louisiana. But agriculture and oil and gas development carved into the bayou eliminate protective buffers, leaving local residents more vulnerable. It cost me thousands and thousands of dollars. Soon, Foytlin is back in the car, descending from the towering Calcasieu River Bridge and into Lake Charles and the guts of the petroleum industry. Metal scaffolding clings to the steel towers of oil refineries. Red-and-white stacks puff clouds of smoke from petrochemical plants. And everywhere, there are signs of growth. Armies of giant cranes stand amid fields of shiny white 300-foot-wide storage tanks. Energy companies complained it would delay construction, and Trump already has abandoned the pledge for the Keystone XL pipeline. Petroleum-related companies along the Gulf Coast, meanwhile, report booming business. In filings with the SEC, oil transport and storage companies disclose investments totaling tens of billions of dollars in new pipeline and storage ventures. Of course, not every company is that candid, at least in public. Energy Transfer Partners, in describing the need for the Dakota Access pipeline, cites energy independence for American consumers. The map featured a yellow dotted line for the last leg of the Dakota Access pipeline: the Bayou Bridge. That stretch recently cleared one regulatory hurdle, bringing it closer to reality. But in the age of Trump and Standing Rock, Foytlin senses something has changed. Years back, perhaps two or three people would join her at a hearing to oppose oil and gas development. This year, she said, two local hearings on the Bayou Bridge together drew nearly 800 people. The 22-year-old is opposing Enbridge Inc. and its Line 66 pipeline, which would transport up to 800,000 barrels a day of Canadian tar sands oil through the northern Midwest. Still plenty of oil demand Oil hardly looks like an industry on its last legs. Some 35 billion barrels of proven American oil reserves still lie underground, and harder-to-reach reserves could be more than seven times that. The new administration wants to turn the industry loose by shredding regulations, abandoning vehicle fuel standards and promoting new pipelines to send crude toward the Gulf Coast. And for now, there is still plenty of demand. Electric and hybrid vehicles likely will become an increasing part of the U.S. mix. And the American love affair with the automobile appears to be waning. Perhaps the biggest reason of all: Eventually, the politics of climate change will catch up to the reality of its effects. Because in the current atmosphere, say supporters and opponents alike, it still can. Lucian Pugliaresi, president of the pro-oil Energy Policy Research Foundation, stokes the oil security argument. Others see an industry simply looking for new markets in other countries, much like the tobacco industry did when the number of U.S. smokers declined. Committing to the larger fight A half-dozen teepees rose on the National Mall in March in the shadow of the Washington Monument. Several thousand indigenous people and environmentalists had gathered for a rally and march in solidarity with Standing Rock and the broader issues it represents. She sat on a patch of grass on a mild afternoon; the cherry blossoms were blooming, much earlier than usual. It is an urgent situation because the ice melting has allowed the erosion of the coastlines. The game, Gemmill-Fredson said, has been shortened dramatically by its actions. In other words, the opposite of the outcome at Standing Rock. Activists in Washington seemed resigned to the fact that the Dakota Access pipeline soon would be pumping oil, and the gathering on the Mall in some sense represented a commitment to move on to the larger fight. From a Senate office building, the activists livestreamed their meeting with Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Merkley arrived at the encampment, ducked into a teepee and sat on the dirt in his gray pinstripe suit. He was surrounded by more than a dozen Native activists, all with their own stories of energy disasters on their homelands. He looked around the teepee. Outside the teepee was Vanessa Dundon, 32, a Navajo woman who was shot in the eye with a tear gas canister during clashes with police at Standing Rock in November. Since then, she has had three surgeries but says she still has only 10 percent vision in her right eye. Dundon was more interested in talking about where the fight would go from Standing Rock. She meant that literally: Embers from the sacred fire at Standing Rock, she said, are being carried to other pipeline struggles across the country, where they light up new struggles. And the one in Iowa just started. The fire also has spread, symbolically, to a white Southern woman on a lonely patch of land in the Louisiana bayou. Hope Rosinski, 48, owns a home in the path of the Bayou Bridge pipeline. Company representatives have tried to cajole her with friendly talk, entice her with money and threaten her with eminent domain, she said. In March, the company served her with a petition for expropriation. Researcher Rebecca Gibian contributed to this story.
