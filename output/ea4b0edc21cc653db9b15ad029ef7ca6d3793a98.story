In an Instagram post, Momoa urged fans to sign a petition against the oil pipeline which, according to activists, threatens to pollute water sources and disturb sacred burial grounds on the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. It lasted all of four days. An executive order unblocked the project and, on Friday, the administration sent law enforcement to clear the area of dissenters. Momoa held no regrets about rallying fans to the cause, despite resistance he met from higher-ups. He laughed about it. I just prefer to put it out there because you can use your social media to get out some things that people may not know about. I spoke up a lot about Mauna Kea and fought for what was happening on the Big Island. If someone told me to be quiet about that because of my profession, no. His voice can reach many people . Just like he said he wants to stick up for his people. I wish more people were like him speaking up and not sitting back. One person can change things they can get the ball rolling so to speak .
