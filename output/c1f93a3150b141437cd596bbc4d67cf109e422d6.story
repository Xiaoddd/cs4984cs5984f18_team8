An obscure West Virginia law that came to light during the teachers strike gives police expansive powers to crack down on peaceful protesters. Among other things, it allows them to force private individuals to help shut down the group, search homes nearby without a warrant, and impose guilt-by-association on anyone present if an officer is wounded. A bill ostensibly meant to bring the law into the 21st century was introduced before the strike began, but the revisions fall short. But the bill would still allow police officers to commandeer private citizens to help disperse a crowd. In many ways, these dangers mirror the troubling nature of the broader anti-protest legislative trend around the country. In many states, these legislative efforts ignore existing law. If passed, it would not only chill environmental protest, but it would replicate an existing law that already criminalizes property damage. In Wyoming, legislators are considering a similarly repetitive and harmful bill. In West Virginia, lawmakers are now in danger of reaffirming an existing, antiquated law.
