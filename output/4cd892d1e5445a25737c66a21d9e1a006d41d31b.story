Posted on January 16, 2017 by jenny If you are thinking of going to support Kirkby Misperton Protection Camp, here is some info about how to get there and what they need. They are trying to, over time, gather large numbers at the weekend, to show the strength and breadth of the support. Campaigners there say they are committed to staying until Third Energy renounce their intention to frack. They set up camp just before Christmas, after the High Court rejected a legal move to stop plans for fracking at a well to the south-west of the village. If you can give them at least one hour notice, it would be greatly appreciated. Trains from Hebden Bridge to Malton take about 2 hours and involve a change at Leeds. So if you claim this discount, buying your energy from Ecotricity will stop this. Kitchen update. Firstly thank to so many for kind donations. Keep it coming. Post on here or contact Derek Chapman, Lou, Eddie or Tracie. Derek is offering to organise a rota, as this would help. Regarding dry goods, with thanks, could we stop the donations of tins, cereals, pasta and condiments for now please, until we put another call out. No more loo rolls too.. So to conclude.. Come on down for an hour or two, for a tea n chat n biscuits n cake We need builders for the washing up station, and builders for pallet chairs n tables.. Posted from here. Bookmark the permalink.
