The centuries-long genocidal program of the US settler-colonial regimen has largely been omitted from history. Now, for the first time, acclaimed historian and activist Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz offers a history of the United States told from the perspective of Indigenous peoples and reveals how Native Americans, for centuries, actively resisted expansion of the US empire. And as Dunbar-Ortiz reveals, this policy was praised in popular culture, through writers like James Fenimore Cooper and Walt Whitman, and in the highest offices of government and the military.

That is a personal and subjective remark, but true. As an indoctrinated child of the U.S. public education system and a graduate of a U.S. University with a degree in U.S. History, and a lifetime of autodidactic immersion into the study of U.S. History, my reaction to this thoroughly researched and painstakingly documented presentation of an alternative perspective was like barely surviving a modern war. I was disoriented beyond belief, shattered mentally, feeling like I had been blitzkrieged into submission, but I emerged absolutely convinced of the truth of what I read. In other words, an invasion of a land inhabited by a pre-existing people with laws and covenants and self-governmental structures identifying them as the rightful owners and rulers of this place. In addition, the author in turn decimates the puerile understandings fostered by generations of teachers and scholars regarding the motivations and actual practices of our so-called American heroes, almost to a man an apologist for genocide, also relating two-hundred years of precedent to the continued intent behind U.S. military involvement throughout the world. She brilliantly exposes the lies behind our self-congratulatory stance, and every U.S. citizen would be well-served to face the truth of his own history. A great starting place for righting wrongs and creating a better country. This runs the risk of making other parts of settler colonialism, especially assimilation attempts (allotment, boarding schools, termination, etc.), seem somehow less damaging and harmful. Yes we can and should, but given the amount of space in the text that she gives to the former and not the latter speaks to the possibility that the reader will miss the damage of the latter. My final overarching complaint is that this book is incredibly, dangerously caught up in pain and death. And I know that we need to make that pain legible to white settler folks, but I also think that she leaves very, very little room for stories of resilience and survivance (despite her citation of Vizenor,) and I think that people (white settlers and indigenous folk) need to see stories of survivance to understand what to do next. This is influenced by a lot of personal stuff, but I really do think that those narratives need to carry as much weight as the death and pain because focusing on death and pain only perpetuates the dehumanization of indigenous folks. BUT: I will say I think it's a decently accessible book for getting people to think settler colonialism and begin to change the paradigms of the dominant narratives about the US state. I just think that when you finish it, you should immediately read one of the books she suggests to get a taste of narratives of resilience and survivance.

Actually, the natives had an eco-friendly management of the land. It was just not in the style the Europeans used. This was all based on the a papal bull that gave permission for Christians to wipe out non-Christians. This policy was established to justify the crusades. Once the policy was established, the U.S. government made full use of it. The history of genocide in the original 13 colonies and its spread as the country expanded is thoroughly described. However, the book is very light in its coverage of the active Indian slave trade established by the Spanish - particularly in New Mexico and California.

December 9, 2017 Format: Paperback Verified Purchase Other reviews have noted some of the quotes are imperfect, some of the details contestable. I'm a psychologist rather than an historian, oblivious to such details. A have a minor problem with the writing; as an academic writer and reader, I am distracted by the use of adjectives. Adjectives and adverbs are necessarily subjective judgments, best left to the reader. Given the perspective of this work, however, and the broad sweep of nihilistic colonial violence and genocide, emotional writing is likely called for and appropriate. This book presents Anglo readers with some serious problems. We live in a country founded on said violence. No matter how high or low we stand, we stand there on the bones of the murdered. Ortiz does not suggest we all go home to Europe, by any means, but begs us to be aware. So much of this history is hidden, buried, unconscious. And for many people (nations) it is no great favor to make the unconscious conscious. Even so, she highlights on every page the necessity of doing so. This is good, solid writing and an historical tour de force. This work is relevant every day. I recommend it. I bought several other handbooks or introductions (for different subjects) for almost the same price, which are much easier to...
