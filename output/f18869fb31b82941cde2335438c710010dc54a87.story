Zinke is one week into a rapid-fire review of dozens of national monument designations, including the 2016 decision to create Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, under an executive order from the president. Representatives from five different tribal governments tied to the 1.3 million acre monument area in southeastern Utah have tried repeatedly to get Zinke to talk to them, they said, but the secretary has not responded. Advertisement Yet Zinke has held meetings with others, bypassing the sovereign Indian nations and their governments to talk with county and state officials of the U.S. government. We are supposed to engage in a process. Astroturfing The Desert Instead, Zinke has entertained the input of San Juan County Commission leader Phil Lyman, who strenuously opposes the monument designation. Lyman was sentenced to 10 days in jail and 3 years probation for organizing the illegal protest ride, a penalty he appealed without help of a lawyer. Federal and local officials in the San Juan County area of Utah where much of Bears Ears lies have been swift to hold up minority dissenting opinions from individual Indians who do not speak for any tribal government, they said. The apparent push to undermine Indian governments and erase tribal perspectives on Bears Ears is ironic given the history of anglo-Indian relations in Utah, Chapoose said. My people. If Trump believes he has tasked Zinke with unwinding monuments protections and shrinking federal authority over western lands, then all the rest of this is just window dressing. Zinke, who rode a horse to his Washington, D.C. office on his first day as Secretary, is familiar with political stagecraft. The Trump-Zinke-Lyman axis may believe it can score a quick win by rapidly rescinding the monument designation hammered out over years and years of negotiations. The fuel and mining companies that would ultimately win out financially might celebrate. The Trump-Zinke sprint toward an industry-friendly administrative ruling would put everyone involved back onto a war footing that imposes costs on all parties. For all his wry invocations of old stereotypes, though, Chapoose sounded weary of being cast as the belligerents in a renewed fight over Bears Ears.
