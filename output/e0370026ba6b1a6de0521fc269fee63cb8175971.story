The legislation, which still needs to be considered by the state Senate, also would make it a misdemeanor to wear a mask while committing a crime. Rep. Terry Jones, R-New Town, said he and other members of the House Judiciary Committee carefully considered the proposals with the goal of protecting citizens' rights. The new charge would apply to situations such as pipeline protesters who attach themselves to equipment to stall construction of the pipeline. Opponents questioned whether a felony offense was appropriate. House Bill 1426 would elevate offenses such as instigating a riot of 100 or more people or providing firearms or weapons for a riot from a Class C felony to a Class B felony. Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Byers testified during the hearing that individuals can be guilty of engaging in a riot if they fail to disperse when ordered by law enforcement, even if they remain peaceful during the event. Jones said the proposal is modeled after how speeding tickets are issued in North Dakota and could reduce some of the cases that need to go through the court system. Lawmakers voted 69-22 in favor of House Bill 1304, which makes it a Class A misdemeanor to wear a mask while committing a crime or fleeing from a crime. The bill was amended from its initial proposal to address concerns about it being unconstitutional. The bill, which failed in a 11-79 vote, had language that was vague, overly broad and would not withstand constitutional challenges, said Rep. Shannon Roers Jones, R-Fargo. About 700 people have been arrested in connection with Dakota Access protest activity since Aug. 10. The bills carry an emergency clause, which means they would become effective immediately if approved by the Legislature and signed by the governor.
