While the Dakota Access Pipeline is scheduled for further construction, it is important to examine the thriving community that was established at the Sacred Stone camp along Lake Oahe. As many as 10,000 protestors visited the encampment, where food and water accommodations were provided along with a 24-hour security post, medical tent and both solar and wind power resources. It is these phenomena which help model an ideal society. Everyone engages in participatory roles that contribute to a common goal. She further reasoned that people want to make a difference and alleviate the current situation during these times. Memorable protests throughout history were named, including the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong for universal suffrage and Arab Spring in Tunisia to protest a political regime. This protest camp in Washington had a medical clinic as well as access to education, shelter and food for all participants. Here was another example of the people creating an ideal society of their own. Addressing another issue, Fiskio explained that the protests are not anti-institutional, for people could not create the results needed if that were so. Occupy Wall Street, for example, was not about tearing the bureaucratic institutions down, Fiskio said, but rather a movement that exemplified a caring, just society speaking for what they believed in. The Tar Sands Healing Walk in 2010 was discussed. This was a peaceful demonstration to acknowledge the people, air quality and wildlife affected by the Athabasca Oil Corporation in Alberta, Canada. The significance of this event can be traced in the simple, everyday act of walking. This march communicated decades of exploitation and suffering received by the local First Nations people, where water contamination, food security and disease were key issues. It can happen in a garden, in classrooms, or in the work space. During a discussion following the presentation, Michael Omps posed a question regarding issues today. Omps said. Fiskio reasoned, it is not that we need to think in that mindset. There are different strategies for being effective in different ways. They were going through the Supreme Court. They were going through the state system. They were using boycotts. Among the audience was Dr. Fulbert Namwamba, a professor of environmental studies at Southern University in Louisiana. We are watching things happening. There is no fantasy. Namwamba further stated that there are three things necessary to create change. The first one is the use of knowledge, for that will always be present. The second is being able to use science, and third is the need to organize. Among the stifling of the EPA and loose regulations for fossil fuel industries, knowledge will always be there to provide substantive evidence. Several members of the audience remained to speak to Fiskio following her insightful presentation. Massey is an environmental and political science major at Salisbury University. This presentation offered great information about the history of protests, the implications of those movements and the knowledge to be gained in the current climate of political activism. but there was an error posting your comment.
