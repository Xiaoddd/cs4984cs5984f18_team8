Three of those dissenting votes went to Colin Powell and the fourth went to Faith Spotted Eagle. If that name has you wondering who on earth Faith Spotted Eagle is, well, that was exactly the intent of the man who cast that vote, Robert Satiacum. In what he says was a last-second decision, the member of Washington's Puyallup Tribe opted to vote for Spotted Eagle of South Dakota's Yankton Sioux Reservation to send a message about the environment. As a result, Spotted Eagle is believed to be the first Native American to win an electoral vote for the land's highest office. Spotted Eagle has made a name for herself as an environmental activist, most visibly in opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline and more recently the Dakota Access pipeline, notes the Seattle Times. The protest of the latter is where she and Satiacum met. But she tells ABC News she understands the vote is about the movement she belongs to, not herself. She adds that she expects things to get worse for environmentalists under the Trump administration.
