HEATHER BELLOW - THE BERKSHIRE EAGLE Micah Carpenter-Lott led the activist march from Southern Berkshire District Court to TD Bank, where groups are calling for divestment from large banks that support pipeline builds. HEATHER BELLOW - THE BERKSHIRE EAGLE A coalition of activists calls for divestment from fossil fuel projects outside TD Bank in Great Barrington on Monday. The mission hasn't changed. But with the pipeline they've fought for nearly six months about to go live, they're now taking a broader strategy and going after the system, one they say is not only harming the environment but crushing the rights of indigenous people. Botkin then walked into the bank with the crowd at his back and delivered a letter, calling for divestment, intended for the CEO of the company. That ended with town police asking everyone to leave the lobby. But it all began earlier at Southern Berkshire District Court for pretrial hearings for four water protectors who were charged with trespassing on Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.'s work easement in Otis State Forest. Micah Carpenter-Lott, MyKennah (Little Wind) Lott, Karla Colon-Aponte and William Connelly were charged with criminal trespass, but those charges were reduced to civil offenses and civil responsibility hearings set for Dec. 7. The water protectors have joined forces with Sugar Shack Alliance members and other groups to try to stop the completion of the Kinder Morgan subsidiary's natural gas spur next to two existing pipelines built in 1951 and 1981 in the Otis State Forest in Sandisfield. The company is ready to begin pumping gas through its Connecticut Expansion Project, a 13-mile, tri-state storage loop that has been criticized at every turn. More than 70 arrests have been made since the work began in May. Activists have decried the effect the production and distribution of more natural gas will have on the earth's atmosphere. They have lamented such infrastructure going into state-owned and protected forest. And they have condemned what they say is an overarching economic system that funds pipeline construction. It is on this complaint that they walked to the bank to encourage divestment from one bank marked by activists around the continent as investing in pipeline construction. And they weren't alone Monday. As it turns out, TD Bank does not fund the Connecticut Expansion Project, according to company spokesman Matthew Doherty. But the activists think this investing is anything but. Botkin further called on elected officials and pension managers to join a boycott and also close accounts with Bank of America, CitiBank and Wells Fargo. Drivers honked in support. Water protectors performed a sage smoke purification ritual on everyone, including members of the press. Then police showed up. Then Botkin, who has been arrested twice since May, went in. Amid singing and drumming, he stood in the lobby after delivering the letter, looking like he might not budge, despite police asking him to leave. After about 10 minutes of singing and drumming, he did, and officer Samuel Stolzar shooed everyone else out. But it is this issue that is new fuel for Native American activists rooted out of their entrenchment at Standing Rock, N.D. They haven't pulled attention away from the Dakota Access Pipeline, but have turned to the bank divestment tactic. The indigenous grass-roots group has teamed up with a website that is collecting bank and divestment information. The organization says the government and its courts do not protect indigenous people, and all that's left is pulling money out of banks that continue to fund the Dakota Access Pipeline and other building projects, including the four Tar Sands Expansion pipelines in Canada, which are opposed by a treaty alliance of 121 First Nations and Tribes. The Mazaska Talks site says there is momentum. Back outside TD Bank, police asked protesters to use half the sidewalk so people could pass. And more police arrived, including Chief William Walsh, who, after talking to some protesters, was purified with sage, top to bottom. Walsh smiled. Reach staff writer Heather Bellow at 413-329-6871.
