Some opponents of the controversial tar sands pipeline have suggested this, but more and more people inside the oil industry are saying time has passed by the project. TransCanada, the company seeking to build the pipeline, acknowledged Friday that the project might be abandoned. The legal courtlike hearings to determine whether the 275-mile route will be approved by the Nebraska Public Service Commission are scheduled from Aug. 7 to 11 in Lincoln. A company spokesman said he could not say whether oil producers are turning away from the XL, as is being reported, because the information is proprietary. But Matt John of TransCanada said that talks with producers continue and the company remains optimistic the 36-inch pipeline from Alberta to a junction at Steele City, Nebraska, will be built. Much has changed since the Keystone XL was first proposed in 2008. Meanwhile, U.S. production of oil has taken off, rising 77 percent between 2008 and 2016 due to the advent of fracking. And other pipelines have been proposed and built to transport oil. And its Keystone pipeline, which crosses eastern Nebraska, has been hauling crude since June of 2010. At one time the XL was going to haul 100,000 barrels of U.S. oil a day from fields in Montana and North Dakota. But pipeline capacity from North Dakota has increased 500 percent in the past decade. Three other pipelines from Canada have been proposed, and some analysts think that, given the opposition in the U.S. to the Keystone XL and the expected legal battles, at least two of them are on a faster track than the nine-year-old XL, and will fulfill any need for new pipelines. He said that while there could be an oversupply of pipelines to the mid-2020s, there is a need for heavy crude oil on the Gulf Coast. He added that of the three leading pipelines, the Trans Mountain likely had the most upside, since it would service new markets in Asia. With a worldwide glut of oil, there are just cheaper and easier sources of oil elsewhere. Forecasts for oil production in the oil sands regions have fallen dramatically since oil prices plummeted in 2014. XL critics, including in the oil industry, point out that TransCanada has bet on some losers in the past. The company was picked by then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to build an 800-mile natural gas pipeline there. But by 2014, natural gas was cheap and plentiful and the project was dead. John, the TransCanada spokesman, said those projects were different, and the company still sees customer need for the Keystone XL. Nebraska dropped out of the multistate compact that was determined to build the dump in Boyd County. Time had passed it by, and other repositories were sufficient. Of course, things could change, oil analysts said. If the worldwide supply of oil is disrupted, particularly the flow of heavy crude oil from strife-torn Venezuela, oil prices would skyrocket, brightening the outlook for the Keystone XL. But right now, observers like Share, the oil industry magazine editor, say that oil producers are shying away from signing up the 20-year contracts required to use and, more importantly, finance the pipeline. 402-473-9584 Sign up for World-Herald news alerts Be the first to know when news happens.
