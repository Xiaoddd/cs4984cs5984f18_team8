In this audio postcard, we bring you the voices of two Arizonans who went to Standing Rock to protect the water they believe embodies life itself. My name is Jandi Craig. I am a member of the White Mountain Apache Tribe, and I am a member of the I Dishchiidn Clan. I am also a proud member of the International Network of Indigenous Women of the Americas. It tells you a lot of about the indigenous paradigm. What you plant there, how you treat it. To me being a Water Protector is like being an advocate for something that has sort of lost its voice, which would be the water. It brings up some feelings of trauma. I think that it echoes that colonial violence that continues to exist in our world right now, in our experience as indigenous people. I think with the whole idea of protecting the water in a peaceful sense, not in a confrontational sense, not in a confrontational sense, the whole peacekeeping water protection journey. Even my name, Shonto, is water. I think in this case it is people putting themselves between the sacred element of water and those that are planning on a possible destruction of it, or change, or fouling, desecration of it. A lot of people, the extent of their association with water is just turning on the tap. Know where it comes from and the life of it, and the possible pollution of it, that we all need water. That little sparkle of light that plays on the canyon. I guess, a signature of that spirit.
