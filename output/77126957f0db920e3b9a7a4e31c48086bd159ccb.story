Confrontations began on Wednesday, August 10, when construction crews and private security hired by Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based developers overseeing the pipeline, arrived to break ground. Arrests were made beginning Thursday, as 14 protesters were charged with disorderly conduct and trespassing, while dozens more remained defiantly on site. Organizers, led by Standing Rock Sioux, established Camp of the Sacred Stones in April, after learning of the impending project. Concerned that the pipeline would wreak havoc on the sacred sites and delicate wildlife in the area, a group of about 30 indigenous tribal members and allies moved to occupy the proposed construction site. LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, a tribal historian and organizer, was confident as she spoke to reporters in April. They argued that the pipeline, which would pump as much as 570,000 barrels daily of fracked Bakken crude under the Missouri River, represents a major ecological threat as well as public health risk. Rather than comply with these requests, the USACE announced on July 26 that it had approved permits requested by Energy Transfer Partners to begin work on the pipeline. A coalition of lawyers and advocates issued a statement of protest on August 5, arguing that both tribal and environmental concerns were being disregarded. Further efforts have been spearheaded by the younger generation. Standing Rock Youth launched an online petition in the spring and gathered 166,140 signatories. When the USACE failed to respond, the group extended their run to Washington D.C. and New York City, traversing 2,000 miles to deliver the petition. Embed from Getty Images On Monday, the residents of spirit camp received a 48-hour notice that construction of the pipeline in their area would begin August 10. We are searching for every avenue through prayer to defeat this Black Snake. Protesters held out on the scene through the first night, but on August 11, local news sources reported arrests had begun. Activists posted videos online of civilians blocking the path to the construction site, some being forcibly removed by law enforcement. According to Brave Bull Allard, the crowd had grown to approximately 200 protesters by Thursday evening, including members of other Native tribes, non-Native allies, and even actress Shailene Woodley. While videos circulating online yesterday showed bulldozers breaking ground, the movement remains steadfast. Emboldened by solidarity and prayer, they will continue to stand their ground.

The Native American people were here on this land first, then these white people put them on reservations and restricted them so they are constantly poor, now the white people want to use their land for FREE. In the name of the father the son and the Holy Ghost .. Amen Glenda Sue Jenkins August 13, 2016 at 9:43 am We need to BAN fracking. Water is Life. We stand with our brothers and sisters of Standing Rock. Harriet August 13, 2016 at 11:21 am Looking for share to Facebook button. Cannt find it. My wishes of the heart are with you. We are sharing, praying, and rallying for your success. But all throughout history, mankind has always sought a way to escape or buy their way out of a mess they create. Greed is one of the seven deadly sins. The water table in that area is very shallow. It does not go down really deep. It will be easily contaminated. My father prophesied that one day our home territory in NE Kansas would be a desert. At the time, I just listened. Now, I can see how that can be a reality. Cynthia mann August 13, 2016 at 4:07 pm Our Native Americans have suffered far more injustice than is imaginable. This is just one more. They fought on the exact same grounds to stop the pipeline coming through. Its the same thing except for the fact that they are discriminating against Native Americans again. Send the information to TRANS-CANADIAN pipeline to show them that Nebraska changed its mind. All other states were on board except them. What an obvious move of discrimination of Native Americans. Even after the EPA and everyone said no. It worked for Nebraska. This is more than the same situation with Native American sacred ground. We lose our God given rights and those afforded by the constitution every day. They got rough with the Native Americans to protect their lands but the BLM (black lives matter) protesters do what they want, inciting hatred and violence. Look at the police officers that lost their lives. The reservation belongs to the Native Americans and are supposed to be protected by the Federal Government. Ann August 14, 2016 at 12:26 am We are not ignorant. Read the constitution. Life, Liberty and Pursuit of happiness came from the decision of God given rights. It became American rights. Ignorance is not knowing, therefore you are ignorant. Check your facts before spouting names. I was a professor at a University and also worked for an oil and gas company. I will not waste my time any further you need to do your research. Then again you appear to be an atheist. I am just making sure they have accurate knowledge to win. Being Native American myself I understand. Melissa August 14, 2016 at 5:43 am Here we go the pot calling the kettle black, always some ignorant person posting stuff like this. Just making sure of which one you are calling ignorant. Just making sure of who you were referring to. I took care of pipelines in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming. I know the process. Sharon Davis August 15, 2016 at 9:56 pm This was indian land before it was america. What indians werent killed or died from disease brought here from europe entered into treaties. The treaties have all been broken. Indian culture was nearly destroyed. They tried to erase the spiritual worship of the land and all it provides for sustaining life. The land is mother earth. Land passed down by generations. Indians do have their god given right to this land and absolutely that land by treaty. Ulonda faye August 13, 2016 at 6:43 pm I am adding my energy and support in prayer. May all prayers be heard immediately, and may you all be blessed for your work. We must protect our mother, Mother Earth. Love, Light and Blessings. Marge Berkeyheiser August 13, 2016 at 10:18 pm I pray for your land to be saved. Mother Earth is suffering the 600 poison chemicals they pump into her through fracking. The spilled oil from the sub-par pipes used in the pipelines that blacken the land for days at a time before anyone ever discovers it. The pollution pumped into the water and air. They have no respect for the earth that gives them life. I guess no one needs to use it after they are gone. Nothing is more important than the greed of money. They are sick demented souls that thinks money is God. I pray our God to save the land and our earth from the likes of greed that put money over the rights of others. Medicine Turtle August 14, 2016 at 3:03 am Dakota Pipeline needs to stop the land is sacred medicine turtle cherokee Chris Williams August 14, 2016 at 12:12 pm Thank you brave youth for standing against corporate greed. May your efforts be successful, may you prevail in protecting your land I hope that somewhere in past treaties, there is language that can prevent further rape of the land; that legal manipulation can work for you, as it does for corporations. sandra August 14, 2016 at 1:59 pm Drop this stupid pipeline, honor our natives and our land, our planet. I waa born in n.d. and it was pristine at that time. This pipeline is a blasphemy. anna begody August 14, 2016 at 4:47 pm These people think they can do whatever they want. They dont understand our culture and our connection to Mother Earth. As Natives we must keep fighting, dont ever give up. Our people before had to fight for this land for our own lands..now its our turn to fight. Wira Laubach August 14, 2016 at 6:31 pm You should inform worldwide news agencies to report about it. You need more press this will make more pressure. petition Patricia Collins August 15, 2016 at 4:12 pm Please show some humanity and leave this alone. The Native Americans have been through enough and put up with enough. Your greed is going to destroy you but unfortunately it will destroy the earth, the only home we will ever know first. You are throwing this beautiful gift of mother earth back in the face of our creator who gave us everything to live abundantly. Norma Martin August 15, 2016 at 8:29 pm I admire the courage to do the right thing for all the people. Nola Lee Kelsey August 16, 2016 at 5:54 pm This project based in greed disrespects the Sioux lands & people, risk the Missouri River (a massive tributary to the Mississippi) and is a waste or money that should be going into clean energy, not dirty water. PJ Lincoln August 16, 2016 at 9:21 pm Blessings on these brave people,standing up for what is right and true, for the land, for the animals , for the sacredness of mother earth. Wish I could be there with them, it is indigenous peoples worldwide fighting to stop the onslaught of corporate profits willing to endanger and pillage our environment. Wira Laubach August 17, 2016 at 6:08 pm I agree. Nick Matthews August 17, 2016 at 9:40 am I was prepared to stand with the native people of northern wisconsin when a mine was threatening their wetlands. I want to stand with the native people now.
