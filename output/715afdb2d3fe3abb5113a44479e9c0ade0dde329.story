Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. DR. DR. I went to the protest site to participate in the protests. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: I believe it was August 12th. And so, there had already been some people arrested prior to that, trying to stop the machines from going onto the land just north of the Oceti Sakowin camps. That was actually before the camp had really started. But the Sacred Stone Camp had been there since April. So I went there just with the intent of participating as any citizen would concerned about our environment. DR. And so there were people that were collected along the road that were praying, and they were singing and saying different, you know, protest chants, basically. And there were community members of all ages and all races there to help us, you know, voice our opposition to what was going on. DR. You know, the decisions that are made regarding pipelines in North Dakota, those decisions have to go through the Public Service Commission. And so, we were first aware of the Dakota Access pipeline route in 2014, is when I became aware. And so, the company had notified the tribe of the route they were going to take, and, you know, there were probably about 50 of us community members that attended and voiced our opposition at that time to the route. The confluence of the rivers right there had created many stones that were sacred to our community members, to our people, and had been used in spiritual ways for hundreds of years. There are other stories of when our people had to flee the Army and the cavalry of places that they would cross, and those are historic places, as well. The graves and the stone effigies that are in that area are also important to our community members. DR. I was there, but I had already been arrested previously, and so I was one of the people named in the SLAPP suit with a restraining order. So, I actually was there, but I had to stay a hundred feet away. AMY GOODMAN: Explain what that SLAPP suit is. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: So, the SLAPP suit, basically, it named several people, including the tribal chairman and other tribal councilmen and several other people, but then they added on Jane and John Doe onto that. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: Because we had already previously been arrested and identified. Like, the charge that I was charged with was disorderly conduct. AMY GOODMAN: So, explain what you did that day, on August 12th. DR. And so, the actions that I was involved with that day were to protest the company using our treaty lands to facilitate building a pipeline, which threatens our way of life. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: Yes, the Army Corps of Engineer lands are included in our treaty territory. And that includes the lands that the Army Corps has claimed are their lands, as well. AMY GOODMAN: That created Lake Oahe. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: Yes, that created Lake Oahe and Lake Sakakawea up on Three Affiliated territory. DR. We know that there are people around the world that are also fighting to keep their waters clean and fighting for the health of their families and community members. I want my children to have clean water. And we have communities all across South Dakota that depend on this river also. AMY GOODMAN: I was speaking with a non-Native person who had come to the reservation casino to see a concert, and I asked him what he thought about the pipeline. DR. And so, the safest way is for us to change to renewable energy. And North Dakota should be in the lead of harnessing that wind energy. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: How that relates is that the state of North Dakota and the Public Health Department and the Public Service Commission had recently voted to raise the level of radioactive waste in the state of North Dakota, the level that could be stored here. The companies, a lot of times, have been using subcontractors who were dumping radioactive waste just in random warehouses. So those are things that we have to be aware of and continuing to fight against the lack of regulation of these environmental waste products in North Dakota and the lack, really, of a public health discussion in our state, that have not been given a voice in the Public Service Commission process or really a voice in the media, either. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: Right now those SLAPP suits had been dismissed. And so will many of the water protectors, as well. DR. DR. AMY GOODMAN: Thank you. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: Yes. We see a pattern of corporations doing this. DR. Stay with us.
