NRDC has been opposed to all major new tar sands pipelines proposed over the last decade. An orca surfaces. Flickr But among the bunch, the Trans Mountain expansion is an extraordinary stinker. Salmon navigating upstream to spawn Flickr In a terse summary of the decision, the court embraces the importance of considering the full scope of risks the Trans Mountain expansion would create if built, something Canadian regulators failed to do. In the two-pronged decision, the judge wrote: The Board unjustifiably defined the scope of the Project under review not to include Project-related tanker traffic. Canada failed in Phase III to engage, dialogue meaningfully and grapple with the real concerns of the Indigenous applicants so as to explore possible accommodation of those concerns. The duty to consult was not adequately discharged. And none of that even gets at the climate problem created by this project and the two others supported by the Trudeau government: the new Line 3 and Keystone XL. Together, the three pipelines would facilitate growth in tar sands production to the tune of more than two million bpd. Unlike other oil fields, tar sands projects produce for very long periods, meaning that new production would be locked in for at least 50 years, creating a huge impediment to the global effort to decarbonize our economies by midcentury.
