TOM STROMME, TRIBUNE Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Two Dakota Access Pipeline protesters were arrested for criminal trespass at Turtle Hill on Friday. Police made the arrests at 3:15 p.m. at the hill, which is located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land. A number of arrests have been made on the hill as protesters have crossed the Cannonball River to get to a sacred burial site. This brings the total number of protest-related arrests to 584 since Aug. 10. Earlier that same day, at 2:45 a.m., about 50 protesters were at Backwater Bridge removing concertina wire from the law enforcement barricade on the north end of the bridge. Protesters disregarded orders from law enforcement to leave the bridge. Braun said the corps is supposed to issue a statement to initiate an environmental impact statement for the 1,172-mile crude oil pipeline, but has yet to do so. The bridge has been a point of contention since law enforcement erected concrete barriers across it, saying it was unsafe after being damaged by fires set during an October clash between police and protesters. Tribal officials say the bridge's continued closure has caused economic harm to the tribe, has made travel more difficult for local residents and has delayed emergency response to the area. Core samples were shipped to an out-of-state lab for structural damage analysis, with results still pending. The protesters remained at the bridge until 3:45 a.m. No arrests were made at the site. Braun said she remained near the bridge with a warm vehicle to make sure no one got too cold. At the camp, people have been checking in on one another to make sure everyone stays warm as subzero temperatures continue. Your notification has been saved.
