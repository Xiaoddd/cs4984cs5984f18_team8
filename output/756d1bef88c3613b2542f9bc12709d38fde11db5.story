Rudi and his mother fled Austria after its annexation to Nazi Germany, where Hitler had banned nudity, among many other acts. When a photo shoot for his topless swimsuit was arranged on Montego Bay in the Bahamas, all five models for the session outright refused to wear the design. Carol Doda was later arrested in 1965 for indecency which sparked a protest outside the police department calling for her release. The monokini had made the former prune picker a symbol of sexual freedom. Funnily enough, Rudy was also well-known for his revolutionary designs that actually covered the breasts. In the same year he released the monokini, Rudy also invented what we essentially know today as a seamless soft-cup elastic bra. His minimalist designed revolutionized bra design, changing the trend from a sculpted, bullet-shaped bosom to a more natural shape. The topless monokini went on to reach its highest popularity level during the 1970s but has since been revisited numerous times in magazine shoots, worn by supermodels such as Kate Moss and Laetitia Casta. And again, going in for the grab. Aaand again. This might have been a re-occurring problem with the monokini. Alright back-off buddy. and only that. and only that. All rights reserved.
