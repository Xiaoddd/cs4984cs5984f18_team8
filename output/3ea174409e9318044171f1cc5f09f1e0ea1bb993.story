On Wednesday night, the third annual Candlelight Vigil honoring the Tolowa Dee-ni' (people) killed at Yan'-daa-kivt (Yontocket) in the 19th century attempted to move past the pain by acknowledging the massacre. The vigil offered a time to reflect on the more than 450 Tolowa killed in 1853 by white settlers pushing into the area, but it's also a time to give thanks to the surviving ancestors who kept the Tolowa people in existence. Under a star-soaked sky, with the sound of waves crashing in the background, almost 50 people gathered around a bonfire, electric candles in hand, to remember the Tolowa people that lived at Yontocket. Tribal council member and resident historian Loren Bommelyn told the tale of the Tolowa massacre and the Tolowa's relationship with Yontocket, located within present-day Tolowa Dunes State Park, a place the Tolowa believe to be the center of their spiritual world. The Tolowa believe that Yontocket is the site where the Creators made the first redwood and the first people. For thousands of years, the Tolowa Indians on the North Coast, numbering at least 10,000 people, gathered annually at the Yontocket village to celebrate Nee-dash, a world renewal ceremony, Bommelyn said. The 10-day ceremony is held during winter solstice, because that's when days start growing longer, Bommelyn said. Tolowa people would come from as far as present-day Humboldt Bay and Port Orford for the ceremony, Bommelyn said. During the Nee-dash festival of 1853, white settlers set fire to the plank homes of Yontocket, then shot at the Tolowa while they ran from the flames, Bommelyn said. The state would reimburse militia men for every Indian scalp they brought back. Smith River Rancheria has 11 receipts showing reimbursement for Indian scalps, Bommelyn said. The Smith River Rancheria and some other anthropologists have declared the destruction of native populations in this region a holocaust because it was organized under a government, Bommelyn said. After the Yontocket massacre and destruction of the village, the Tolowa founded a new village between present-day Lake Earl and Lake Tolowa called Etchulet, meaning large land peninsula. The 1854 Nee-dash ceremony was held there, but once again white settlers came for Indian scalps, this time killing around 100 people, Bommelyn said. From 1851 to 1856, around 8,000 Tolowa people were killed, then another 1,834 were marched to a reservation, which was more like a concentration camp, in Oregon, Bommelyn said. The few hundred that remained were eventually sent to reservations at present-day Klamath and Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation, Bommelyn said. The vigil honoring the Yontocket victims and survivors was started to help the tribe overcome feelings about the slaughter. Bommelyn and others shared the pain of knowing about the massacre and the marginalization experienced from growing up Indian - all part of the healing process. After the vigil at Yontocket, attendants met at the Lake Earl Grange to share a meal, stories and watch a documentary made in the 1970s about the Tolowa people. The tribe expressed optimism about the shift towards acknowledging their ancestors' past, and hopes to continue to spread knowledge of the massacre.
