Native Americans march to a sacred burial ground site that was disturbed by bulldozers building the Dakota Access pipeline. His third book, Death at Seaworld, was published in 2012. An analysis released Wednesday by the Center for Biological Diversity found that pipelines in North Dakota have spilled crude oil and other hazardous liquids at least 85 times since 1996. In the largest accident, in July 2013, some 840,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from a pipeline in Tioga, North Dakota, and contaminated a wheat field. The analysis was released just days after the Obama administration denied an easement to the Dakota Access pipeline for construction under Lake Oahe, the drinking water supply for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which has been on the ground with supporters protesting the pipeline for months. Instead, the corps will conduct a review of alternate pipeline routes and complete an environmental impact statement for the project. Spivak said her group opposes all new fossil fuel infrastructure projects because of their contribution to climate change, as well as their direct impact on local ecosystems. Pipelines can fail in a number of ways, including mechanical failure, human error, and subfreezing temperatures that can rupture pipes, connectors, and valves, she said. A companion time-lapse video documents each significant incident. Corps officials did not respond to requests for comment. One company behind the project, Energy Transfer Partners, did not respond to requests for comment. Donald Trump once owned a stake in Energy Transfer Partners and wants to see the pipeline completed.
