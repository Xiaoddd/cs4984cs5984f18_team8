In Washington, Trump continued to speak, with Judge Neil Gorsuch and his wife now standing behind him. Yet his execution was a reminder of the kinds of cases Gorsuch would review if confirmed to the Supreme Court. When outside lawyers tried to step in to correct their gross neglect, courts blocked them at every turn. Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch arrives for a meeting at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Feb. 2, 2017. At the center of their argument was midazolam, the first in the three-drug cocktail used to kill Lockett. But sodium thiopental had become unavailable years before, in part due to an international anti-death penalty campaign to cut off supplies. States rushed to find a replacement, tinkering with their formulas. Yet Oklahoma forged ahead. The District Court denied the challenge. Judge Gorsuch joined the decision. Warner was executed three days later. Oral arguments in Glossip v. Gross took place on April 29, 2015. In her dissent, Sotomayor disagreed. In a perverse postscript to the legal saga over midazolam, autopsy records would later reveal that Oklahoma killed Charles Warner using the wrong drug, a discovery made public only after Oklahoma came close to doing the same with Richard Glossip later that year. Judge Gorsuch may be a bit player in this sorry legal episode, but that does not entirely excuse him. Other decisions have inspired reflection in Gorsuch. Francis was removed from the chair and successfully executed several days later. Staunch adherence to precedent is rarely good news for people facing execution, whose challenges can be easily waved away on procedural grounds, even when the facts of their case are objectively egregious. At the heart of this question was the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, otherwise known as AEDPA. More significantly, AEDPA shifted the balance of power in the judiciary, demanding far more deference from federal judges to state court rulings. AEDPA has been especially devastating for the wrongfully convicted. Durbin asked. Yet as a judge, his rare findings of error in such cases have been generally followed by the conclusion that the error was ultimately harmless. When his federal habeas petition was inevitably dismissed as untimely, the attorneys did not bother to tell Christeson, leaving him under the impression that his appellate proceedings were still underway. In the end, state intransigence and procedural roadblocks kept his new attorneys from saving his life. We cannot know how Gorsuch might have handled the case of the man executed on the night of his nomination. And while his record certainly suggests he might have waved it through on procedural grounds, this would hardly differentiate him from judges who have spent their careers doing the same. This includes Merrick Garland, whose nomination was so shamelessly derailed by Republicans last year. With Gorsuch yet to turn 50, he stands to be a conservative force on the Supreme Court for decades to come. Yet Singh points out that Supreme Court justices have very different experiences with death penalty cases. They see the arbitrariness, the flaws embedded in the system.
