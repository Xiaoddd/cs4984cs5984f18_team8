They say they are using only as much fertilizer as they need to grow their crops. Toxins in that muck seeped into the water supply of Toledo, Ohio, last weekend, forcing officials to ban nearly half a million people from using tap water. And local farmers are on the defensive. Six miles from Lake Erie is Ron Schimming's 400-acre soybean and corn farm. He's referring to Toledo's water crisis. Farm runoff is often cited as a major cause of Lake Erie's algae problem. Schimming doesn't deny that, but he says he's using only the fertilizer he needs. Forty miles south of Schimming's land, another farmer, Paul Herringshaw, oversees his soybean fields. Farmers like him have been working for decades to reduce fertilizer runoff into the lake, he says. Many farmers have cut back or stopped tilling the soil. Following the water crisis, the Ohio Farm Bureau, which represents 60,000 farmers across the state, went on the offensive. The bureau has long promoted proper fertilizer techniques. So have local county conservation programs like the Ottawa Soil and Water Conservation District. And as we've reported, farmers have actually been using less fertilizer in the basin in the past 10 years. Water quality experts are still trying to understand why phosphorus from crop fertilizer is seeping into the lake at rates not seen in decades. And there is growing concern that the algae are feeding off of other sources, too, such as runoff from livestock and sewage. Most experts still believe that phosphorus is the main cause of algae on the lake, and efforts to improve the water largely focus on farming. Earlier this summer, Ohio lawmakers passed a measure requiring most farmers to be certified before applying fertilizer. But it's unclear how much this will affect the lake. It is disgusting. It is putrid. Yet Bihn doesn't lay all the blame on the farmers. Instead, she says other sources need to be considered, too. algae bloom sewage crop runoff drinking water Toledo, Ohio agriculture Facebook Twitter Flipboard Email The Salt What's On Your Plate The Salt What's On Your Plate About With a pinch of skepticism and a dash of fun, The Salt covers food news from the farm to the plate and beyond.
