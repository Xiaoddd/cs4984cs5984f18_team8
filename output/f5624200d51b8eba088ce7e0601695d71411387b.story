By Daniel J. Graeber (0) A U.S. oil pipeline group said it wants relief from tariffs on steel as most of the domestic sector caters to industries like automotive. U.S. President Donald Trump signed off on the tariffs, saying they were necessary to protect national security and critical industries. Before the Commerce Department defended the move last week, Jack Gerard, the president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, said the president's announcement of a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff for aluminum was inconsistent with Trump's goal of U.S. energy dominance. The U.S. Association of Oil Pipe Lines, meanwhile, said the administration should use caution when considering new tariffs. Hundreds of millions of dollars could be added to the cost of major pipeline projects like Keystone XL and take jobs out of the U.S. economy.

In one of his first moves in office, Trump facilitated the approval process for the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. Sandy Fielden, the director for oil and products research at Morningstar, said earlier this month that steel tariffs in particular could throttle the U.S. energy sector because of the increase for pipeline projects like Keystone XL.

Oil and gas companies, meanwhile, could be forced to cancel projects because of the higher price for steel.
