Presbyterian Disaster Assistance is responding to Florence & Mangkhut: give now. But those are just a few of the professionals who have brought their talents to the camp to assist during these difficult days. More than 3,000 people are preparing to spend the holidays fighting cold, windy conditions in Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Some have been there since April as the Standing Rock Sioux tribe began its efforts to stop the construction of an oil pipeline along the reservation border. Others have come for brief periods of time to work, share their support and return to their homes. During a recent visit, a delegation of Native American Presbyterian leaders and supporters had the opportunity to tour the camp and meet with many of the people who have chosen to bring their skills and talents to the table. A local company has provided approximately 80 portable toilets for the camp, but once the temperatures plummet and the units begin to freeze, the company will have to remove them. Groups have organized to build smaller, portable composting toilets, similar to what is sent around the world to communities impacted by natural disasters. Other companies provide dumpsters for trash, and freshly cut trees for firewood. A blacksmith stokes the fire to begin creating 200 tent stakes at the camp.

Lindsey McClure-Miller traveled to the camp with her husband to work with children, creating a space for them to share their stories. On the day of the delegation visit, many of the children were on a field trip. Several tents have been constructed to provide children a learning atmosphere. Angela Bibens is a lawyer of Santi Sioux heritage. She visited the camp earlier in the summer with her children and felt called to provide her services to those who need it. Now, she is the ground coordinator for the Water Protector Legal Collective. She adds they could always use more. She has been leading the efforts to help those arrested during the Sunday action. Medical teams have established a variety of support operations at the center of the camp. The medical team has placed an urgent call for wool clothing and zero-degree sleeping bags and other items to keep families from freezing this winter. As many as 200 people were reported injured in the action with law enforcement including one elder who suffered cardiac arrest on site. If people have skills to offer, they are offering it. The only thing asked is that those who choose to stay here must respect the spiritual nature of the camp. The Rev. Buddy Monahan, pastor of the Westminster Presbyterian Church in Odessa, Texas relates closely to the group, coming from a region that is big on oil and gas.
