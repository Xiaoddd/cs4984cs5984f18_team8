Know Your Rights: Free Speech, Protests & Demonstrations SHARE: KYR: Free Speech, Protests & Demonstrations (FULL) You have the right to speak out. Both the California Constitution and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protect your right to free expression. But there are many questions you face when you decide to organize and speak out. Your right to express your opinion is protected no matter what beliefs you hold. What matters is how you use that right. If you organize a protest that causes serious disruption, the government may be able to intervene. But with a few notable exceptions, nobody can restrict your rights simply because they don't like what you say. 2. FREE SPEECH IS FOR EVERYONE Young or old; anarchist or evangelical; pacifist or hawk; Mormon or Muslim; these rights apply to you. It doesn't matter whether you're a U.S. citizen, whether you're of voting age, or whether you speak English. Free-speech rights are for everybody. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. 3. WHEN, WHERE AND HOW Consider when, where and how you use your free-speech rights. If you organize a rally that causes violence or unnecessary disruption, your event may be disbanded. Every municipality has regulations and it's your responsibility to understand them. You must observe reasonable regulations on time, place, and manner when you exercise your rights to demonstrate and protest. About this guide This guide is designed to answer common questions. IT DOES: Outline your free-speech rights under the U.S. and California constitutions; Define the limits to your rights, including when speech may not be protected; Outline the steps you may take to keep your demonstration lawful; Give you the tools to recognize when your rights have been violated. IT DOES NOT: Advise on political strategy or on the nuts and bolts of how to organize a protest; Provide specifics on local ordinances or on state laws outside California; Replace legal counsel, should you be arrested, or believe your rights have been violated. The First Amendment protects your right to express your opinion, even if it's unpopular. You may criticize the President, the Congress, or the chief of police without fear of retaliation. Yes, for the most part. In the 1940s and '50s, suspected subversives or Communists were often charged with 'incitement to illegal activity' and convicted. Subsequent courts have interpreted the government's ability to prohibit speech as incitement more narrowly. The government can't stop you from talking generally about ideas or future events. You can't be held responsible for the way that counter-demonstrators or your own supporters react, as long as your words don't directly incite violence or law-breaking. It's the responsibility of the police to control the crowd. Whether you're marching on city hall, holding a candlelight vigil, or rallying outside the statehouse or a private business, you should check your local permit ordinance before you put on your marching shoes and pull out the megaphone. While regulations vary, here are some guidelines: The government can't prohibit marches on public sidewalks or streets, or rallies in most public parks or plazas. But it can often require a permit to regulate competing uses of the area and to ensure you respect reasonable time, place and manner restrictions. Most permit ordinances require that an application be submitted a few days in advance, so be sure to give officials sufficient notice. But advance notice periods should be days, not weeks, and there should be an exception to allow demonstrations in response to breaking news. Some activists have successfully challenged ordinances that fail to meet these standards. An ordinance is invalid if it's unreasonably or unnecessarily burdensome, if it prevents you from communicating your message, or if it's selectively enforced. This means that city officials may not impose additional burdens or costs on you because your message is controversial. A municipality must have precise and specific standards for denying a permit. Such an ordinance is unconstitutional and you can't be lawfully punished for violating it. If the government denies you a permit for expressive activity, it should tell you why it has done so. The government may impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of your event in order to reduce the amount of disruption it will cause. The government can't deny a permit just because past demonstrations by your group or others ended in civil disobedience or a disorderly brawl. Likewise, officials can't ask you to promise that protesters will obey the law before agreeing to issue your permit. Cities may charge for the actual costs of a demonstration, including the costs of processing permits, traffic control, certain narrow insurance requirements and some clean-up costs, but you may challenge excessive fees. Although the ACLU Foundation of Northern California cannot provide legal services to all callers, our civil liberties counselors, in consultation with our attorneys, can provide you with helpful information and referrals. The answer varies from city to city but one general principle applies: You may use amplification devices as long as your intent is to communicate your message, not to disturb the peace. The government may require permits for music, drums andloudspeakers, but ordinances should be narrowly tailored so that they prevent excessive noise without interfering with your free-speech rights. Check your local regulations. Yes. You have the right to approach willing passersby to hand them a leaflet, engage them in conversation, or ask them to sign a petition. But you may not obstruct or harass passersby after they have informed you that they are not interested. You shouldn't need a permit to leaflet on public sidewalks, in parks or public plazas, or even to go door-to-door talking to people. The First Amendment protects your right to ask people for money. However, this right is more tightly regulated than other forms of speech since it's considered more disruptive, particularly if you are asking for people to give you money on the spot. The courts have ruled, for example, that you don't have a right to solicit money inside an airport terminal. Also, you may need a permit to solicit funds. Check your local regulations to be sure, and remember: if an ordinance is unreasonably burdensome, or if it discriminates based on what you want to say, it may be unlawful. The First Amendment protects your right to use a table or news rack to display materials, subject to the usual time, place and manner rules. People who have a physical condition that substantially limits their ability to stand have the right to sit down. In either case, the police can prohibit you from blocking the sidewalk. Yes. In 1989, a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case invalidated the federal Flag Protection Act, along with flag desecration laws in 48 states. A flag desecration amendment to the Constitution, which was recently proposed and is likely to surface again, would permit Congress to pass a law barring the desecration of the U.S. flag, but no such law is currently on the books. From sit-ins to handcuffs: brushes with the law June 24, 1963. Demonstrators leave the First A.M.E. Church in downtown Los Angeles on their way to join a march of more than 1,000 people that culminated with a protest against school segregation in front of the Los Angeles Board of Educationbuilding. Civil disobedience is the active refusal to comply with certain laws as a form of protest. If you're planning to block an intersection or lie down in the middle of the street, make sure you know your rights before you begin. Take time to familiarize yourself with the practical consequences of civil disobedience, and with the steps you can take to minimize your chances of an extended stay in jail: Carry current identification. If you don't have ID, you may be taken to jail for a very minor offense instead of getting a ticket. Be aware of any consequences particular to you, such as: If you're an undocumented immigrant, the government may communicate your arrest to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which could affect your immigration status and even result in your deportation. California law prohibits most private employers from asking about arrests that did not result in a conviction. However, if you apply for a job in law enforcement, in another state, or with the federal government, you may be asked about arrests as well as convictions. If there is a warrant out for your arrest, you may be held in custody. Learn about civil disobedience at public California universities. It depends what you're arrested for. Misdemeanors The police will usually take you to the station to be fingerprinted and photographed, but they should release you if you have identification and you sign a promise to appear. One exception to this rule is if the officer has reason to think that you will resume breaking the law if you're released. Felonies The police may keep you in jail, but you have a right to bail immediately. If you don't bail out, within 48 hours a judge will review the police reports to see whether they show any criminal act. You must be seen in court within two business days to be informed as to whether you're being charged with a crime. Many people arrested at protests are never charged and are released without going to court. If you aren't ever charged, you haven't technically been arrested. The police department should issue you a certificate saying you were merely detained. If you're arrested in a federal facility or national park, or in some other situation where federal law applies, the process will be different. Even if you view your expressive activity as lawful, there's a chance that the police will regard it as over the line. Use it. You must give your name and address but don't say anything else. You have the right to legal counsel. Ask for an attorney. Don't discuss your case with the police without consulting your attorney. You have the right to make three free local phone calls immediately after being booked and no later than three hours after arrest. A parent with custody of a minor child may make two additional calls to arrange for childcare. If you remain in custody, a judge will review your case within 48 hours and you must be taken to court within two business days. The police are charged with safeguarding the public during a demonstration, but they can't use their powers to stop you from exercising your free-speech rights. The police may use reasonable force to break up a gathering or to detain or arrest a person who is violating the law. This gives the police some leeway while prohibiting force that any trained officer should know is excessive. Overly intrusive and unnecessary police spying and intelligence gathering activities may violate constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech or privacy if it is targeting groups or individuals engaged in First Amendment activity absent some connection to suspected criminal activity. Yes. The police may lawfully photograph or videotape events that are open to the public. However, California's right to privacy prohibits state and local officials from maintaining unnecessary information about the people of our state, so tapes that do not show any unlawful conduct should be destroyed. Sometimes. The restrictions must also allow protesters to have a reasonable opportunity to effectively communicate their message to their intended audience. Although the First Amendment gives you the right to decide where best to express yourself, your right to exercise your free-speech rights may hinge upon exactly where you choose to exercise those rights. If the answer is yes, you're holding your protest at a traditional public forum, where speech may only be restricted through reasonable time, place and manner restrictions. Designated Public Forums: Other spaces may receive the same protection as traditional forums because the government has opened them up to be used for speech activities. Once the government treats a public venue as available to some for non-commercial speech, it must be made available to all. Common examples of designated public forums include public auditoriums, the steps of city hall and plazas in front of public buildings. Non-Public Forums: In other venues, your rights are less clearly protected. At military bases, airport terminals, or the entrance to a post office, for example, reasonable prohibitions and restrictions may be upheld, as long as they are objectively applied and do not favor one side of an issue over the other. The government cannot discriminate based on viewpoint, even in a non-public forum. Under that test, expressive activity on government property may only be prohibited if the speech is incompatible with the normal activity of the venue. It means leafleting at a train station or a prison parking lot may be approved, while forcing nurses to weave around solicitors inside a hospital ward will not be. Relevance matters, too: the courts are more likely to give the nod to a location when it is an actual or symbolic target of your protest. You should be allowed to protest on the outdoor streets and plazas of public college and university campuses, subject to reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions. A public college cannot allow protests on one side of an issue but prohibit protests on the other side. But it may restrict speech activities that unduly interfere with classes. In California, your free-speech rights are fully protected in school, as well as outside. Schools may not stop you from discussing a controversial topic, writing for the school newspaper or criticizing school rules, but they can require you to obey reasonable, non-content-based regulations. Yes. However, the school may require you to observe reasonable time, place and manner regulations, such as holding your protest before or after class, and in a safe location that doesn't block entries and exits. Since the law requires you to attend school, you may be punished for skipping class. The school can't punish you for your views, however, and the consequences should be the same as if you skipped school for any other unauthorized reason. (San Diego). Yes. You may not physically obstruct or intentionally interfere with the staff members, patients, or building of a medical clinic offering reproductive health services. These statutes also apply to houses of worship. Check your local regulations to learn more. As a rule, the First Amendment doesn't give you the right to engage in free-speech activities on private property unless you own or lease the property, or the owner has given you permission to use the property for speech. Shopping malls are an exception to the rule. Yes. Most large malls have rules restricting free speech activities, although the California Supreme Court's recent decision in Fashion Valley Mall v. N.RB calls into question some of these restrictions. The Court invalidated a rule that prohibited a union from handing out leaflets at a San Diego mall calling for a boycott of a particular store, finding that the union's interest in getting its message across outweighed the economic interests of the mall. If you exercise your free-speech rights in violation of these rules, you may be excluded from the mall. Most large shopping malls have adopted a set of written regulations, which are available at the center's offices. The court decisions applying this standard have not been consistent, so the state of the law is unclear at this time. Many of the large shopping centers adopted rules that were complicated and burdensome to advocacy groups, but many of these rules were upheld in state court decisions. Such rules included: Requiring a permit in advance to give the center prior notice of the activity Limiting free speech activity to designated free speech areas (usually 2 or 3) Imposing strict limits on the number of participants (usually 2 or 3) Requiring advance approval of signs and literature Prohibiting all free speech activity during certain busy periods (e.g. Thanksgiving to Christmas) Prohibiting direct solicitation of any monetary donations A more recent federal court decision, relying on the California Supreme Court's ruling in the Fashion Valley case, rejected the reasoning of these state court decisions, thus calling into question many of these same rules. The court specifically rejected the following rules as either impermissible content discrimination or as not narrowly tailored. Prohibition on speech activities that identify or single out the mall or a mall tenant by name (e.g. When you know your rights you can better protect yourself, your family, and your community.
