During the long history of dam-building in the United States, hundreds of communities have been vacated, demolished, and flooded to allow for new waterways. Among the hardest hit have been Native American communities, which were forced to relocate from their sacred homelands with meager, if any, compensation. This is the dark part of American history that Amy Hassinger illuminates in After the Dam, a contemporary story about several generations of two families, the Bishops and the Claybornes, whose lives are changed by a dam. The Bishops are Ojibwe tribe members, whose ancestral land is flooded by the building of the dam. Rachel Clayborne, the great-granddaughter of the dam builder, is the protagonist of the novel. In one passage, he recounts the number of deaths and catastrophes associated with dam failures. The novel urges us to look away from profit and think instead of the people who live in these areas and of the land we all inhabit. His deployment unravels their relationship and Rachel moves on, earning an environmental studies degree and marrying an indigenous studies scholar. A pivotal, emotional scene unfolds the night before Joe leaves for the war. To him, this is defeat. That changed with the ongoing battle over the Dakota Access Pipeline, the proposed 1,172-mile pipeline that will transport approximately 470,000 barrels of crude oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois. It is still worth noting that the pipeline, and projects like it, threaten the sovereignty of tribal nations, which are federally recognized as independent from the United States. It also jeopardizes their ability to protect their sacred land and water. The Army Corps of Engineers used a general nationwide Permit 12 that does not address Native American sacred sites, climate, or environmental impact. As the Dakota Access Pipeline Project reminded us, the United States has a long, unsavory history of deceiving Native American people. Hassinger could have rehashed this well-known saga, but she digs below the surface, uncovering the often-complex circumstances and agreements that lead to exchanges of land. They are forced to return to the land as caretakers rather than owners, guests to the man who destroyed their community. The families are bound together by their shared history and the land they both live on. An even more telling scene takes place when Rachel is in her 20s. She visits the dam as a newlywed, with her husband Michael. She can immediately recognize how it has obliterated traditional ways of indigenous peoples and, while personally owning the wrong she believes her great-grandfather committed, Rachel suggests blowing it up. Throughout After the Dam, the exchanges between Michael and Rachel illustrate how the academic world, which encourages dispassion and objectivity, can cripple the emotions that drive us to action. Tribal members consider it sacred.
