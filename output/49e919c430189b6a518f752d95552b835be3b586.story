The campaign was launched on the occasion of Al Quds Day 2012 (on 17th August 2012), since then we have held actions every fortnight in support of Palestinian prisoners. As part of that campaign we target two companies which are complicit in Israel's crimes against Palestinian prisoners - G4S and HP. G4S partners with the Israeli occupation to secure many of its prisons and interrogation centres where Palestinians, including young children, are caged and tortured. G4S also provides service to Israel's checkpoints, the apartheid wall and Israel's illegal colonies. Hewlett Packard provides the IT backbone of the entire Israeli Military and provides the essential IT services and infrastructure that enable Israel's dungeons and torture dens to operate. It helps the Israeli occupation implement apartheid with its biometric access control system at checkpoints and its colour coded ID system. HP also supports Israel's illegal colonies. Inminds also runs other campaigns which are BDS related - cultural boycott campaign, boycott Israel dates campaign, boycott Israeli blood diamonds campaign, and a general consumer boycott campaign. We stand united against injustice. Raising awareness and funds for the victims of tyranny in the Middle East.
