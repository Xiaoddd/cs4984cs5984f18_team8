Nice. Beautiful shirt by juliette l. on Mar 18, 2018 The print is amazing and the colour sooo vibrant. The tshirt itself fit well (except some minor problems around the chest).

Fit is perfect too. The fabric on the front is a thin type fabric, not used to it, and the back is soft. The thin fabric is kinda weird but it makes the Print look amazing. The artwork stands out so well on it. I throw a open weave sweater on top and a unique outfit everyday. I love the fit. Loose but not baggy. Very unique.
