Green Party candidate Jill Stein is set to hold a rally along with her supporters in front of the Trump Tower in New York on Monday. Stein, who has initiated the process of vote recounts in the states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania following the 2016 presidential election, made the announcement on Saturday. GOP nominee Donald Trump won presidency on November 8 by flipping the three traditionally blue states, triggering calls for a recount pursued not by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton but by Stein. Trump has vowed to block the efforts by having his lawyer file lawsuits against the move. On her website, Stein is asking Americans for donations to pay for the cost of recount in the states. A designated observer (R) watches as presidential ballots are recounted in Dane County on December 1, 2016 in Madison, Wisconsin. Despite being one of the most unpopular Democrats to run for president, Hillary Clinton managed to garner over two million votes more than his opponent across the country. All rights reserved.
