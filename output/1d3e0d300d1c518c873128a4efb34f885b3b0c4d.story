Copy may not be in its final form. The growing resistance movement is the largest gathering of Native Americans in decades. Darcy also indicated the government will undertake an environmental impact statement for this section of the pipeline, a lengthy process that takes months, if not years. We, as a people, have a right to stand up for this. And so, we expressed those feelings from the very beginning. We expressed those feelings with the company. We expressed those feelings with the senators of the state, the congressmen of the state. You know, everybody knew that Standing Rock was opposed to this pipeline because of the threats that it has on our people. And we had a lot of support. So when this decision came down by the Corps of Engineers, it feels like, finally, for the first time in history, over centuries, somebody is listening to us. And in order to listen to us, they have to make the right decision. Something like this has never rolled in our favor ever. We were peaceful and prayerful, and we tried to do the best that we can to build awareness for everyone. And I want to thank you, Amy, for all the work that you have done, as well, to build awareness. And so, this is just another example of corporate world forcing its hand on a people and on the government. And this has to stop. You know, we know, within our treaty boundaries, what sites are sacred and what is meaningful, what places are sacred to us. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: The difference between an environmental impact statement and an environmental assessment is environmental assessment only looks at the least impactful route for the environment, but with the EIS, environmental impact statement, you take into consideration people. And because we are here, we have every right to oppose this pipeline, because we feel that this pipeline will threaten not only our water, but our heritage, our culture, our environment. You did it to us all too long, for 200 years, and for the interests of energy independence, economic development, national security, we paid for that. We continue to pay for it. And somebody is listening, finally. AMY GOODMAN: Last week, President-elect Donald Trump expressed his support for the completion of the Dakota Access pipeline. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: You know, I see it as an opportunity for indigenous peoples, for tribes, to start a relationship with the president-elect and help him understand what is important to the first occupants of this nation and what we have paid for. And so, we have a huge opportunity in front of us to help president-elect understand our issues. And I look forward to a conversation, and just like I had with Kelcy Warren. I have nothing personal against the senators and the congressmen of this state of North Dakota or the government. And there are some things that are just precious and important to us, and everybody has to understand that. We will be the first ones to pay for it. They have swelled to thousands. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: The pipeline is not going to move ahead. The campers that are there can now enjoy the winter with their families at home. You know, they had a purpose, and that purpose is served. That was to help us build awareness and show the support and stand with us. And every day is a good day. So, they can go home. Ten million dollars, we understand, has been spent, at least, on police activities. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: Yeah. What we have to do is we have to try to rebuild relationships that were harmed. You have to understand that I live here in this community. But the path they chose harmed relationships. So we have to try to re-establish and rebuild those relationships. AMY GOODMAN: Well, Chairman Archambault, I want to thank you very much for joining us, joining us from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. We thank you for this update. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: They have to pray. They have to continue to pray. And they have to start taking the lessons that were given at this camp. They can go home and enjoy this winter, enjoy the holidays, if they celebrate them, with their families. And I understand their mistrust for the government and for this company, because, from the beginning, nothing was held to. AMY GOODMAN: Well, I want to thank you again, Chairman Dave Archambault, chair of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, speaking to us from Standing Rock in North Dakota. He comes from Arizona, Navajo, his grandfather a Navajo code talker. Stay with us.
