A special commissioner and prosecutor will be appointed to oversee a hearing, which has not yet been scheduled. Schwartzenberger got the news while he was in Cannon Ball assisting law enforcement at the site of the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. The Village Business Institute, a Fargo-based consulting firm hired to look into complaints against Schwartzenberger and Lt.
