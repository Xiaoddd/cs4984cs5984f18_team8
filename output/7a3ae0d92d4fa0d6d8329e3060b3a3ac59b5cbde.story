noted a recent decline in earthquakes in major coverage. But that number jumped to 2,500 in 2014 and soared to 4,000 a year later. The article concedes the earthquake numbers have dropped recently, but the reason for the drop is still debatable. According to the article: There has recently been a decrease in wastewater being injected deep underground, either because of regulatory actions or because oil and gas extraction has declined due to falling petroleum prices. That might be a reason for the decrease in the number of Oklahoma earthquakes last year, to 2,500, So the state has gone from virtually no earthquakes to 4,000 in one year and is now back at around 2,500. These earthquakes have caused damage to personal property such as homes and other structures. In the fracking process, a toxic slew of saltwater and chemicals is injected by high pressure underground to create fissures in rock formations. These fissures release oil and gas. The wastewater from the operations is then injected underground into what are called injection wells or disposal wells. The Oklahoma Corporation Commission, with no help from former Oklahoma Attorney General and now U.S. Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, has shut down some wells, and limited wastewater volume amounts in other wells over the last couple of years or so. What we also know is that world may have reached peak oil demand at this point because of the growth of renewable energy sources and fuel efficiency. Those wind turbines everyone sees driving south down I-35 in Oklahoma are only going to multiply in years to come. Solar energy, which accounts for a growing amount of our energy supply, will also increase in geometric proportions. What this means is that Oklahoma is tied to a dying industry, which gets major tax breaks, thus decreasing state revenues that go to fund education while damaging our personal property. The powerful oil and gas lobby here makes it difficult for regulators to do anything significant. Will a big earthquake of a magnitude of 6.0 or higher, which geologists say could happen, strike in a highly populated area, causing massive damage and injuries, even death. We know how to solve this. Simply place a major reduction leading to a complete moratorium on wastewater injection wells.
