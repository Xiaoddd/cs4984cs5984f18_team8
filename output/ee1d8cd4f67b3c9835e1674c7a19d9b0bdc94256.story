Share story By Lynda V. Mapes Seattle Times environment reporter While President Trump issued an executive order Tuesday intended to advance construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, restarting the stalled project may not be simple. Jan Hasselman, attorney for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota, said Tuesday the tribe would push back with a lawsuit defending the decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to undertake a full environmental-impact review that includes looking at alternative routes for the 1,100-mile oil pipeline through four states. The tribe has opposed the pipeline out of concern a spill could pollute drinking water in the Missouri River and threaten Native American cultural sites. Roy Murphy, of the Muckleshoot tribe, on why he is protesting with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe against the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. About the DAPL protest The Trump administration has advanced the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipeline projects. And here's what we're reading related to the controversy. March 28: What the completed Dakota Access pipeline means for key players. Feb. 22: Preparing to leave, Standing Rock protesters ceremonially burn camp. Feb. 1: Hundreds rally as the Seattle City Council considers divesting from Wells Fargo because of its role as a Dakota Access Pipeline lender. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says it will push back. The Corps withheld action on the easement late last year and instead called for an environmental review that could take more than a year. The pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners, needs an easement from the Corps to complete the final crossing under the river. If the easement is granted, construction on the crossing could begin and continue unless a court took action to stop it. The necessary work takes about two weeks, working 24 hours shifts. Crews are already in hotels waiting to get to work, and all equipment is on site to begin the job, a source close to the project said. The drill pad for the crossing is secured behind multiple barriers, and police are promising a stiff resistance to interference. The tribes called for demonstrators to leave last week out of concern for their safety because of predicted seasonal flooding of the river near the area of the camps. The fight against the pipeline became an international cause, drawing opponents to the area from around the nation and world, including many members of Washington state tribes with experience battling fossil-fuel projects in the Pacific Northwest. The company could not immediately be reached for comment. A court could stop the flow of oil in a finished project, he noted. Archambault said in a phone interview Tuesday the tribe is considering all its options. View Comments No personal attacks or insults, no hate speech, no profanity.
