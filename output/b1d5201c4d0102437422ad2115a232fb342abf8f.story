Dakota Access Pipeline protesters are seen at the Oceti Sakowin campground near the town of Cannon Ball, North Dakota, U.S. November 19, 2016 in an aerial photo provided by the Morton County Sheriff's Department. Native American activists and environmentalists say the line threatens water resources and sacred tribal lands. A joint statement from several activist groups said protesters Sunday were trying to remove burned vehicles blocking Backwater Bridge in order to restore access to the nearby Standing Rock Sioux encampments so emergency services and local traffic can move freely.

Law enforcement also fired rubber bullets and sprayed protesters with water in temperatures that reached as low as 18 Fahrenheit (minus 8 Celsius) overnight. The main company behind the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners LP (ETP.N), is building the line to bring crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois en route to the Gulf Coast. Officials did not address the protests. About 100 to 200 protesters remained after midnight. Police said protesters had hurled rocks and burning logs, striking one officer. Dave Archambault, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, said law enforcement is escalating the violence. The latest confrontation began Sunday evening, after protesters attempted to remove a truck that had been on the bridge since Oct. 27, police said. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had also asked Morton County law enforcement to prevent protesters from trespassing on federal land. Supporters of the pipeline said the project offers the most direct route for taking shale oil from North Dakota to Gulf Coast refineries and would be safer than road or rail transportation. The Army Corps of Engineers last week said they will need more consultations with Native American tribes, even though the Corps said they had followed all legal requirements for permitting. President-elect Donald Trump has not commented specifically on Dakota Access, but he has in the past been supportive of pipeline development. Should a decision be delayed to his term, the pipeline could be approved.
