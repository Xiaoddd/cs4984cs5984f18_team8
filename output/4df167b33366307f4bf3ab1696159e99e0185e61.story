Fallis was in court for a hearing on charges related to protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Six officers who participated in some aspect of Fallis' arrest on Oct. 27, 2016, along State Highway 1806 testified during the all-day hearing Friday. Their testimony largely related to the circumstances of her arrest. Other officers testified about where they were when they heard the three gunshots Fallis is alleged to have fired from under her as they tried to cuff her. The courtroom also watched three videos from the time of Fallis' arrest that show when Schmit tackled her to initiate her arrest. As the 5 o'clock hour approached in court, Fallis' team still had one officer to complete questioning, while two other witnesses had yet to testify, including a man who traveled from South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation. After a brief awkwardness as to how to proceed, attorneys and District of North Dakota Chief Judge Daniel Hovland then agreed to reconvene at 8:30 a.m. Monday. Fallis was on court-ordered leave from a Fargo halfway house to attend Friday's hearing. In an unusual agreement, a man who lives in a West Fargo motel volunteered to return her to Fargo Monday afternoon. Prior to testimony, defense attorneys addressed issues of discovery related to potential recordings the prosecution has been unable to produce. Defense attorney Bruce Ellison also asked about outstanding discovery items, such as photos taken in October 2016, requested in January and received Thursday. Hovland said both sides will work to resolve discovery issues. Fallis' jury trial is set to begin Jan. 29 in Fargo. She is charged with civil disorder, discharging a firearm in relation to a felony crime of violence and possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon.
