The camp at Oceti Sakowin camp in Cannon Ball, North Dakota. In its consultations with the Standing Rock Sioux about the pipeline crossing underneath Lake Oahe within a half mile of the reservation, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers purposefully withheld key studies that could have helped the tribe evaluate the risks. One report modeled damage from potential spills; another weighed the likelihood of spills; a third compared alternative routes and discussed the environmental justice concerns raised by the project. The contents of these documents, which have still not been released to the public, are unknown. Kristen Carpenter, Oneida Indian Nation visiting professor of law at Harvard Law School, was amazed to learn that the government had denied these documents to the tribe. Carpenter believes the Corps should have done a more thorough analysis and consulted more fully with the tribe from the beginning. But the Army maintains it both was and is on firm legal footing. Her memo directs the Corps to release those documents that it had withheld from the tribe. In early December, the thousands of protesters camped at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation celebrated what appeared to be a massive victory. But the fight is far from over. The 1,172-mile pipeline, designed to carry Bakken crude oil to refineries in Illinois and beyond, would pass within half a mile of the reservation and underneath Lake Oahe, which the tribe relies on for drinking water and treaty fishing and hunting rights. An earlier pipeline route that would have crossed the Missouri River 10 miles north of Bismarck was rejected for a variety of reasons, including potential risk to the water supply for that larger, whiter, more affluent community. But later that day, a fierce winter storm hit, and Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II urged protesters to leave. Thousands did. But President-elect Donald Trump supports the pipeline, in which he held a financial interest until recently. After the tribe asked for a preliminary injunction to stall construction, a federal judge in September ruled that the Corps had met its obligation to consult with it, saying that tribal representatives repeatedly failed to attend meetings. In response to protests and political pressure, however, the Department of the Army, the Justice Department and the Department of the Interior stepped in to block the project while the Corps reconsidered. That led up to the Corps deciding that a full environmental impact statement is necessary. Experts say it will be difficult for the Trump administration to evade this time-consuming requirement, which entails extensive study and significant input from the tribe and the public. Dakota Access LLC, the pipeline company, asked a judge to intervene, claiming that an easement is unnecessary because the government already gave permission for the pipeline to cross the lake. Grijalva visited Standing Rock in September and says he was impressed: The protesters include representatives of many tribes and environmental and civil rights activists from around the country and abroad, strongly united and prepared for the attacks on the environment, poor communities and tribes that they expect to see once Trump takes office. Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections: For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S., particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century. The comments of our readers are the most vibrant, best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News. Accordingly, we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services. It is, however, important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in. Adapt and overcome. The incoming administration has not thought through the consequences of their ridiculous intended policies. One will be further loss of our drinkable water which will hang around their necks for whatever time is left to the planet. And remember that the Podesta emails showed us that Citigroup picked the Obama Administration. To these psychopaths, clean fresh water openly available to the public is unwanted competition. If the price of oil goes up, that's a bummer. If the price of water goes too high, we die. The pipeline would stop right there; the company would never sign. Hell, if we charged the oil industry for all the money they cost us, all pipelines would go dry. The next chapter in the fight for indigenous rights will take place in the spring. Trump, the oil man, will no doubt come down on the side of petroleum and those who profit from it. Yes, I get that it's dangerous, but his insistence that the temporary halt was a victory and everyone should leave didn't ring well. The Dixie-crats of the day portrayed Lincoln as an Ape with glee and lived to regret their Treasonous Folly. Nor would a President Clinton the Second say that the Water Protectors needed to stop being so violent, and honor the pipeline layers who just wanted to get back to work. Oh wait. Both of those things happened. We have common enemies here. And those enemies are not named Obama, Clinton OR Trump. Those enemies put people like Obama, Clinton and Trump into office to carry out their will. However, it is incumbent upon us to see the distinctions between Obama (and Clinton), under whom the Army Corps of Engineers have ACTUALLY STOPPED the construction of the pipeline, albeit temporarily (and giving us more time to organize the fight, as Grijalva says), and the Trump contingent of the oligarchy who will have no consideration for tribal or environmental rights WHATSOEVER and will be foaming at the mouth to crush the resistence and renew pipeline construction ASAP. Every successful revolution occurred when significant numbers of the enforcers refused to follow orders to crush dissenters. The veterans could have forced the enforcers to make that decision. When Obama halted the project temporarily, he prevented that confrontation. It long has been, but is now such as never before. They are all about deception. It's a deflection, and nothing but a transparent ploy, part of the lying, manipulative, inflexible corporate-fasci st agenda putting on a show of being the opposite. Don't be fooled (anymore). Everything is a tightly-choreog raphed show to the corporate-fasci sts working to enslave us increasingly. The elitists couldn't care less about us, The People. We are all expendable to them. They just want to make as much profit off us in the process, from cradle to grave. You're dealing with psychotics, sociopaths and psychopaths who run the globalist corporate-fasci st show, so you can't in reality expect any true or real justice from them. It's not in their DNA. As the government's treatment of the water-protector s doing nothing but non-violently exercising their rights and duties shows, the authoritarian, more and more totalitarian, powers-that-be don't care how many people they harm along the way. And while everyone's watching the show, Saudi Arabia announced they were going to stop over-producing oil and OPEC has agreed to cut supplies, ensuring that prices will rise. And the Federal Reserve just raised interest rates for the first time in years, and say they plan to hike the rates 3 more times in 2017. Inflation to go along with the cuts in social services.
