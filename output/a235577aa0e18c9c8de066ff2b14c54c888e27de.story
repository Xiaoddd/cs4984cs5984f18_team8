Twitter thinks so. One of the climbers, identified by Minneapolis police as Karl Mayo, even answered his cellphone to conduct an interview with the Pioneer Press. One of two protesters who hung a banner demanding that U.S. Bank divest from the North Dakota Access Pipe Line descends, Spider Man style down his rope the second quarter at U.S. Bank Stadium on Sunday, Jan 1, 2017. He talked while hanging several hundred feet in the air wearing his Brett Favre No. 4 Vikings home jersey. Mayo declined to answer logistical questions about pulling off the stunt in front of 66,808 football fans. The meaningless game between two NFC North Division also-rans was not interrupted but the spectacle went viral on social media and caused a stir in the stadium. Carolyn Feldman, 27, identified by police as also being involved in the incident, was arrested and booked into the jail on suspicion of obstructing the legal process, a misdemeanor. About six rows of seats in Section 102 were evacuated below the protesters while dozens of police officers, crisis negotiators, firefighters and stadium security officers swarmed the base of the truss to strategize how to get the protesters down safely. During the second half, as fans used their smartphones to take pictures and video of the climbers, several rescue workers climbed the truss and assembled on a catwalk over the pair. A Vikings source said law enforcement decided not to engage with the climbers until after the game to avoid a televised confrontation. They were handcuffed without incident as lingering fans cheered and heckled them. Another team source said the protesters might have entered the stadium through separate gates and that one or both of them smuggled the bungee cord and canvas banner under their coats and avoided a pat down after getting through metal detectors. No one was injured during the protest, police said, including the protesters, who were examined by medical personnel on site before being booked into jail. It was not immediately clear how Mayo and Holiday smuggled the large banner and climbing equipment into U.S. Bank Stadium, which limits tote bags to 12-by-6-by-12 inches of clear plastic for fans entering the gates. SMG issued a statement during the protest saying the climbers appeared to scale a guard rail surrounding the truss. Roberson provided a cellphone for Mayo, who followed instructions by the Pioneer Press to wave his left hand before conducting the interview during second quarter. Mayo refused to answer questions about how he smuggled in the banner and climbing equipment, whether he had help from inside the stadium, his climbing expertise or how dangerous the protest was. More than two hours after the game ended, the banner still hung from the truss.
