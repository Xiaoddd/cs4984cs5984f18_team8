In rare instances, land could even sink or collapse. The oddest unintended consequences tend to bubble up in this pockmarked slice of West Texas, where wildcatters started poking holes in the ground nearly a century ago. But those are hardly the only holes that petroleum companies have bored into the Texas landscape. As far back as 1990, Texas touted more than 1.5 million oil and gas-related holes, including hundreds of thousands of test wells, service wells and those that came up dry. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. When most wells end their service, no big deal. Operators plug them, limiting pollution threats, and move on. Occasionally, the wells yield pollution you can see: oil, brackish water or other smelly substances leaking onto the land. But the biggest threats lie thousands of feet underground: the possible, but tough-to-detect migration of oil and other toxic minerals into aquifers or water supplies. Not every abandoned well threatens groundwater. And as boom-and-bust cycles continue across Texas drilling fields, walling off water sources from potential contamination will only get harder. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Its waters have tested more than three times saltier than averages in the Gulf of Mexico, with sulfur and salt crystals coating the surrounding vegetation. Edwards asks sarcastically as a reporter takes a whiff of the stench. The source of the putrid smell: a well that has gushed for more than a decade. Rafael Aguilera for The Texas Tribune Oil wells are bored through multiple layers of rock and other geology, aiming for below where groundwater pools. The idea is to tap the oil or gas deposits and pump them to the surface without letting any seep into other layers. Oil and gas comes up through metal piping that helps keep it from mixing with water resources. Cementing around that piping adds more layers of protection. At Boehmer Lake, brackish San Andres aquifer water is shooting through a corroded wellhead, mixing with salt and other minerals on the way out. Even worse, Van Deventer says, the area is sinking as water eats away at underground salts. Ranchers then repurposed some of these wells for irrigation. But they walked away, leaving the wells subject to cracks, corrosion and other natural damage. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. The groundwater district has found about a dozen such unplugged wells, including several that are flowing. Cash-strapped itself, the district has asked the Texas Railroad Commission to clean them up. It appears no state agency has such a role. Looking for trouble Groundwater officials like Edwards and his boss, Paul Weatherby, spend plenty of time searching for abandoned wells. Often by truck, once in a while by plane, and sometimes just using Google maps, they scour Pecos County for drilling leftovers that could pollute water. They try to gather as much information as they can about each well. In June 2016, a thick black substance paints the land around an abandoned well that the Middle Pecos Groundwater Conservation District has asked the Texas Railroad Commission to plug. Rafael Aguilera for The Texas Tribune The groundwater officials send whatever they can glean to the Railroad Commission. In those cases, the commission, tapping fees it collects from industry, might hire a contractor to plug a well. The hit-and-miss process can be frustrating, even when it results in a state-funded cleanup. A 2011 study prepared for the Oklahoma-based Groundwater Protection Council cited 30 times that abandoned drilling sites polluted Texas groundwater from 1993 to 2008. The Railroad Commission told The Texas Tribune that it has not linked any groundwater contamination cases to abandoned wells since 2009. But experts say pollution can fester where no one has looked. Mother Nature also exacts a toll. Fighting the backlog Texas officials paid little attention to the environmental dangers of abandoned oil wells throughout much of state history. The agency evaluates each well based on a litany of risk factors, and it tries to plug the riskiest wells first. Totals plunged from nearly 18,000 to 7,000 from 2002 to 2010. But the trend has since reversed amid a drilling downturn that followed a years-long bonanza. (In September, the Railroad Commission narrowed its definition of such wells, specifying that all must have also violated another rule for inactive wells. But some experts foresee even more abandoned wells on the horizon. During the boom, these contractors helped companies drill more wells. (Well operators plug the vast majority of inactive wells on their own. And some wells could eventually escape the list if their owners simply renew their lapsed permits.
