The project has aroused strong opposition, particularly in densely developed areas of Delaware and Chester Counties, where Sunoco is building the second of three adjacent pipelines. Sunoco spokesman Jeff Shields said the company received the suspension order Wednesday morning and intended to comply with the conditions. The company has encountered problems when it has used horizontal drilling techniques to install the pipeline underground to avoid digging a trench at the surface. The project's opponents, who have complained directly to Gov. Wolf, on Wednesday called for the state to cancel construction rather than suspend work. State Sen. Andy Dinniman (D., Chester), who has called for stricter regulatory oversight of pipeline projects, said the state's action was overdue and insufficient. The suspension will remain in place until Sunoco demonstrates compliance with the permits, Wolf's spokesman said Wednesday in a statement. The permit suspension is the latest setback in the Mariner East 2 pipeline, which was initially aimed to begin operations in early 2017. ETP, the parent company, announced in November that it was pushing back completion to the second quarter of 2018, blaming regulatory delays. The Mariner East 2 pipeline is the second of three pipelines designed to carry gas liquids from the shale region of Western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia to a terminal that Sunoco has built on the site of its former Marcus Hook refinery. Most of the material is being loaded on ships and exported to European petrochemical manufacturers. Sunoco also has commitments to add a third, 16-inch-diameter pipeline to the route as soon as the ME2 is completed. All together, the pipelines could carry up to 675,000 barrels a day to Marcus Hook.
