The spill in Iowa leaked an estimated 138,600 gallons of diesel fuel onto private agricultural land, but is expected to cause road closures for at least two days. The leak occurred near a small creek located on the agricultural land, but Iowa officials say there is no evidence the oil has contaminated surface or groundwater yet. Trump uses executive action to revive Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines The biggest victories of the environmental movement under Obama are now in jeopardy. The leak came from a 12-inch pipeline system operated by Magellan Midstream Partners L.P. The Iowa DNR is investigating the situation to determine whether Magellan violated any Iowa Administrative Codes which might have contributed to the leak. Advertisement In Canada, a pipeline carrying oil leaked some 52,000 gallons onto First Nations land in the Saskatchewan province late last week and into early this week. The break occurred late last Friday, according to the Saskatchewan provincial government, and cleanup efforts had recovered about 45,000 gallons of that oil by Monday. As of Monday, the spill had been contained. The spills are a stark reminder of the environmental dangers of pipeline projects, even as Trump moves full speed ahead with attempts to revive stalled projects like Keystone and Dakota Access. Both projects faced huge backlash from environmentalists and landowners along the proposed routes, who worried that the pipelines would spill and cause environmental damages. Pipeline spills, while rare, do occur, and tend to be larger in scale and impact than spills from oil trains. Despite opposition from landowners, the North Dakota House just passed a bill that would not require companies to report pipeline spills smaller than 420 gallons. The State Department spent years studying the environmental and economic impact of the Keystone Pipeline under the Obama administration, but Trump reportedly did not ask for their expertise on the matter before issuing his memorandum.
