Authorities have started to close in on the remaining camp protesters of the Dakota Access Pipeline, after some occupiers had refused to leave despite an evacuation order set by state and federal authorities. As of late Wednesday, 10 people were arrested outside of the main protest camp, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum said during an evening press conference. The arrests occurred on the road at the main entrance to Oceti Sakowin protest camp, which is situated at the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation near Cannonball, North Dakota. Those arrested were willingly outside of the barrier put up by protesters to block police from going inside the dwelling area, according to officials. Police have yet to enter the inside of the camp where between 25 and 50 protesters remain, the governor said, who indicated that anyone voluntarily leaving overnight into Thursday would not face charges. Camp residents had been given until 2 p.m. local time Wednesday to evacuate the site. Two people in the camp were injured as a result of fires, one person with severe burns who had to be airlifted to Minneapolis. Police will attempt camp cleanup efforts again at 9 a.m. local time. Gov. Burgum has set up a travel assistance center that will offer each protester water, snacks, a food voucher, a personal hygiene kit, a health and wellness assessment, hotel lodging for one night, a taxi voucher to the bus terminal, and bus fare for a return trip home. Transportation will be provided from Oceti Sakowin camp to the travel assistance center in Bismarck. Last week, Burgum signed an emergency evacuation order for the Oceti Sakowin camp that reaffirmed a Feb. 22 deadline set by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe began coordinating a cleanup in late January, but state officials said it wasn't happening fast enough. The Cannonball River is a tributary of the Missouri River. Dakota pipeline builder says oil could flow in as few as two weeks Dakota Access Pipeline protesters meet with authorities over emergency evacuation order Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe files 1st legal challenge over Dakota Access Pipeline easement Native American solar energy visionary equips Standing Rock protesters with green technology How it all began The 1,172-mile pipeline is nearly finished except for a 1.25-mile segment, part of which will run under Lake Oahe, a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota just upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation. Construction of this final phase has been the focus of a contentious legal battle and massive protests in recent months. While the Army Corps says this area is federally owned land, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe cites an 1851 treaty that it says designates the land for Native American tribes. The tribe, which claims its members were never meaningfully consulted before construction began, sued in July to block the four-state crude oil pipeline. That lawsuit is pending, and the Army Corps and the company behind the pipeline argued in court papers that they followed a standard review process. The protests have drawn thousands of Native Americans, environmental activists and their allies to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation. She also encouraged the Corps to share company documents containing risk analyses and spill models that had not been made available to the tribes during the initial environmental review. She is no longer in the position after the change in administrations. The move to deny the easement was hailed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other pipeline opponents as a major victory. But on his second weekday in office, President Trump signed a memorandum aimed at advancing the Dakota Access Pipeline, as well as one directed at the Keystone XL Pipeline. Speer said the decision was made based on a sufficient amount of available information. The Army Corps on Feb. 8 granted an easement to the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline, allowing it to install the final segment of the pipeline. The court on Feb. 13 denied that motion seeking a temporary restraining order. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe also filed a separate motion seeking a preliminary injunction directing the Army Corps to withdraw the easement issued to the pipeline company. This court cannot wait until the harm begins to issue equitable relief. A further hearing on the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's motion for a preliminary injunction against the pipeline is set for Feb. 27 in Washington, D.C. The Dakota Access pipeline will connect oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Patoka, Illinois. The court filing was required as part of the ongoing legal battle that is challenging the construction at the site by Lake Oahe.
