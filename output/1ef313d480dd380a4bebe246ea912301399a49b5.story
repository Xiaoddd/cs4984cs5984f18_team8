HIT & RUN BLOG Protester Trash and Debris Threaten Water Contamination at Dakota Access Pipeline Clean-up efforts are in a race to beat the coming floods. It's the people protesting it. After the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a statement demanding that the Oceti Sakowin Camp be closed by February 22 over concerns of flooding, many protesters packed up and departed. Left behind was their trash and waste, NBC News reported. Oceti Sakowin Camp sits in a lowland area where the Missouri and Cannonball Rivers converge, making it a prime location for flooding. The record winter snowfall heightens the chances as spring arrives. And with flooding comes the risk of water contamination as trash and human waste could be swept into the nearby rivers. Federal and local officials estimate there's enough trash and human waste to fill 2,500 pick-up trucks, according to ABC News. Efforts to clean up the area are underway, but time is of the essence as the surrounding snow begins to melt. Standing Rock Environmental Protection Agency and Dakota Sanitation are currently working to remove the mountains of trash that have accumulated. Everything from tents to cars have been left behind after protesters received the evacuation notices. Around 300 to 400 people are reportedly still at the campsite, with some aiding in the clean-up effort. Despite the help, the job is only half-finished, according to the Washington Times. One of the main arguments against constructing the Dakota Access Pipeline in the first place was that it was an environmental risk, since a rupture in the line could contaminate potable water in the area. Now it seems the protesters themselves may end up polluting the rivers, if their debris can't be cleared out in time. She was Reason's Spring 2017 Burton C. Gray Memorial Intern.

You can't make this shit up. At this point in time I'd be surprised if the environmental protesters DIDN'T trash the environment in the process of protesting. Hydroelectric dams can be good depending on how they are employed. They have pros and cons. No clue on the ethanol but ethanol is stupid because of soil erosion and causes food and land to skyrocket. There is no safe collection system set up and in many use cases they are not smart and die early. Also not educating people on how and where they should be use was stupid. every month and I do. It's possible that I could measure what I use in water and compare it to what they charge me. Electricity, I would have to spend more money that it is worth in devices to measure my usage. It is already a rate; namely, 1 watt is equal to 1 joule per second. SomeGuy almost certainly means that his kitchen is using 600 watts. If it was drawing 600 watts per hour, then after a few months, he would be consuming more power than the rest of his neighbors combined. In a decade or so, he'd be exhausting an entire power plant just for his kitchen. The power company confuses things because they use kilowatt-hours to bill you; 1 killowatt-hour is 1000 watts times 1 hour. But you know the answer: the taxpayers. They're on land controlled by the US Army Corps of Engineers. They don't have the proper permits, but they weren't told to leave either. This is almost exactly where my mind went. We really need Ron Bailey to explain the tragedy of the commons to us. Then delineate how we either need to appoint an agency in charge of cleaning up these protests, privatize the cleanup, or ignore the problem altogether. And that the latter two options are non-viable on their face. I don't understand why they weren't fined out of their ass for this. And it's not like the people who caused this are unknown. Lindsay searched for a stock image of a giant pile of garbage and all that came up was pictures of Winston's mom. It's the people protesting it. ...

After the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a statement demanding that the Oceti Sakowin Camp be closed by February 22 over concerns of flooding, many protesters packed up and departed. Left behind was their trash and waste, NBC News reported. Re-enactment. How about at every turn. One day you will realize how short your ideology is when it comes time to stand up for issues that really affect people and human progress. It is egregious mendacity. Here they proved it. Wanting them jailed for protesting would be 2. That same principle gives us the right to hold and express the view that said views are stupid. Which would have been just dandy had they not trashed the fucking place. Trashing the place tending to diminish whatever moral standing you may have previously had. So IOW, I'll see your double standard, and raise you one. Color me shocked. Even the Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault II expressed disgust at the way protesters trashed the environment. When the people you're protesting on the SUPPOSED behalf of start telling you off, that's a pretty good time to come back to reality and acknowledge that you fucked up. There was a place down there where eagles, over 100 eagles would come and land. Now, it's occupied by people. -Archambault It's the Sioux who are upset with you people. It's not so much the authorities but the VERY PEOPLE YOU PRETEND TO BE HELPING. Well, yeah. You can only put two, maybe three, bodies in the cab of a pickup truck, but a dumpster can hold like a half-dozen. More if they're 'just fetuses'. 250 dump truck loads if I recall correctly. Border is hundreds of miles away. I've been hearing sewage concerns since September. I wonder why we're not hearing that sort of thing now, especially since the magnitude of contamination is so much higher.
