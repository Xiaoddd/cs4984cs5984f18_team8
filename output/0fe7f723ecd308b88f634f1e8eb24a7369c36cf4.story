While in Keokuk, I stayed at what was the Mississippi Stand action camp for several days. This reflection touches on some of most poignant moments for me. Of those who plead not guilty, all but one requested jury trials. When I heard that, I wished I would have pleaded not guilty. There were two people I watched go in front of the judge that day who were not connected to the protest. For the tactic of flooding the court system with jury trials to work most effectively, it would have been advantageous for us to discuss the option and its potential results and consequences beforehand as a group, so that some of the people who pleaded guilty might have instead pleaded not guilty and requested a jury trial. The judge seemed to be caught off guard and seemed to really consider the request. I wonder what would have happened if this question were asked by the first person from our group who stood in front of the judge. Perhaps we could have saved ourselves some money. I was excited to see the ways in which this second NVDA workshop I attended was different. The speaker stated that the Mississippi Stand action camp had specifically developed for people interested in nonviolent forms of action and that actions planned for the camp would be nonviolent and would not include sabotage. However, the speaker encouraged, too, that people recognize a common enemy and support that various groups are attacking in various ways. Someone mentioned an instance where hundreds of people gave the same false name to authorities after being arrested; people told stories of tree-sits, barricades, sit-ins, occupations, lock-downs, mass marches and other forms of direct action. Once arrested, a person had to sit down. If a cop stayed with the arrested person, three people had to tag that person for an un-arrest. Meanwhile, people ran in various patterns looking for opportunities to make a move toward the pole or unarrest people. I was really excited, several days later, to find a video in which three people used similar tactics to un-arrest a fellow protester. I was happy to be in a place with people experimenting with non-hierarchical structures. I liked that everyone could choose how they wanted to participate day-by-day or moment-by-moment. I enjoyed the slow pace of cooking by fire for hours before a meal while hanging out and getting to know others at camp. I had fun with the urgency and excitement of the direct action side of things. I soaked up being outdoors for a week in the chilly Fall weather and ended up liking that, too. I appreciated the spirituality of the camp, too; I felt comfortable accepting an open invitation from a Native person at camp to participate in a peace pipe ceremony that was new to me, and I felt open to exploring prayer as something other than the Judeo-Christian prayer I grew up with. I also liked to spend time singing and drumming at the ditch where the DAPL private security would guard the access road to a construction site. A few people consistently volunteered for long or overnight shifts on security duty or keeping the sacred fire going, which left them frustrated and wishing others would volunteer. The camp structure had evolved to include committees for some areas (such as media, security, and infrastructure), but sometimes it was difficult, especially for short-term campers, to connect with the committees, even when the committee could use the help and the person was eager to give it. Sometimes various misunderstandings arose. The Native people who came from Standing Rock said they felt unwelcome because the sacred fire at camp had died down to embers when they arrived in the middle of the night; they explained that the fire needed to be kept going so that the ancestors would stay nearby and be warm. In our morning meeting, one of the Native people explained several ways that the spirituality of the camp could be improved and asked to say a prayer before people left to protest at the ditch. In the prayer, the person fervently asked Creator to not allow anyone to be arrested. To me, the petition seemed out of place since many at the camp viewed risking arrest as one of the available strategies for drawing attention to the pipeline, challenging the law, and ultimately stopping construction. These moments were confusing and difficult to navigate. On one hand, the camp was, in part, standing in solidarity with Standing Rock, and a few Native people as well as non-Native people there were carrying out Native spiritual practices. Perhaps the small contingent of Natives in the camp was happy to have the increased support of the group that came (despite the accompanying criticisms of the status quo), and perhaps the group of Natives would have offered more fullness to practices that were potentially appropriated for use at the camp. Others grabbed banners and signs and began marching around the area. That day, authorities all decided to do nothing. The protesters took this as an opportunity to set up camp at the site, complete with an R.V. donated to the cause. On the Home Front My time at Mississippi Stand allowed me to engage with a small but active group of protesters who created a second front (in addition to Standing Rock) in the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline. My ancestral burial grounds are not at stake. The NoDAPL movement, and Mississippi Stand and Standing Rock in particular, have also shown us that mass mobilization and long-term, well-supported actions are possible. At least tens of thousands of people have travelled to Mississippi Stand and Standing Rock, and for those who have journeyed home, they are taking with them experiences of carrying out direct actions, adapting spontaneously to the cops and other hurdles, coping with police brutality, building teepees, cooking for hundreds of people, and living in a makeshift camp with dozens or thousands of others. Those people are now connected to one another and ready to act. account.
