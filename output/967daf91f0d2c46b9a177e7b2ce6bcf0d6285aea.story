It means She Shields The People Woman. As a child, I can remember watching veterans bringing in the flags at Powwows and being recognized at the Sundance and the honor given to them. From early on, justice, integrity, responsibility, and courage have defined her guiding values and actions. So it should not surprise any of us to learn she enlisted in the Air Force at the age of 22. From Texas and Florida to Korea, Kuwait, Sarajevo and Iraq, from the challenges of a Special Ops assignment to the battle against gender and racial discrimination, Jacqui has not only survived, she thrived in the military. I have a foundation as a Lakota woman, and the military gave me both camaraderie and skills. She felt ashamed she shared a uniform with these militant forces deployed to Standing Rock. She went to Standing Rock in October 2016, to stand up and to use her skills to make sure people stayed healthy and safe. Her first two hours were spent with mace victims and people at risk of hypothermia. She returned in November and again in early December with Veterans Stand for Standing Rock. Her commitment to the task wasn't finished and she redeployed with the Veteran Service Corps Operations Team in February where she assisted with the set up of Medical Operations at Four Bands Camp, an eviction proof camp created at the request of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. While at Four Bands Jacqui coordinated with the medics in all camps ensuring the safe evacuation of the People. I answered the call to veterans to protect the rights of the people. She is an advisor, a tactical leader, and active in seeking support for our work. On this Giving Tuesday, please consider making a one-time or recurring gift to Veteran Service Corps, to continue our efforts to engage veterans in meaningful service that benefits communities.
