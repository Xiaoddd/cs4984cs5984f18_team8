SHENANDOAH COUNTY, Va. (WVIR) - Property owners and opponents of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline are banding together to keep a watchful eye over construction of the proposed natural gas project. This group is calling itself the Compliance Surveillance Initiative (CSI), and members are training hundreds of volunteers to observe and document the construction from both the ground and up in the air. Pilots like Godfrey are working by both plane and drone for the CSI to monitor the construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Already, a drone has captured footage of tree-cutting along the right-of-way near Wintergreen. Besides the pilots, there will also be teams serving as environmental watchdogs on the ground. Dominion Energy says more than 1,300 environmental and safety inspectors are watching over the construction. He says companies' track records show that completing construction as quickly as possible takes precedence over concern for the environment. Godfrey plans to spend a lot more time behind the cockpit controls as pipeline construction is expected to begin this spring. Organizers of the Compliance Surveillance Initiative are planning training sessions in communities along the pipeline. They've also created an online interactive map to document every location they check out, which you can take a look at here. Follow Matt on Twitter, Facebook, or send him an email.
