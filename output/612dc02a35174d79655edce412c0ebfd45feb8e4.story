Sequoyah Fuels Corporation was opened by Kerr-McGee in 1970 to convert yellowcake uranium into uranium hexafluoride, a compound that produces fuel for nuclear reactors. The company switched hands several times over the years before closing in 1993 after several releases of hazardous chemicals. In January 1986, one worker was killed and dozens more were injured after a cylinder of uranium hexafluoride ruptured. It has since been in the decommissioning process, under the authority of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. During the decommissioning process, Sequoyah Fuels collected approximately 11,000 tons of uranium-contaminated sludge in several basins, lagoons and ditches at the site. Last week, Sequoyah Fuels announced it had been unable to locate an off-site location for the radioactive waste and, instead, intended to place the waste in an on-site storage cell. The Cherokee Nation and state of Oklahoma wanted an expert to review the off-site disposal options, but the company stated its intention to begin immediately placing the waste in an on-site cell.
