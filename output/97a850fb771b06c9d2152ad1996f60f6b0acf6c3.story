I needed to witness firsthand what was happening there, and wanted to offer solidarity to those fighting for the right of tribes to exercise agency over their own futures. Only one problem remained: I had to find a way to go. I am not a man of means. I weighed obligations, such as bills and work, and considered travelling expenses. I glanced at my vehicle, already knowing it was hardly suited for the 1,100-mile drive from my home in north-east Oregon, and resigned myself to staying home. In early November, I was contacted by my good friend Jamie Stone, who said he wanted to go and offered his truck and trailer to haul supplies. Jamie also happens to be a former oil worker on the North Slope of Alaska. His uncle is an oil executive, and his brother works for oil companies around the globe, but he also has family members who are farmers in the midwest and have had easements forced across their own land for oil pipelines. I quickly agreed to the opportunity, but requested that we attempt to raise donations for the water protectors, the group of Native Americans representing over 300 different tribes who are encamped near the location where the pipeline is slated to cross the Missouri river. They had put out a call for donations of firewood and winter camping supplies.

Where I live, in the wooded mountains of north-east Oregon, firewood is abundant. So the first thing I did was start reaching out to people for firewood donations. The response was overwhelming. Within 24 hours, we had reached our goal and acquired two more full-sized pickups and another trailer to accompany us. People also gave winter clothes, bulk food, horse feed and tack for the Sioux youth riders who have been active on the front lines of the movement since day one. Jack Walker, from Wallowa County, Oregon, was one of the people who donated. In the picture above, he is seen cutting firewood to take to Standing Rock.

Photograph: Public domain Wallowa County itself, much like the Standing Rock area, is home to one of the most tragic tales in American history and the Indian wars. Much as cities in the Dakotas are named for local tribes, Wallowa County and my hometown of Joseph are named for the people who had to endure atrocities committed by settlers eager to clear that land. The story of Chief Joseph, in particular, is yet another tale of a protector willing to sacrifice everything in the face of insurmountable odds. Chief Joseph was a leader in the Nez Perce war of 1877, in which his tribe and others opposed the US army. They were cut short not far from the border by a surprise flank attack in which much of the tribe was killed. All my friends are there. My father is buried there. Some of my children are buried there. I like the white people, but they have driven me out of my home. I have friendly feelings for all. My blood is the same that flows in the veins of the white men. We will all die just the same. Joseph was not allowed that right, and he died in exile. Cody is a member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian reservation, which is not far from my home.

Photograph: Joe Whittle for the Guardian On the long drive into the Great Plains from the mountains and forests of our home, we talked of the days when his tribe and the Nez Perce would cross the continental divide and hunt bison, sometimes allying with the Sioux who lived on the plains, occasionally warring with them. Travelling those aisles of American history together felt surreal, considering where we were headed. History, it seemed, was repeating itself, only in a more modern form. When we finally arrived, it was dark and cold, and we were met by a security team. After the team made sure we were not intoxicated or bringing weapons, we were allowed in. Around 4,000 people are spread across roughly one-mile stretches of land on either side of the Cannonball river, which are filled with tipis, tents and a few RVs. My own daughter was fired at with rubber bullets while kneeling on the ground praying The sounds of Native American drum groups and songs echoed through the crisp air. Native people have survived 500 years of atrocity on this continent with the help of prayers, ceremony, and our community. We are steady in our promise to never give up on our cultural and spiritual relationship with the land and water we owe everything to. It is perhaps for this reason that despite the continuing war against our way of life, there is love, happiness and a deep spirituality at Oceti Sakowin Camp. In the distance, to my left, I could see the bright lights coming from a line of police cars behind the barricade, across State Highway 1806. To my right, high-powered floodlights near the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL) construction site shone brightly, pointing at the camp all night long. DAPL floodlights point at the camp from dusk until dawn. But a plane circles the camp low, with lights off (an FAA violation) all night long, providing a near-constant droning buzz.

My own daughter, Mia, a 4.0-grade average student at Stanford University with a full-ride doctorate scholarship to any university in the world, was fired at with rubber bullets while kneeling on the ground praying. The following is the text message I received from her after a terrified night of watching live feeds on Facebook from my home back in Oregon: My friend was shot with a rubber bullet right next to me. Her auntie took care of us; she swiftly and strongly guided us back to the van where she was taken to the medics. She was a badass warrior. The women are all holding it down, that needs to be clear. They are the ones who get forgotten about in these movements, their importance needs to be emphasized. The entire area is considered a sacred area, and said to contain other graves. When construction began, water protectors made an attempt to occupy the location to protect it. Police responded with violent force and lined the shores of the Cannonball river under the hill, repelling people with rubber bullets and high powered pepper spray. Many people were injured. It was one of the most violent encounters of the ongoing resistance. Last week, Sophia Wilansky, 21, was seriously injured after being hit by a projectile when officers threw less-than-lethal weapons at demonstrators. She might lose her arm. They marched to the police roadblock, and performed a 21-gun salute for a fallen veteran and a prayer ceremony on the bridge. Many people are surprised to learn of the seeming irony of the fact that Native Americans possess more enrolled military members per capita than any other ethnicity in America. Law enforcement officers have, too. Former Wallowa County police officer Michelle Bloker joined the caravan from Oregon. Jeff Ginter, a former Department of Justice investigations officer and Homeland Security air marshall, was at Standing Rock during my time there. Retired after 30 years in law enforcement, Jeff has an easy way about him which would lend itself to de-escalation tactics as a police officer. It was needed. The abuses are many. My own brother Larry Whittle, a Marine Corps veteran of the Gulf war and enrolled member of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, also decided to show solidarity at Standing Rock. On my fifth day there, he informed me that he would be joining the peaceful direct action. Their intent was to march peacefully down a county road to DAPL headquarters, where tribal elders would pray and hold ceremony to bless the sacred sites being disturbed by pipeline construction. The group was threatened by an angry local owner of a construction company called Four Square Concrete, who flew into a rage at having his drive home impeded by water protectors. After pushing into several protectors with his truck while laying on his horn and revving his engine, he pulled out a handgun and began pointing it at people. Before leaving the scene, he reached his gun out the window and fired seven rounds over the crowd. We used to go out there and listen to the spirits, really listen to what they had to say. Photograph: Joe Whittle for the Guardian He and his friends are the peaceful modern-day equivalent of the famous Great Plains horse warriors of yesteryear. It was their ancestors who defeated Gen Custer at the famous battle of the Little Bighorn. They have not only been instrumental in helping to initiate the movement, but also in leading and inspiring it. They have provided security for people in the camp and repeatedly protected elders during confrontations. One horse was shot twice with lethal ammunition by an unknown assailant during one protest encounter. Another horse was killed by rubber bullet impact from police during the first Backwater Bridge incident. Lakota leader Crazy Horse spoke of his vision of that prophecy with the following words: Upon suffering beyond suffering, the Red Nation shall rise again and it shall be a blessing for a sick world. A world filled with broken promises, selfishness and separations. A world longing for light again. I see a time of seven generations when all the colors of mankind will gather under the sacred Tree of Life and the whole Earth will become one circle again. In that day there will be those among the Lakota who will carry knowledge and understanding of unity among all living things, and the young white ones will come to those of my people and ask for this wisdom. So far, Standing Rock has seen visitors come from as far as Tibet, Japan, and New Zealand to offer support. Even the last remaining indigenous people of Europe, the Sami tribe, have sent representatives. People such as Lakota youth Phillip Wright believe the time Crazy Horse described is now. The Yellow Nation, the Red Nation, the Black Nation, and the White Nation, all came together. There is a sense of history in the making. This is what they were probably talking about. They were calling us, warning us about something. No one at the camp really wants to think about the possibility of the pipeline crossing the river. But there is definitely a sense that something bigger is happening. Please choose your username under which you would like all your comments to show up. You can only set your username once.
