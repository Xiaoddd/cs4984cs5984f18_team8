Our brothers and sisters at Standing Rock in North Dakota are being viciously attacked for peacefully standing up to defend our sacred places, clean water and Mother Earth against a reckless pipeline project. She may lose her arm. I saw Indian people from across this country coming together to Stand with Standing Rock. For more than 100 years, the pollution-based economy has dominated not just this country, but the planet. It is a system that treats Mother Earth not as the source of life and of everything that sustains life, but as both a treasure trove to be exploited and as a vast waste pit. We have polluted and exhausted our water ways. We have poisoned our air and contaminated our soil. We have treated every living being and non-living thing as consumable and expendable. The pollution-based economy has now impacted the farthest reaches of our planet. Our oceans are choked with plastics. Glaciers are disappearing. River beds are dustbowls. Forests are vanishing. Species all around us are dying out daily. Our air is poison. This pollution-based economy is not sustainable, because it was never designed to be sustainable. In the process it imprisoned them in their excess and separated them from everything life giving while leaving millions to wallow in poverty. The owners of the Dakota Access pipeline are just passing through and will stop at nothing to run over anyone or anything in their way. They lie to and deceive the public and the media. Their grandfathers did not succeed and neither will they. Indian Country is rising up. We know that if we stand together we cannot be defeated. Still, we need all righteous people to stand with us against this injustice. Most of all we need the Federal government, which has a trust obligation to act in the best interest of Indian people, to stand with us. We must stand together.
