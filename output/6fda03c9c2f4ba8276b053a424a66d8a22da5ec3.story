Sophia Wilansky, an environmental activist from New York, was hospitalized in Minneapolis where surgeons are attempting to repair a severe injury to her left arm that destroyed arteries, nerves, muscle, soft tissue and bone, according to her father. She remains at risk of amputation, and if the arm is salvaged, it will probably have very limited functionality. Wayne Wilansky, her father, contends that the injury was caused by an exploding concussion grenade thrown by law enforcement, who also deployed teargas, rubber bullets and a water cannon on protesters during a tense standoff on a bridge Sunday night. The highway patrol also released photographs of propane cylinders recovered from the scene of the confrontation, which they said were being used as explosives. A witness, Stephen Joachinson, told the Guardian that he was talking with Sophia Wilansky near the burned vehicle when police started yelling at them on a bullhorn. The 1,172-mile pipeline would carry 470,000 barrels a day. The local Standing Rock Sioux tribe and thousands of Native American supporters say the project threatens sacred native lands and could contaminate their water supply from the Missouri river. The pair began running away, he said, when a concussion grenade exploded behind them. Seconds later, a second concussion grenade struck her arm. Officials have said that they deployed teargas, bean-bag rounds, sponge rounds and a water cannon. The explosion is under investigation by the North Dakota bureau of criminal investigation with support from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. A spokesman for the FBI refused to confirm or deny that the agency was involved in the investigation. The movement has become a global rallying cry for indigenous rights and anti-climate change activism, but has faced fierce opposition from the pipeline company and local law enforcement.
