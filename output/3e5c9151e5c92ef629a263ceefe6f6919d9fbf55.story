Calling for impeachment is not premature. This is a valid concern, but I think impeachment is still important. First of all, you can impeach Pence too. But even if that fails, we might still end up in a better place. Trump is an asset to Pence: someone who can control media attention and be a figurehead for public outcry while he does what he wants. People who do evil things in the most powerful office in the world should be punished for them. Basically, someone in the House needs to call for it, get a few key committees to commission an investigation and then bring the articles of impeachment to the full House floor for a vote. In other words, it involves convincing a lot of Republican Members of Congress to rebel against Trump. Here are a few ways to possibly do it. Find ways to expose his greed, corruption and moral degeneracy, and keep sharing them with the world. Speak out, cause trouble, get press to cover the stories you want covered about him. And most importantly, get him to react to you. There is a point at which his unpopularity becomes such a weight on GOP Members of Congress that they will be willing to kick him over the side of the ship to keep themselves afloat. The more you drive down his ratings, the better. Second, obstruct the things Presidents need to do to pursue their agenda. Being President is hard, and he needs the cooperation of the press, federal agencies and judicial system to make his policies happen. Support lawsuits that obstruct his worst ideas, encourage whistle blowers from the bureaucracy to speak out, and participate in protests that prevent him from getting his message out undiluted. That again makes them likely to jump ship. This is a place where Trump and the House have a difference of opinion. I wanted to add a few things that might be more relevant as the issue of impeachment rockets into the political mainstream. It now appears that the Russia story and ensuing coverup is going to be the most likely avenue for any serious impeachment proceedings. I would like to make the case that impeaching because of the Russia scandal is still a valuable and useful outcome. First, any time you publicly demonstrate that the most powerful person in the world is subject to the rule of law, you are making a step forward for good governance and progressive values. Second, Russia is a right wing, militaristic petro-government that is expanding its influence in the US and abroad for the purpose of extracting more oil and imposing arch-conservative values of patriarchy and militarism.
