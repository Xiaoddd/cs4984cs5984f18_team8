The outcome will determine whether additional study will be required or the project proceeds as planned with construction possibly beginning in early 2019. was completed in 2014. The project would cross six counties in Montana. In 2015, John Kerry, secretary of state under President Barack Obama, concluded the controversial project was not in the country's national interest, citing the impact the project would have on climate change as a major factor in the decision. Climate change, whooping cranes, oil spills, executive authority and environmental laws were among the issues debated. Attorneys for the environmental groups argued that the Trump administration's State Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in a rush to approve the permit for Keystone XL, disregarded fundamental environmental laws. Eight attorneys representing those groups were seated at one table. Douglas Hayes, an attorney for the Sierra Club, said the permit was illegally issued before the final route in Nebraska was determined.

The National Environmental Policy Act requires site-specific analysis, Hayes said. Jared Margolis, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, said the plaintiffs, through a freedom of information request, had obtained new telemetry data regarding whooping crane locations from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. That information needs to be considered before the project moves forward, he said. Powerlines associated with the pipeline increase the risk of whooping cranes colliding with them in migration areas, Margolis said. It did not count the costs of climate change including rising sea level, drought and wildfires, he said. He also said that the environmental study failed to address the threat the line would pose to 30,000 users of Fort Peck-area water system in Montana. That system relies on Missouri River water downstream from the location of where the pipeline would pass under the river. Accordingly, it is not subject to judicial review, and the claims should be dismissed, they said. Seven attorneys representing the government and TransCanada were seated at one table.

He accused the environmental groups of abusing the purpose of the environmental impact statement process and getting so far in the weeds it makes it difficult for government agencies to do their jobs. Regarding the study of whooping cranes, Steenland said the plaintiffs would like the court to believe government review was arbitrary and capricious. That observed data was looked at in the environmental review, and the new data will be considered as the project moves forward, he said. The differing outcomes reflect differences in policy judgment, he said. That the Nebraska Public Service Commission changed the pipeline route through Nebraska after the permit was issued in 2017 does not require an update of the environmental study, Hajek said.
