Besides suing to prevent the pipeline from deteriorating their land, the farmers are challenging eminent domain law at-large to protect all lands from for-profit seizure, arguing against the claim that the pipeline is a public utility. The pipeline, whose construction is near completed, runs through North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois and would transport over half a million barrels of crude oil a day. The Army Corps of Engineers denied easements earlier this month that would allow the company, Energy Transfer Partners, to drill below Lake Oahe, where thousands of Native Americans and allies from around the world camp to resist environmental and cultural damage. INTERVIEWS: What You May Not Know About the Dakota Access Pipeline Native Americans have participated in the actions in Iowa, but it has mostly been led by landowners who felt coerced into settling for easements and insist that having oil run through their land, to be refined in Texas and shipped back to Iowa for possible consumption, is not a public service. Many also expect the oil to be shipped overseas and not even be sold in-state. Many of them voted for Trump, said Fallon, but he expects them to be disenchanted soon, if not already, considering his nominee for energy secretary is on the board of Energy Transfer Partners. Iowa, a major battleground state, favored Trump by a 10-point margin, and the counties in which the pipeline runs voted for Trump far above the state average, some voting up to 70 percent red.
