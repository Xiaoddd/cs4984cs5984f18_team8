Case in Point The Man Who Spent 35 Years in Prison Without a Trial The Jerry Hartfield case is an extraordinary tale of justice delayed and denied. An audio version of Case in Point is broadcast with The Takeaway, a public radio show from WNYC, Public Radio International, The New York Times, and WGBH-Boston Public Radio. When Jerry Hartfield walked out of the Hutchins State Jail in Dallas on Monday into the sunlight and the arms of his family, he became one of the most unlikely prisoners ever to be freed early in Texas. No one else has confessed to the murder for which he was convicted in 1977. No DNA cleared him. No witness recanted. No celebrities pleaded his cause. Hartfield was freed from prison because Texas finally gave up trying to find a valid reason to keep him there. He was supposed to get a new trial in 1980 after an appeals court reversed his conviction and death sentence because of a flaw during jury selection. If it were not for a fellow prisoner and the public defenders who eventually discovered the mistake, the 61-year-old intellectually disabled man likely would have died alone in his cell, his story as lost as he was. Jerry Hartfield at the Hughes Unit outside Gatesville, Texas, in 2012. Hartfield was convicted in 1977 of killing a woman in Bay City, Texas. His conviction was reversed a few years later, and he was set free this June. Then, when the problem was discovered in 2006, a new generation of Texas officials relied on those same complexities to keep Hartfield in prison for another 11 years. In an interview with The Marshall Project just after he was released, Hartfield said he holds no animosity for the state lawyers whose arguments kept him confined for so long. I am not angry. For the attorneys and advocates who helped free him, he had nothing but gratitude. The story starts in 1976 with the murder and sexual assault of Eunice Lowe, a white woman whose body was found in the bus station where she had worked in Bay City, near Houston. Confessed, that is, the way a black man with an IQ later found to be in the 50s or 60s could ever legitimately confess to anything in the South in the 1970s. Hartfield says today that he was coerced into confessing. He has always maintained his innocence. On Sept. 17, 1980, four years to the day after the murder, the first unusual thing happened to Hartfield. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ordered him retried because prosecutors had improperly dismissed a juror over her reservations about the death penalty. They failed. So, in 1983, the Texas appeals court again ordered a new trial. Prosecutors thought the commutation effectively resolved the case in their favor, but they were wrong. The appellate judges believed their order for that second trial was being followed by prosecutors. They were wrong. They were also wrong. Maybe he and his client both figured they would wait to see how it played out. And so Hartfield sat in prison for another 23 years, until 2006, when he finally began to figure out that something may have gone wrong. Once Hartfield started asking questions, no judge or lawyer knew precisely what to do. Evidently, no one had ever seen such an extraordinary delay between the time a court ordered a new trial and the time a defendant asked for one. But for years, one judge after another simply wallowed in that tangle, each refusing to cut through it to either set Hartfield free or get him his new trial. They apparently hoped the embarrassing mistake would simply fade away with time. It did not. Between 2006 and 2007, with the help of a fellow inmate named Kevin Althouse, Hartfield made three requests to state judges for help. Each time, however, judges summarily rejected his claims. There was something automatic in the way these rulings came down, without any written analysis or explanation, almost as if the jurists never even considered the arguments. To them, perhaps, he was just another confessed murderer trying to get relief on some hoary technicality. Realizing he was getting nowhere with the state courts, Hartfield asked the federal courts to get involved. First, a federal judge assigned Hartfield a public defender. It was a major milestone in the case. It was a classic Catch-22: state judges hiding between procedural hurdles and federal judges deferring to those state judges. So Hartfield took his case to a federal appeals court, which acknowledged, too, that he was imprisoned without a valid conviction. But that court also refused to intervene directly. In 2013, 30 years after it had ordered Hartfield to get his new trial, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals acknowledged at last that Hartfield had been improperly imprisoned for all those years. But it, too, refused to order him released or retried. Instead, the case was reassigned to a another judge, who again ordered a new trial. That judge concluded that Hartfield was to blame for the long delay in asserting his rights and he had not suffered much by waiting all those years. So Hartfield was retried in August 2015. If anything, the second trial highlighted the flaws of the first one. Two key witnesses who had testified against Hartfield in 1977 had died, so their original testimony was read into the record. None of this mattered. Jurors convicted Hartfield again, and a judge sentenced him to life in prison. Prosecutors got what they wanted, only 35 years later. But that is not where this story ends. And this time the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, as much a player as a referee in this case, finally rescued Hartfield. That was his fault, the judges concluded. But it did credit him for speaking up from 2006 to 2013. That, finally, was enough to sustain a claim. And enough to get him released. The irony is thick. By arguing over technicalities in a case of such obvious injustice state attorneys sabotaged their own cause.

And a nap. Jerry Hartfield took a nap Monday afternoon, which means Jerry Hartfield must have woken up shortly thereafter and wondered if it all had been a dream. Hartfield says he found God during those long years of incarceration with the help of chaplains and nuns and other spiritual advisors. He received little job or career training all those years because everyone presumed he was serving a life sentence with no chance of parole. Then again, his life story is right there in the first lines of a famous hymn: I once was lost but now am found.
