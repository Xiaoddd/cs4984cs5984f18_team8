In a letter to Smith sent Tuesday, the attorneys general argue the demand for documents interferes with the investigative authority of the states. The attorneys general of Massachusetts and New York have ongoing investigations of Exxon under each state's securities and consumer protection laws related to whether Exxon properly disclosed risks posed by climate change to the company's business. Smith, a 15-term Texas Republican who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, first subpoenaed the Massachusetts and New York state AGs last July. He followed last month with a second subpoena seeking records that delve into the investigative strategy of the AGs, a tactic critics say is an attempt to shield Exxon from scrutiny. Smith has said the attorneys general investigations amount to a crusade to silence alternative views of climate change, and that his probe is designed to protect the First Amendment rights of academic institutions, scientists and companies engaged in climate research. He has used his chairmanship to launch prior investigations questioning the work of climate scientists. In September, Smith extended his subpoena to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had reportedly launched a related investigation into Exxon. The group of attorneys general called on Smith to withdraw his subpoenas. The letter states that the New York and Massachusetts investigations are lawful and that the House Committee's subpoena threatens to interfere with pending court proceedings involving Exxon.
