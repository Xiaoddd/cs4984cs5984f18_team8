Mr. Giron, who is known as Little Feather, was charged with Civil Disorder and Use of Fire to Commit a Federal Felony Offense, arising from events of October 27, 2016. Subject to the acceptance of the plea agreement by Judge Daniel Hovland, who is presiding over the case, prosecutors and the defense will jointly recommend a sentence of 36 months on the Civil Disorder charge, although the judge does have the authority to go as high as five years. Little Feather and his legal team were facing monumental challenges including the prospect of trial with a hostile jury pool, limited discovery, and the risk of a long prison sentence. In December of 2016, WPLC brought in an expert to poll the potential jurors to determine the extent of local bias against Water Protectors. Little Feather is a member of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, and was raised in Santa Barbara, California. His time in camp was a cleansing experience that helped put him in touch with his spirituality and his indigenous identity, and opened his heart to a prayerful way of life that he looks forward to sharing with his family upon his release. The whole family loves and adores him. He keeps us strong and we want him home with us. The change of plea hearing will be at 1:30PM on Thursday February 8, 2018 in Bismarck federal court before Chief Judge Daniel Hovland. Supporters are encouraged to attend to show solidarity with Little Feather and his family. Little Feather has been incarcerated since March 9, 2017. He is represented by attorneys Peter Schoenburg of New Mexico and Timothy R. Lohraff of Washington. Activists North Dakota Standing Rock Water Protectors Ronzig the Wizard Sadly the government used the threat of 10 years in jail for merely standing up for his rights of freedom of speech and protection of his values. Extortion is a common form of coercion in the justice system. Prosecutors charge a person with a medium level crime when no real crime has been committed. They simultaneously charge him with a serious felony that comes with a guarantee of extremely long jail time to force him to plead guilty to the lesser charge which he is not guilty of to avoid the likely conviction of the greater charge. There is no justice in this gambit but it takes an extremely dedicated activist to stand by his convictions in the face of a government bent on destroying his whole life for doing what was right.
