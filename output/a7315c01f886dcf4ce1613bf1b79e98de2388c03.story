Because the activists have cost the oil company hundreds of thousands of dollars, tension between opposers of the DAPL and law enforcement workers has only escalated in recent months. In addition to protestors being tear gassed, beaten with batons, shot with rubber bullets, maced and tased, activists were drenched by water canons in below-freezing temperatures last week. Bismarck Tribune reports that the lawyer guild seeks an immediate injunction to prevent Kirchmeier and other agencies from using detrimental munitions, such as rubber bullets, lead-filled beanbags, water and sound canons, water hoses, directed energy devices, explosive tear gas grenades, and other chemical against against the protestors. Indeed, action taken against the protestors in recent weeks has resulted in one woman almost losing her arm, several tribal leaders being hospitalized, activists suffering broken bones, some losing consciousness, and a woman possibly going blind due to impact to her eye. Illegal use of force against the water protectors has been escalating. It is only a matter of luck that no one has been killed. These are standing orders. Kirchmeier claims the action taken against the protestors is for the protection of police.
