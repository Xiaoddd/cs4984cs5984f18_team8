At least 33 activists were arrested at a shopping mall during a rally meant to coincide with heightened business. About 100 demonstrators, including some members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, walked into the Kirkwood Mall in the downtown area of Bismarck, the capital of North Dakota and one of the nearest cities to the tribe's reservation. Protesters and police say the demonstration was calm and without incident. In Chicago, Illinois, crowds marched along the city's most popular shopping strip Friday morning, aiming to shut down the so-called Magnificent Mile. Last year's protest followed the release of a video showing the fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald by a white Chicago police officer. We've successfully shut down Wells Fargo for the day. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.
