Thick smoke darkened an overcast sky and obscured the silhouettes of the people torching anything still standing. The government had ordered everyone to disburse, bringing an end to the Dakota Access Pipeline protest. But before leaving, the water protectors who had spent months at the camp burned it all down. Some called the fire a ceremonial act of prayer, according to the Bismark Tribune, while others said burning the structures was easier than moving them. Whatever the case, the fire marked the end of a six-month protest that drew as many as 10,000 people to Cannon Ball, North Dakota to protest the pipeline's construction near the Sioux Standing Rock reservation. The protesters won a reprieve in December, when the Army Corps of Engineers blocked the 1,172-mile pipeline's passage under the tribe's water source. The Corps of Engineers gave everyone until Wednesday afternoon to clear out. Yang, a Getty photographer, visited the Oceti Sakowin camp twice before, and found the solidarity among protesters overwhelming. There was orderliness. Everyone was getting fed. All resources were being distributed. People were unselfish. When the time came, most people left willingly, but on their terms. The fire was a final act of a defiance marking the end of the camp, but not the fight it represents. All rights reserved. Your California Privacy Rights. Ad Choices.
