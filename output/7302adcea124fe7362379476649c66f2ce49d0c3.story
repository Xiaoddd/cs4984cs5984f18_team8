Dakota Access Pipeline Add Interest Local authorities have issued a mandatory evacuation order for the site near the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation where hundreds of activists are camping out in protest of the controversial crude oil pipeline. Those who have not cleared out by Monday could be arrested, authorities said. Authorities said they issued this evacuation order as a safeguard against the winter conditions. In addition, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights told ABC News on Friday that it would send commissioners to North Dakota because of the commission's civil rights concerns. Despite the looming possibility of confrontations, arrests and the below-freezing temperatures, many demonstrators said they will continue their protests. I hope it doesn't come down to that. Iron Shell, a member of the Oglala Lakota Tribe, is one of the original members of the International Indigenous Youth Council, an advocacy group that has become known for its commitment to remaining peaceful during confrontations with police. The activist is also a descendant of Chief Iron Shell, a widely respected Brule Sioux chief who was among the first tribal leaders to sign the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, which established the Great Sioux Reservation, a vast territory that has since been cut down by acts of Congress into checkerboard remnants of its original version. Iron Shell said there's a lot of talk among the protesters about what's going to happen on Monday. Since this summer, Native American groups and environmental activists have been battling to block construction of the 1,172-mile pipeline that is slated to traverse four states and transport crude oil from North Dakota's oil fields to refinery markets in Illinois. Energy Transfer Partners filed for a court order two weeks ago asking for the right-of-way to complete construction of the pipeline without further intervention from the federal government. The court has yet to rule on the matter.
