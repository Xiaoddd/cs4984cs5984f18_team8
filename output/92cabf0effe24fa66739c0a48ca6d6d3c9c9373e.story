Lemalu, 21, traveled with about a dozen people from Springfield to Standing Rock Sioux Reservation this week to protest the construction of the North Dakota Access oil pipeline. She said both horror and love have shaped her days embedded with a months-long demonstration, which has drawn people from around the world. A few hours later, she was running blindly from a choking cloud of tear gas, surrounded by hundreds of screaming people. The family of a woman hurt by an explosion during the confrontation has said she faces multiple surgeries and could lose an arm. One officer was injured when struck with a rock. As soon as I began running two (tear gas canisters) exploded at my feet. My body was shutting down. My jacket from the tear bombs and coughing & choking. They were actual tear bombs. They exploded like a shotgun blast. but she's glad to be part of the movement. Lemalu, who is indigenous Polynesian, said she traveled to North Dakota to support Native Americans opposing construction of the pipeline near a reservation. The pipeline stretches 1,200 miles across four states. Many are indigenous people from across the United States and even from other countries. She said there is a lot to do and learn. Volunteers are busy prepping food and building or winterizing structures for protesters who plan to stay through the frigid North Dakota winter, Lemalu said. Not all members of the Springfield group camped out. Springfield resident Mindy Spitz, 57, stayed at a hotel about 15 minutes away. Spitz said she's in North Dakota to fight for the environment and against corporate interests. Spitz said she had been watching the developments at Standing Rock since September and felt like signing petitions online and posting on social media was not enough. Spitz was not at the skirmish Sunday night, but she said she opened her hotel room to be used as a shower station for protesters who had been tear-gased. Spitz said one member of the Springfield group was hit by three rubber bullets, leaving deep bruises, and at least four others were tear-gased. Protesters, some from Springfield, clashed with law enforcement near Cannonball, N.D., Sunday November 20, 2016. It felt like it was war. She said she will continue to speak out. Law enforcement officials have disputed details about Sunday night. He defended using them. She said there has been a lot of conflicting reports about the demonstrations.
