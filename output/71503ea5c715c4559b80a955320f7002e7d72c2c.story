Everything you need to know from the authority on music, entertainment, politics and pop culture. Nash says she was inspired to pen the note and reach out to others in the music community after participating in a letter-banking event. Doing so reminded her of signing a letter two years ago in support of then-imprisoned Russian punk outfit, Pussy Riot, and Nash notes how excited she was that the band added their name to her letter. Over the last several weeks, protesters have been subjected to water cannons, rubber bullets and concussion grenades. The full letter is available to read below. Along with Nash and the signees of her letter, the DAP protests have garnered support from other musicians including Neil Young, Dave Matthews and Mensa, who joined the protest earlier this week. Matthews, meanwhile, organized a benefit concert in Washington D.C. with Graham Nash, Neko Case and Ledisi, while Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt and Jason Mraz staged their own show in Fort Yates, North Dakota. Kate Nash Full Letter Regarding Dakota Access Pipeline Dear President Obama, Army Corps of Engineers, and Department of Justice, We are writing to express our shock at the treatment of the people of Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota. We are deeply disturbed by the police actions that have been taking place, where non violent protests have been and continue to be met with extremely aggressive tactics including; being shot with water canons in below freezing temperatures, chemical weapons, rubber bullets, and attack dogs. These are the same inhumane methods used during WWII and the Civil Rights Movement. We feel strongly in the current political climate that those in power must be held accountable for their actions. We encourage you to remember that this planet provides for us, not the other way around. Water is life and this cannot be underestimated or taken for granted in 2016. We are aware of the long and painful history between the US and its indigenous people. Standing Rock we stand with you. Sign up for our newsletter.
