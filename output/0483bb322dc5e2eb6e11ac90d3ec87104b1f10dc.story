In response, Greenpeace USA Tar Sands Campaigner Rachel Rye Butler said: After a constant wave of resistance and negative press in both Canada and the United States, Kinder Morgan has deemed the new Trans Mountain pipeline and tanker project too great a financial and reputational risk. In recent months, more than 200 people have been arrested confronting this project and those protests have spread to Quebec and across Canada, as well as Seattle, the UK, Switzerland, and beyond. Advertisement The remarkable decision of a pipeline company to give up on its own project is one of the clearest signs yet that pipelines are risky investments for companies, banks, and their shareholders. It is unforgivable that the Canadian government is doubling down on this project. The Trans Mountain expansion would worsen the effects of global warming, violate Indigenous sovereignty, risk poisoning water, and threaten the thousands of jobs that depend on clean coasts. The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion threatens to increase the transport of toxic tar sands oil through the Salish Sea sevenfold, creating a tar sands tanker highway off the West Coast. The Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion and tanker superhighway would endanger Southern Resident Killer Whales and fish populations, and trample Indigenous rights on both sides of the border. Moreover, such an expansion of the tar sands will exacerbate global climate change.
