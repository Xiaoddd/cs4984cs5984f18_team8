A Neanderthal woman might have looked like this artist's rendition. By Simon Worrall PUBLISHED October 14, 2017 Today, scientists routinely map the genomes of the long dead, from Neanderthals to medieval kings. Speaking from the BBC studio in London where he hosts the weekly radio program Inside Science, Rutherford explains how the development of farming changed human biology; why the most important story our genes tell is that we are all family, despite race or tribe; and why it's not genes that turn people into mass shooters. If you think of DNA simply as a data storage device, the data it stores is biological information. Under the right conditions, DNA will last for thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years trapped inside the bones of a person or organism. With the advent of our ability to get it out, we can do genome studies on creatures that have been dead for thousands of centuries. The first big landmark came in 2009, when DNA was extracted from the bone of a Neanderthal. Europeans on average have between one and two percent Neanderthal DNA. Using sophisticated statistics and computer models, we can also pinpoint when that DNA went from Neanderthal to humans and vice versa. Learn how the species fits into our evolutionary story. We saw that we interbred with the Denisovans, and they interbred with us. The further east you go today, the more Denisovan DNA you see in living people and the less Neanderthal. Another exciting discovery is how our genes change culture, and vice-versa. Even before we were Homo sapiens, we were using technology like fire to cook with or tools like stones. That developed in our species what we broadly refer to as culture, which includes art and music but also agriculture. The emergence of farming as our dominant technology 10-12,000 years ago fundamentally changed human behavior and our own biology. The best-understood example of that is what is referred to as lactase persistence. They get gassy tummy and diarrhea as a result of drinking milk after they have weaned. Looking at the genetics of ancient people, we know that we had, in fact, started dairy farming before lactase persistence evolved, rather than the other way around. We were already using goats and sheep for their dairy products before we had the ability to drink raw milk into adulthood. Fast forward millennia to the recent riots in Charlottesville, which showed how volatile the issue of race still is in America. In many ways, genetics makes a mockery of race. But when we look at the full genomes from people all over the world, those differences represent a tiny fraction of the differences between people. There is, for instance, more genetic diversity within Africa than in the rest of the world put together. You had your own DNA analyzed. The data refers to a proportion of people in a population who have that characteristic. In 2012, geneticists were asked to analyze the DNA of mass-shooter Adam Lanza for clues to his violence. It says something about us that we look for simple answers to complex questions. Inevitably, people have turned to the relatively new science of genetics to try to explain otherwise unfathomable human behaviors, such as spree killing or murder. But the notion that there would be a deterministic, genetic component to someone who went out and shot 20 kids in a school, as Adam Lanza did, is incredibly misguided. There is a genetic basis to human behaviors. But there is also an environmental component. We used to say nature versus nurture. But we might say nature via nurture. Almost all spree killers display similar characteristics of profound psychological problems, and Adam Lanza was typical in that regard. Some of those problems have a heritable component. The single common factor in all spree killings is access to guns. That seems straightforward to me. In that sense, we are changing. That is a much more difficult question to answer, partly because evolution happens slowly. Adaptation to different environmental pressures happens generally very slowly, over many, many generations. This is effectively a history book. Our new ability to get DNA out of the long dead has made geneticists like me historians, with this new source text that is complementary to all the traditional forms of knowing the past. Every week a paper comes out that makes me catch my breath and also makes me sigh because it means I have to rewrite the book. And will probably be rewriting it for many years to come.
