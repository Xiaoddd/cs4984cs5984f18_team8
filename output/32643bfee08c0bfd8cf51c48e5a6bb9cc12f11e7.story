You know, the successes and struggles that are the building blocks of everyday life. In the wake of the election, the discussion changed. The group, dubbed 500 Women Scientists, was created in response to President Trump and his anti-science, anti-women comments. All donations made between now and September 29 will be matched dollar-for-dollar. While the group is inclusive of all scientific disciplines, Jane Zelikova, one of the original texters and a fellow at the Department of Energy, said climate change was one of their top priorities in drafting the pledge. Beyond climate research and policy, the administration has also signaled a shift away from fact-based policy making. Moreover, early executive actions on immigration and reproductive issues have underscored that women, minorities, and immigrants could face further setbacks under Trump, to say nothing of his comments released during the election about sexually assaulting women. Reality. Science. Democracy. As of Friday, more than 14,000 women scientists had added their names. There has also been an outpouring of international support, with signatories from 109 countries. Women also face a pay gap, with female faculty members earning 11 percent less than their male counterparts in the U.S., and many women have to deal with the challenges of raising a family while trying to advance their careers. Making science more inclusive has the potential to unlock new lines of research and thinking. In fields like climate change, this is particularly important because the impacts will disproportionately affect poor communities. Kelly Fleming, another founder and fellow at the Department of Energy, said the group will focus on mentoring and supporting women in science as well as helping scientists engage communities that can use science to solve their problems. A number of signatories said the twin themes of the need for science and inclusivity resonated with them. The themes will also drive what comes next for the group, which is in the process of applying for nonprofit status. While the group will help women in science, it will also stand as a strong watchdog against the politicization of science by governments, and not just in the U.S., but abroad as well.
