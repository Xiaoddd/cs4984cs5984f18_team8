Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated. Until then, construction can continue. The emergency request came after the U.S. Army on Tuesday announced that it had granted Texas-based gas company Energy Transfer Partners permission to start work on the final section of the North Dakota-to-Illinois pipeline. ETP, a Fortune 500 company, first petitioned the government in December 2014 for permission to build the line, which will also cross through South Dakota and Iowa. All four states signed off on the plan over the succeeding 16 months; Iowa, the last, granted permission in March 2016. In April, protesters converged in North Dakota, arguing that the pipeline was both a blow to the Native American tribes and the environment. But in July, the Army Corps of Engineers greenlit the construction work, granting the oil company permits to build at more than 200 water crossings. The Cheyenne River Sioux in August signed onto the same lawsuit. The peaceful demonstrations swelled in size and grew tense after the lawsuits. Since the onset of the direct action, North Dakota police have arrested more than 600 protesters. Weeks later, the Army announced it was approving work on the final part of the pipeline, overturning its December announcement. Lawyers for the tribe will likely argue to expedite the lawsuit in order to get a decision before that happens. Chase Iron Eyes, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux, said in a statement that the tribe is disappointed with the ruling, but not surprised. While the legal battle is ongoing, protesters, too, are continuing their fight. The once thousands-strong camp in North Dakota has thinned to about 300, but demonstrators are still vocal. On Sunday night, Paris Jackson spoke out against the pipeline at the Grammy Awards. Email check failed, please try again Sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.
