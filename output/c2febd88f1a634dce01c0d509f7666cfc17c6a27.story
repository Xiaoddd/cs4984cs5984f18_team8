Shanthi used rags to manage her monthly bleeding. She tried to hide them, but periods are rather public in nature. Just like butterflies. He dedicated himself to creating a simple system that allowed poor women to make menstrual pads for themselves. It took him years of experimentation before he was able to create a good, cheap technical solution to the problem. Arunachalam Muruganantham wanted to ease the lives of poor women and girls. But I did not want to. And that is butterfly economics. You are loving, inventive, gentle.
