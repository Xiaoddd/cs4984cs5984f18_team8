For that reason, they should be entitled to information collected by TigerSwan about Tilsen, they argued. Nodland is seeking information pertinent to Tilsen's arrest. Prosecutors have argued in court that the process is very dangerous. He is scheduled for trial alongside Daniel Tseleie. Grosinger resisted Tilsen's motion, saying that Nodland was overstating the relationship between private security and local law enforcement. In a written brief, he argued that Dakota Access was a victim in the case and gets certain rights and privileges. Private security's role would have been limited to the initial report and incident, according to Grosinger, who added that speculation about the relationship between law enforcement and DAPL was without merit. If Grosinger is unable to retrieve reports from TigerSwan, the defense can subpoena it, Schmalenberger said. The judge also asked the prosecutor to track down more potential witnesses and further video from law enforcement trainings regarding cutting protesters from equipment.
