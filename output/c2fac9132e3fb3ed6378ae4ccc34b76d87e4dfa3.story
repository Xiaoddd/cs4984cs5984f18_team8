Grijalva visited Oceti Sakowin on September 22, 2016 to lend show his solidarity to the water protectors. Previously, he served as editor of the Native News Network. He is a resident of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Of course I am. The tribal council are to accept this Executive Order and negotiate it. Dave Archambault has been acting beyond the scope of his official duty and has place the Tribe in harms way. He has lost the confidence and respect of the very governmental agencies he has to work with. He has become a rogue public self-seeking individual who finds himself unfruitful. You live in ND. You have never been to the protest camp. This truly is stubbornness and total entitlement behavior that the big oil mongers are portraying toward people that are protecting good drinking water for not only them selves but for everyone. What is wrong with these oil mongers. Who does the oil pipeline help when the oil starts to leak into good drinking water. Enid Lessne 2 years ago Ladies and Gentlemen, I have just emailed the following message to both of My State Senators and My District Congressman. I suggest you do so as well. Tomorrow I will be placing a call to the SCOTUS (1 202 479 3211) in Washington, D. C. to request that they deliver a warning to the State of North Dakota as to overstepping their authority in regards to the laws governing Native American Indians, Native American Lands as well as Native American Treaties- all of which are on record in Our Constitution already, but not being upheld. It is the job of Our SCOTUS to uphold Our Constitution. Senators and Congressman, Congressmen Grijalva & Huffman have written a letter to POTUS Obama asking to meet with him and discuss the DAPL situation in North Dakota. I am writing to urge you to call the two Congressmen and join them at that meeting. Thank you for your time and assistance in this matter.
