Over 160 eminent domain lawsuits have been filed. Citizens' properties are being seized to complete this project. Most of the people that live closest to the pipeline are not even aware that it is being installed. Natural Gas would be transported on commuter trains and the entire system will consist of staging areas, compressor stations and areas to process and export the natural gas. One of the latter is close to a nuclear power plant. This puts lives in danger. The human impact cannot even be estimated at this time and could occur from mistakes such as work hazards, derailments and possible explosions. Our team of artists would be applying an activist art strategy created by Aviva Rahmani to leverage copyright and eminent domain law. We don't have much time, perhaps weeks as Sabal Trail under Spectra and other parent Big Oil and Gas companies have already broken ground in three states: Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The pipes are being installed rapidly and in multiple locations throughout the three states right now. This pipeline is expected to be operational by May of 2017. It is important to note that this pipeline has been APPROVED. There is no more asking nicely from elected representatives. Voting harder or wiser will not change what is happening now. We need to move forward in an attempt to save our future. We all want the same things for our families. We want to leave the beauty of this region even better for the next generations. Please consider giving. Give generously if you can. If you can't, every little bit helps. This is for our future. Those coming after us will be grateful. Our brothers and sisters who have had their properties seized will appreciate anything you can give towards this effort. We probably won't have a second chance to get this right. Thank you.
