The pressure on US Bank to end its relationship with oil and gas pipeline companies has been mounting over the last five months. Late last year, dozens of groups sent the bank a letter, demanding an end to its financing of Energy Transfer Partners (ETP). Instead, US Bank doubled down and joined a massive new credit facility for ETP. Despite the national attention generated by Standing Rock during the Dakota Access fight, ETP is still finding money to build new pipeline projects around the country, including the Bayou Bridge, Mariner East 2, and Rover Pipelines. And at the Annual Shareholder Meeting, these resistance leaders came to tell their stories. Outside the meeting, activists rallied at the Hyatt Regency Albuquerque, led by local Indigenous leaders and others from across the state fighting fracking in the Greater Chaco Region. Business press covering the US Bank meeting attended the rally as well, and wrote about it later that day. Following the meeting, US Bank refused to comment to media, then posted a recording of the Annual Meeting excluding the Q&A section. Neither is resistance to the banks and financiers raising money for companies building oil and gas pipelines that are a threat to sovereignty, water, air, land, and the climate.
