Indigenous people and environmentalists in the Southwest have been speaking out against such projects for much of the last two years. But in recent months, their efforts have been re-energized by the protests in North Dakota. About 25 attendees at Friday's meeting were young people who'd made the trek south from the Dakota Access pipeline protests to engage and stage demonstrations in Window Rock. The November meetings concerned the amendment of a Resource Management Plan for the region, which sets guidelines for how the Bureau of Land Management allows public lands to be used. The current plan was passed in 2003, before modern fracking technology was being widely used in the area. As a result, the current RMP does not account for the dangers such techniques might pose. This lapse has allowed the BLM to approve permits for more than 360 new oil wells on and around indigenous land, according to the Sierra Club. Many Navajo and other concerned residents want the plan changed so it recognizes for these new threats. Both battles stem from indigenous people's objections to oil interests that endanger natural resources on or near their lands. Both started as local confrontations that gestated for more than a year before outsiders started paying attention. And both were responses to brief oil booms in their respective states. The cost of this development has been steep for local people. Oil development in the area over the last century has created a methane gas hotspot so intense it is visible from outer space via spectrometer, according to the Denver Post. Meanwhile, many archaeological and paleontological sites in the region remain protected from the drilling. But considering what a rich site of indigenous history the Greater Chaco area has proven to be, it's unclear what's being lost to obscurity as developers lay waste to the landscape. In July, 36 oil tanks caught fire near the small Navajo town of Nageezi, New Mexico, forcing 55 people to evacuate their homes while the blaze raged for three days. It doesn't end there. The next battlefront in this conflict could very well be the region's own version of the Dakota Access pipeline. But according to Eisenfeld and Goodman, Navajo community members and other environmental advocates have succeeded in delaying the project pending the completion of an environmental impact statement, which may take up to two years. The 2003 Resource Management Plan amendment process is still ongoing. There's a lot more courage now here, and a lot more speaking out. That's what we need. All rights reserved.
