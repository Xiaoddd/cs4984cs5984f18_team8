Although I have largely been skeptical of the mainstream media for most of my life, I never fathomed that it could be as inaccurate as it has been when it comes to reporting on topics surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline. On Sunday night, November 21, millions around the world watched live online as police from all over the country attempted to freeze water protectors in Cannon Ball. Live feeds from independent journalists and private citizens documented law enforcement spraying individuals with water, tear gas, percussion grenades and rubber bullets in below freezing weather. The use of water as a weapon on unarmed people in freezing weather can only be described as a form of torture. It is likely that one water protector will forced to have a limb amputated after police threw the percussion grenades into the crowd. Sadly, the documented evidence from the night in question shows the opposite. Individuals were drenched with water in what can only be described as an attempt by law enforcement to inflict harm on private citizens. After the law enforcement finally ran out of ammunition the people would go and use the newly created ice slopes to sled on. Our people have always been resilient in the face of oppression. As someone who has worked in the media for a number of years it is disturbing that certain North Dakota based news agencies have become little more than the P.R. branch of the Morton County Sheriff's office. Despite the presence of overwhelming evidence that police are initiating and escalating conflicts with water protectors, the North Dakota media still prints the quotes of dishonest state officials without question.

The efforts by the non-Native media to push forth the state's bogus GearUp narrative is a perfect example. Some people in this business would prefer to be in the good graces of those in power instead of actually working to put forth objective facts. In fifty years the world will look back in what has taken place in Cannon Ball and it will understand why our people fought the corporations over water. In fifty years those who have not understood just how sacred and necessary this element is will begin to feel the pinch of a limited water supply. We only wish that they would reach this understanding before it is too late.
