Early trials of the drug, currently listed as a schedule 1 substance by the Drug Enforcement Administration along with heroin and LSD, have shown encouraging results for patients with treatment-resistant PTSD. If the trials go well, MDMA could be legalized as soon as 2021, providing a novel way to treat those battling with PTSD, a debilitating mental condition that can be caused by witnessing or experiencing a life-threatening event. PTSD is common among military veterans, victims of sexual abuse and refugees with symptoms including anxiety attacks, body shakes, nightmares and insomnia.

Maps has funded a total of six phase two studies of the drug, in which 136 patients have undergone MDMA-assisted therapy. Phase three trials require bigger groups of patients, at least 230 people, across different countries. Maps submitted data from its phase two trials along with plans for phase three to the FDA a month ago. On 29 November, the FDA gave the final phase of trials the go-ahead, subject to further clarification on a few technical details, including how to ensure double blinding with a drug whose effects are so dramatic. The recruitment of patients is scheduled to start in June 2017. This is where we needed to be. I am one of the lucky few that got this amazing treatment. Once phase three trials are completed, and provided the results still look positive, the data can be submitted to the FDA for approval. In theory this means MDMA would be legalized for therapeutic use by 2021. The design of the trials means that the drug could only be administered by a trained psychotherapist in licensed centers. He is swift to distinguish between the trial MDMA and the club drug ecstasy or molly. The drug, particularly when taken in a clubbing environment, can lead to overheating and organ failure.
