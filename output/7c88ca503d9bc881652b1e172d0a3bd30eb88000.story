Though the environmental impact study is good news for water protectors, the fight to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline is far from over. Kennedy, a staunch environmentalist, serves as president of the Waterkeeper Alliance and chief prosecuting attorney for Hudson Riverkeeper. The people, the tribes on site understand that.

Despite the uphill battle, Kennedy said there are reasons for optimism in the fight against big oil. The same thing is now happening to batteries. The rationale for liquid fuel is evaporating the same way that the rationale for coal-burning power plants. The three biggest coal companies in our country, Arch, Consol and Peabody, have all lost 95 percent of their value in two years. The markets have already realized that carbon is dead. The meteor has hit. The pipeline is also linked to threatened water quality and quantity around the world due to climate change. The last time the globe was six degrees hotter than it is today, there were crocodiles at the north pole. And if that happens the civilization on most of the planet is going to collapse. You are going to see billions and billions of environmental refugees, and we are already beginning to see the beginning of that concept. While the climate continues to warm, the predictions for climate change made by scientists with the intergovernmental panel on climate change have consistently proven to be too conservative.
