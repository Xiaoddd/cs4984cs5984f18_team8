There are few bold-faced names here; not all of these people are Sierra Club members. Rather, we've sought to highlight a few of the unsung heroes who embody the ethos that social change begins with people power. They're the sort of people who come home from a long day of work, put dinner on the table and put the kids to bed, and then begin the difficult job of defending the environment. It's not especially glamorous work: crafting outreach emails, enlisting allies, organizing neighbors. But that's how change is made, and it's everyday people who make it happen. You don't have to be a superman. We couldn't agree more. McBride has worked as a photographer and filmmaker for National Geographic since 1998 and has traveled to 80 countries on assignment for it and other magazines and organizations. He uses captivating imagery and prose to relate the often-untold stories about why water conservation and public land matter. She was one of the 135 people exposed. It happened just nine months after the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, released more than 40 tons of methyl isocyanate (MIC), killing 3,800 people and injuring another 200,000. Nixon became a spokesperson for People Concerned About MIC, fighting for pollution controls and safeguards for the largely African American community in Institute. Although at one point she became ill with an autoimmune disorder, Nixon has continued to work tirelessly on air and water contamination issues in a variety of public roles, fighting for environmental justice across West Virginia. An oil well owned by AllenCo had recently been drilled two blocks from her school in South Central Los Angeles, and she wasn't the only kid suffering. She responded by going door to door, holding meetings, and rallying her neighbors to join People Not Pozos (People Not Oil Wells). The organization worked with the EPA to get the operation shut down in 2013. In fact, it's a butterfly species (Callophrys viridis) that is increasingly rare in the area. In 2006, some were found barely hanging on in a chain of parks and open spaces. Enter Amber Hasselbring and her Nature in the City project, which worked with local residents, schoolchildren, and others to transform city streets into connective corridors. Then the BP oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico happened. She was a founding contributor to BridgetheGulfProject.org, which shares stories of people affected by social and environmental justice issues, including the spill. She walked from Louisiana to Washington, D.C., where she delivered to EPA administrator Lisa Jackson letters from those who had suffered from the disaster. Before it, she worked at 350.org, first as a youth and student coordinator for the 2014 People's Climate March and later organizing campus fossil fuel divestment activists in the Southwest and primary voters in New Hampshire. Already, its members have pressed Senator Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) for stronger action against Trump and staged a candlelight vigil at the White House. By 1992, she'd decided she wanted to become an Outings leader herself. Since then, Goodwater has led more than 135 trips. She's taken groups through the Rockies, the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, and Alaska. She's also traversed England's Coast to Coast Walk, climbed Mt. Goodwater even switched from a full-time job as an electrical engineer to consulting so she could devote more time to leading trips. Now that she's retired, she makes up to 12 excursions a year. After serving in the navy, Brown suffered from PTSD and crippling depression. His nonprofit, Soul River Inc., housed in the back of the shop, organizes fly-fishing trips that pair urban kids with veterans. The vets get a chance to mentor teens; the teens get to build their confidence through increased self-reliance. Everyone gets an education in climate change. Among them was Shailene Woodley, star of the sci-fi series Divergent and the film Snowden. Like any good millennial, Woodley makes use of Instagram; she rallies her followers to launch local divestment movements against pipeline-supporting banks. She lived near the largest coal plant in Minnesota and worried about its health and environmental effects on her rural community. So she became a Beyond Coal volunteer leader and spent the next four years organizing meetings, writing letters, and spearheading petitions. At times, Thelen was the only one in her community willing to publicly oppose the plant, a major job provider. Last October, the state utility agreed to retire two coal-burning units and committed to doubling its output of renewable energy. In her day job, Thelen travels the world to help develop protections for victims of domestic abuse. By summer, thousands of self-described water protectors had gathered at the Sacred Stone Camp. We had Mongolians. We had Aborigines from Australia. The water protectors' courage in the face of police violence, including the use of water cannons and attack dogs, galvanized supporters. Although the Trump White House has approved the pipeline, Brave Bull Allard says the spirit of Standing Rock has become contagious. Sign up for daily updates from Sierra magazine.
