Powell said personally she hoped the outcome at Standing Rock would include a victory for tribal members and their allies, and on one level it has. The United States Army Corps of Engineers decided Dec. 4 to block, for now, the building of an oil pipeline near the reservation. The researchers saw banners, T-shirts, posters and flags along the fence line that runs beside Highway 1806. They were displayed by different Native nation groups and other visitors, including NGOs, veterans and schools groups in an act of support for the water protectors. These are the big questions that inform this research project. Powell returned again over Thanksgiving for additional research. Beginning in February 2016, members of the local Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and ultimately thousands of Native American and non-Native supporters set up camps along the Cannonball and Missouri Rivers, about an hour south of Bismarck, North Dakota, in protest over the proposed DAPL.

She was granted her second University Research Council (URC) award last year, to continue her research around environmental justice, indigenous territories, energy infrastructure and public debates on technology in the Navajo Nation. She had planned to return to Navajo territory in fall 2016, for preparatory work to help launch a new project there, following on her coal plant research. Also in the works was a proposal to collaborate with a Maori colleague in New Zealand around water rights, electricity and Maori territory. Normally, cultural anthropology research projects take long-term planning and preparation, including a fair amount of paperwork for institutional review board approvals. In each of her fall anthropology courses, Powell brought the issues at Standing Rock into the classroom for discussion on how issues of culture, technology and power impact local communities. In her course Native America through Ethnography, she taught the course from the field for one class meeting, talking with students via Skype from the Oceti Sakowin camp. In this course and her other upper-level course, Anthropology of Environmental Justice, she assigned readings related to the Standing Rock issue and was able to integrate it as a case study into class discussions, drawing upon both of her fieldwork trips to North Dakota. Standing Rock will also inform her spring course titled Political Ecology and Sustainability. Silhouetted tipis at Oceti Sakowin.

Draper is 25 years old, a non-traditional student with five years of experience as a social activist, working on water-related crises and extractive industry impacts. The Greensboro native worked in the Appalachia region, mostly concerned with issues around fossil fuels, before coming to the university. She had planned to study mapping through the Department of Geography and Planning, but after taking a class in cultural anthropology with Dr. Tim Smith, she changed her major to anthropology with a social practice and sustainability concentration. Draper also had contacts of her own there on the ground, enabling her to reach other networks of social practice and critique. Their research methodology was to observe, as activist researchers and ethnographers, by embedding themselves with water protectors and by conducting interviews and audio and visual recordings where permitted. They were interested in talking with people who had reasons for being there that may not have been so widely articulated, she said. The media were everywhere, according to Draper. We are trying to unsettle, swerve or push past the prepared statements. We recognize and hear those talking points, particularly from people used to being interviewed for immediate publication. But this is a very diverse set of water protectors, some of whom are very skilled at messaging, at interfacing with the media and delivering curated responses. We are trying to ask different questions, to tap into oral histories, memories, meanings and related struggles. Draper said this experience was different from other protests in which she has participated. Although she knew some of the allies at the site, and had been with them in other actions, her role this time was two-fold. I would argue, with others, that we can do better scholarship because of this kind of engagement, becoming better contributors to our field than if we were pursuing these kinds of social problems, without that depth of experience and investment. Our critical theory is enhanced by this deep level of commitment. Draper, who said she conducted about 10 interviews while at the encampment, concurred. I came back to school after working for five years in Appalachia around issues of coal mining and the economic impact in local communities. Preparing wood for the winter.

Photo by Dr. Dana Powell This is not a party Draper described the campgrounds as a huge, complex community: communal kitchens, food storage, medical care. As an ethnographer and a scholar, that interests me. I want to talk to that person. But as an active collaborator, it hurts, because it displays a real lack of historical, cultural and political understanding. This is not a party. When Powell returned to the campsite for five days over the Thanksgiving holiday, the number of people on the ground had more than doubled, from 4,000 to nearly 9,000, and the situation had intensified dramatically, following the events of Nov. 20, when law enforcement deployed water cannons, rubber bullets and concussion grenades on activists at the front line. Conducting interviews had grown increasingly difficult, Powell said. People were busy and the cold weather and wind were taking a toll. The three interviews she was able to arrange took place in her rental car with the heater running. But because of the intensity, Powell said she had a much deeper level of participant observation. We are organizing solidarity actions and community events to support the struggle for clean water and indigenous sovereignty, while building power in our home to resist harmful extractive industry and systems of power that maintain environmental and cultural degradation.
