The purpose of this fundraiser is to send me to Standing Rock Reservation to report on the ongoing protests against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. My intention is twofold -- both to truthfully report on what is happening there and to stand in solidarity with those who are protecting our water from the greed of the fossil fuel industry. WHY I'M ASKING FOR HELP As a poor & independent writer, I do not have access to the funds that I would need to accomplish this task alone. That is why I am asking for my community & for society-at-large to provide the resources necessary -- food, equipment, & travel-expenses -- to reach North Dakota, to report, to interview, & to bear witness, and finally, to return. In exchange, I can promise to try my best to film, photograph, & write truthfully about all that I see there. In sharp contrast to what the major media corporations are doing, I can promise to report truthfully & with integrity, with the purpose of informing the people of my country & of the world. If enough of you want to send me to report on these demonstrations, then I know that we can accomplish it together. Thank you for your time & please consider contributing to this fundraiser.
