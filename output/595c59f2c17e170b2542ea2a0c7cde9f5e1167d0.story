Police say 18 men and two juvenile men were arrested. The operation was designed to attract people looking for sexual activity illegally online. The men were a wide range of ages, some in their 20s and others, in their late 50s. They're also from different states, some North Dakotans and others from Texas, Louisiana and Nevada. So far, no formal charges have been filed. Police say the paperwork isn't finished and no charges have been filed. The North Dakota National Guard says the man works part-time, but is still employed. The Guard will wait for the legal process before making any personnel decisions.
