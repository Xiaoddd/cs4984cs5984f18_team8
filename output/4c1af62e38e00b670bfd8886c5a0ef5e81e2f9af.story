The treaty was signed two years after Custer was sent in to kill all the Cheyenne and Dakota Sioux, so the U.S. could steal their lands. Custer failed, so the U.S. begrudgingly signed the Treaty. Treaty law is one of the supreme laws of the land, second only to constitutional law. Treaties are signed agreements made by two or more parties. Legally, signed agreements cannot be changed without the written consent of all parties. Unfortunately, the U.S. has never been very keen on following their own laws, especially where Indians are concerned. In fact, the first U.S. Supreme Court decision regarding the tribes was in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution. In that decision, the SCOTUS used religious law, specifically the Roman Catholic Rules of Conquest under the Christian Law of Nations to justify the taking of Indian lands (see Doctrine of Discovery). So, it should be no surprise that they have summarily violated all treaties with the Indigenous nations of this land. The U.S. breached the Treaty of Ft. You get to watch as history repeats itself. The question is whether you will watch quietly or if you will stand up and do something about it. On December 5th, the U.S. is going to honor their long tradition of stealing Indian lands and killing Indian people, by celebrating their most beloved Indian killer Col. George Armstrong Custer on his birthday. They will do so by attacking Indian people on lands that the U.S. has taken illegally, using illegal amounts of force, to protect the interests of an oil company that is attempting to poison the drinking water of the Tribe. The term for this is ecological genocide, and it is being carried out through industrial and environmental terrorism at the hands of a U.S. corporation, and with the full backing of the U.S. government and police forces in violation of the U.S. Constitution and Treaty Law.

This is something everyone should do. Enid Lessne 2 years ago Ms. Mitchell, Thank you for all the information you provided in your post. I have already written to Our POTUS, both of My State Senators, My District Congressman, Senator Sanders, Governor Dalrymple, and Senator Heitkamp. I have also donated money to the NODAPL fund. Today, I received a reply from one of My State Senators. It is my intention to come to The Oceti Sakowin campsite, on The Standing Rock Reservation on December 4th. I am working on the logistics now. I am trying to find out how to get back and forth from the campsite each day. Least we forget the injustices to any human being or group we are as much to blame personally for those injustices. I firmly believe that the heinous crimes brought to bear on the TRUE NATIVE AMERICANS has been and remains intolerable. So, with that firm belief in place, it is my fervent resolve to stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with ALL THE SOVEREIGN NATIVE AMERICAN NATIONS of The United States of America. Sincerely, Enid Lessne, R. N., B. S. N TribalMember and Proud of it. 2 years ago Just a note of CAUTION. As I had stated of a very dear Asian friend of mine, her child was born on September 11th of this year. A date that brings many mournful thoughts to ALL AMERICANS living in this country. Yet, her birth on this same date, shows A SIGN OF HOPE. Thank you for being WISE in the listening of this message. Enid Lessne 2 years ago Ms. Mitchell, Thank you for all the information you provided in your editorial. Although I am not of Native American Indian descent, my people have lived with generations of discrimination. From my personal standpoint that mantra applies to every person in this World and not just my fellow Hebrews. Help support Native News Online by clicking on our sponsors' advertisements.
