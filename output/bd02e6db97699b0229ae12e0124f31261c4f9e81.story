There is a human rights crisis developing at Standing Rock in North Dakota, and we do not have time to call it anything else. One woman is facing possible amputation after her arm was ripped apart by a concussion grenade. Independent journalists and peaceful protectors have been shot with rubber bullets, tasered, maced, sustained broken bones, and, while in police custody, strip-searched and left hooded while zip-tied like war criminals. North Dakota public officials have never apologized for their tactics during the raid. Using state powers to violently suppress nonviolent dissent is a human rights violation. Four UN members have already condemned these abuses. North Dakota should not have the right to unleash real physical violence on unarmed people, simply to protect a billion-dollar corporate project. This is about stopping a human rights crisis in our own backyard. Please join us in demanding President Obama take whatever steps are necessary to remove Dakota Access Pipeline equipment and employees from Standing Rock, and stop the human rights abuses being perpetrated by law enforcement in Standing Rock.
