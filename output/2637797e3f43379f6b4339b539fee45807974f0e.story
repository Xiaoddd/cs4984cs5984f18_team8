The investigation stems from an hour-long demonstration against the Dakota Access oil pipeline that led to a 4-mile freeway backup after protesters stopped traffic just south of the Lakeway Drive exit on Feb. 11. Protesters block northbound Interstate 5 at Lakeway Drive on Saturday, Feb. 11, in Bellingham. The Washington State Patrol said the blockade led to a five-car rollover crash that injured one person.
