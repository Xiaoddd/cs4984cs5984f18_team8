Our Tribe is deeply disappointed in this decision by the United States, but our resolve to protect our water is stronger than ever. We ask that all everyone who can appeal to President Obama and the Army Corps of Engineers to consider the future of our people and rescind all permits and deny the easement to cross the Missouri River just north of our Reservation and straight through our treaty lands. When Dakota Access Pipeline chose this route, they did not consider our strong opposition. Our concerns were clearly articulated directly to them in a meeting on Sept. 30, 2014. We have released that audio recording from our council meeting where DAPL and the ND Public Service Commission came to us with this route. We ask that the United States stop the pipeline and move it outside our treaty lands. Although the news is saddening, it is not at all surprising given the last 500 years of the treatment of our people. Learn more about the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe at standwithstandingrock.net.
