And the extreme violence from the authorities seems to be deteriorating by the day. There is growing outrage and condemnation as more and more first-hand accounts and footage emerge of water cannons, rubber bullets, tear gas and even stun grenades being used against some 400 water protectors on Sunday night and early yesterday morning. Some 300 people were hurt after being hit by either water, gas, grenade or rubber bullet. An estimated 27 needed hospital treatment. Reports from legal observers suggest that several people were unconscious having been hit by rubber bullets. There were so many casualties that the local school gymnasium had to be opened for emergency relief. There are graphic photos online of serious injuries incurred by the protectors. If you want to see the extent of some injuries go here, but the images are distressing. In freezing temperatures, police fired cold water to prevent the protectors removing blockades on the Backwater Bridge on Highway 1806, near the camps they have been occupying for months. In response, activists lit fires to try and keep their soaking companions warm. This seems to have further inflamed tensions. They commit atrocities anywhere on the planet. Bill says: November 22, 2016 at 10:28 am You have stopped the pipeline for the time-being. So stay the fuck back. You deserved everything that happened to you. You are not peacefully protesting. You must think these officers want to be there away from their families. These officers actually feared for their lives. Carol Roberts says: November 22, 2016 at 1:19 pm I thought peaceful protest was a right. This is sickening. Bonnie says: November 22, 2016 at 3:33 pm LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. Recall anyone and everyone using any sort of weapons or intimidation against the Native Americans protesting against the proposed route of the pipeline and order the pipeline rerouted to a less damaging location. Sorry, this is a primitive and agressive reaction. This is absurd, in a country that dares to lecture others on human rights issues. Kj roane says: November 22, 2016 at 8:05 pm Stop this madness. Your methods expose those faced by the Indians led by Gandhi against the British explotaition of Indian labour and Indian products. The greed and corruption that covet Indian nations resources, lands and spiritually significant sites is a reflect on the ills of your nation. The injustice is exposed by the methods used to kill protest and objection and thus exhonerates the water protectors. More people will come and join and fight against injustice through JUST means. M says: November 22, 2016 at 9:49 pm I was shocked to find out how much of mutual funds contained pipeline investments. mixed with almost all investment packages. These seem to be funded by the banks. That is where the pressure is.We are all to be blamed. The financial system,companies investors etc.We are all part of the problem. Michelle Gosselin says: November 22, 2016 at 10:05 pm Hey w is our Government allowing Such atrocities. Croz says: November 22, 2016 at 11:09 pm Corporate paid-for hired thugs in uniform. These, are the terrorists you have been fearing America. Terry Barber says: November 22, 2016 at 11:23 pm Clearly the sheriff and Governor Dahlrumple are in the pocket of the corporations. This is an outrage reminiscent of treatment indigenous people received in the 1800s. It must stop. NOW. Blessings, grace and goodness to the Protectors. Om. Tom Hilgartner says: November 23, 2016 at 2:24 am Shameful malfeasance perpetrated by dishonorable militarized police. No excuses. You are lying moron. If they are forced to stand down they know they will lose the moral right to continue with their pollution of our planet. The protestors are fighting for all of us. Our water around the world is under siege. Standing Rock is a symbol of a much bigger fight we will all be facing if they do not succeed. Sianie Howells says: November 23, 2016 at 8:07 am Other than posting posts on my facebook feel over whelmed with a sense of powerlessness. May I suggest arming yourselves with camcorders or recording mobile phones so the authorities know they will be caught. I know how helpless some of us feel and how unaware some folks are of the violence being done to water protectors.Do I am making people more aware.Bless you all and try to stay safe. The whole time this effect Event was going on, they were sneaking in large drill equipment on the hill nearby preparing to drill. And these are not normal police. People almost died. Lives have changed forever. They did nothing wrong. The injuries inflicted are like war wounds. Which means they have a will have a huge class Acton lawsuit against them. This was genocide. Right here, on our soil. Maria eastburn says: November 23, 2016 at 10:34 am We need to stand with The Indigenous people to protect them and our earth. Stop abusing them, and we need to stop taking everything from them. The indigenous people only wants to live and raise the family like everyone else. Since Europeans came to America the Native Americans been suffering so much abuse. Brother Bigfoot says: November 23, 2016 at 10:44 am Brothers and sisters, Color of law is being used to trespass and cause harm. If they do not stop, fill out a form and serve it to the in front of witnessess. If they do not stop, file a color of law suit. The legal system operates under fiction if law and is just a ruse. Maxim- He who slumbers on his rights has none.The creator gave us unalienable rights. GO LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF PIPES THAT HAVE FAILED AS OPPOSED TO THE NUMBER THAT HAVNT FAILED YET. AND THEY ARE LINED W RADIOACTIVE PAINT . GET INFORMED. (edited comment) Melissa Hanson says: November 23, 2016 at 11:31 am The young woman who was injured may very well lose her arm, these are war injuries. Scrabo says: November 23, 2016 at 12:17 pm Bill is a policeman, or have money in the oil business, or just dont know about history and the mechanism of capitalism and control. There is no justification for the methods being used and for the blatant disregard DAPL has shown for the Native Americans and their rights. Veronica Mauvis says: November 23, 2016 at 1:06 pm Obama looks like Nero fiddling whist this terrible situation carries on. Obviously he has no leadership qualities. Ebba Malmqvist says: November 23, 2016 at 1:25 pm This is utterly outrageous of the police department. Even more so when the victims are peaceful water protectors from the indigenous population. I hope the police will get prosecuted. Wendy Hollis says: November 23, 2016 at 2:03 pm This Thanksgiving, Native American rights are once again being disregarded. Please sign this petition to support them and our environment. We need people as far as they can see. Deena McClain says: November 23, 2016 at 3:11 pm All of us should be supporting this. Protect their right to life and clean drinking water. We are many and they are few. They cannot stand against us all. Kristina Hedman says: November 23, 2016 at 3:46 pm This is not the America we thought existed. This is the beginning of a fashiststate. When police standing safety behind barbwire misuse nonleathal wepons so that they are lethal. I am trained in using that stuff and what I see in the films scare me a lot. Do they have so little respect for human life. Barb says: November 23, 2016 at 5:26 pm Keep this water safe. No Pipeline. Take a look at the water in Flint, Mi. Now take a look at all the schools that are finding lead in the drinking water. The Rich get Richer and the poor get poorer. Clean water for all. Catalina Garzon says: November 23, 2016 at 7:23 pm While families are preparing to celebrate Thanksgiving, Native Americans are being fired with tear-gas, rubber bullets, and water cannons in freezing temperatures. The irony is strong with this one. The water protectors at Standing Rock need our support now more than ever. It makes a difference. The water source is 11 miles away from the pipelines planned river crossing, and at the end of the year, said water source is actually being relocated to Mobridge, approx 50 miles further away. It was initial violence against the workers, and token security staff ( on private land ) by protesters, that sparked off the escalation in force; While i dont agree with the continuing violence, what do you expect when you have misinformed, or purely ignorant, zealots clashing with armed security staff.One side needs to back down, and its not going to be the side with billions invested, and legal approval to build a pipeline which benefits the nations economy and wont be effecting the tribal areas water supply. While ive paraphrased a lot of that info for simplicity sake, its all public information that anyone can access. Margaret says: November 23, 2016 at 8:34 pm I think a lawyer should look into if the police actions fit the criteria for crimes against mankind. TJ says: November 23, 2016 at 8:34 pm People claiming these people are peaceful should let me throw rocks and use sling shots on them so they can see how peaceful that is. All you idiots complaining about water should turn in your cars and stop using any type of oil. Judy Merritt says: November 23, 2016 at 9:21 pm 300 of 400 water protectors were treated for injuries. That is serious aggression. The images of the violence that Sunday night have shaken me to the core. The military police have changed their strategy. Up until Sunday, they were arresting a lot of people. Now they are hurting them. Yet the good people who believe the lies that are being fed to the media have no idea that this type of violence can happen just as easily to any one of them. Obama neglecting to stand up for Native American rights at this moment is a lousy president, imagine the license that will give Trump. caroline white says: November 23, 2016 at 10:36 pm whistleblowers, and movies after movies have shown us over and over how deceitful and how BIG this is. we watch as though it is just entertainment. as we can see, the blatant lies being told out of our law enforcements mouths. they have sold their souls. BIG MONEY. so big, we cant even imagine. everyone needs to listen to the native elders. they are wise to guide and steer the people to do all of this with love and prayers and blessings. we must choose GOOD. I live in California and sometimes I can hardly breathe because of the pollution in the air. Oil is a bad investment and their stock should be decreasing since oil is not an acceptable alternative. The banks that are supporting this destruction of the earth should be stopped. Hit him in the wallet and they will listen. We must all do our part and take our money to credit unions so they will stop funding these projects. Thank you to all the water protectors and those who care my heart is with you. Sharon Greenlaw says: November 24, 2016 at 5:56 am Today, I visit the Bank, I will be making an appointment to review at whatever the cost, my investments in mutual funds. I will be moving my investments to renewable energy, education, and inovation. Bob white says: November 24, 2016 at 5:55 pm Quit whining and go back to your work. Paul d says: November 24, 2016 at 6:51 pm You would not be hit with rubber bullets or sprayed with water if you would go home and stop breaking the law when told to disperse. Some people never learn. Jennifer Buntz says: November 24, 2016 at 9:18 pm It is all just in time for the Thanksgiving celebration here in America. Joshua Hinkle says: November 24, 2016 at 10:46 pm Veterans from all over the country are currently mobilizing to protect the Water Proectors. Jennifer says: November 24, 2016 at 11:35 pm I really have no comment, everything was covered by the excellent posts I just read. Edwina Hodkinson says: November 25, 2016 at 3:46 am Across the pond in the UK we are horrified at this war on Native people and the atrocities being committed at standing rock. Has your government stooped so low as to allow this to happen. But then again it has committed genocide against Native people once before. So appalled.. Carol McKinley says: November 25, 2016 at 10:35 am This article is Excellent and informative. It is all very horrific. Breaking the media silence for sure. Keep on draining the money from Dakota Access Pipeline. Manna Heimer says: November 25, 2016 at 12:18 pm Vote with your money, think for yourself, do what you can and stand together. The only threat the government or you are allowed to hang over these people is the threat of arrest and prosecution. If there are sling shots or rocks, let the arrests begin in mass and in earnest. Jimminy Cricket says: November 26, 2016 at 1:45 am American People will be withdrawing all money in any bank funding this pipeline. People in Norway are fucking angry now. We work for redrawing norwegian investments out of this bad snake. (Meaning treator of its own people and mother country). (edited comment) Benjamin Franklin says: November 28, 2016 at 6:02 am None of these articles mention the hired police are specifically targeting the women and younger protesters in order to enrage the men, just in hopes that the situation escalates to live ammunition. (edited comment) Dan says: November 29, 2016 at 10:21 pm I am native. Your water protectors have been taken over by white hippies. They must be vanquished from the camps and the natives must stand up and carry the fight. ALL anti-American traitors and they should all be treated as such. This is not a peaceful protest. The Standing Rock people have asked the out of state rioters to leave. They have brought this to a riot. The people of the area have been threatened to the point that they send their children to live elsewhere, farm animals have been shot with arrows and guns. Latest count over 100. They chased buffalo until some died from exhaustion, they use sling shots to shoot rocks and anything thry find at law enforcement. They build baracades on the highways so emergency vehicles and any others can not go through. When asked to move it they start it on fire. One place is on a bridge where all this you write about happens. They burned tires cars and military vehicles on that bridge making it dangerous to use. ThE barbwire is to keep the from going to construction equipment so they can drain fuel onto the ground and burn the equipment. Yea water protectors. They have come to town and protested by grade schools scaring small children. This will forever scar the children. They poured oil on our capital building. So until you have been here and witnessed this you have no voice. Sad they have hurt the relations between Standing Rock and North Dakota people for years to come. Many of the protesters, other than some of the Natives including the elders, have not been peaceful at all. Most of us locals, including the Natives, just want all the protesters to leave so we can handle this in a civil manner. This article is beyond ridiculous. mary says: March 7, 2017 at 11:55 am you people are mad,after you lie to each other enough you seem to believe it. Basically we like ours,so take care of your trash.Give the state the money to fix the bridge you burned. Then charge less then any coming off the rez,just to pay you back for the money you have cost. I have native blood,it wasnt and isnt the good fight. There are jobs all over here,decent jobs. With employers that mostly dont care wtf you are. You make out like we are this poor people. I am ashamed that any of my people go along with this bovine scatology Cancel reply Your email address will not be published. Design by Diligent.
