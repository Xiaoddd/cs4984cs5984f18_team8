This information may help you figure out how best to be of service at this time as well as respectful and educated allies. THIS IS NOT A FESTIVAL. Unfortunately there has been some festival & alternative non indigenous people already at Standing Rock who have not respected the ways of the indigenous people and have been perceived as colonial and disrespectful. The situation at Standing Rock is not a stable one. The recent clash between Protectors and authorities on Sunday 20th November was highly militant and violent toward Protectors, who were unarmed & prayerful. Be aware that things could change here in the camps any day. An eviction notice with the date of Dec 5th has now been issued by the Army Corps - the camp has decided to stay regardless, and the outcome is unknown. You are fully liable for your own safety at all times and need to be prepared if things escalate. You are not generally at risk of arrest unless you are on the front lines - but there is no guarantee that things will remain this way. If you wish to engage on the front lines, please make sure you attend Action Meetings and follow tribal leadership at all times. All actions are peaceful, prayerful & non-violent. You are taking a risk by coming to Standing Rock, this is a serious battle for indigenous rights & the terrain is constantly changing. Be vigilant, and prepared. Be safe. If you have a skill to offer, are willing to work & volunteer daily, can bring resources, or are willing to be arrested - then you have a purpose here. This is not a place to come for a couple of days so you can say you went to Standing Rock. This is not a place to come unless you genuinely have something to offer, in service to this indigenous movement. Please check in to the volunteer tent, and attend the 9am daily meetings for newcomers, so you can receive proper orientation and information about how to be in camp. Do not bring any alcohol or drugs whatsoever. This is clean camp and you are expected to respect that protocol. Absolutely no weapons or firearms in camp. You need to bring EVERYTHING you need so you are not a burden on the camp - your own food or food to contribute to the kitchens, your own winter structure, your own warm clothes, your own bedding, firewood, and everything else you might need. Please do not come if you cannot be self sustainable here, it taxes the movement rather than supports it. Bring alternative energy sources. Leave knowing you gave more than you received. Make sure you speak to your neighbours before setting up camp, to ensure you are welcome & in a suitable camp location. BE PREPARED FOR WINTER CONDITIONS & SNOW - that means winter structures, heating, firewood, winter clothes & shoes, winter bedding. You are on indigenous land, and are expected to respect indigenous leadership. Respect the elders, and indigenous camp leadership at all times. Do not come in a colonial way, with your preconceived plans of what you think will be a better solution to anything and impose those ideas. Come in humility and service, offering help, skills & resources - and look at how you can plug into the winterization projects already underway. Do not impose your ideas in any way, instead look to offer support in any way you can and you will be well received. There are also winterization meetings daily, keep an eye out at the Sacred Fire for notices on what times these are. Educate yourself about cultural protocols, and how to behave accordingly. Educate yourself on what cultural appropriation is and ensure you do not exercise such behaviour. Educate yourself on decolonization, and decolonize yourself before you come. There are many fundraisers not directly benefiting the indigenous people at Standing Rock. You may be more effective in supporting from afar by raising funds, or joining actions locally. Respect. Compassion. Honesty. Generosity. Humility. Wisdom. For more information about Oceti Sakowin Camp please go HERE.
