Photo by Indigenous Rising Media Chairman Dave Archambault II of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe thanks Indian Country and other allies for supporting efforts to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline from crossing its treaty territory in North Dakota: This is an historic moment. Our treaties and our human rights were ignored, our interests in protecting lands and waters were considered unimportant, and our voices were not heard. It was this shared history that led tribes to come together as never before to seek the protection of our waters against the threat of the Dakota Access Pipeline. With peace and prayer, indigenous people from hundreds of tribes said: our future is too important. We can no longer be ignored. The goal was to protect these sacred waters, and to do so in the name of our children.
