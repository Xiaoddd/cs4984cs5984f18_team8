But a recent financial move by actor and activist Adrian Grenier stands out as public protests of well-known U.S. banks boom over issues like unethical business practices and lending to the oil pipeline project planned for Native American land Standing Rock. Where you keep your checking account can matter, and a growing citizen awareness of that power means values-based institutions like Beneficial State Bank have more appeal than ever. Grenier noted how Beneficial State Bank has been a consistent lender to clean energy projects. Worldwide, the Global Alliance for Banking on Values says that focusing financial instruments toward planet-friendly projects is helping these banks take a lead over their bigger competitors on Wall Street. Between 2003 and 2013, even with the economic downturn that hurt the banking industry in 2008, values-based banking institutions showed annual growth rates in loans, deposits, assets and total income that were higher than their for-profit counterparts. Kat Taylor, co-CEO and co-founder of Beneficial State Bank alongside her husband, Tom Steyer, says she sees even more growth for community banking institutions in 2017. That would mean a greater number of players looking to change the game of finances for the better. Taylor recently wrote an op-ed for the San Francisco Business Times about the impacts for-profit banks have had on issues beyond environmental sustainability. And C-suite executives take home fat profits while one-third of bank tellers rely on some form of public assistance. The Equity Factor is made possible with the support of the Surdna Foundation.
