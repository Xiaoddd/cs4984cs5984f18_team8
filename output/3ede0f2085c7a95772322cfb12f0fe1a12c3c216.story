You'll receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities. The reviews have been unanimous. More than 1.4 million CREDO activists have joined you in signing our petition urging the Senate to reject DeVos, an extreme right-wing bigot who has no relevant experience as an educator and did not attend or send her children to public school. The pushback from CREDO members has been amazing and has played a role in slowing down her confirmation process. But, our resistance is not done. We have to do everything we can to keep the U.S. Department of Education out of her unqualified hands. She also has an appalling record on civil rights, which indicates she will be a threat to LGBTQ children, especially transgender students, who face prejudice, harassment and bullying in schools and suffer from higher rates of depression and suicide than non-LGBTQ classmates. Her confirmation hearing was an unmitigated disaster that showed even more clearly how unqualified she is to run the Department of Education. Equal access to high-quality education is one of the cornerstone promises of our democracy. Putting Betsy DeVos at the helm of the Department of Education puts the promise itself at risk. Democrats must do everything they can to defend the Department of Education, starting with standing united against DeVos. Thanks for everything you do.
