All rights reserved. A second, above-ground spill occurred on March 5 in Mercer County, North Dakota - a leak of half a barrel, or 20 gallons (75 litres), due to a manufacturing defect. The contaminated soil was reportedly cleaned up before doing any damage to the surrounding environment. A third, known leak occurred on April 4 in South Dakota, where two barrels (84 gallons) spilled at a pump station. The North Dakota Environmental Health Chief, Dave Glatt, told the Associated Press that all spills are listed on their online database, but they don't usually notify the public unless the leaks involve at least 150 barrels (6,300 gallons or 23,848 litres), or the oil has made its way into the waterways. One of them occurred in Billings County, just 2.5 hours away from where the Standing Rock protest took place, when a December 2016 spill leaked 529,830 gallons of crude oil (12,615 barrels or 2,005,624 litres) into Ash Coulee Creek and the surrounding countryside, due to a fault in the Belle Fourche Pipeline. Especially concerning for locals was the fact that the company that owns the leaky pipeline, Belle Fourche Pipeline Co., didn't even realise it was happening until a member of the public stumbled on the leak and notified them about it. But the fact that the Dakota Access leaks have so far been small will be cold comfort for concerned locals, who say it's only a matter of time before a bigger, and more environmentally damaging incident occurs. Several tribes in North and South Dakota, including the Cheyenne River, Standing Rock, Yankton, and Oglala Sioux, are currently fighting the Dakota Access Pipeline in federal court. 5 days ago Politics & Society Semi-Automatic Rifles Really Are More Deadly, New Study Clearly Shows Numbers don't lie. 6 days ago Politics & Society To Save Ourselves It's Time to Rethink Our Economic System, Warn Scientists The market is killing the planet. 3 hours ago PHYSICS Single Hydrogen Atoms Could Form Eerie 'Ghost Bonds' With Nothing, New Study Shows It shouldn't be possible. 15 hours ago SPACE SpaceX Has Announced The First Tourist to Go to The Moon - And Take Other People With Him Such a wild project. 15 hours ago NATURE Potentially Deadly Threats Are Now Lurking in Post-Hurricane Flood Waters Hurricane Florence isn't over yet.
