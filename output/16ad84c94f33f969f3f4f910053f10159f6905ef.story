Because our work has had a big impact, supporters of Big Oil are afraid of what we can do as our movement keeps growing. This is why they are attacking us now, trying to undercut, discredit, and divide our movement any way they can, including spreading lies. These attacks are being led by Allen Rice under two organization names: Defend Iowa and I Am Netizen. Here is what you can do: Little Creek Camp is asking us to like their facebook page and to show our support for their work in Iowa. You can also donate to help fund Little Creek Camp here or send a check to the camp: PO Box 1693, Iowa City, IA, 52243. As Nobiss states in this short video by Fusion, the camp welcomes both indigenous people and settler-descendants to come to join in learning, community building, and love. Through this way of life we hope to create a mindset that nurtures progressive thought and action that will bring change to Iowa. Beyond the continued fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline in Iowa, we are a think tank dedicated to action for social and environmental justice. This camp is a hub for all organizations and individuals in Iowa that want to resist the new administration, modify this system of governance and encourage a new economy; an economy for the people that is built on renewables and a sustainable way of life. We will not stand for these attacks and will not let lies destroy our movement.
