Dec 5, 2016 The sun sets over bluffs on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, one of the reservations Lakota Country Times serves. Currently, Ecoffey is the editor of Lakota Country Times located in Martin, South Dakota, right in the heart of Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. I grew up on a reservation. I went to Dartmouth College. When I was at Dartmouth, I was a government and Native American studies major with a minor in political theory. I kind of had the notion that I was going to head to law school and do the whole federal Indian law stuff. I came home to do economic development work. What ending happening is that I ended up being caught up in a federal drug case. I actually spent 42 months in federal prison on a drug charge. After that happened, I came home and I came across an opportunity. I knew I had a certain set of skills based off my college education. As I was thumbing through the paper I saw a job announcement for a staff writer position at Native Sun News under Tim Giago and what happened was I brought in a writing sample and Mr. Giago knew who my family was, knew my connections to the reservation, just kind of knew my history, and seeing that I had some writing skills, just gave me an opportunity. My work picked up a lot of followers locally. And for me, my good times to work are from 4 a.m. to 10 a.m. Working with people you know and covering news about people you know comes with the blessings but it also comes with the hardships of having to expose certain things about people you may know personally or be on the other end of a political idea or a political view or policy. And a lot of times that can impact your personal relationships with people that you knew prior to doing this work. It made it look like we call the local high school the Pine Ridge Pigs. We had to write a retraction. The school board and the chamber of commerce writing us letters and what happened (when we published the piece) was I had just switched over from using a desktop and I actually was editing from my iPad and I had never used Apple technology before. That actually happened this fall. I guess providing a Lakota perspective on certain incidents that get a lot of coverage by the non-native press is a success story. There was a hazing incident on the reservation where a tribal police officer, non-citizen, hazed a guy like 20-some times. I liked doing that. Part of what got my name out there was getting in touch with LastRealIndians.com. So, I think if you can reach out to people who are looking for content, the blogs, anyone really. You get a lot of people who go into journalism because they want to make a name for themselves, or they go into it because they like the attention that comes with the headline-grabbing stories. Ecoffey spoke honestly and passionately about covering Native American issues in modern media. He showed the incredible juxtaposition of minimizing harm and seeking truth. Ecoffey obviously finds that rewarding. What mattered the most to me from the entire interview was that he said journalists need to come from a position of compassion and respect. They are interdependent values in the journalism world. This interview has been edited and condensed. Give Abby Petersen a round of applause. From a quick cheer to a standing ovation, clap to show how much you enjoyed this story. 1 BlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Abby Petersen Reconcile.
