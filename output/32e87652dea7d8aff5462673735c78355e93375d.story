The lands of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sit a half mile south of the proposed route of the Dakota Access pipeline. The tribe fears the line could destroy sacred sites during construction and that a future oil spill might pollute its drinking water. Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II told Reuters the tribe was aware of the safety record of Energy Transfer, but declined to elaborate. Sunoco Logistics is one of the largest pipeline operators in the United States. Sunoco acknowledged the data and told Reuters it had taken measures to reduce its spill rate. This significantly cut the amount of barrels lost during incidents, he said. It highlighted the need for reform in the way companies building infrastructure consult with Native American tribes. HIGH SPILL RATE Reuters analyzed data that companies are obliged to disclose to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) when they suffer spills and found that Sunoco leaked crude from onshore pipelines at least 203 times over the last six years. PHMSA data became more detailed in 2010. In its examination, Reuters tallied leaks in the past six years along dedicated onshore crude oil lines and excluded systems that carry natural gas and refined products. The Sunoco data include two of its pipeline units, the West Texas Gulf and Mid-Valley Pipeline. That made it the operator with the highest number of crude leak incidents, ahead of at least 190 recorded by Enterprise Products Partners (EPD.N) and 167 by Plains All American Pipeline (PAA.N), according to the spill data reported to PHMSA, which is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Enterprise said it has comprehensive safety and integrity programs in place and that many spills happened at its terminals. Sunoco and Enterprise both said most leaks take place within company facilities and are therefore contained. Plains All American did not respond to a request for comment. Slideshow (5 Images) To be sure, most pipeline spills are small and pipelines are widely seen as a safer way to move fuel than alternatives such as rail. Sunoco said it found that crude lines not in constant use were a significant source of leaks, so it had shut or repaired some of those arteries. While total pipeline incidents have increased by 31 percent in the last five years, large spills of 500 barrels or more are down by 32 percent over the same time, the report said. Sunoco accounted for about 8 percent of the more than 2,600 reported liquids pipeline leaks in the past six years in the United States. SAFETY OVERHAUL The company has made previous efforts to improve safety, a former Sunoco employee who declined to be identified said. It overhauled safety culture after a spill in 2000, and did so again another in 2005 that dumped some 6,000 barrels of crude into the Kentucky River from its Mid-Valley Pipeline. Sunoco acknowledged that some of its pipeline equipment dates back to the 1950s. In September, Sunoco received another corrective measure for its newly constructed Permian Express II line in Texas, which leaked 800 barrels of oil earlier this month.
