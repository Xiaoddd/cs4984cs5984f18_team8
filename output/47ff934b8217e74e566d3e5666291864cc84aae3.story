From start to finish, it was simply beautiful. And, in a classic blame the victim stance that appears to come out of an Alex Jones playbook, Trump seemed to accuse his opponents of initiating anti-Semitic incidents in order to defame and disparage him. It's not a straight simple question. 'Anti-Semitism has wound its way into mainstream conversations in a manner that many Jews who lived through Nazi Germany find terrifying,' he said at a meeting at the Knesset, which was convened to discuss the plight of American Jewry under the incoming Trump administration. No. But you have some of the signs and some of that anger caused by the other side. They'll do signs and drawing that are inappropriate. It won't be my people. Trump's theorizing about his opponents coincides with a meme that David Duke, former Ku Klux Klan imperial wizard has been circulating. Trump's shabby treatment of Turx also followed on the heels of a woefully inept White House statement about Holocaust Remembrance Day, which left out any mention of Jews or anti-Semitism. Perhaps most frightening and difficult to explain is Team Trump's desire to eliminate neo-Nazis and white supremacists from the US government's counter-extremism program by moving it to focus exclusively on Islamist terrorism.
