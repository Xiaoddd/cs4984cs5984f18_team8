Rosa added the company is working with the energy regulator to ensure all environmental and safety rules are followed. There were no reports of injuries or damage to the site, Rosa said. An earthquake with a magnitude of 4.8 hit the Fox Creek area Tuesday morning, prompting the closure of a fracking operation. (The Tyee ) The energy regulator automatically shuts down a fracking site when an earthquake hits a magnitude of 4.0 or higher in the area in which a company is operating. He estimates in the last six months there have been hundreds of quakes in the area ranging in magnitude from 2.0 to 3.0. But it is not considered a risky area with a such low population, said Gu, who added that Fox Creek and the surrounding region is carefully monitored by the energy regulator. Still, Gu said, there were two fairly large quakes in the area in January 2015, one of which had a magnitude of 4.4. Could be largest quake in Canada If it is revealed that fracking induced Tuesday's 4.8 quake, Gu said, it would be the largest such quake in Canada's history. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said her officials are looking into Tuesday's quake. Area resident Jesse Christensen was in Fox Creek at the time of the quake. Pseudonyms will no longer be permitted.
