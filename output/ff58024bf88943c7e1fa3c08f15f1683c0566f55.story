One condition of the 404 nationwide permit is that if even one water crossing in a project is ineligible for the permit, it cannot be used for any of them. Another condition in the permit is that MVP cannot take more than 72 hours to complete construction across a stream or river. The request for stay was filed by Appalachian Mountain Advocates on behalf of a coalition made up of the Sierra Club, Appalachian Voices, Indian Creek Watershed Association, West Virginia Rivers Coalition and Chesapeake Climate Action Network. The fracked gas Mountain Valley Pipeline is already having devastating effects on our water and communities, and all construction on it must be immediately stopped. In reality, the environmental impacts of this unneeded and unnecessary fracked-gas pipeline were felt almost immediately after construction began. In addition to helping people from all backgrounds explore nature and our outdoor heritage, the Sierra Club works to promote clean energy, safeguard the health of our communities, protect wildlife, and preserve our remaining wild places through grassroots activism, public education, lobbying, and legal action.
