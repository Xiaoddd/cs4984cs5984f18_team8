Since the founding of the camps last April, this has been an indigenous-led movement rooted in ceremony and dedicated absolutely to nonviolent civil disobedience. No weapons, alcohol, or drugs are permitted at camp or at direct actions. One water protector, Vanessa Dundon, was blinded following a police attack using a tear gas canister; another, Sophia Wilansky, is still undergoing surgeries to attempt to regain use of her arm after being hit by a concussion grenade in November. A recent video shows a Bureau of Indian Affairs agent apparently beating an unarmed water protector with a baton. And yet, as it has since its inception, Standing Rock will stand in ceremony. In the last few days, water protectors have documented an increased law enforcement presence, including security checkpoints and the continued presence of Morton County police, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Army Corps of Engineers agents, and the recent arrival of agents of the National Parks Service and the FBI. In the final 48 hours before the deadline, women water protectors released a video highlighting their commitment to fighting the pipeline in the face of potential arrests and police brutality. For months she has run a traditional Lakota kitchen at the camp now known as Oceti Oyate and has vowed to remain, even as some of her crew willingly evacuate. Today, Ojibwe water protector Tania Aubid is on her 22nd day of a hunger strike in resistance to the pipeline. While some at camp have moved to uncontested land, for many, today is the last stand. Yesterday camp leaders met with representatives from the Army Corps of Engineers to discuss an evacuation plan. A heated dome that served as a camp landmark and community space was dismantled; volunteers used an ice pick to break down frozen piles of donations, to gather and redistribute them to those in other reservations and communities. The request for an extension to remain and complete cleanup was denied. Water protectors also asked that the Army Corps provide guarantees that those who voluntarily evacuate today will not face recrimination, and that those who choose to remain behind and peacefully occupy the land will not be met with violence. For the world, the struggle at Standing Rock marked an unprecedented gathering of nations united in the pursuit of a common goal. For the embattled United States of America, it has become the galvanization the country needed; it offered a model of sustained, morally rooted civil disobedience for resistance. For an indigenous-led movement, it reopened centuries-old wounds, of colonialism, warfare, religious and cultural oppression, racism, and abuse, largely at the hands of the federal government. But in doing so it has also deepened the conviction and radical bravery of a people who are fundamentally and spiritually connected to the water and the earth. A violent reaction by law enforcement today could quickly tarnish that and return America to a place of deep, unpardonable shame. All rights reserved.
