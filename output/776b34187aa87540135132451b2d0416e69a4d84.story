Then your muscles start to cramp. Contreras, of Aliso Viejo, is the former wellness coordinator for the OCFA. First, you need to stay hydrated. And, you need to take cooling-off periods. Contreras said he expects the firefighters to be working 12-hours on, 12-hours off shifts. They carry canteens, so they can stop for water. The crews were being aided by 10 helicopters and five air tankers. Victor Caballero, who lives in the Laguna Estates community in north Lake Elsinore, said his bags were packed and he was ready for evacuation. We have our pictures and passports in boxes. Mamak Shakib and her husband, an Irvine couple, lost their nearly 100-year-old cabin in the fire. But they are thankful for what they have. Nestled in the natural setting of Holy Jim Canyon, the cabin let the couple escape for a few days from their urban life in Irvine to a mountain retreat. He included a video of their cabin, smoldering and burned to the ground. Although it was a shock, Shakib, who is a chiropractor, said she is not sad about the loss: Memories of time spent at the place console her. View this post on Instagram When the Holy Jim Fire broke out today, an elderly couple became stranded on the mountain and could not go back down due to the fire. The couple had to hike quickly away from the fire and entered an area in the canyon without cell reception. Duke 6 was sent for the search and rescue of the couple before they were overrun by the fire. Fortunately, the Duke 6 aircrew located the couple and hoisted them off the mountain. If the couple was not rescued, the results could have been tragic. After the rescue, Duke 6 returned to drop water on the fire. Subscribe here.
