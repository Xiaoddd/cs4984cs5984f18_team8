I just attended a conference in Big Sky, Montana with fellow Water Protector, Amanda Dumeingo, where we were plenary speakers on the community building that took place at Standing Rock. Of course, donors were mentioned as a critical component of anything we were able to do and WOPILA again to all for your gifts. We will continue to update on the use of this historical structure. A film has been screening at Tribeca Films in New York tonight... here is the link. You have all been apart of this Movement. Also, on Monday... our historic tipis will be put up at the St Francis Indian School to kick off Earth Week 2017. A slide show will also be shown. Thank you all... Wopila and will be in touch soon. With the March on Washington having culminated yesterday, we at Stand for Standing Rock are starting to slow down gracefully. I personally did not attend the marches as I have been assisting campers moving from ND to other parts of the United States. The camping infrastructure we managed to save has continued to house and help Water Protectors in their transitions. We have also been assisting with safe storage for some friends who were with us on the ground to the end. Donations have been turned off earlier this week, and monies have been sent to help others until the very end of the fund's opening. We are now repairing and storing canvases to protect from mold. These may go to fight and water war in the future, so treatment is necessary. With people coming and going still, I haven't been able to do any creative projects yet. I have many things in the works and will keep this page open for a while, as you have all been apart of a living documentation of an indigenized view of how we lived, protected, survived, endured, and celebrated at the Movement at Standing Rock. (The photos are fun selfies with friends made. Of all he camps, it has been acknowledged that great efforts are being made to restore and preserve the land. That being said, I have a crew that needs to come join me on my reservation for a short time to recuperate and determine their next plans. One includes a family of 6, and 2 single young men who were the heads of security to the very end at our camps. The last camp vehicle is being transported today. (Grandmother Earth ) Wopila Tanka for you all. The donor tipi is home right now and will be the first one treated and preserved. It will be spread out on dry grass soon and all of our donors names will be documented inside and out. Please try again.
