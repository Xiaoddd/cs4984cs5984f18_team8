Public Safety Federal judge orders environmental review of Dakota Access pipeline Heavy equipment is seen at a site where sections of the Dakota Access pipeline are buried in North Dakota in October. David Debold, an attorney for Dakota Access, and Daryl Owen, a lobbyist representing Energy Transfer Partners, did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. Four Sioux tribes in the Dakotas have asked the court to shut down oil-pumping operations. The pipeline has been the focus of legal maneuvering and protests for months. Authorities reported 761 arrests resulting from protests before the pipeline began commercial operations June 1. Opponents, who say the pipeline endangers their water supplies, said leaks began even earlier. Tribal leaders say their environmental concerns have grown more urgent now that the pipeline is operational. In late 2016, President Barack Obama ordered the Army Corps of Engineers, which controls the river and lake, to ask Energy Transfer Partners, the pipeline company, to submit environmental impact statements on alternative routes. But Trump on Jan. 24 ordered the engineers to speedily issue the final easement the company needed to finish construction in the national interest. On Feb. 8, the Army said it no longer needed an environmental-impact statement and issued the easement. Comments The story must be told. Your subscription supports journalism that matters.
