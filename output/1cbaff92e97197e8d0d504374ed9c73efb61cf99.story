May 14, 2017 Format: Hardcover Verified Purchase An interesting introduction to thinking about enslavement of American Indian people from the beginnings of colonization. His analysis does fail entirely to go into the ways that sexual violence was a major part of this--he makes clear that women were more highly valued on slave markets, but just erases the reasons for that, which mirrors the continual erasure of the amount of sexual violence that Native women experience to this day. This massive gap in his analysis really needs to be addressed, and the fact that it is not in this book is really a problem. Nevertheless, undoubtedly this book will open doors for more historians to examine this phenomenon, and to begin to make connections intellectually between American Indian enslavement and African enslavement on the North American continent, making both avenues of thought more productive.

Gardiner 5.0 out of 5 stars Indian Slaves in the American West June 24, 2017 Format: Paperback Verified Purchase I reviewed this book in the journal New Oxford Review in June 2017 and give it a very high rating. Most of the book is about the enslavement of Native Americans in Latin and Central America and in the Indies, but there is a very important section about the enslavement of Native Americans in the United States in the 19th century especially in New Mexico, California, and Oregon. That is what my review is focused on. Moreover, the same law stated that a white man could not be convicted on the word of an Indian, and that an Indian could not appeal from the decision of a justice of the peace.

James 5.0 out of 5 stars Everyone in America should read this book February 2, 2018 Format: Kindle Edition Verified Purchase This is an excellent book about Indian slavery of which I knew nothing. Well researched and expertly written so that it holds your attention like the best murder mystery - which I guess it kinda is although not much of the mystery to it. Man's inhumanity to man. We haven't changed much down through the centuries. Just turn on the news any evening and there it is. I should think people would have jumped on this now, with all this new knowledge, and demanded change. This is a book everyone in America should read - because as we see today, the history we don't know is the history we repeat. The situation was much the same among the American judges of New Mexico. absolute terms, such figures may not sound like much, but the percentage was extremely high for the Navajo nation. For the present-day United States as a whole, it would be as if the population of California, Texas, or New York and New England combined were suddenly sold off into slavery. Glad it was written. Something that needs to be taught in the school ciriculum at all levels.
