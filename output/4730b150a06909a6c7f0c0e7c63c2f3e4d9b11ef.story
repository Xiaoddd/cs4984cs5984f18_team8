Steve Martinez, 42, a pipeline protester from Williston, N.D., has been ordered to testify regarding the arm injury of Sophia Wilansky, 21, of New York, according to his attorney, Ralph Hurvitz. Protesters maintain she was injured by a grenade thrown by police, but authorities say she was hurt by a small propane tank that protesters rigged to explode. Hurvitz's request was denied Wednesday in a closed hearing. U.S. Atty. He declined to say what his role was in the clash that occurred late Nov. 20 and early Nov. 21, when protesters tried to push past a long-blocked bridge on a state highway near the protesters' main encampment along the pipeline route in southern North Dakota. They were turned back by authorities using tear gas, rubber bullets and water sprays. Police said protesters were throwing objects including rocks, asphalt and water bottles at officers. One officer was hit in the head. About 40 protesters rallied outside the courthouse in support of Martinez, and court officials locked the courthouse doors. Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners disputes that and says the pipeline will be safe.
