(Climate Direct Action) March 21, 2018 FORT BENTON, Mont. Last November, Higgins was charged with criminal mischief and misdemeanor criminal trespass and faced up to a decade in prison. Speaking Monday before his sentencing, Higgins remained steadfast that it will take every kind of effort to stop climate change. Together with four other activists in Minnesota, North Dakota and Washington state, Higgins helped shut down 15 percent of the United States' oil imports for about a day. Lauren Regan, Higgins' attorney and executive director of the Civil Liberties Defense Center, commended the court for recognizing Higgins' action as a conscientious act of civil disobedience. She said it's also a win for free speech. Higgins said he's encouraged by the increasing number of people he sees who are compelled to act. While most of the others have not received jail time, North Dakota valve turner Michael Foster was sentenced to three years in prison in February.
