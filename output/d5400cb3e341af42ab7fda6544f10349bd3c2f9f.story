TRANSCRIPT AMY GOODMAN: You recently gave a speech in Washington around the Dakota Access pipeline. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Yeah. They had a pow wow. They met the children. It was quite amazing. So, he knows the Standing Rock tribe in North Dakota. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: I trust that most people here know about the Dakota Access pipeline. And I think your description of the situation is correct. So those are the three issues there. I think what we have done is, number one, demanded that the president do what he did with Keystone. A lot of people put a lot of pressure on the president, and he finally did the right thing. And that is to kill the Keystone pipeline, which, by the way, under a Trump may be reopened again. But that is what he should be doing. And certainly, the demand must go to the North Dakota authorities that the kind of military presence that exists there is simply not what is acceptable. So, we have written to the president. We are going to continue to put pressure on the president to do everything he can to protect the Native Americans in the area and the protesters in the area.
