Officials from Sunoco Logistics, which owns the busted pipeline, say oil was sighted in the Ohio River Monday evening and the situation was being evaluated. The company has planned a press conference for Tuesday at 1:00 p.m. in Carrollton. The pipeline reopened Monday, less than a week after a leak sent 63,000 gallons of crude oil into the Kentucky River. Company officials say they are working with local water treatment facilities to ensure drinking water remains safe. It still was not clear what caused the underground pipeline to rupture January 26th. The pipeline carries up to 195,000 barrels of crude oil daily from the Gulf Coast to refineries in northwest Ohio.
