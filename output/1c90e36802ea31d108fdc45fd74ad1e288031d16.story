The State Department said it had found the project, which was blocked by former US President Barack Obama, to be in the US national interest. The 1,180 mile (1,900km) pipeline will carry tar sands oil from Canada to refineries on the Texas coast. pipeline. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recused himself from the matter because of his previous role as chief executive of ExxonMobil. The permit was signed by an undersecretary of state for political affairs, career diplomat Tom Shannon.

For several years Mr Obama remained conflicted over the project, torn between opting for dirty-but-secure Canadian oil over cleaner-but-vulnerable Middle Eastern sources. In November 2015, global warming gave Mr Obama a way out of the dilemma. Mr Obama scrapped XL, and it helped persuade the world to sign the Paris Climate Agreement. But the new administration has made clear that jobs and infrastructure top climate change as priorities. In January President Trump asked the State Department to re-assess the project and they found that the economic argument made sense. However, completing the pipeline is not a foregone conclusion. The low price of oil makes XL (which stands for 'export limited' and not 'extra large') extremely expensive, while land rights and environmental objections may delay it for years. TransCanada still needs approval of the pipeline's route through the US state of Nebraska. Mr Trump offered to call the governor of the state later today. An evaluation by the US state department was required, because the pipeline crosses an international border.

During the presidential election, Mr Trump embraced the idea that the pipeline would create American jobs. He also signed a memorandum requiring Keystone to be built using American steel. However, the White House later said this requirement would only apply to future applications, not projects already being built, such as Keystone. A mandate to use US steel would not only have been more expensive for TransCanada, but could have led to US authorities being sued by the World Trade Organization. The company said that roughly half the steel would come from US manufacturers. Environmental groups criticised the decision, saying the potential damage from a spill is not worth any profit. The project is expected to carry more than 800,000 barrels of heavy crude per day from Canada's Alberta province to the Gulf of Mexico. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.
