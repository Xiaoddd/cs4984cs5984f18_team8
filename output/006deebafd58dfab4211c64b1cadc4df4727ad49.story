But there are other potential costs, even if Ottawa succeeds in finding another company to take on the project. It was a key demand by the former B.C. provincial Liberal government as a condition of its agreement to the project. Article Continued Below Federal officials hope to find another private sector company quickly, one with a greater appetite for risk than Kinder Morgan, to take on the project. If that fails, Canadian taxpayers will be the proud owners of a pipeline. The Canadian government says the project would create 15,000 new jobs during construction, and 440 permanent jobs a year during operation. But a 2015 study done for Metro Vancouver and B.C. said the job prospects were overstated, and construction of the pipeline would produce only around 4,000 new positions in the province. The theory is that if more Canadian oil can be shipped to coastal ports, with the possibility of being sold directly to energy-hungry Asian markets, especially China, Canada would fetch a better price. Then there are royalties projected to result from the pipeline expansion, which will triple the capacity to ship heavy, light and refined petroleum products to Vancouver. According to a November 2016 report from Environment and Climate Change Canada, the total upstream greenhouse gas emissions of the expanded Trans Mountain pipeline would be between 21 megatonnes and 26 megatonnes per year. The expansion would increase the capacity of the pipeline to 890,000 barrels per day, up from 300,000 barrels. There is the risk of a spill along the pipeline route. There is also the risk of a tanker spill, once the oil has been delivered to port. B.C., in particular, is concerned about the possibility of a spill in coastal waters. It says the effects of a bitumen spill are not well known. Once the federal government takes ownership of the project, Canadian taxpayers will be on the hook to pay for the clean-ups of any spill. The project has sparked a nasty feud between Ottawa and Alberta on one side and B.C. on the other. More broadly, other provinces, notably Quebec, are closely watching the debate and its implications for federal involvement in such projects elsewhere in the country. This will be a challenge for the Liberal government. But other Indigenous groups remain opposed to the expansion and have vowed to keep up their protests to the project. Uncertain at this time. Ottawa has always insisted that, because the pipeline crosses provincial boundaries, the project falls squarely into federal jurisdiction. Government officials say it is much harder for the B.C. government to make laws against a federal Crown-owned project. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley comes out a winner. B.C. Premier John Horgan may also be on the winning side. Horgan, leader of a minority government, may ultimately fail in his attempts to block the pipeline expansion, but B.C. voters may still reward his determination. But the decision to take ownership of the project now puts the Liberals squarely on a collision course with their opponents and that could cost them in B.C. in the 2019 election.
