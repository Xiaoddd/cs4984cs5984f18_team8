Its significance to American culture past and future cannot be overstated. However, the amount of sediment transported has diminished as dams, levees, and channelization increased over time. Today, the river might be more accurately described as a gentle giant. Only in its upper reaches does the Missouri shed that image. There, even a slow-motion summer float through the Upper Missouri River Breaks National Monument can offer a back-to-the-wilderness sensation, where the 149-mile Wild and Scenic section of the river winds downstream from Fort Benton, Montana, to the Charlie Russell National Wildlife Refuge. Lewis and Clark spent three weeks in 1805 exploring the Wild and Scenic area now considered the premier component of the Lewis & Clark National Historic Trail. River runners can still camp at the same sites used by the explorers. Fishermen may encounter some rare native species in the area, including prehistoric-looking paddlefish or the endangered pallid sturgeon among some 150 species of fish within the entire Missouri River Basin. The basin also supports 300 species of birds and a variety of mammals including trophy elk, whitetails, and mule deer that support a significant seasonal hunting economy. Even the occasional wayward grizzly has been reported near Fort Benton. Several other threatened and endangered species are making a stand along the Missouri, although restoring fish and wildlife populations to historic levels will require flow modifications, protecting and restoring habitat, and adaptively managing the river system. The Backstory Major floods have always been a fact of life along the Missouri. For more than 75 years, Congress has directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to administer flood control, navigation, and irrigation on the Missouri by impounding, channelizing, and dredging the river. The resulting series of massive reservoirs on the upper river and the deep, narrow channel on the lower river has actually made flood damages worse, putting surrounding communities, wildlife, recreation, and river health in jeopardy. As flooding on the Missouri increases in frequency and severity with climate change, communities need better flood protection solutions. Levees and dams can no longer be the only line of defense. We need a smarter, more natural approach. The Future Sound science and public involvement are the keys to achieving smarter river management that safeguards communities and the environment. That begins with the recognition that levees, dredging, and impoundments actually increase the frequency and severity of floods. The preferred alternative is to try to reconnect the naturally broad, shallow river to its floodplain wherever possible. That means removing some levees, changing the timing of dam releases to mimic the historic river flow, and reinvigorating the riparian cottonwood forests that absorb water and provide the richest wildlife habitat on the Great Plains. In May 1673, the French explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette were the first Europeans to document their discovery of the river. In the height of the fur trade, steamboats traveled as far as Fort Benton, MT, a trade stop that became one of the biggest settlements between Minneapolis and Seattle during its heyday. A section of the Black Eagle Dam in Great Falls was dynamited to save nearby factories from inundation when the upstream Hauser Dam failed in 1908, causing catastrophic flooding for miles. The upper Missouri River system is the largest remaining stronghold for endangered pallid sturgeon, which weigh about 85 pounds and can live up to a century. Its lineage traces back 70 million years.
