But he said he didn't know enough about the pipeline to comment even though his administration has been closely involved in the controversial project for at least two years. The comments came after two young citizens of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe questioned whether Obama was living up to his promises to support Indian Country. They noted that the president came to their reservation in June 2014, a visit that both he and First Lady Michelle Obama have repeatedly cited as inspirational. Gracey Claymore, 19, shared similar concerns. She was among the group of young tribal members who met with the Obamas, who have frequently shared their experience from the trip with wide audiences. He cried with us and he told us how important we were to him. Claymore added. They staged one run to the Army Corps district office in Nebraska that's been handling the Dakota Access permitting process for two years and another to Washington, D.C.. The 2,000-mile journey to the nation's capital culminated with a series of actions. One was a march from the U.S. Capitol to the main Army Corps headquarters, where the youth's insistence on being heard led to a meeting inside with senior officials. It opened a lot of their hearts and they listened to us. But ReZpect Our Water was denied a meeting at the White House even after the Obamas had welcomed the Standing Rock youth to the Oval Office in November 2014.

Photo courtesy United Tribes News Less than three weeks later, the youth were back in D.C., and Woodley, Riley Keough, Susan Sarandon joined a huge rally at a federal courthouse, where the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe requested a preliminary injunction against the Army Corps in hopes of stopping the pipeline. A ruling is expected by Friday. Even though the tribe only named the Army Corps as the defendant in the lawsuit, the Obama administration has taken notice. A hearing on Tuesday regarding an emergency request for a temporary restraining order drew an appearance from Solicitor Hillary Tompkins of the Interior Department, which is otherwise not involved in the dispute. When administration officials attend hearings in other cases, they typically take places in a reserved row of seats behind the table where attorneys from the Department of Justice are seated. It's typically seen as a show of support for the federal government. But Tompkins and her colleagues instead took seats behind the table where the attorney representing the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe was seated. The courtroom was nearly full, though, and the row of seats behind the DOJ table was taken up by the large Dakota Access team so Tompkins most likely found the most convenient place to watch the proceeding. Appeals are expected no matter how Judge James E. Boasberg rules on the injunction. But even though the matter is under litigation, the Obama administration plays a major role in determining whether the Dakota Access Pipeline goes forward -- the Army Corps has yet to issue a key easement for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River.
