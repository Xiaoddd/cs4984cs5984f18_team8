Hundreds of demonstrators began rallying outside the Department of Justice, which Sen. Cory Booker has urged to investigate the police tactics used against protesters at the Standing Rock site in North Dakota, where the pipeline is being built. The marchers then followed a route that took them by the Trump International Hotel, the White House, and on to the National Mall, near the base of the Washington Monument. Keepseagle, who said the rally was organized in about two weeks, expressed surprise at the number of people who had turned out for the event. The controversial Dakota Access Pipeline would stretch 1,172 miles and carry crude oil through underground pipes on sacred Native American land. While Sunday was a clear day, the weather in DC was in the 40s. Many well-known activists gathered to help spread the message, from Dolores Huerta, prominent labor and civil rights leader, to Shailene Woodley, star of the Divergent series. Woodley was joined on stage at the rally by Ezra Miller, actor in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and Dave Matthews of the Dave Matthews Band. The rock group was set to perform a benefit concert for the cause at DAR Constitution Hall on Sunday evening. Lissandra Villa is a politics reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Washington, DC.
