Posted on Sep 21, 2016 Oct 3, 2016 In an amazing act of solidarity, over 1200 archaeologists, anthropologists, historians and museum directors sent a letter to President Obama, urging the White House administration to halt construction on the Dakota Access pipeline to prevent the destruction of cultural resources. The focus of the lawsuit is that the Army Corps took an illegally narrow view of its responsibilities to protect and engage the Tribe when it granted the permits. The lawsuit alleges that the Corps violated multiple federal statutes, including the Clean Water Act, National Historic Protection Act, and National Environmental Policy Act, when it issued the permits. These concerns were validated with the Sept 3rd bulldozing of burial sites by the Dakota Access pipeline company. We continue to ask for the Obama administration to revoke all permits granted under the authority of the US Army Corps of Engineers permit process titled Nationwide Permit 12. Furthermore we demand the Corps should exercise its discretion to order a full EIS be conducted on the entire project. In a new letter sent to the Obama administration, over 1,200 museum directors, archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians expressed solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in its fight against the Dakota Access pipeline. However, they have not yet committed to conduct a complete environmental impact statement, or that the Tribes would be adequately consulted. The letter has galvanized unprecedented from support from these communities, with hundreds signed on in just the first 24 hours. There are now 1,280 signatories. 50 of those are executive directors of museums and institutions of archaeology or anthropology, including Smithsonian, Field Museum, American Museum of Natural History, and others. While the majority of the signatures are from the United States, museum staff and scientists from around the world, including Australia, Guatemala, Italy, and Brazil have signed on. The letter was organized by The Natural History Museum, a mobile and pop-up museum that champions bold action on climate change. Since its release, eight institutions have responded by either divesting from fossil fuels, dropping a fossil fuel sponsor, or enacting new policies that refuse fossil fuel funding. In addition to sign-on letter initiated by The Natural History Museum, the American Anthropological Association and the Society for American Archaeology have both released strong statements of their own denouncing the Dakota Access pipeline. While the evictions took place the Kenya Forest Service was funded by international donors, including the World Bank, the European Union, and the Finnish government.
