Injuring or killing a road-obstructing pedestrian would also be free from criminal penalty if the driver struck the person unintentionally. Blocking roads or highways has also been a tactic adopted on occasion by protesters in other movements, such as Black Lives Matter. A spokeswoman for the pipeline protests said she is concerned the bill, if passed, would give careless drivers a free pass to kill or maim people who are exercising their free speech rights. The network is an activist group that opposes the pipeline, which would carry Bakken crude oil across the Missouri River just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Braun said she once was struck by a woman who objected to her video-recording a protest outside a fast-food restaurant in Mandan, and she worries the bill would embolden people to harm pipeline protesters. The proposal has attracted some national attention. Robert Reich, a former U.S. labor secretary and liberal commentator, has criticized the bill. House Bill 1203 was introduced last week and is set for a committee hearing Jan. 20. It also grants an exception for wearing a mask or covering based on religious beliefs. Braun wondered if wearing a scarf worn for protection against the cold would be prohibited. The bill allows an exception for a mask or hood worn for protection against the elements.
