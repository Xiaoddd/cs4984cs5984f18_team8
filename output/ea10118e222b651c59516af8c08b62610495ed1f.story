The Adorers of the Blood of Christ order has filed a complaint against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in a bid to keep the pipeline off their land. The Adorers, an order of 2,000 nuns across the world, have made protection of the environment central to their mission. Atlantic Sunrise pipeline It is an extension of the Transco pipeline, which runs more than 10,000 miles from from Texas to New York, and will carry gas extracted from the Marcellus shale region since fracking was permitted by the state. Williams, the company building the pipeline, wants to pay farm owners to allow it to dig up land, install the line, and return the land to farm use. It has offered compensation for lost crops and regular inspections to ascertain if the pipeline affects agricultural output. About 30 landowners who refused to do a deal with Williams now face being forced to comply by a FERC order. A section of the pipeline is planned to run underneath a strip of land owned by the Adorers in West Hempfield Township, Lancaster County, and leased to a local farmer. Earlier this month, the nuns dedicated a makeshift outdoor chapel at the site, consisting of some wooden benches and an arbour surrounded by corn, with 300 people in attendance. If the court rules against the nuns, Lancaster Against Pipelines, a local activist group, has pledged to mount a round-the-clock vigil at the chapel.
