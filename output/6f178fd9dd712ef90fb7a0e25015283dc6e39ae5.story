Trump just signed Executive Orders to move the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines forward. Donald Trump is already proving to be the dangerous threat to our climate we feared he would be. But, these pipelines are far from being a certainty. From the plains of Nebraska and North Dakota to the streets of New York to the halls of Congress, millions of Americans and hundreds of Tribes have stood up to block these dirty pipelines and their voices will not be silenced. We will continue to fight these dangerous projects. The Keystone XL pipeline was rejected because it was not in the country's interest, and the environmental review of the Dakota Access Pipeline was ordered because of the threats it poses to the Standing Rock Sioux. Nothing has changed. These pipelines were a bad idea then and they're a bad idea now. It would carry and emit the climate equivalent of 37.7 million cars' annual emissions each year -- a disaster for our climate. TransCanada, the foreign company behind the Keystone XL project, will attempt to use eminent domain to sue American landowners and seize their private property in order to pipe this dirty fuel across the U.S. for export. The 1,168-mile Dakota Access Pipeline could carry 450,000 barrels of fracked oil every day through four states. It would cut through communities, farms, sensitive natural areas, wildlife habitat, and tribal lands like the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's ancestral lands. It would also cross under the Missouri River just upstream of the Tribe's drinking water supply, where a spill would mean a serious threat to the Tribe's health, culture, and way of life.

Approving the Keystone XL pipeline means the American people will have to pay for the financial and environmental costs of a Canadian pipeline and that goes against our national interests. TransCanada, the foreign oil company behind the Keystone XL project, continues to bully American landowners with eminent domain to seize their private property in order to pipe this dirty fuel across the US. I call on you to stand with the American people, to stand strong against dirty trade deals, like the TPP, not with a foreign oil company. Similarly, the Dakota Access Pipeline tramples on the rights of Native Americans by putting corporate interests above Tribal treaty rights and clean water. The pipeline was originally proposed to cross the Missouri River just above Bismarck, ND, but after complaints, it was rerouted to cross the river along sacred Tribal grounds, less than a mile from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines encourage dirty, dangerous tar sands development, when clean energy is growing faster, producing more jobs, and has a real future. I call on you to support the growth of clean energy jobs and businesses, not dirty pipelines. The American people are counting on you to protect American landowners and Native American tribal interests from oil companies trying to steal and threaten their land by constructing dirty and dangerous pipelines through it. I call on you to protect our clean air and water by not permitting a tar sands superhighway that will endanger both and hasten the climate crisis. These pipelines are not in our national interest. I urge you to follow through on your promise to put people first. button click. The Sierra Club Seal is a registered copyright, service mark, and trademark of the Sierra Club.
