Let's take back our country and restore democracy. Feb 10, 2017 Divestment and Bank Exit: How We Fight Pipelines Everywhere Tim Canova, Chair, Progress For All With a radical Republican agenda threatening this nation on so many fronts, many of us are spread thin fighting back. On all these fronts, the Republicans could take us back years, even decades. It threatens the sustainability of life on Planet Earth. And nowhere is this more apparent than here in Florida. The Threats from Fracking and Pipelines The struggles of the Standing Rock Sioux against the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) has woken people everywhere to the threats to our water supplies. In the final weeks of the Obama administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) completed a five-year study in which it finally concluded that fracking contaminates drinking water. Unfortunately, the Obama administration approved a tremendous amount of fracking and pipelines during the past eight years, and now the Trump administration is making the situation worse by taking steps to green-light DAPL and the Keystone XL Pipeline. Militarized police forces may also be even less restrained in dealing with peaceful protesters. Florida is truly on the front lines on what could become an environmental disaster. Climate change is all too apparent here. Rising sea levels have resulted in saltwater intrusion into the Lower Floridan Aquifer that provides drinking water to all of South Florida. We also see flooding on the streets in Miami Beach and even further inland on cloudless days during our King tides, for instance. Projections are grim for even greater flooding of many more coastline neighborhoods throughout the entire state of Florida in the future. Florida residents recognize the dangers and are trying to respond. Unfortunately, our politicians are getting in the way. This was most impressive, given that the private energy and utility industry spent tens of millions of dollars against this solar initiative. But thanks to our grassroots movement and social media, we prevailed. Floridians are recognizing that solar and other renewable energy sources are creating more jobs now than fossil fuels. Unfortunately, the state legislature in Tallahassee has dragged its feet on providing any support for solar energy. All across the nation, we see dangerous pipelines threatening our drinking waters. Meanwhile, the studies show that if we put solar panels on half the acreage of the pipeline (515 miles by 50 meters wide), we would produce the same amount of energy that will be going through the pipeline, without any of the environmental dangers. However, this is also sinkhole country. Sinkholes are cavities that open up in the ground, often unpredictably, and are caused by water erosion. Some of you may recall that four years ago, a 37-year-old man, asleep in his bed was swallowed up by a giant sinkhole that opened below his house. His body was never recovered. In this part of Florida, it is not uncommon for sinkholes to appear out of nowhere. Perhaps this is not too surprising. teamed up some weeks ago to circulate a petition calling on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to stop the Sabal Trail Pipeline. We wondered why I had not heard a word from Senator Nelson, a Democrat who in opposing the Keystone XL Pipeline, expressed concern about the massive Ogallala Aquifer and the source of drinking water for millions of people in the Midwest. With our elected officials apparently unconcerned with the environmental threats posed by the Sabal Trail Pipeline, many of us have turned to protests and civil disobedience. Some weeks ago, I took part in such demonstrations at the pipeline construction sites along the Suwannee River and stayed at the nearby Sacred Water Camp. Some months ago, I threw my support behind the growing divestment movement, urging ordinary citizens to move their savings out of investments in these fossil fuel and pipeline companies, and to change their bank accounts from the banks that fund these pipelines. We have only months before the Sabal Trail Pipeline and many others are completed. But we also have a grassroots movement that was mobilized during the recent presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders and we have the power of social media. Progress For All has already begun to organize a divestment movement in Florida. In the coming days and weeks, we will intensify our efforts at the many colleges and universities here to divest their endowments from the pipeline companies and the banks that fund the Sabal Trail Pipeline, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and JP Morgan Chase. We hope to mobilize thousands of students and alumni of our universities to demand action. We also hope to follow the lead of Seattle by demanding our city and county governments to divest. Divestment may truly be the only effective tool we have left in this fight. And please remember, what happens in Florida is happening everywhere. Give Tim Canova a round of applause.
