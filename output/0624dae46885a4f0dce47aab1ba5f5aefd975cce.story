During his Presidency, last year President Obama and the Army Corps of Engineers stop the construction of the pipe line. Now 23 days into his presidency, Trump and his new administration have passed some controversial executive orders, but the one executive order that poses a real threat to human rights violation is the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Standing Rock Protest (Picture courtesy of Google Images) The Dakota Access Pipeline is a 1,172 mile long pipeline ranging 80 inches in diameter transferring crude oil from North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois. underneath Lake Oahe lies seven more pipelines, the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline will be the eight addition to an already vulnerable situation. Humanities negligence and destruction of water and the ecological eradication of species is the biggest catastrophic misfortune to occur in centuries. Humanity has not forgotten about the past oil spills, but instead chooses not to acknowledge or learn from these past catastrophic events, and so they are condemned to repeat it while, encroaching on our human rights. The authors of the study randomly sampled residents of Cordova, Alaska- Exxon Spill and South Mobil County, Alabama- BP Spill, 5 months after each event.

The Water Protectors of North Dakota, and the Standing Rock Reservation are all fighting for the access to clean and sanitary drinking water.
