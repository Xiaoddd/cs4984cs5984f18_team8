Facebook Twitter youtube Trending What You Need To Know About The Dakota Oil Pipeline And The Native Americans Trying To Stop It The pipeline would transport millions of gallons of crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois each day. But Native Americans and environmentalists have slammed the project as a threat to sacred sites and nature. So the idea is to get that oil out of the ground and to refineries and markets in other parts of the US. The pipeline has been in the works for years, but it was approved by the US Army Corps of Engineers on July 25. They've mounted a big campaign trying to stop the pipeline. In August, hundreds of new demonstrators arrived at a camp in the area that reportedly now includes members of dozens of Native American tribes. Tribal spokesman Steve Sitting Bear said six people were bitten by security dogs, while 30 others were pepper-sprayed. Native Americans who oppose the pipeline criticized the decision as inadequate and said it would lead to construction crews destroying sacred sites. As a result, construction in the vicinity of the lake was halted. Jim Dalrymple is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Los Angeles. Submit it here.
