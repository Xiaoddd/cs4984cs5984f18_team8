Wednesday was the federal- and state-imposed deadline to dismantle the campsite, which has been occupied for six months and at one time hosted as many as 10,000 protesters. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers cited concerns about spring flooding when it ordered the evacuation earlier this month. About 150 protesters marched arm-in-arm out of the campsite Wednesday before a 2 p.m. deadline, according to The Associated Press. Some of the temporary wooden structures built there were ceremoniously set on fire, according to the protesters. At least nine people were arrested for not following commands to leave. The North Dakota Department of Emergency Services requested the latest assistance. Wisconsin sent 43 officers from state and local departments in October to assist with crowd control and vehicle patrols. The assignment coincided with mass arrests one day and an increasing number of pipeline opponents gathering in Morton County 25 miles south of Bismarck, north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. One of the people arrested was Madison Ald. Rebecca Kemble. State police sent to the protests reported after the assignment that they should replace name tags with badge numbers to protect their privacy, employ a videographer or body cameras and upgrade helmets and protective vests. A state emergency management spokeswoman said that as of Wednesday no other Wisconsin law enforcement agency was assisting at the North Dakota site. Your notification has been saved.
