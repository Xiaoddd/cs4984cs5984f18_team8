Donate A federal appeals court recently rejected a bid by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to permanently halt construction on part of the Dakota Access pipeline, paving the way for the Dakota Access company to resume construction on private lands adjacent to Lake Oahe on the Missouri River. A decision on whether the pipeline can proceed under the river rests with the Army Corps of Engineers. Since then, members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and others have set up a permanent encampment across the street from the bulldozed burial ground. We are joined by Dave Archambault II, chair of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. This is viewer supported news. Please do your part today.

Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: Yeah. But it also put a stay on everything from going underneath the Missouri River. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: Right. And then, the second one was just to keep the construction from happening within 20 miles on both sides of the Missouri River. But in the ruling, they were able to tell us that the company does not have an easement. And the administration needs to pick up on that signal. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: Yes. Tribes have not been recognized. They have been ignored. And anytime infrastructure projects like this come near, we are invisible. And so, to have this consultation, government-to-government relationship, now surface, it means a lot. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: The consultation has begun. And we are hoping that the department heads are there at the consultations, so they can actually hear what it means to us. AMY GOODMAN: Now, one of the things I learned covering this that I was surprised by is that the pipeline actually originally was not slated to be going through Native country, but above Bismarck, above the city of Bismarck, and right here in Mandan, North Dakota. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: Yeah, and we are told that this route that they chose, that is just feet away from our reservation, is the least impactful. And those pose a threat to us. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: Well, we had a treaty in 1851, and it was a peace treaty. This is with the federal government. And it was by the U.S. Congress, ratified by the president of the United States. More and more people kept coming and encroaching on it, so they had to reduce the land base and enter into a new treaty in 1868. Then there was gold discovered in the Black Hills. And those are violations on those original treaties. And we see the same thing happening today. We have lands, treaty lands, that are being encroached on. AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to ask you about where we are right now, Mandan, North Dakota, just about an hour from the reservation, from Sacred Rock. Right behind us, the county jail and the county courthouse. And I reacted to some things that were going on, and one thing led to another, and then I was arrested. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: Yes. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: Yes. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: Disorderly Conduct. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: Yes, yes. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: Yes. But I accepted. We certainly saw a lot of that on Saturday, a huge police presence, as these nonviolent land and water defenders marched down the road, again, expressing concern about the Dakota Access pipeline. All of that is unnecessary if you look at the actions that have been taking place in North Dakota and compare them to other actions in other states. We bumped into them on Saturday, actually. This is a simple issue. That is, protect the water. AMY GOODMAN: Finally, I wanted to ask you about President Obama coming to Cannon Ball, coming to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: There were three presidents. Roosevelt, I think, was one. Bill Clinton went to the Oglala reservation. And then, President Obama had come to Standing Rock. AMY GOODMAN: And he came to Standing Rock, to your tribe, 2014. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: You know, when the president came, I wanted to show him what reality was, and I asked our children to share stories with him. And they did. And I felt that the president and the first lady was moved by their visit. And what we saw was a lot of, for the first time, policies to help Indian country, to help Indian children. AMY GOODMAN: You mean the three agencies. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: Yeah, Department of Interior, Department of Army, Department of Justice. Those are all underneath the administration. And he had to learn more. He had information. DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II: Stop this pipeline. Ask for a full environmental impact statement. AMY GOODMAN: Well, Chairman Dave, thanks so much for being with us, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, Dave Archambault.
