Law enforcement officers armed with tear gas, rubber bullets, armored vehicles, stun grenades and water cannons descended on anti-Dakota Access Pipeline protesters Nov. 20. During the nighttime engagement, at least 17 protesters were injured badly enough to be taken to the hospital. Violent clashes between demonstrators and police aren't anything new at the protest site in Standing Rock, N.D., but this was the first time police had trained their water cannons on protesters in sub-freezing temperatures. Boisean Celia Espinoza, who had been at Standing Rock days before and stays in touch with friends she made there, felt her fellow protesters' pain. The Dakota Access Pipeline protests have been ongoing since April, as Native American stakeholders and thousands of demonstrators from across the country gathered at Standing Rock to demand the project be halted over safety and environmental. Espinoza spent four days at Standing Rock, from Nov. 3-7. She was on a supply run, hauling winter gear, blankets and other necessities to the site. Once she'd distributed her supplies, Espinoza was conscripted into working in the kitchen, where she prepared soups and tea for the demonstrators. Life at Oceti Sakowin, the camp where she stayed, was a mix of protest preparation and Native American ceremony, as she helped cook traditional dishes like buffalo tripe and elk stew. Her responsibilities grew in the short time she was there. Lurking on the margins of daily life at Oceti Sakowin, however, was the presence of the police. During her stay, Espinoza said she saw helicopters swarming overhead, floodlights and a mysterious plane without running lights that would fly at low altitudes over the camp at night. Since returning from Standing Rock, Espinoza has worked to get the word out about what has been happening at Standing Rock, including a demonstration for media accountability related to coverage of the North Dakota protests planned for 11 a.m.-2 p.m. Friday, Nov. 25 at the studios of KTVB-TV. She and others say the national media has not done an adequate job of communicating the human toll of the anti-DAPL protests. There could have been a death. Sep. 18 Wed. Sep. 19 Thu. Sep. 20 Fri.
