The government agency has jurisdiction over Lake Oahe and a spokesperson for the Army Corps of Engineers said the pipeline company can drill for 200 feet before hitting federal land. If it goes any further, the government will take enforcement action. Violence erupted Sunday night as protesters confronted police at Blackwater Bridge on Highway 1806 in a melee that resulted in 167 injuries, according to the Indigenous Environmental Network. The Bismarck protest was smaller than the thousands of people, by some estimates, who occupy the main protest camp. Read more The company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline continued to move drilling equipment into place near the Missouri River Monday, the day after police used water cannons, tear gas, and rubber bullets to disperse protesters in freezing temperatures. The government agency has jurisdiction over Lake Oahe and a spokesperson for the Army Corps of Engineers said the pipeline company can drill for 200 feet before hitting federal land. If it goes any further, the government will take enforcement action. Violence erupted Sunday night as protesters confronted police at Blackwater Bridge on Highway 1806 in a melee that resulted in 167 injuries, according to the Indigenous Environmental Network. The Bismarck protest was smaller than the thousands of people, by some estimates, who occupy the main protest camp. Protester Conor Handley said the conflict began when the demonstrators tried to remove two burned out vehicles that were blocking the road. However, police say the conflict started when protesters lit fires, so they used the water cannons to put them out. Handley said he saw several people hit with rubber bullets, including people who were hit in the face. As he took photos up close of what was happening, he was hit with a water cannon in the back. The water froze quickly, coating his back in ice. On Nov. 15, Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners filed applications in U.S. federal court seeking a judgement declaring that Dakota Access Pipeline has the legal right of way to build, complete and operate the pipeline without any action from the Army Corps of Engineers. If granted, it would remove the need for the easement. erupted Sunday night as protesters confronted police at Blackwater Bridge on Highway 1806 in a melee that resulted in 167 injuries, according to the Indigenous Environmental Network.
