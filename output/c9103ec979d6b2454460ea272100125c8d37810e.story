Connelly: Tankers coming our way; Canada's government buys pipeline Updated 3:48 pm PDT, Tuesday, May 29, 2018 The vast Alberta oil sands project, often compared to Mordor from Lord of the Rings: The expanded TransMountain Pipeline would carry up to 890,000 barrels a day of heavy tar sands crude oil south to an oil export terminal in Burnaby, B.C., just east of Vancouver.

He claims to be an environmentalist, but is having his government buy and build a 600-mile oil pipeline and oil port that will send 34 tankers a month through sensitive marine waters shared by Washington and British Columbia. The government will then spend taxpayer money -- billions of dollars of it -- to complete the pipeline and oil export port. The project will triple, to 890,000 barrels of oil a day, the capacity of the existing TransMountain pipeline. The oil will be exported by tanker through sensitive marine waters shared by Canada and the United States.

He is fearful of a tanker accident along the route, which runs from Vancouver's Burrard Inlet through the San Juan and Gulf Islands, and out the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The purchase puts Trudeau's government, which has touted cutting carbon emissions, squarely into the oil business. The Kinder Morgan project is designed to provide tidewater access to bitumen crude produced by the vast oil sands project in northern Alberta. But Washington would also take one for the team. The San Juan Island National Historical Park and lands of the San Juan Islands National Monument adjoin the tanker route. About 350 people in Seattle protested the pipeline project earlier this month. Kayactivists took to the water. Gov. Jay Inslee has voiced worry about expanded tanker traffic, and its impact on endangered Orca whales.

The Canadian government does not intend to hold onto the pipeline forever. The fears of a spill are far from far fetched. A barge spill off Grays Harbor, in 1988, leaked 230,000 gallons of oil. Currents carried the oil ashore in Olympic National Park, but also carried the oil more than 250 miles to where it fouled beaches in Canada's Pacific Rim National Park on Vancouver Island. Canada has repeated shown with small leaks, such as a 2015 spill in Vancouver's English Bay, that it does not move quickly. It was not even able to deal with oil tanks on a tug boat that sank off the west coast two years ago.
