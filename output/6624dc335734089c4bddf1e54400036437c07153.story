Well, advisor Moore, meet the Trump transition team. We are witnessing not a populist, working-class revolution, but the wholesale takeover of government by an extremist faction of the corporate class. It turns out that nearly three-quarters of the landing teams come from the corporate world or corporate-affiliated think tanks, according to a Public Citizen review. And, although the Trump team has kicked registered lobbyists off the transition, at least 13 of the 71 landing team members have been registered lobbyists in the past, some as recent as last year. Take a look: Paul Atkins is in charge of financial regulation for the Trump transition and on the landing teams for the Elizabeth Warren-created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). He is the CEO of Patomak Global Partners, a consulting firm that advises financial services companies on compliance issues. Atkins formerly served as a Republican commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission, where he was viewed as being largely opposed to regulation. Joel Leftwich is the staff director for the US Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry. He was a lobbyist for PepsiCo from 2013 to 2015, and in 2010 was a lobbyist for DuPont. There are 10 people on the landing team for the Department of Defense. More than half work now or previously for defense contractors, including Mira Ricardel, a former vice president for Boeing known for advocacy of space laser weapons. Michael Dougherty is on the landing team for the Department of Homeland Security. He is the CEO of Secure Identity & Biometrics Association, a trade group that represents the interests of member corporations whose business is security screening technology for airports and border crossings. Previously he worked for Raytheon, a security contractor and, before that, as a Homeland Security official under President George W. Bush. Doug Domenech is on the landing team for the Department of Interior. He also worked for 12 years for the Forest Resources Association, a national trade association representing the forest products industry. There are nine people on the landing team for the Department of Justice, predictably drawn heavily from the ranks of corporate law firms. President Obama took important steps in this direction with an executive order at the outset of his administration but only addressed registered lobbyists. We are witnessing not a populist, working-class revolution, but the wholesale takeover of government by an extremist faction of the corporate class. At no time is this more true than now, with a president-elect with minimal interest in policy details. Trump voters hoping for anti-establishment, anti-insider politics are in for a rude awakening.
