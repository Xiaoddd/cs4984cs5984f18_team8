The family are seeking expert opinion to identify the flesh-eating bugs. Marine biologists have said they were likely to have been sea fleas, tiny scavenging marine animals. After a tiring football game on Saturday evening, the 16-year-old decided to soak his legs in the cold bay near his home. Speaking to the BBC's World Update radio show, Sam described feeling pins and needles in his legs after standing waist-deep in dark cold water for about half an hour. After two local hospitals could not identify the cause of the multiple pin-prick injuries, the Melbourne father decided to investigate and went back to the beach. Mr Kanizay said he hoped the sandy-coloured mites would not scar his son, and he is expected to make a full recovery. Marine biologist Dr Genefor Walker-Smith, who saw some of the samples, told Australia's Herald Sun newspaper that the bugs were probably lysianassid amphipods, or sea fleas. Experts have said such cases are very rare and that there is no reason for alarm. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.
