Thousands of Ex Army Veterans have teamed up and are heading towards Standing Rock to protect protesters of the Dakota Access pipeline from Police brutality. Now, Wood Jr. and Clark Jr. are organizing mass non-violent protection against police violence on protesters in North Dakota. Anti-media reports: According to an article published by Business Insider that first appeared in Task and Purpose, a military-oriented news and culture site, two veterans are leading the charge in a show of dissent against the increasingly aggressive police. Clark would later attempt to distance himself from those statements but still managed to convince his son, a member of the Army at the time, to stay away from Iraq. Now, Wood Jr. and Clark Jr. are attempting to organize a mass, nonviolent protest against police action in North Dakota. Just this past weekend, a female protester was hit with a concussion grenade, causing severe damage to her arm and requiring surgery. Other have been tear gassed, tased, beaten, and shot with rubber bullets. Anti-Media journalist Derrick Broze was tased by law enforcement immediately after he declared he was a member of the media. Another journalist was shot with a rubber bullet while standing away from a gathering of protesters as she interviewed an attendee. Police have made over 470 arrests since August, and the Indigenous Environmental Network claims 167 people were injured just this past Sunday when police deployed water cannons in freezing weather. Clark Jr. was clear he was not looking for violence and that the protest would be unarmed. We can stop this savage injustice being committed right here at home.
