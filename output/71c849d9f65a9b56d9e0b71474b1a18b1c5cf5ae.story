And when the history books are full of lies, our entire nation is at risk. But something has happened this year that may change how Americans view the holiday: The movement for indigenous sovereignty, clean water and human rights at Standing Rock is smashing the myth of Thanksgiving and fighting to protect not only our water, but the very soul of this nation. The night before Thanksgiving, I arrive at Oceti Sakowin, the main camp just south of Bismarck, North Dakota, on the Standing Rock Reservation. The camp is named after the seven council fires of the Dakota, Lakota and Nakota people; the fire in the center of the camp burns perpetually. Mekasi Horinek, a member of the Ponca Nation from Oklahoma, and Floris Whitebull, a native of Standing Rock and a distant relative of Sitting Bull, are hosting me and a crew of activists, musicians and journalists who have arrived to winterize yurts, tiny houses, trailers, bunk houses and other structures to get ready for the harsh North Dakota winter. In hushed tones after midnight, Horinek relates the events of a few days prior. North Dakota police attacked water protectors seeking to re-open ND 1806, the crucial main artery that connects Standing Rock to Bismark, which had ben blockaded by burned out trucks and cars set on fire by police weeks earlier. After towing the vehicles out of the middle of the road, police opened fire with rubber bullets and water cannons in 20-degree weather. Every day is a day you could lose your life. Bright and early on Thanksgiving Day, hundreds of water protectors assemble on the bank of the Cannonball River, the north shore of which is across from Turtle Island, a burial grounds for the ancestors of the Standing Rock Tribe. Staring up at the police who are spraying water down at them, they pray, sing, dance and burn sage, knowing that at any minute the police could erupt into violence. Indeed, human-rights groups like Amnesty International have raised serious concerns about the actions of the Morton County Police Department. There have been reports of law enforcement not wearing their name tags so they cannot be identified, and medics at the camp have spoken out to warn that the use of water cannons in sub-freezing temperatures is potentially lethal and could cause hypothermia. In my time at Standing Rock, I have witnessed many incidents of police officers pepper spraying and shooting rubber bullets at unarmed protectors, journalists and medics without provocation of any sort. If you build this bridge, it will be seen as an act of aggression. Think of all the bad press we would get. For these Native American protectors, this holiday is not a celebration; it is a day of mourning. We are tired of having our rights constantly taken away every year, every day, every month. Since 1492, being trampled. A band of drummers and singers wail away on the banks as protectors talk to the police. Please leave our ancient burial grounds. Please stop trampling on the graves of our ancestors. Please leave, they say. Go home to your wives and families. When you are reactive, you step out of prayer and go into anger. Have love in your heart. Pray here and do what we came here to do. The point is to own a deep sense of power, strength and connectedness, and celebrate and pray. The sense of peace is palpable.
