The argument is that the situation had a heavy federal nexus, dealing with a dispute with a federally recognized Indian tribe inspiring protests on federally-managed lands at the heart of which was delays in issuing a federal permit to cross a federally regulated waterway. The feds, North Dakota officials argue, contributed in no small way to the existence of the protests. Thus, the feds should pay. Which is an argument I agree with. Well today Senator John Hoeven announced that the feds may be paying at least part of the expense.
