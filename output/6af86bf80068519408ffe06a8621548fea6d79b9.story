Monkeywrenching Security Zines Read. Distribute. Fallen Warriors Obituaries to fallen warriors. Journal. Newswire In the witching hour of March 11th, we crept up to the Virginia Beach oceanfront mansion of Elizabeth Duke, Vice Chair of Wells Fargo. As we all know, Wells Fargo is one of the financial institutions funding the Dakota Access Pipeline and a number of other exploitative energy projects. As vice chair, Elizabeth has specifically been chosen as a target in order to apply the pressure needed to get Wells Fargo to defund and divest from the DAPL. Alongside the NoDAPL March on Washington yesterday, and in coordination with the call to action last month, we felt it was time to do our part and pay Mrs. Duke a visit. Even in the whipping wind, our banner remained taught as we slipped away unnoticed into the night. In solidarity with indigenous struggles every where, and uncompromisingly toward the liberation of all creatures and life forms, our Green Antifa crew will continue to fight and build to defend the magical wild we love. Particularly with the looming threat of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, we will be fighting alongside the indigenous people and tribes of Eastern Virginia Coalition of Woodland Nations to defend their sacred land and to honor our sacred duty to protect our Mother, our kin, and ourselves.
