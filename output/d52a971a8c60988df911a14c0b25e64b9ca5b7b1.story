Energy Oil leak discovered after 'impact' at Hilcorp platform in Cook Inlet Author: Alex DeMarban Updated: December 2, 2017 Published April 1, 2017 File photo: Offshore oil platforms in Cook Inlet, 2012. The oil leak is on the west side of the inlet and is unrelated to the company's ongoing natural gas leak on the eastern side of the basin near Nikiski. What caused the impact is not known. The largest sheen was 10 feet by 12 feet, the state agency said. Two other sheens were about 3.5 feet by 22.5 feet. The size of the leak is unknown, Ryan said. The crude oil pipeline runs between the Anna and Bruce platforms. Production at the platforms was shut down Saturday to stop the flow of oil through the pipeline. The line is 75 feet underwater. That gas leak was discovered on Feb. 7, on an 8-inch pipeline running between an onshore facility and the A Platform built in the mid-1960s. Hilcorp has delayed repairs on that leaking gas line, saying it's too dangerous with sea ice choking the inlet. The company was hoping to send divers down next week to fix the gas leak, if the sea ice clears enough. A repair by divers also won't happen immediately for the oil leak. Hilcorp reported the leak to DEC at 12:05 p.m. today. The company is the dominant producer in Cook Inlet, after arriving in Alaska in 2011 and rapidly acquiring facilities, many of them old. The pig would act like a squeegee, with the goal of pushing the oil past the trouble spot and cutting off the leak site, said Ryan. The DEC and the U.S. Coast Guard will send personnel to the Anna Platform Sunday to monitor that effort, Ryan said. Cook Inlet Spill Response Inc., an oil spill response contractor, will also have vessels in the water, she said. An Incident Command Post is being established at CISPRI offices in Nikiski, the agency said. Bob Shavelson with watchdog group Cook Inletkeeper said potentially many thousand gallons of oil could have leaked into waters occupied by endangered Cook Inlet beluga whales, salmon and other animals.
