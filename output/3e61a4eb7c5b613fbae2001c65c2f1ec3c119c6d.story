BACKGROUND In past years, and particularly in past months, the municipality of Tixtla has been the scene of an ever increasing generalized violence, characterized by actions of armed groups supposedly linked to organized crime which are disputing control of the territory and roads of the region; all of this in a state of impunity. This past weekend, on the 19th and 20th of November, 8 decapitated and dismembered bodies with signs of physical violence were found on the highway which connects Tixtla to the cities of Chilapa, Atliaca and state capital, Chilpancingo. Navarrete was kidnapped in downtown Tixtla and his body was found hours later near the garbage dump located along the Chilpancingo-Tixtla highway. These events make it evident that the climate of generalized violence is being used to attack human rights defenders, as well as defenders of education and of the communities. Due to this and the SERIOUS DANGER TO THE LIFE, FREEDOM AND INTEGRITY OF TEACHER IRINEO SALMERON DIRCIO stemming from his kidnapping, we demand that the municipal and state authorities: 1- Carry out all pertinent investigations and actions in order to locate IRINEO SALMERON DIRCIO. 2- Guarantee the life, liberty and integrity of teacher IRINEO SALMERON DIRCIO. 3- According to the law, detain and punish, all the material and intellectual authors of the kidnapping of IRINEO SALMERON DIRCIO. 4- Design humane public security strategies which respect human rights and policies to prevent further cases like the one which is being presented.
