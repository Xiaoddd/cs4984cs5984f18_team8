The post was handmade by activists protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline, and it comes from the Oceti Sakowin (Great Sioux Nation) protest camp on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation bordered by North Dakota. All Americans inherit these rights, Indian and non-Indian alike. The Horse Creek (Fort Laramie) Treaty of 1852, which is shown elsewhere in the exhibition, defined the lands of the Sioux. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe rose up in defense of these guarantees when a private company built a pipeline that they assert threatens their lands and water. A key issue for the tribe was protecting treaty rights and the right to be consulted as a government. When more than 12,000 indigenous people and their allies from around the globe joined the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to protest a pipeline built without adequately consulting the Native Nation most affected, they created this mile-marker post to show how far some had travelled. Located on the National Mall at Fourth Street and Independence Avenue S.W., the museum is open each day from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (closed Dec. 25).
