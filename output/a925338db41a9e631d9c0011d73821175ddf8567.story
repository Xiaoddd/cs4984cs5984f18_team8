But this clarity is enough to give us a sense of what we just saw happen, and why it happened the way it did. News Reports (1) Priebus made two public statements today. One is that the ban on Muslims will no longer be applied to green card holders. The other was that the omission of Jews from the statement for Holocaust Remembrance Day was deliberate and is not regretted. (3) CNN has a detailed story (heavily sourced) about the process by which this ban was created and announced. Also notable is that career DHS staff, up to and including the head of Customs & Border Patrol, were kept entirely out of the loop until the order was signed. As the diagram below (by Emily Roslin v Praze) shows, this leaves almost nobody in the entire senior staff of the State Department at this point. The seniormost staff of the Department of State. As the Guardian points out, this has an important and likely not accidental effect: it leaves the State Department entirely unstaffed during these critical first weeks, when orders like the Muslim ban (which they would normally resist) are coming down. (5) On Inauguration Day, Trump apparently filed his candidacy for 2020. Given that a sizable fraction of the campaign funds from the previous cycle were paid directly to the Trump organization in exchange for building leases, etc., at inflated rates, you can assume that those campaign coffers are a mechanism by which US nationals can easily give cash bribes directly to Trump. No. But it raises some very interesting questions for journalists to investigate. I see a few key patterns here. First, the decision to first block, and then allow, green card holders was meant to create chaos and pull out opposition; they never intended to hold it for too long. Note also the most frightening escalation last night was that the DHS made it fairly clear that they did not feel bound to obey any court orders. That is to say, the administration is testing the extent to which the DHS (and other executive agencies) can act and ignore orders from the other branches of government. This is as serious as it can possibly get: all of the arguments about whether order X or Y is unconstitutional mean nothing if elements of the government are executing them and the courts are being ignored. It gave them useful information. A second major theme is watching the set of people involved. Other departments and appointees have been deliberately hobbled, with key orders announced to them only after the fact, staff gutted, and so on. As per my analysis yesterday, Trump is likely to want his own intelligence service disjoint from existing ones and reporting directly to him; given the current staffing and roles of his inner circle, Bannon is the natural choice for them to report through. Especially if combined with the DHS and the FBI, which appear to have remained loyal to the President throughout the recent transition, this creates the armature of a shadow government: intelligence and police services which are not accountable through any of the normal means, answerable only to the President. The third theme is money. Kushner looks increasingly likely to be the money-man, acting as the liaison between piles of cash and the president. This gives us a pretty good guess as to what the exit strategy is: become tremendously, and untraceably, rich, by looting any coffers that come within reach. Combining all of these facts, we have a fairly clear picture in play. Trump was, indeed, perfectly honest during the campaign; he intends to do everything he said, and more. This should not be reassuring to you. Departments are being reorganized or purged to effect this. The secondary aim of personal enrichment is also very much in play, and clever people will find ways to play these two goals off each other.
