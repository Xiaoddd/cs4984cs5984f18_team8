Monkeywrenching Security Zines Read. Distribute. Fallen Warriors Obituaries to fallen warriors. Journal. Given the complex land ownership and public access rules that govern the bayou, handing discretionary arrest powers to a private company is particularly controversial. Crawfish producers and environmental justice groups have pursued legal strategies and direct-action campaigns to stop the project. If prosecution of the arrestees moves ahead, attorneys may use the criminal cases as a springboard to argue that HB 727 is overly vague and broad, and infringes on free expression. For two weeks prior to the first arrests under the new law, pipeline opponents paddled in the public waters transected by the pipeline easement, prompting workers to halt construction. Spoon said the officers then reached down and yanked the two women from their boat by the wrists, placing them in handcuffs. The security guards also arrested a third Bayou Bridge pipeline opponent who was kayaking nearby. The protesters were charged with unauthorized entry of a critical infrastructure facility and resisting arrest. They were released later that day. Pam Spees, a senior staff attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights who is representing groups opposed to the Bayou Bridge project, said the situation raises important concerns about whose interests are being protected. In an interview with The Intercept, Pastorick estimated that roughly 50 state probation and parole officers had gained outside employment with the security company Hub Enterprises, which was hired by Energy Transfer Partners to guard the Bayou Bridge pipeline during construction. But he said that as of August 13, department personnel were no longer working for Hub. He was not aware of the reason behind the shift. A spokesperson referred inquiries to an email address for Energy Transfer Partners media relations. These situations are dealt with by local law enforcement. One officer walked to the base of the trees and announced into a bullhorn: If anyone was occupying the tree-sits, they were now committing a felony and must come down immediately. Unbeknownst to the deputy, he was calling up to empty platforms. Aware that the bill was about to take effect, the tree-sitters had already abandoned their perches. One of the trees supporting the skypod was on the pipeline construction path. But the skypod itself was not, and thus was theoretically not subject to prosecution under HB 727. Legal filings indicate that the company only began the eminent domain process after it started construction. ETP spokesperson Granado told The Intercept that the expropriation process is underway, and that more than 800 people have rights to the land. Another landowner, Peter Aaslestad, has a pending legal case demanding that ETP stop construction. Three other pipeline opponents and one independent journalist embedded with the group, Karen Savage, were arrested and charged under the new law for refusing to leave. But Savage disputes trespassing in a critical infrastructure construction zone. A sixth water protector was also arrested under other charges. Today, Leighton continues to work security for pipeline projects that have attracted local opposition, hiring primarily local law enforcement officers. Both the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipelines pass through West Virginia and Virginia; the Atlantic Coast pipeline also runs through North Carolina. Journal Collective.
