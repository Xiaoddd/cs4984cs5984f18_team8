First Americans have served in the United States Military, defending the soil of our homelands, at a greater percentage than any other group of Americans. There is no other people more deserving of veteran support and this situation encapsulates whether we are called heroes for violence and cashing paychecks, or for justice and morality. They will be limited in their violence against us by U.S. and international human rights laws, a national press presence, and observers from U.S. Congress. In the ultimate expression of alliance, we are there to put our bodies on the line, no matter the physical cost, in complete non-violence to provide a clear representation to all Americans of where evil resides. The Water Protectors are leading the way against this same evil which we must all face globally, saving ourselves and our children from the apocalyptic outcome of climate change. We are the cavalry. This is not an action of violence. If you feel any potential for violence or anti-social behavior, do not participate in actions. Contact us for resources to address that first. Anytime one of us who speaks to a camera or tweets something out, you are a representative of all of us. Feel no shame in leaving that to members more experienced in that lane. We must hold the center and quickly replace any gaps caused through attrition. This must not happen under any circumstances. If DAPL personnel need to access this pad for safety reasons, we will permit them entry. We will then quickly form into platoons and companies and brief following day actions. The tribal elders will then perform a cleansing ceremony to wash away our sins and steel us for the days ahead. A few veteran members of U.S. House of Representatives will then hold a press conference to confirm the rightness of our cause to the national press. We will then board the buses and be transported to the front line. Upon exiting the bus we form up into our platoons and companies, transitioning into one massive line of us all wrapped arm-in-arm marching toward our first encounter. At sundown, we will board the bus and return to the gymnasiums, where we will be fed by the Sioux. contact page.
