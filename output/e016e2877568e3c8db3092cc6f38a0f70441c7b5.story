The city and sub-cities often do trendy when it comes to politics, entertainment, and market life. Thus, I blog, write and edit Fictional Stories, Essays, and Opinion and do so on social, cultural, and political matters. I may try Astrology. Think Smart, Get Going, and Love to ALL Pages LATEST NoveL NEWS CULTURE SOCIAL MEDIA THANK YOU domain Raspect RAS'PecT. TRUMP the Market The world was shocked to hear the news that Donald J. Trump won the presidency of the United States. At least that's what the majority of people thought as displayed by the popular vote. The truth of the matter is, no one really knows what they are going to get in politics. People say one thing and mean another. People expect one thing, and then get something completely different. In fact, some might even welcome such occurrences. A thin line lies between that of humanity and that of societies. To start, humanity equates to the totality of all of us human beings - no matter what race, creed, age, etc. Society, on the other hand, often dictates what is rule of law and order of civilization. It is fixed, whereas humanity is random, unique and sometimes, (if not all of the time) at the mercy of nature. Part of the greatness of the U.S. is our unity as a country. The US takes pride in its ability to act, evaluate, and assess situations. Indeed, there is plenty to be proud of as an American because in the U.S., we come to be known as great collaborators, influencers, and leaders. The U.S. has a reputation of being a great nation, as we are one of the top leaders in the world, contributing to technology and sustainable ways of living. Now, whether the U.S. strongly impedes on other countries, or not, is a different matter. Some may refer to us as bullies, but that is because we have some of the most aggressive leaders in the world who strongly believe in freedom and democracy. Sure, we might just want to showcase our way of living and why other countries should adopt it, but that is because we have a strong sense of pride in development. Personally, I believe it is the job of each world leader to decide what is best for their own individual country based upon the needs of their own people and land, unless such decisions are deemed extremely harmful. Honestly, only time will tell. Although many people online have shown that they disagree with his biased opinions, reports have been surfacing that some of his ideas might be good for the U.S. - perhaps with the exception of his overbearing nationalism. Maybe for trade, his sense of nationalism is good, but for worldly relations, it might be bad. Some people on social media have also displayed their sense of nationalism, particularly with the concerns of global terrorism, as well as global economic development. One of the main issues for the U.S. has been the opportunity of jobs versus global trade pacts. Domestic laborers need to work in order to compete in what is now considered a global market - particularly if they can no longer rely on shares of stock which do not promise guaranteed outcomes, as seen in the 2008 housing market crisis. After all, some consumerism is found in various kinds of objects which may cause unnecessary hoarding, as well as unfit ways-of-living. The thing about President-elect Trump is that he is all about business. He may fold to how businesses react to his policies, but that is because he is a businessman. His arrogance may have some businesses kissing ass for political favors too, but at least it is not toward a politician already known to simply throw favors and taxes, while also not properly regulating the way taxes are used. Hmm, maybe all recent U.S. presidents simply pose favors for favorites, versus actual, sustainable options. Perhaps it is embedded in American society. In the U.S. political arena, it really is EAT, or be eaten. For the most part, businesses in the U.S. will not be threatened because the nation has a majority of republicans in the House, Senate, and Office of Presidency. However, any reckless maneuvers may hurt the people and taxpayers. If Trump holds his sense of nationalism, however, to benefit ALL Americans, then the U.S. economy may experience considerable growth. If not, well then, we will just be normal competitors in an ever-growing, but possibly unsustainable global market. After all, banks have cheated people, and it may only be a matter of time before supply exceeds a diminishing demand. Usually business does not work that way, though, seeing how many people flock to the first show of opportunity. Perhaps then, this election is about morals and values. Sure, there are just too many reports which contradict each other on such issues as climate change, productivity, and political boundaries. Humanity, however is at a level of making more conscientious decisions - particularly now that we are more connected and aware of our surroundings. Life may be different online than it is in the real world, but politics happen every day in the form of monetary transactions, consumerist decisions, and communal relations. On the global scale, the U.S. should come to terms with alternative methods of living and sustainability, as well as foreign relations. Although Trump has the ability to recognize progress made in the world over certain issues, it only takes a few bad decisions to ruin everything. -written by reggaerockgaL Trump the Market by reggaerockgaL is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.
