Saturday, hundreds of people gathered at camp before dawn to walk 8 miles to a site where several water protectors had chained themselves to construction equipment. Some of us were present at this peaceful and prayerful action, walking over the burial grounds of our ancestors.

They body-slammed people to the ground, and arrested elders, journalists, and even a 17-year-old pregnant woman.

On Standing Rock, like many other reservations, there is a severe lack of opportunities and resources for Native youth to grow and learn in a safe environment. Because of this, many young people struggle with addiction, and suicide is an all too common occurrence. you so much for your continued generosity. In a world where indigenous youth often feel like no one cares, this campaign has introduced us to a community of supporters who care deeply about protecting our earth and all those who live on it.

In the past few weeks since the announcement, they have been taking advantage of a lull in media coverage to increase their presence and continue criminalizing us for fighting to protect the water. Last week, 21 people from the camps were arrested while conducting a peaceful ceremony in which they planted corn and willow in the path of the pipeline. Police officers showed up with armored vehicles, in riot gear, and one of them even pointed a gun at the protectors before arresting them. be back soon with further actions you can take to help escalate the campaign.

Friday, after protesting in front of the Army Corps Headquarters, we had a meeting with several officials from the Army Corps, the Department of Defense, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. We delivered your signatures to them, and told them about why we are fighting to protect our communities from this pipeline. We talked about addiction and lack of opportunity on the reservation, and by the end of the meeting almost everyone was crying. It was an emotional moment, and we were so glad to be truly heard. For hours, we prayed, sang, and danced in the hot sun, calling on President Obama to come out and speak with us. When it started raining, we danced harder, and we sang louder. Sunday morning we left DC and drove to New York City to rally in Union Square. Shailene helped us put out the call, and Rosario Dawson joined us to speak about why she too opposes harmful oil pipelines. We ran around the park and through the streets, and our supporters ran behind us, helping to amplify our call. we are beginning our journey back to North Dakota to join our brothers and sisters at the Sacred Stone camp and await news on the legal battle our tribe has started against the pipeline.

The Standing Rock Reservation has very few resources for young people, and those that do exist are constantly shutting down for lack of funding. We have no teen center and few job or educational opportunities. Our people are dying of drug abuse and alcoholism. shared this with the president when he met with myself and a small group of young people from our tribe in 2014. It was an emotional meeting for all involved. We told him stories about our struggles on the reservation, and he cried with us when one of my friends talked about having to leave college in order to come home and care for his siblings after his mother became addicted to meth.

Yesterday we found out that in spite of months of campaigning, the Army Corps of Engineers has ignored our calls to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. They have granted a construction permit for the project. The Dakota Access Pipeline is a direct threat to the health and safety of those living along the pipeline route, yet our tribe was never consulted in talks leading up to the permit. Not only that, but the project relied on an environmental assessment that did not take tribal concerns into consideration at all. This means that we need to ramp up our efforts even more and increase pressure on them to do the right thing. But before then, we need your to help. The pipeline threatens the health and safety of all those living along its path, particularly the members of the Standing Rock Tribe, whose drinking water will be at risk. Though we are devastated by this news, we are NOT giving up. Please help us stay strong and stop this awful pipeline.
