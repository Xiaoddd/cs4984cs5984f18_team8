The top fundraising page was the Support Victims of Pulse Shooting, which was set up in the wake of a June 12 shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando that left 50 people dead. Multiple GoFundMe pages related to the Dakota Access protesters have been set up since protests began in late August. Protesters from across the country have gathered north of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation to oppose the 1,172-mile pipeline that was slated to cross under the Missouri River in Morton County. The pipeline would carry oil from the Bakken Formation in western North Dakota to Illinois, where it would be shipped to market in the Gulf Coast. Protesters fear a possible leak would pollute the Missouri River and Standing Rock's water source. The Missouri River portion of the project was halted after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced earlier this month it would not approve a permit for the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe. Those funds covered the costs for veterans to travel to the protest site in early December. The campaign was established after Sophia Wilansky, a protester from New York, was seriously injured during the protests. Her father, Wayne Wilansky, told media she was hit by a concussion grenade in late November. The money will help pay for surgeries to save her arm. Campaigns to support law enforcement and first responders also were launched on GoFundMe. Again, it was beat out by the Pulse shooting. She grew up on a ranch 10 miles southeast of Belfield, where her family raises registered Hereford cattle. During her time at the college, she worked as a reporter and editor-in-chief for the university's newspaper, The Collegian. Baumgarten previously worked for The Dickinson Press as a city government and energy reporter in 2011 before becoming the editor of the Hazen Star and Center Republican. She then returned to The Press as a news editor, where she helped lead an award-winning newsroom in recording the historical oil boom. Contact Baumgarten at 701-780-1248.
