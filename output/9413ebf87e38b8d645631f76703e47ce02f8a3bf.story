Brent McDonald The Downside of the Boom By DEBORAH SONTAG and ROBERT GEBELOFF NOV. 23, 2014 North Dakota took on the oversight of a multibillion-dollar oil industry with a regulatory system built on trust, warnings and second chances. There had been an accident at the Skurupey 1-9H oil well. More in this Series Part 2 Where Oil and Politics Mix After an unusual land deal, a giant spill and a tanker-train explosion, anxiety began to ripple across the prairie. Nov. 23, 2014 Part 3 In North Dakota, a Tale of Oil, Corruption and Death Tex G. Hall, a tribal chief connected to the oil industry, has pushed profits on the Fort Berthold Reservation. But accusations of corruption and murder for hire have upended business as usual. Dec. 28, 2014 It was the 11th blowout since 2006 at a North Dakota well operated by Continental Resources, the most prolific producer in the booming Bakken oil patch. Two years earlier, a towering derrick in Golden Valley County had erupted into flames and toppled, leaving three workers badly burned. Blowouts represent the riskiest failure in the oil business. Yet, despite these serious injuries and some 115,000 gallons spilled in those first 10 blowouts, the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which regulates the drilling and production of oil and gas, did not penalize Continental until the 11th. In 2011, Andrew J. Rohr and two other workers were badly burned when a towering derrick erupted into flames and toppled. A small state that believes in small government, it took on the oversight of a multibillion-dollar industry with a slender regulatory system built on neighborly trust, verbal warnings and second chances. In recent years, as the boom really exploded, the number of reported spills, leaks, fires and blowouts has soared, with an increase in spillage that outpaces the increase in oil production, an investigation by The New York Times found. Its state leaders rarely mention the underside of the boom and do not release even summary statistics about environmental incidents and enforcement measures. The Times found that the Industrial Commission wields its power to penalize the industry only as a last resort. It rarely pursues formal complaints and typically settles those for about 10 percent of the assessed penalties. State regulators say they deliberately choose a collaborative rather than punitive approach because they view the large independent companies that dominate the Bakken as responsible and as their necessary allies in policing the oil fields. They prefer to work alongside industry to develop new guidelines or regulations when problems like overflowing waste, radioactive waste, leaking pipelines, and flaring gas become too glaring to ignore. Daryl Peterson taste-tests the residue left by a wastewater spill on land he farms. The highly saline spill rendered the land useless. At the same time, the state has significantly increased staffing to enforce environmental protections. One environmental incident for every 11 wells in 2006, for instance, became one for every six last year, The Times found. Through early October of this year, companies reported 3.8 million gallons spilled, nearly as much as in 2011 and 2012 combined. Over all, more than 18.4 million gallons of oils and chemicals spilled, leaked or misted into the air, soil and waters of North Dakota from 2006 through early October 2014. The spill numbers derive from estimates, and sometimes serious underestimates, reported to the state by the industry. State officials, who rarely discuss them publicly, sometimes use them to present a rosier image. In fact, the rate has risen sharply since the early days of the boom. He noted it is a federal agency, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, that regulates oil transmission pipelines. Most individual spills were contained to the immediate drilling area, but many of the largest spills polluted surrounding farms and waterways. Indeed, as the tangle of buried pipelines has grown, there have been no federal pipeline inspectors based in North Dakota. Continental Resources hardly seems likely to walk away from its 1.2 million leased acres in the Bakken. But the company, which has a former North Dakota governor on its board, has been treated with leniency by the Industrial Commission. From 2006 through August, it reported more spills and environmental incidents (937) and a greater volume of spillage (1.6 million gallons) than any other operator. What Continental paid Mr. Rohr, the injured driller, is guarded by a confidentiality agreement negotiated after a jury was impaneled for a trial this September. Mrs. Rohr said. Oil wells, shown in yellow, cover the agricultural landscape. Most have been built since 2006. Thousands of lines drilled underground connect the fracking operations to surface wells. Especially during the first years, officials were anxious that this oil boom, like previous ones, could be fleeting, that oil companies, if not embraced, could shift their rigs and capital investment to fields with less severe winters and better access to markets. Mr. Sattler said he tried to establish a protocol for field investigations, preparing a three-page checklist of procedures, including how to conduct witness interviews. Lynn D. Helms, the director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources, advocates a collaborative, not punitive, approach to oil industry enforcement. By 2011, when it handed out 1,927 permits, it was still managing to issue them in 10 days. Some officials in western North Dakota challenged the accelerating pace. In the spring thaw of 2011, however, after a winter of record snowfall, scores of oil waste pits overflowed at once. The large, open pits, adjacent to rigs throughout the Bakken at that point, disgorged oil-based drilling mud that mixed with snowmelt and streamed across farmland and into stock ponds, creeks and river tributaries. Farmers were horrified; the local news media took note. Hess Oil was one target. Continental, like some other companies, disputed its responsibility. Its lawyer, a former counsel to the Industrial Commission, proposed that consent agreements state that the overflows were caused by unforeseeable extreme weather. That fall, at a commission meeting in Bismarck, Mr. Helms explained the logic behind the waste pit settlements. Bearded and deliberative, Mr. Helms is a petroleum engineer by trade, with a hand that bears the burn scars of an industrial accident. To his critics, Mr. Helms personifies a cozy relationship between the commission and oil companies. Mr. Helms, however, said that his background gives him access and authority, and that his job is to promote responsible development, not the industry. The commission has imposed its stiffest penalties on smaller companies. Mr. Helms said that problems in the oil patch were often the fault not of the major companies but of the contractors who do their physical labor. Judging by the data, the Health Department, overseen by civil servants and not elected officials, appears to have been tougher on the oil industry than the Industrial Commission has. Still, most of that revenue derived from a single industrywide enforcement action that, Mr. Glatt said, the industry itself requested. A task force was formed; the companies devised a new model for estimating the emissions and pledged to control them through devices. A ranch in Epping, N.D., is dotted with oil rigs and sliced by oil service roads. It sits along the road to the Lewis and Clark State Park. It raised awareness that spills of all magnitudes were daily and routine. It highlighted the inadequacy of pipeline monitoring. And it made clear that even in the worst cases the authorities are hesitant to use punitive sanctions. More than a year after the spill, neither the federal nor the state government has penalized the company responsible, Tesoro Logistics of San Antonio. But we use a carrot and stick approach. His wife called the operator of a nearby well, which contacted Tesoro, and both companies immediately sent out representatives. It was squirting out of the ground. In its initial report, Tesoro seriously underestimated the contamination. The spill was publicly disclosed only after local reporters learned of it, provoking an outcry from environmentalists that led to the creation of a spills website. In Tioga, a preliminary investigation found a small hole in the pipeline that appeared to have been caused by lightning, said the federal pipeline administration, whose final investigation has yet to be completed. Mr. Glatt said. Before the leak sprang in July 2013, Tesoro had not conducted an internal inspection of that segment of pipeline for eight years. Federal officials had last inspected the Tesoro network in North Dakota in 2010. Pipeline leaks are not the most common cause of spills; valve or piping connection problems are, The Times found. But they spew the greatest volume of oil and wastewater and are the most likely to cause pollution. Transmission pipelines, which carry oil to market, are not the only problem, however. Until this year, no authority, federal or state, monitored what Mr. Helms estimates to be 18,000 miles of gathering pipelines, which transport oil and wastewater from wells to collection sites. In fact, the North Dakota government does not even know their precise locations. In Tioga, the Jensens are inclined to look at the bright side, though 33 acres of their farmland have been cordoned off for an industrial cleanup operation expected to take at least another year. Neither the federal nor the state government has penalized the company responsible. Their corner of the state is like a cautionary tale. It is pocked with the remnants of 1980s oil production: abandoned wastewater ponds, some of which leached brine downward and outward, sterilizing the soil and shriveling crops. Though the industry now disposes of oil field brine primarily by injecting it deep underground, it still needs to be transported to disposal wells and remains a stubborn pollution problem. For every barrel of oil, about 1.4 barrels of brine is produced, state officials say, and far more of it spills than does oil. Three years ago, a farmer in the Antler audience experienced one of the largest oil field wastewater spills ever in North Dakota. A leaking wastewater line contaminated some 24 acres of farmland and eight surface ponds, and the site has yet to be restored to health. After the leak was detected, cleanup crews pumped out two million gallons of severely contaminated water, with chloride levels 2,700 times higher than normal, and a generator was still pumping out contaminants this summer. Meanwhile, that 24 acres has expanded, with Mother Nature, to the neighbors. Mr. Helms, in an email last year to his spokeswoman, Alison Ritter, estimated it at 332,000 gallons. Mr. Nelson, the legislator and agronomist, thinks it probably was three times that much. A farmer working a field, foreground, near oil wells outside Epping. North Dakota has shed its identity as an agricultural state in decline to become an oil powerhouse second only to Texas. But that is not a universally shared perspective. He said that almost all problems found by his inspectors were corrected within 30 days of verbal warnings. Some 2,500 warnings were issued last year, Ms. Ritter said; only 4 percent resulted in a written violation and only nine complaints were filed (up from four in 2012). All told, the number of wells is up 200 percent and spills 650 percent since 2004. The most encouraging statistic, Mr. Helms told the farmers, was that a higher proportion of individual spills were being contained to production sites. That is true according to the numbers he uses. Without engaging in any data analysis, the farmers in Antler were suspicious of the spill estimates because they were based on self-reporting by the industry. Indeed, The Times found scores of cases on that website where the release of pollutants was not just undercounted but marked as zero. One supposedly zero-volume wastewater spill in Bottineau County last year required the removal of 600 dump-truck loads of contaminated soil. The state spills site posts incidents in chronological order, without summary statistics, and it is not searchable. Oil and gas enforcement data is not made public at all, unlike in Texas, where the legislature mandates quarterly reports. It found that companies in the Bakken spill at different rates. This suggests to some experts that companies could do more to prevent and minimize environmental incidents. Interactive Database Spills in North Dakota Open Interactive Database This database contains all reported spills from Jan. 1, 2006, to Oct. 13, 2014. Based on volume, Statoil has produced 9,000 gallons of oil for every gallon of spillage; Continental has produced 3,500. Statoil contained some 70 percent of its spill volume to production sites. Continental contained less than half, The Times found. And I totally understand why. The public never knew the blowout had occurred because the well, like many new wells, had been granted confidential status by the state for competitive reasons; almost everything except its existence was off the record for six months. Oil, water and chemicals shot 40 feet into the air from the wellhead but did not ignite. One worker was injured with a broken finger and bruises to his head and chest, the sheriff said. The oil misted over hundreds of acres, contaminating hundreds of bales of hay and alfalfa fields. They left no stones unturned, as far as I was concerned. Mr. Rohr, the injured driller, sued Continental Resources. The case was settled. Rich Addicks for The New York Times The wreckage of the rig Mr. Rohr and his co-workers were working on. Erick J. Hartse During the voir dire process, many prospective jurors had revealed just how interwoven their lives were not only with the oil industry, but also with Continental. Some had worked for or done business with Continental; others owned its stock or received royalty checks from Continental wells. Asked if they had strong feelings about the oil boom, almost all, even those who saw the positive, raised their hands to say they thought it had had negative consequences, too. The next morning, a settlement was reached. Later, in a nearby hotel, sitting with his lawyers, his wife and a former co-worker, Mr. Rohr lifted his T-shirt to reveal what he had been prepared to show the jury: his pink, waffled back, patched together through skin grafts after the rig at the Beaver Creek State 1-36H well exploded into flames on July 24, 2011. And then that big blast hit me. I was a big ball of flame, running out of there, my safety glasses melting around my eyes. I thought I was blind. Mr. Rohr, who is called A.J., stared into his coffee cup, crying. Erick Hartse, 23, who had been his assistant driller and escaped injury in the blowout, winced. Mr. Rohr and two colleagues were airlifted to a burn center in Minneapolis. With serious burns over 60 percent of his body. Mr. Rohr spent a month hospitalized. Still in constant pain and reliant on painkillers, he has not returned to the oil fields, the only job he has ever known. The two men and their boss, Wally Dschaak, said they thought from the start that the well, situated in a remote, serene spot about a mile from the Little Missouri River, was going to give them trouble. Continental, which declined to discuss the case, imported oil fire specialists from Texas to extinguish the blaze. Later, Cyclone sent Mr. Hartse to Wyoming to help build a replacement rig, he said, but did not allow him to accompany it back to North Dakota.

It is considered the largest on-land oil spill in recent American history, not the largest ever. We would love to hear from you.
