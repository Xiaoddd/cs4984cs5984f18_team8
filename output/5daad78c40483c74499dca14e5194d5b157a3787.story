Read more about sharing. Only five of the 27 countries do so. Mr Mattis said members must show progress this year and adopt a plan to increase their contributions, even if slowly. Only the US, UK, Estonia, Greece and Poland currently meet the target, but others are on course to reach that level. The US defence chief added that investing in common defence was vital, and cited the threats that have emerged since 2014, such as the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the rise of so-called Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, on the southern border of member Turkey. Europe on notice: By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent General James Mattis, the former Nato insider, has delivered a thunderbolt aimed at the complacency of many of Washington's European allies. He has put them on notice. No longer will the US taxpayer bear a disproportionate share of the defence burden. Quite what this means is unclear. Well that's a proposition presumably that Gen Mattis believes will not be tested. He must hope that his warning, and a warning it was - however eloquent and hedged around with words of reassurance - will force Nato allies to pay more. This debate matters now more than ever because there is a new species of US president with few of the predictable reflexes of previous occupants of the White House. There is also a resurgent Russian threat and a diverse array of worrying challenges on Nato's southern flank. The US has deployed thousands of troops and hundreds of vehicles to the alliance's eastern borders to reassure its allies. Now they are going to have to foot more of the bill. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said alliance members were already increasing their contributions. The meeting was held amid concern over the new administration's ties with Russia and the resignation of Michael Flynn as US national security adviser. But Mr Mattis showed strong support for the alliance, hailing its ability to respond to security challenges. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.
