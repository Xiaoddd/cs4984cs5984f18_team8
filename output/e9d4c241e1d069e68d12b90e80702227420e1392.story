Support for concentrating on alternative energy is up slightly since December 2014. There continue to be wide political differences on energy priorities. While a 2016 Pew Research Center survey found large majorities of Democrats and Republicans supported expanding both wind and solar energy, the new survey shows that Democrats remain far more likely than Republicans to stress that developing alternative energy should take priority over developing fossil fuel sources. There is an ideological divide in these views within the GOP. Political differences over energy priorities are broadly in keeping with polarized views on a wide range of climate and energy issues. Americans under the age of 50 are especially likely to support alternative energy sources over expanding fossil fuels. Older adults are more divided in their views, though they also give more priority to alternatives. Note: These findings are based on a Pew Research Center survey conducted Jan. 4-9, 2017 with a nationally representative sample of 1,502 U.S. adults. The full methodology can be found here, and the questionnaire wording and topline are here (PDF).
