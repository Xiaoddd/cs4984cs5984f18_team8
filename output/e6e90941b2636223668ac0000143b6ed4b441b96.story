DAKOTA ACCESS Tribes to court: Shut down pipeline Ellen M. Gilmer, E&E News reporter Published: Tuesday, August 8, 2017 Earthjustice attorney Jan Hasselman, representing the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and Fredericks Peebles & Morgan attorney Nicole Ducheneaux, representing the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, speak outside a federal courthouse after a court hearing in June. That's the latest battleground over the long-contentious oil project. After the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in June ruled that an environmental assessment for the pipeline was missing a few critical elements, both sides are now wrestling over what should happen to Dakota Access while the Army Corps of Engineers sharpens its review. To the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes, the answer is clear: Oil cannot continue flowing. The Army Corps said last month that its revised review, which will focus on the pipeline's potential oil spill risk, environmental justice impacts and effects on tribal fishing and hunting rights, will likely be complete in December. If the court vacates underlying permits now, the company would face costly shutdown procedures and months of disruption in the interim. Much of his analysis will rely on what's known as the Allied-Signal test, established in a U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit case in 1993. Under the standard, Boasberg will consider two things: whether the Army Corps will likely be able to support its original decision on remand and whether vacating the decision would have disruptive consequences. In their own briefs to the court last month, government and Dakota Access lawyers argued that it would be unnecessary and harmful to shut off the pipeline now. The tribes listed a number of cases in which complete projects have been stalled or shut down after courts have found NEPA violations, including a small Montana gas pipeline that was shut off for a month for NEPA violations and a Colorado coal plant whose permits were vacated while regulators improved their environmental review. 'NEPA does not work after-the-fact' More than a dozen law professors chimed in with their own arguments in favor of shutting down the pipeline while the Army Corps supplements its review. In an amicus brief filed yesterday, 18 professors and practitioners argued that allowing Dakota Access to remain in service would undermine NEPA. The professors were led by Bill Snape, a faculty fellow and assistant dean at American University's Washington College of Law, who also works as an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity. Others signing on include the University of New Mexico School of Law's Clifford Villa, George Washington University School of Law's Robert Glicksman, Vermont Law School's Pat Parenteau, the University of Wyoming College of Law's Sam Kalen and several more. In another amicus brief, tribal advocacy groups and 14 tribes also pushed the court to vacate the underlying permits for the Lake Oahe crossing and take the line out of service. Timeline Yesterday's briefs are the latest round in what has been a dramatic year of litigation over Dakota Access. The tribes sued last summer, arguing that the Army Corps did not adequately consider the pipeline's potential impacts on the tribes and the environment, especially at the crossing of Lake Oahe, a dammed section of the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. They were dealt preliminary losses in the courtroom last fall before the Obama administration committed to performing an in-depth environmental impact statement to weigh the final approval to cross Lake Oahe. President Trump took office and quickly reversed the plans, ordering the Army Corps to make a swift final decision. The agency issued the easement in February, setting off a flurry of new legal filings that led to the June court decision finding the Army Corps' review partially flawed. The Trump administration, Dakota Access and supporters will file additional briefs next week on whether the pipeline should stay in service, and opponents will have a final chance to weigh in at the end of the month. Boasberg could issue a decision sometime in September. pipelines Related Headlines PIPELINES FERC restarts Atlantic Coast project Energywire: Tuesday, September 18, 2018 PIPELINES N.Y. project backer heads back to court Energywire: Tuesday, September 18, 2018 PIPELINES Warren, Markey press company, regulators on Mass. blasts E&E Daily: Tuesday, September 18, 2018 PIPELINES NTSB homes in on cause of deadly Mass.
