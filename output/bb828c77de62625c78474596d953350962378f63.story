The media are clearing out, packing up satellite trucks and heading home. White allies who showed up in solidarity are breathing a sigh of relief. For them, the day is won, the black snake is dead, and it's time to head home. But for the indigenous people they are leaving behind, the fight will rage on, harder than ever before. The Lakota Sioux people and their guests from around the globe built a veritable small city at Oceti Sakowin Camp in order to hold ground at Standing Rock, and now that the harsh North Dakota winter is settling in, they could be left with a bigger fight and fewer resources to fight it if the battle continues. At night, communal sleeping spaces are organized with burning wood stoves. People climb the hills above Highway 1806 to the north of Oceti Sakowin Camp to get a better view of the police presence beyond the blockades. The Army Corp of Engineers declined to grant Energy Transfer Partners, the corporation building the pipeline, the easement necessary to cross under Lake Oahe, and they called for environmental impact studies for alternative routes. But ETP doesn't intend to stop plowing through Sioux treaty lands, and Republicans are already bragging that once Donald Trump is in office, the pipeline will carry on as planned. This is big-government decision-making at its worst. I look forward to putting this anti-energy presidency behind us. The short-term victory against the pipeline effort was won by putting bodies on the line to occupy territory. The unintended consequence of celebration could be that those bodies become a scarce resource. When the North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple announced, falsely, that Standing Rock would be forced to evacuate, reinforcements still came. Now, many of the Lakota Sioux and the Standing Rock resistance allies believe that all of the fanfare around the declared victory will just be another attempted deterrent, but this time using the illusion of success to convince the Sioux that their job is done, and that they can head home. A blizzard battles Oceti Sakowin Camp the day after the victory announcement. It's an area of the North Dakota plains that the indigenous rarely settle due to harsh winters, and the camp is already struggling to winterize structures and keep the roads clear as the first blizzards set in. But they're not leaving. All rights reserved.
