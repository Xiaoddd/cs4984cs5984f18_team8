The coalition has threatened to start disrupting business within Wells Fargo branches throughout the city unless the bank removes its money from the Dakota Access Pipeline. The coalition is building towards a mass day of action on January 5th, when dozens of Wells Fargo customers will show their support for Standing Rock by closing their accounts. In less than a week, the coalition has grown to include a number of groups; including Ndns for Justice, 350 Seattle, Coalition of Anti-Racist Whites, Seattle for Standing Rock, Our Revolution, the Green Party WA, the Green Party Seattle, the 43rd Progressives and the Buddhist Peace Fellowship.
