Rick Perry has held a paid position on the board of directors of Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the controversial project. Native American rights activists and environmentalists have protested the oil pipeline over concerns that it could endanger water supplies and damage sacred grounds. The project was put on hold last week when the Army Corps of Engineers refused to issue a permit that ETP needs to complete construction. But that delay may only be temporary; even before the Perry announcement, the incoming Trump administration publicly supported the pipeline. Perry has been a vocal advocate for the Dakota Access Pipeline. The Energy Department plays no formal role in approving pipeline construction. But as a Cabinet-level official, Perry could have a voice in administration decisions on these areas.
