Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Petition Closed Honor the Fort Laramie Treaties This petition had 6,715 supporters Citizens of the United States started this petition to President of the United States of America Barack Obama We, the undersigned citizens of the United States, demand that the President of the United States and our highest representatives in the federal government uphold the territorial and water rights of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, as protected by the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1851 and the Sioux Nation Treaty at Fort Laramie of 1868, as well as subsequent agreements. As citizens of the United States, we are parties to those treaties. We recognize that these treaties are living documents that must be honored. We urge the President to uphold his reputation for integrity and usher in a new era of renewed treaty-based relationships with Native nations, beginning with halting the Dakota Access Pipeline. (U.S. Department of the Interior, Indian Affairs, Frequently Asked Questions. We understand that DAPL will transect the permanent homeland of the Dakota and Lakota people, crossing the Missouri River and the Ogallala Aquifer at sites, including Lake Oahe, which pose a significant threat to the water supply of those nations, threatening their inherent human rights to clean water and their homelands, both of which are protected under the Fort Laramie treaties. As parties to those treaties, and all subsequent agreements between the United States and the Sioux Nation, we demand that those rights be respected and upheld. (25 U.S.C. Section 71). As U.S. citizens we refuse to turn a blind eye to this situation, not at Standing Rock or anywhere else that treaty rights are threatened. The Native nations have upheld their end of the bargain; it is time the U.S. government did the same. Finally, as global citizens impacted by a growing climate crisis, we ask the President to stand with those who have gathered at Sacred Stone Camp to protect the water supply of countless citizens who rely on the Ogallala Aquifer, and to insist on adaptive solutions to climate change. Only by standing together with Native nations in reciprocal, just relations will we see the change that will lead us through this collective, transnational and intergenerational challenge.
