The tribes argued that construction under the lake violated their right to practice their religion, which relies on clean water, and they wanted the work suspended until the claim could be resolved. When they filed the lawsuit last summer, the tribes argued that the pipeline threatened Native American cultural sites and their water supply. Their religion argument was new, however, and disputed by both the corps and the company. Boasberg said he was likely to allow the tribes to continue making the religion argument, though he did not think it was likely to succeed. Native Americans are planning four days of activities, including lobbying lawmakers and culminating in a march on the White House. Tribal members and supporters plan to camp each day on the National Mall, with tipis, a ceremonial fire, cultural workshops and speakers. Both tribes also have asked Boasberg to overturn the federal permission for the Lake Oahe crossing and to bar the corps from granting permission in the future. The pipeline saga has endured for months. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of pipeline opponents who sided with tribal opposition to the pipeline camped on federal land near the drill site for months, often clashing with police. There have been about 750 arrests in the region since August. Authorities last month closed the camp in advance of spring flooding season and set up roadblocks to prevent protesters from returning. Work under Lake Oahe had been held up in the courts until Trump last month instructed the corps to advance construction. The army is involved because its engineering branch manages the river and its system of hydroelectric dams, which is owned by the federal government. ETP began drilling under the lake 8 February.The company attorney William Scherman said in court documents that the pipeline could be moving oil as early as next week.
