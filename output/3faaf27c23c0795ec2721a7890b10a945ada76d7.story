Please include any car, home, personal or small business loans. We will not sell or share financial data in connection with your name or email. If you are thinking of moving your money to a bank not financing the Dakota Access Pipeline, please note where you currently bank so that we can have greater and more specific impact. The vast majority of you have signed the Equator Principles, in which you commit to resolve differences to the satisfaction of Indigenous peoples. And, according to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, you all have a responsibility to respect human rights and remediate human rights violations linked to your business operations. The militarized police actions against peaceful and unarmed water protectors have been widely and publicly condemned, and may result in a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into police misconduct and civil rights abuses. Continuing to finance DAPL signals your approval of the use of militarized force against those asserting their First Amendment rights and traditional spiritual beliefs and practices, and disregard for Indigenous responsibilities to protect people, lands and water. We demand that you discontinue DAPL loan disbursements until outstanding issues with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Seven Council Fires of the Great Sioux Nation - Oceti Sakowin are resolved, and Equator Principle 5, which requires Free, Prior and Informed Consent from Indigenous peoples, is upheld. For months the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Oceti Sakowin headmen and elders, other Indigenous peoples and other water protectors and allies have been under siege while peacefully and prayerfully resisting the DAPL. The pipeline was approved without environmental reviews, adequate assessment of cultural properties and sacred sites, or the Free, Prior and Informed Consent of the Standing Rock Sioux affirmed in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This could lead to banks financing an illegal activity. ETP and Sunoco are rushing to build a pipeline that is economically unnecessary today, and will become a stranded asset as the world moves away from climate-destroying fuels. The Morton County Sheriff's Department has violently repressed the water protectors in service of the corporate desperation to meet this timeline. These banks now face a clear opportunity to reconsider further funding a project steeped in controversy and demonstrating material loss. Now these lenders must take a stand. It is time for these banks to cut their losses and for us to turn up the heat. Sign this petition to support the sovereignty and rights of Indigenous peoples and hold DAPL banks accountable.
