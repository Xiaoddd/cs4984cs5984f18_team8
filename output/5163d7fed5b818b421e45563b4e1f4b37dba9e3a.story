The Army, which owns the land on each side of the river, announced on Dec. 3 it will deny an easement to Energy Transfer Partners, blocking construction under the water, instead calling for an environmental impact statement to look at possible alternative routes. So after a day of joyous celebration last night, today we have to get ready for the next step. Already DAPL has issued a statement saying what was done last night won't deter them. The Tribe and their allies remain committed to waging the battle along several fronts. In the camps around the construction site, thousands of people, including citizens from 300 Native American Nations, remain gathered in a prayerful and peaceful community. Three thousand veterans joined advocates this weekend to stand with them against future construction. Monday afternoon, Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II participated in a webinar with financial investors to discuss the future viability of the DAPL. We thank the tribal youth who initiated this movement. We thank the millions of people around the globe who expressed support for our cause. Who knows what may happen under a pro-pipeline Trump administration, and as legal challenges against the DAPL work through the courts. Always. What happened yesterday was that the United States government said that the needs of our native population must be a priority. That was historic. Regardless of what happens with the Dakota Access Pipeline, that moment - that acknowledgement - can't ever be taken away. So as the water protectors celebrate being heard, many plan to stay vigilant in the camps until the last pieces of machinery are removed from the construction site, even though Tribe Chairman Archambault asked them to go home for the winter. Give thanks for the remarkable leadership of the Standing Rock Sioux Nation, their allied water protectors, and the millions of people around the world who have declared their solidarity in standing with Standing Rock. After this much needed moment of joy and gratitude, our work continues. Please review our Community Guidelines before posting a comment. If you have any questions, contact us.
