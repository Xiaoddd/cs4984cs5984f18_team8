Masked agitators vandalizing property, making threats, and attacking law enforcement became an almost daily part of life for people who lived in that area. Such laws have been implemented against a diverse list of extremist movements, from the Ku Klux Klan to Occupy Wall Street. Such laws have been implemented against a diverse list of extremist movements, from the Ku Klux Klan to Occupy Wall Street. Probably not. While the motivations are understandable, the policy is misguided. People wear masks for a lot of perfectly legitimate reasons, as the list of exemptions in the proposed legislation attests. Should this bill become law, a mask worn for a holiday or for a parade or because of the weather would be legal, but a mask worn during a demonstration would not be. This makes me think of the wrong-headed arguments people often make against guns. But those of us who support gun rights point out that guns do not commit crimes. They are a tool, with a number of perfectly legitimate uses. The same can be said of masks. People commit crimes. Outlawing the wearing of masks would accomplish very little, other than perhaps allowing law enforcement to sometimes arrest people at political demonstrations for wearing masks.
