Standing Rock is currently battling construction of an oil pipeline in North Dakota. The position also undercuts a key element of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples which the Trudeau government has claimed it plans to embrace as part of its efforts toward reconciliation. Simon was referring to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe which is currently trying to stop construction of an oil pipeline through North Dakota. Simon is one of the lead spokespeople for an anti-pipeline alliance supported by about 85 First Nations and tribes which have signed a treaty to oppose new oil pipeline projects. The 1,150 kilometre pipeline project would run from Edmonton to Burnaby, B.C. The government only believes it needs to consult and accommodate. That is the full spectrum. In its 2004 Haida decision, the Supreme Court, quoting the previous 1997 Delgamuukw decision, describes the spectrum of consultation. Time to call non-confidence, with a full investigation into the Governments behavior on these matters and more in the last Decade. If we do not, we will most certainly lose control of our own Country. I stand with First Nations, and will do so until I die. Our Government is openly lying to the Canadian voters and it is going to STOP one way or another. LIne ( seems like a good choice. Twenty DPLPROTESTS may be the minimum.
