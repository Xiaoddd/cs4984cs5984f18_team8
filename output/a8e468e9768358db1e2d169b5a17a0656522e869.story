On Dec 4 there will be over 2000 veterans arriving at Standing Rock in support of the Water Protectors. There have been numerous human, ethical and constitutional violations, by both the oil company and local and federal government. The Water Protectors cannot fight this battle alone, this issue is bigger than any individual person, race, religion, and creed. This issue will affect each and every one of us regardless of the outcome. We must put off our individual political views that seem to have torn our country in half, and we need to come together on this issue. Please help me spread the word. You can help out by Liking the post, sharing the post and or donating anything you can. All money received will go towards food and resources If I had it my way I would stay until the end but financially this is not possible. Please help do your part in protecting our rights and the future of our planet. I returned from Standing Rock earlier then I would have liked to. The Lakota Dakota Nakota people asked us to leave because of weather conditions. While I was there we were hit with a blizzard, something I have never experienced before. It was -20 degrees and the winds were howling at 40 mph. There were quite a few tents that were blown over, some caught fire. It was a bit chaotic at times but many of us kept our composure and worked together in attempts to make sure everyone was safe, and as warm as can be. I fell like I captured some amazing photos, I am currently tying to edit it down to 12-15 photos. As soon as I feel like the story is ready, i will let all of you know. Thanks again.
