Say what you want about the protest movement, but their propaganda game is strong. It also demonstrates just how important it is to equip North Dakota cops with body cameras. In this digital age we can count on just about every interaction between law enforcement and the public to be recorded, and perhaps even live streamed, for the internet. The Legislature should fund cameras for every law enforcement department in the state. Nor has the Legislature done much in the way of addressing the potential for body cameras with policy. The state needs to do more. The Legislature should fund cameras for every law enforcement department in the state. It will be expensive, I know, and the state is going to enter this budgeting cycle looking for ways to cut spending rather than expand it. And in addition to funding the cameras, lawmakers should pass more detailed legislation defining specifically when law enforcement officers must have their cameras on, when they are allowed to turn them off, and what footage from the cameras is available to the public as well as how long law enforcement must retain their footage. On that last point, lawmakers should ensure there is only very little footage exempted from public requests. Law enforcement is facing more scrutiny than ever. This needs to happen, and sooner rather than later.
