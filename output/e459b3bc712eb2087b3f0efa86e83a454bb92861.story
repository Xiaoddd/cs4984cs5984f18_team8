I've camped in Teddy Roosevelt National Park and seen a bull snake that was five feet long. I've been in Fargo and I've been through Bismark and I've seen Native American poverty from my car window. The shale oil and gas boom was still two decades away. Two months ago I shipped a carton of winter coats and clothing to the Standing Rock encampment, where thousands of people are now protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the serious threats it poses to water and environmental safety and to indigenous peoples' culture and autonomy. I have friends and acquaintances who have done a lot more than ship clothing to North Dakota. This pipeline is slated to carry Bakken Crude Shale Oil, fracked in North Dakota, beneath 200 different waterways to a refinery in Chicago. The original plans called for it to cross under the Missouri River close to Bismarck, ND. No man-made thing lasts forever, pipelines routinely leak. I have come to understand that they are fighting for all of us. They are first and foremost protecting the Earth and are on the frontline against global warming, willing to risk their lives. It would be fully consistent with American history for some Native leaders to be murdered in these actions. Every day at the camp there is two-hour non-violent training session. On a day that I attended there were over 50 people, mostly new arrivals from the Comanche Nation in Oklahoma. It was repeatedly stressed that this is non-violent, peaceful action and that is under the rubric of Ceremony. There are about 40 teepees and hundreds of tents at Standing Rock, housing about 1500 people. Over 300 Native Nations have sent representatives at different times in this unprecedented show of unity. Each time a delegation arrives they are invited to the main circle to share a dance and a sacred song. The challenge now is how to winterize for the brutal North Dakota winter. Several times during Yom Kippur we collectively confess a long list of misdeeds against other. It acknowledges that we all make mistakes and that each of us bears responsibility. We intone throughout the day the compassionate qualities of the Divine as we pray for forgiveness for our transgressions against other people. White America has stolen, lied and spoken slander about Native Nations for over 500 years. This year Yom Kippur is October 12 the original Columbus Day. . . America must atone for the ongoing genocide of our First Inhabitants, genocide is legally defined as the intentional destruction of a people and that is what the policies and practices have been intended to do. We can act to change the situation. THE PEOPLE HERE ARE GREAT This comes from Jewish Currents readers Josh Freeman and Patricia Kelly, who cut short their Thanksgiving holiday to drive from Chicago to North Dakota to assist as medics: Long ride, with many miles of fog, then snow.

About 20 feet in circumference, with supplies in messy boxes and cases around the edge and a few white plastic lawn chairs for patients. With a table in back for patients who need to lay down or providers. We were told to not change the order of anything. This to us and an ER nurse from California.

There are four cook tents with fabulous food. Tonight, we went over and had moose meatloaf and tapenade, cheesy vegetables, fresh pineapple for desert. Really great. So we are sleeping in the medical tent, which is a yurt full of medicines in plastics bins and a few chairs to see folks. Mostly respiratory problems, aggravated by the cold and wood smoke. Minor injuries. Strep. Someone gave us brand new sleeping bags. There is a larger 'warming' tent where Josh is now. Hopefully, the night will be calm. And that the people are great. Here's an interview with her father, Wayne Wilansky, who followed up on November 23rd with a call to President Obama to halt the pipeline's construction. And Bernie Sanders, an early supporter of the protests, has called on Obama to turn the site into a protected federal monument. So those are the three issues there. I think what we have done is, number one, demanded that the president do what he did with Keystone. A lot of people put a lot of pressure on the president, and he finally did the right thing. And that is to kill the Keystone pipeline, which, by the way, under a Trump may be reopened again. But that is what he should be doing. And certainly, the demand must go to the North Dakota authorities that the kind of military presence that exists there is simply not what is acceptable. So, we have written to the president. We are going to continue to put pressure on the president to do everything he can to protect the Native Americans in the area and the protesters in the area. Standing Rock is an incredibly well-organized protest movement that is setting a model for cross-cultural outreach.

And certainly, the demand must go to the North Dakota authorities that the kind of military presence that exists there is simply not what is acceptable. So, we have written to the president. This essay appears in our 2018 Summer Supplement. It was November 2009, deep in the Great Recession. The inconvenient truth of climate change was beginning to sink in. Obama had not closed Guantanamo or ended the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan. As humans, we were anxious. As artists, we wanted to be of use. There were strict house rules about everything from how to hang our towels to how to wash the cutlery; we were chastised harshly when we got it wrong. The groups were all doing important work on a range of issues, but the meetings themselves were strained. For her part, Marta seemed largely uninterested in what we did back home, if a touch repelled by the entitlement and indulgences inherent in being an American artist at all. Her region still had one of the highest murder rates in the Americas. Multinational corporations were plundering the country and the world. There was real work to be done. It was the beginning of my sense that art and activism were two divergent paths, though since then, the state of the world has continually compelled me to try to reconcile them. Occupy Wall Street happened while I was getting my MFA in fiction, and I spent a good deal of time at Zuccotti while being careful not to join anything. Then came the 2014 assault on Gaza. Working it out in writing was not an option; I already felt desperately alone. But more often, the task of trying to graft my creative practice and concerns onto movement work has felt isolated and ill-fitting. Fair enough: these are effective and necessary tactics, and ones that activists are uniquely qualified to carry out. But even direct action itself, with its aspiration to spectacle, its myriad opportunities for performance and design and creative direction, is too often carried out artlessly, the imaginative potentialities reduced to the plane of a sloganed banner. I asked them. The rest of us, I argued, need something more nourishing, more beautiful. We copied it onto butcher paper in orange Sharpie and hung it at the front of the room. Our collaborative workshops were some of our least successful activities, exposing the difficulty in facilitating collective creation processes in groups brought together foremost by politics as opposed to aesthetics. like finding a suitable role for artists in a movement led by activists was a classic case of square peg, round hole. They are prostrate to higher values, motivated by desire for impact. And until we manage to bring the revolution, the volunteer nature of so much movement work will continue to exploit artists, an already notoriously underpaid group. But there are deeper incompatibilities. In their mandate to be awake to life, and to awaken others, the sympathies of artists and activists seemingly align. Activism wants unity, it wants simple slogans and decisive rhetoric. Art wants things grayer, messier, and on personal terms. Activism demands allegiance. Art knows no allegiances save those of practice and form. Artists think activists are myopic, and distrust them because orthodoxy is ugly and boring. Activism expects art to explain itself, to proffer a reason for being. Though these two belief systems are not always at odds, they are simply not the same thing. Angels in America, which debuted near the height of the AIDS crisis and talks politics endlessly, is definitively art. The majority of this work is as eminently forgettable as it is common. But we can identify some instructive examples. And there are also those exceedingly rare works that seem equally successful at both, often by using their form to bear a unique kind of witness, helping us digest enormous horror at the scale of the individual. Perhaps. I take for granted that our current struggles need every one of us, giving what we can, and that artists, who know how to attract people, how to leach their message into a culture, how to bring people into contact with life, have a special role to play. This makes me want to build a fence around my sacred practice, to serve no one but the one true God, the God of Art, forever and ever, amen. Suddenly anything felt possible, if only in the most alarming sense. In this awful state of unknowing, the idea of spending my time futzing around with sentences, with the lives of made up people, seemed utterly deranged. I was not alone. And yet, as Hane alludes to in his essay, the gripping experience of creating or enjoying art is one of our greatest weapons against the concession of our inner lives. I am tempted once again to resign my post in shame. Fuck art, I think. Give me bodies on the line. And yet, what a way for the lesson to reach us. Written only after the means of production have been destroyed. Remember, Roosevelt turned away the asylum-seekers on the St. Louis, sending hundreds to their deaths. Camus wrote The Stranger from 1940s occupied Paris, nary a Nazi in its pages. And for those of us who still feel the pull to a more direct form of activism, perhaps there is an opportunity, not to organize with the activists, but to organize ourselves as artists, to form our own revolutionary groups in the tradition and spirit of the Situationists, taking as a starting point our tools and tactics, building around our mandates and strengths. And we can serve them better, too, in a manner that does not depend on our self-negation or even selflessness, but on our talent for transcending time and shifting ground, for remaking the future in our image. These vignettes came out of a particular set of interviews in Miami Beach, then a great if already fading community for the Jewish Old Left (Jewish Currents founder-editor Morris Schappes provided inspiration and contacts). I loved these old-timers, and they seemed very attached to me: I wanted to hear about their lives. I hardly knew my own (gentile) grandparents, and I was happy to be adopted, even for a short while. Those closest to Jewish Currents were, from my recollection, the most clear-eyed about the past. They regretted the illusions they had had about Russia, but they considered themselves fortunate to have been in so many good struggles, and to have kept many of the same friends they had known since their first years in America. We had a needles trade union of our own. and it was Red. But we had to go back to the ILG with our heads down. People are old and sick and dying. But our paper gives us something to live for. If we are the last Yiddish socialist generation We will carry on until the end. Someone called her a Pepper Pot of a Woman. Sasha Zimmerman, his boss Dubinsky was against us but his door was always open to me. We settled problems right away. The bosses got away with nothing. He was very progressive but quiet. He gave a lot of money to the movement. Down here, we had events for everything that the movement needed. When he died, a blonde pianist and Yiddish music scholar Pursued me, sang to me in concerts Even while his wife was dying at home. But when she died, he married me. And we published his music books. The young people, they sit out at night in the cafes, some have guitars and they sing. Boyfriends and girlfriends just like anywhere else. Just ordinary. And before my friends would arrive. We wanted a place to be close to each other And carry on our politics and culture. We had wonderful times. We always supported progressives and opposed the wars. Now we are all dying. The young people are Cuban, and they hate us. TRANSGENDER BODIES are often stripped of our spirituality and mysticism. I struggled to articulate why the ritual felt as necessary as the anesthesia or scalpel. She explained that we keep mezuzot on our doorposts to mark the transition from one space to another, physically and spiritually. Articulating the transition, the before and after, is crucial to building the ritual. We both knew the traditional trans narrative: trans person is sad, trans person has a dangerous and tumultuous coming out, trans person has surgery, trans person is finally worthy of love and acceptance. Trans person is palatable; trans person is less likely to die at the end of the film. Trans Jew goes to the mikveh to mark the transition from incomplete to complete. I hope those people are doing well. I hope we both survive to the end of the film. I periodically get side-eyed in either bathroom. My hair is long and thick and curly and out of control, not shorn in that cute, tight butch cut all my transmasculine friends have. I would have to take my makeup off before stepping into the mikveh. I was not going from the bad kind of trans to the good kind of trans. It said my body had always been good enough for kindness, and that this impending change, this shift in shape, was not because I was a broken, bent gear in need of sanding down. stayed with me for weeks before I found an answer. I was not marking the linear transition from one gender to another. I was not marking the transition from the wrong kind to the right kind of trans. I was marking my transition through Jewish time, and my right to stay within it. The mikveh created space to embrace the transition I was already experiencing; it held my trans body in a way that both the medical industrial complex and the secular world refuse to. I sobbed through most of the ritual. I had to really work to get the Hebrew of the prayers past my lips. Min hameitzar karati Yah, anani vamerchav Yah. Out of a narrow place, I called to God. We sang the shehecheyanu and every part of my body touched the water. The power of being within that moment, singing holy words that recognize the beauty and magnitude of change, has not left me. It continues to compel me to stay within Jewish spaces, and to demand that my trans-ness is non-negotiable. Our Jewish and queer seminal stories are ones of crossing over: survival and transformation in the face of despair and decimation. There is no way to unwind the braided existence of my gender deviance and my Jewishness. I went to the mikveh because I was called, by my ancestors and by a future where trans Jews define our own lives, bodies, and ritual practices. Jayce Koester is a friendly trans Jewish witch living on occupied Dakota and Anishinaabe land (often called Minneapolis). FOR PROGRESSIVES ABROAD, it might seem like all news coming from Israel is bad news. But recent developments in the struggle against the deportation of African asylum seekers prove just how much power there is in coalition building, demonstrating how our demands are more than a zero-sum game. Netanyahu likely expected to defeat this opposition handily. Most asylum seekers live in the poor and marginalized neighborhoods of South Tel Aviv. Infrastructure and housing have crumbled. Drug use, prostitution, and human trafficking are rampant. The right wing has found its ultimate scapegoat in these vulnerable asylum seekers. For years, the Israeli right wing has promoted a simple equation: the interests of the African asylum seekers are in direct contradiction to those of the disenfranchised Mizrahi residents of the South Tel Aviv slums. This right-wing dichotomy was effective at first because it contained a kernel of truth. There is, and has long been, a connection between liberal political positions and economic status and ethnic background in Israel. Using this history, the right branded all defenders of the refugees as elitists, as haters of the Jewish poor. Not so differently from the politics of Trump and his allies, the right-wing political establishment and its tycoon buddies thus paradoxically portrayed themselves as standing with the lower classes while doing little to nothing to alleviate their conditions. Their message was simple but revolutionary: the right wing takes advantage of the plight of South Tel Aviv as an excuse to deport the refugees. As the government makes plans to deport the asylum seekers, these activists argued, they are already deporting the long-time residents of these neighborhoods; it is deportation through gentrification and the unchecked power of real estate agents who buy crumbling apartment buildings and tear them down to build luxury housing. Our activists, some of whom are themselves based in South Tel Aviv, supported the initiative as it was making its first steps. Assessing strategically, we supported a coalition that would include both the underprivileged residents of South Tel Aviv and the African asylum seekers, as well as allies from all over the country. Throwing ourselves into the struggle, we convened large, simultaneous volunteer meetings in several cities. These veteran and newly-recruited activists were organized into a network of small teams with clear goals. Standing Together was able to play an important role in this struggle for two main reasons. First, because we are not a traditional NGO: Standing Together is a grassroots movement that draws its strength from the energy and activism of its members. This is essential for any progressive campaign serious about winning. Secondly, we took a broad-sighted view of progressive politics, and insisted that economic and racial struggles cannot remain separated. For us, the plight of the poor, socially excluded Jewish residents of South Tel Aviv was on equal footing with that of the African asylum seekers. The electoral behavior of these poor Jewish communities sometimes positions them as the base of the right wing (analogous, perhaps, to the white working-class Americans who voted for Donald Trump). But this doesn't need to be the case. When we show these groups respect, rather than treating them as ignorant reactionaries, coalitions and wins are possible. Almost overnight, the public sphere of these neighborhoods changed. But walking in the street in South Tel Aviv, with balcony after balcony bearing these banners, anyone could see that behind every window and every home lived a person or family who supported the rights of both Israeli residents and asylum seekers. There we knocked on doors, canvassed in the streets, and got numerous people to publicly express their willingness to have asylum seekers live in their part of town, calling for the Tel Aviv municipality to allocate greater municipal funds to the urgent problems of the southern neighborhoods. Throughout this campaign, we consistently emphasized the responsibility of the government. Together we rewrote the dichotomy on which the right had so long depended. We made clear that the true elitists were those in the highest ranks of power, who scapegoated the refugees as a smokescreen for making private profit off of South Tel Aviv. At no time was this clearer than on February 24th, when 20,000 asylum seekers, South Tel Avivians, and activists from across the country demonstrated together. In previous years, pro-refugee demonstrations were organized by human rights NGOs and held in the manicured central squares of affluent Tel Aviv, the stage often dominated by line-ups of artists, celebrity intellectuals and liberal politicians. But this rally was different. Taking center stage were older Mizrahi women, long-time residents of these neighborhoods who spoke about their lives, the suffering their families and friends face due to government disregard for their living conditions, and about the realities of living alongside other poor people of African origin. Previous pro-refugee rallies were met with swift condemnation from Likud politicians. But this time, they were silent. On April 2nd, Netanyahu convened a press conference wherein he announced that an agreement had been reached with the UN. Half of the refugees would be granted asylum in Europe and North America, and the other half would remain in Israel, with permission to work and live in various cities throughout the country. Furthermore, he announced that specific budgets would be allocated to South Tel Aviv. Our victory celebrations were cut short when pressure from the right caused Netanyahu to announce the very next day his cancellation of the new agreement with the UN. Nevertheless, the plan to forcefully deport tens of thousands of asylum seekers has not reappeared. Clearly there is more fight ahead, but the lesson learned is one coming to organizations in Israel, America, and beyond. I met Keith Gessen in 2015 when he was a Fellow at the Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library. He was researching his second novel, which was then simply called Russia. The novel, which unfolds with unexpected humor, is about intimate relationships, familial and social, and the tests they are subjected to under different state regimes. It is also about the ease with which one can enter and leave certain ways of life, and who is free to make those choices. When I first wrote to you and told you how she made me think of my own, you said I was not the first person to tell you this. Keith Gessen: The book was always going to be about a guy who goes to Moscow to take care of his grandmother. Everything else was negotiable. But the role of the grandmother changed over time. I was very wary of turning her into a magic grandmother, the bearer of some occult knowledge or secret. A friend who I show my work to kept half-seriously suggesting that she should have stashed away some secret manuscript, for example about the Holocaust, which Andrei would find and then bring to the attention of the world. The book would be called The Holocaust Diary. Guaranteed best-seller. The breakthrough was when I realized that the grandmother and the socialism were actually part of the same story. It was a kind of gradual process of throwing out all the stuff that was boring or not part of the story: a long summary of Chapter 7 of Capital or a capsule biography of Marx. I was definitely trying to describe a very specific grandmother. One of the interesting things to me, actually, watching the recent resurgence of socialism in the US, has been how few young people care about Russia and its socialist experience at all. Which is as it should be. The experience with socialism of a poor country in the 20th century is not that relevant to a rich country in the 21st century. For the older characters it does sometimes have multiple valences. Some of it is their youth and their idealism. LG: It's been an exciting few weeks on that front here in the US, certainly in New York, with Ocasio-Cortez's win. Andrei becomes a socialist in Russia, though at the end of the novel, with his return to the US and his cushy academic job, it's not clear how steadfast that position will remain . . . In my case, it was my encounter with Russian capitalism. The ideological journey that Andrei goes through in the book is a journey that I took over the course of many more years. And that there were huge numbers of victims that everyone just wished would die off. And that the criminality and inequality that accompanied them were not some kind of aberration of capitalism, but capitalism as it actually exists in most places in the world. Once I realized that, I found myself holding a very different view of capitalism. Andrei, in the book, basically sees how his grandmother has been immiserated by the post-Soviet reforms, but it requires him meeting Sergei and the others for him to kind of put it together into a story that makes sense. As for Andrei when he comes back, I think he becomes a leftist professor. He teaches his students about the ravages of the post-Soviet reforms. He hangs out on the fringes of Occupy. He joins DSA. I hope he has the courage to support the grad students and the adjuncts in their fight for union protections. LG: The portrayal of antisemitism felt very deftly done and true. KG: Antisemitism is tricky. And they started this mass movement which eventually led to the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which tied US-Soviet trade relations to the Soviets' willingness to release Jews. But there were some problems. And while the American Jews may have believed that there was another Holocaust on the way, there wasn't. At least not after 1953. There were restrictions on Jews, and there was antisemitism in public life, but there weren't pogroms and there certainly wasn't a genocide. But once this movement got going, there was no stopping it. So the joke was on Israel. But it was also on the American Jews. There's a really nice story in David Bezmozgis's first collection, Natasha, about a Canadian doctor who was active in helping to free Soviet Jews having two immigrant families over for dinner and basically insisting that they compete to tell him the most horrible story about their lives in the USSR. And it was tricky, because I think my parents were genuinely very happy to have come here, and were grateful to the Jewish agencies. At the same time, they had no interest in organized Jewish religion, and also no one likes to be condescended to, especially when, you know, most of the people who came over at that time had multiple advanced degrees. It was a pretty sophisticated group. Anyway, to bring this up to the present, there was a period after the Soviet collapse when Jews became very prominent in Russian political and economic life. A disproportionate number of the early oligarchs were Jewish. And one of the reasons given for this is that because Jews were in many cases cut off from the legitimate Soviet economy, they had become adept at working in the gray and black markets, and when the whole country became a gray and black market, they were well-positioned to take advantage. Though in some cases, too, these people were quite successful in the official Soviet system. But it is part of the nationalist discourse, and it does come up now and again. And it doesn't usually come up. The Eastern Europeans came in and started arguing that communism was just as bad as Nazism, and that actually nationalism is good and healthy. In the US until very recently, Holocaust memory was deployed as a way of justifying the actions of Israel and also to argue that Jews couldn't possibly be oppressors because they had themselves been oppressed. Obviously there can be different uses of history and memory. One of the things that interested me in the novel was the grandmother's actual relationship to the communist past and the capitalist present. She hated communism. But she misses much of the life and culture of that time. IN THE EARLY HOURS of Thursday morning, the Israeli Knesset passed a sweeping law reserving the right to self-determination exclusively for the Jews. In recent years there have been those who have tried to undermine that and question the principles of our existence. Netanyahu was not speaking in metaphor. The legislation quite literally enshrines Israel as the nation-state of only the Jews, Hebrew as its only official language, Hatikva as its only national anthem, and the Star of David flag and menorah as its national symbols. For a country whose population is more than a fifth Arab (not including the 4.4 million Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank who live under Israeli blockade and occupation), the nation-state bill is a remarkable step toward codifying and entrenching systematic discrimination against Arabs in Israeli society and government policy. But apartheid is not the only logical comparison in global politics that comes to mind. And in Austria, the chancellor of the leading right-wing party, whose governing coalition includes a party with extensive ties to the Nazis, took a trip to Israel the same week that his government moved to close down mosques and expel imams from Austria. Of course, this bill is merely icing on the cake, a fine-point detailing of a fundamentally discriminatory societal arrangement that has long been obvious to anyone who has bothered to look. I've camped in Teddy Roosevelt National Park and seen a bull snake that was five feet long. I've been in Fargo and I've been through Bismark and I've seen Native American poverty from my car window. Two months ago I shipped a carton of winter coats and clothing to the Standing Rock encampment, where thousands of people are now protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the serious threats it poses to water and environmental safety and to indigenous peoples' culture and autonomy. I have friends and acquaintances who have done a lot more than ship clothing to North Dakota. This pipeline is slated to carry Bakken Crude Shale Oil, fracked in North Dakota, beneath 200 different waterways to a refinery in Chicago. The original plans called for it to cross under the Missouri River close to Bismarck, ND. No man-made thing lasts forever, pipelines routinely leak. I have come to understand that they are fighting for all of us. They are first and foremost protecting the Earth and are on the frontline against global warming, willing to risk their lives. Every day at the camp there is two-hour non-violent training session. On a day that I attended there were over 50 people, mostly new arrivals from the Comanche Nation in Oklahoma. It was repeatedly stressed that this is non-violent, peaceful action and that is under the rubric of Ceremony. There are about 40 teepees and hundreds of tents at Standing Rock, housing about 1500 people. Over 300 Native Nations have sent representatives at different times in this unprecedented show of unity. Each time a delegation arrives they are invited to the main circle to share a dance and a sacred song. Several times during Yom Kippur we collectively confess a long list of misdeeds against other. It acknowledges that we all make mistakes and that each of us bears responsibility. We intone throughout the day the compassionate qualities of the Divine as we pray for forgiveness for our transgressions against other people. This year Yom Kippur is October 12 the original Columbus Day. . Past the road closed sign. Then the encampment comes into sight. Flags, banners, people walking in the road. At the main entry, a check point with signs for no alcohol or drugs, no pictures, we are directed to the medical tent -- straight down and to the left. And windy). The medical tent is a mishmash. About 20 feet in circumference, with supplies in messy boxes and cases around the edge and a few white plastic lawn chairs for patients. With a table in back for patients who need to lay down or providers. We were told to not change the order of anything. This to us and an ER nurse from California. But there was an ER doc here for a few days and no one to cover last night. . . Because we were promptly volunteered to work tonight 8pm to 8am. There are four cook tents with fabulous food. Tonight, we went over and had moose meatloaf and tapenade, cheesy vegetables, fresh pineapple for desert. So we are sleeping in the medical tent, which is a yurt full of medicines in plastics bins and a few chairs to see folks. Mostly respiratory problems, aggravated by the cold and wood smoke. Minor injuries. Strep. Someone gave us brand new sleeping bags. There is a larger 'warming' tent where Josh is now. And Bernie Sanders, an early supporter of the protests, has called on Obama to turn the site into a protected federal monument. I think what we have done is, number one, demanded that the president do what he did with Keystone. A lot of people put a lot of pressure on the president, and he finally did the right thing. And that is to kill the Keystone pipeline, which, by the way, under a Trump may be reopened again. But that is what he should be doing. And certainly, the demand must go to the North Dakota authorities that the kind of military presence that exists there is simply not what is acceptable. So, we have written to the president.
