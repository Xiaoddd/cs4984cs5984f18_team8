A trio of excavators move earth along the Dakota Access pipeline route east of Williston in late July. The 1,172-mile Dakota Access Pipeline will transport oil from the Bakken oilfields to a transportation hub in Patoka, Ill. The landowners in the suit collectively own 11 separate pieces of land that make up about 9 miles of the pipeline route in Morton County, Zuger said. Land agents contracted by Dakota Access approached the landowners in 2014, telling them they had 30 days to consider the proposal or risk losing a 20 percent signing bonus, the lawsuit states. The agents also told some landowners in late 2014 that because the price of oil was going down, they should sign the agreements right away and they'd still get the money even though the pipeline might not be constructed, the complaint says. Vicki Anderson Granado, a spokeswoman for Energy Transfer Partners, the main developer behind the Dakota Access Pipeline, said the company doesn't comment on pending litigation. Dakota Access was still in the process of being served with the complaint, which means the legal answer will be due in about three weeks. The lawsuit is not the first time North Dakota landowners have complained about how land agents representing Dakota Access have treated them. Concerns also were raised to the North Dakota Public Service Commission when the pipeline was under review, with some landowners complaining about bullying tactics and threats of taking their land through eminent domain. Troy Coons, chairman of the Northwest Landowners Association, said he often hears complaints from landowners who don't feel they were treated fairly in easement negotiations.
