Thousands of protesters, including Native Americans from more than 100 tribes across the country, have traveled to North Dakota to help the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe block the Dakota Access Pipeline from being built. The Oceti Sakowin medical team, working with Standing Rock Sioux tribal medics, said that nearly 200 people got treatment for tear gas, hypothermia and blunt trauma. It was the latest in a series of violent clashes over the fall. But Dakota Access crews began bulldozing anyway, leading to a violent confrontation between protesters and security guards. The Standing Rock Sioux went to federal court to prevent the Dakota Access Pipeline bulldozers from further destroying sacred sites. A US district judge temporarily stopped work on the pipeline, but then issued a ruling clearing the way for work to continue. A lawyer for the tribe stated that they would appeal the decision. The parent company of Dakota Access LLC is Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, whose board of directors includes Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas and whose investors include President-Elect, Donald Trump. The Threat The pipeline is being built near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Residents of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation immediately petitioned the US Army Corps of Engineers to deny the final permit. In April, residents of the reservation and supporters from other tribes set up camp near the construction site to keep an eye on the pipeline workers who were waiting for approval and preparing to break ground. Standing Rock youth launched a petition called Rezpect our Water, and in mid-July set out on a 500-mile relay run to Washington, DC to deliver a petition of 160,000 signatures. Officials at the Department of the Interior, the EPA and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation voiced concerns. Dozens of environmental groups joined together to oppose it and celebrities spoke out, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Shailene Woodley and Jason Momoa and his Justice League co-stars, including Ben Affleck. The Army Corps of Engineers approved the permit in July. On Aug. 10, construction began and a dozen demonstrators were arrested as they tried to stop it. With thousands of protesters still gathered, Gov. Jack Dalrymple declared a state of emergency on Aug. 19. On August 24, hundreds of protesters gathered in Washington, DC, in front of the federal courthouse waiting for a decision in the case, but the decision was delayed for further review. Shortly afterwards, the federal government issued a statement urging the company to pause construction. The Process The Dakota Access pipeline was fast-tracked from the beginning, using the Nationwide Permit 12 process that treats the pipeline as a series of small construction sites and grants exemption from the environmental review required by the Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. And since it does not cross an international border, as the Keystone XL project did, it escaped a more probing federal analysis of its economic justification and environmental impact, according to the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, David Archambault II, who wrote in a New York Times op-ed that they have been opposing the pipeline since they first learned of it in 2014. The Media Silence The images of guard dogs attacking protesters woke the mainstream media early in September, which had sparsely covered the growing opposition to the pipeline. Throughout the standoff, Mother Jones, Indian Country, AP and local papers like The Bismarck Tribune have provided ongoing coverage and analysis.
