Enbridge is based in Calgary, and Spectra in Houston. According to the group's analysis (pdf), the merger would give the companies control of 79 percent of the offshore Gulf of Mexico-Louisiana natural gas pipeline network; 92 percent of the pipelines crossing the U.S.-Canada border; and 100 percent of the pipelines in and out of Michigan. It would also enable Enbridge-Spectra to raise prices on consumers or increase costs for its rivals in those key regions at will. Both companies also have a history of safety issues, with a track record of leaks and spills that have impacted surrounding communities and environments. From 1996 to 2015, Enbridge unintentionally released more than 54,000 barrels of oils and natural liquids. Its leaks and other releases doubled during that time, from 54 to 117, the analysis states. A notorious 2010 incident saw one of its pipelines spill up to 1 million gallons of crude in Michigan's Kalamazoo River and Talmadge Creek, contaminating the local environment. Shareholders for both companies approved the deal last month. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License This is the world we live in.
