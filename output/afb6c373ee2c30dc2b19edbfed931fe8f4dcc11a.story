Senator Cory Booker sent a letter to US Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who heads the US Department of Justice, demanding they conduct a civil rights investigation into allegations of violence against both law enforcement as well as the protestors, who are chiefly composed of Native Americans. Booker is not the first Senator to speak out about the increasingly dangerous situation in North Dakota, though he is the first to call for an outright investigation into law enforcement behavior at the site. Both have questioned the lawfulness of the protests and Hoeven has urged the President to augment the already massive law enforcement presence at the site. All credible reports indicate, however, that much of the police response to the protestors has been unnecessarily violent and inappropriate. He also mentioned the widely shared video that showed private security guards unleashing attack dogs on protestors, leaving six injured including a small child. Booker also spoke about his concern for the safety of law enforcement officers at Standing Rock, in what is possibly an attempt to be fair to both parties involved. Unfortunately for Booker and law enforcement officers around the country, that trust for many communities throughout the nation eroded long ago and the oppression of protestors at Standing Rock has only made it worse.
