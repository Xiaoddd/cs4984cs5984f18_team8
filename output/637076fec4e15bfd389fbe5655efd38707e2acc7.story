DONALD TRUMP: On energy, I will cancel job-killing restrictions on the production of American energy including shale energy and clean coal, creating many millions of high-paying jobs. On regulation, I will formulate a rule which says that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Janet is the US Policy Director at Oil Change International. Janet, thanks so much for being here. JANET REDMAN: Thank you very much for having me. I think what we are in part really looking at is two different worlds. One is the world of pushing fossil fuels forward. JANET REDMAN: Well, I mean, I can take the second one first. Millions of jobs in the energy sector and in the fossil fuel sector is incredibly unlikely. Right now, we have twice as many jobs in the solar sector as we do in the coal sector, for example. Part of the problem could be regulation. Certainly, there has been some regulation. But the major two drivers are that the price of gas has plummeted, and so coal is no longer marketable. Coal is no longer competitive. And there is a decreased demand for it, internationally in particular, but here in the United States because we can use gas to serve those needs. There is no one definition of clean coal. No, coal can never be clean. Toxic ash is one of the major by-products of burning coal in power plants, as well as mercury and carbon dioxide. There are also questions about its viability geologically. JANET REDMAN: Again, I think that Trump is largely bluffing. There are moves in Congress to slash regulations that have been put in place of the last six months of the Obama Administration. I think we need to look at the kinds of hyperbole that Trump is using across the board. So, I think what we need to examine are bluff and big, boisterous statements, and then think about how he pulls back. KIM BROWN: Well, the President-Elect also said that he came up with a list of plans with the aid of his transition team. We know that the President-Elect is at least a small investor in the Dakota Access Pipeline out in North Dakota. JANET REDMAN: Yeah. Harold Hamm is a fracking mogul and billionaire who has been courted for the Department of Energy, Department of Interior. So, yes, his entire list of potential appointees and advisors who have been catching his ear on some of the most critical energy and climate issues are deeply, deeply embedded in the fossil fuel industry. I think many people in the environment community and in the government accountability community will be challenging that assertion. What people are sick of is having a corrupt government, feeling like the people on the inside are colluding with one another and rigging the rules. And pipelines will certainly folks in rural America. JANET REDMAN: Yeah. I think we should take some solace in the fact that we have pulled out of international agreements before. We were never part of the Kyoto Protocol, and the world went on without us. I think those kinds of fights are going to be increasingly important as Trump attempts to build out infrastructure via his energy plans, but even more broadly via infrastructure plans. And, of course, with the Clean Power Plan, many states are moving forward with state plans to reduce emissions from power generation without the help of the EPA. They are moving forward with that even as the Clean Power Plan has been locked up in court battles. So, I think, again, individual direct action on the streets, local, municipal action, what can happen in cities and towns across the country, and state-level action, is going to continue and may actually see increased energy knowing that the federal space is going to be a bit more mired for the next four years, at least. Janet, we appreciate your time today. Thanks a lot. JANET REDMAN: Thanks for having me. Great to talk to you. KIM BROWN: And thanks for watching The Real News Network.
