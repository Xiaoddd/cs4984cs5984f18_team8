These little guys will tell us how well the clean up of 21,000 gallons of crude oil from a spill nearly three years ago is going. We need enough to dampen the ground and tempt the nocturnal amphibians to head to the stream and wetlands. A wetland cacophony can get loud enough to hurt your ears, said Bret Henninger, natural resources director for Great Parks of Hamilton County, which owns and protects the preserve. Moving along, pulling our boots out of the sucking mud, we check about a dozen buckets. It's still not raining. Crude still seeps out of the earth when the area floods. Crews have found some salamanders in the buckets over the last couple of weeks, Henninger said. When found, they are documented and released. The purpose is not to compare them to an earlier population estimate; Great Parks didn't have one. It's about figuring out whether the salamanders will return to the area. And, there might not be enough food to support their survival. Bugs and tiny invertebrates (salamander food) are more sensitive to pollution, Henninger said. We see the lack of biodiversity first hand, flipping over rocks and scouring little pools we find little living in the reconstructed stream. The most prevalent organisms are small white aquatic bugs, a cousin of the rolly polly. In one spot, we find hundreds of these insects crowded on a few rocks. The survey, which Henninger expects to continue for 10 years, should bear that out. Each rock was removed, cleaned and replaced. On this night, we don't find any salamanders. Not Jefferson or the even the more elusive and endangered cave salamander, which lives in crevices of limestone. Slender and cream-colored, it twists into a loose ball-shaped knot in my palm. Cursing the clouds we say our goodbyes. From The USA TODAY NETWORK These sites are part of the USA TODAY NETWORK. Their content is produced independently from our newsrooms.
