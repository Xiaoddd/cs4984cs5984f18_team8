Oil. First Nations. Standing Rock. Mama Earth. As many of you know, the Black Snake also known as the Dakota Access Pipeline, is trying to make its way through the sacred land of the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota. This is about WATER. For Black, White, Red, Yellow, Brown. All Colors. All Nations. All Tribes. In many ways, I see that we can turn the struggle against the Dakota Access Pipeline into a blessing. A blessing that can wake us all up to the horrors of corporate greed that functions at the expense of our natural resources. A blessing to make all of us come together, no matter who we are and where we came from, to stand up and say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. A blessing of learning to let go of selfishness and greed, to come together for the greater good. But we can stand up where ever we are to show our support and solidarity in many ways. Written by my friend Aaron Edwards and myself, this song is inspired by the land of Standing Rock and all of the warriors out there on the front lines laying down their lives for WATER. But these mountains need their own water in the form of food, tents, blankets, and other materials in order to keep standing tall against the black snake. We are offering this song to help provide them with these things. Our love and prayers are with all people across the earth who are victims of corporate greed and power.
