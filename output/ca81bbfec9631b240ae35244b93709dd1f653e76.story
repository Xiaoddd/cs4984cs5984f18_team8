She left New York City several weeks ago to help with the struggle at Standing Rock. She been an active participate and family to the activist groups NYC Shut It Down and Hoods4Justice. Sophia has always been committed to confronting injustice through vigilance and resistance. Sophia was giving out bottles of water to protectors holding down the space when she was shot with a concussion grenade. This was the response of police and DAPL mercenaries as she and other brave protectors attempted to hold the line against the black snake in hservice of protecting our water. Please consider donating to help pay for her treatment. We must to support our comrades when they need us the most. She needs all of us right now. After all she is our family. My name is Michael Basillas, I live in NYC. Sophia Wilansky is a fierce friend of mine. We've known each other for almost a year now from participation in various demonstrations focused in the city. Sophia and I share passion addressing social justice, vigilance, and resistance , and understanding this world is unsuitable and required drastic change. Sophia is family to many affinity activism groups from The Base, NYC Shut It Down, and HOODS4JUSTICE. I'm this money with the help of several other people to provide medical relief funds after what had happen on Nov 21, 2016. HOW THE MONEY WILL BE SPEND: Funds raised in this campaign will go directly to provide financial aid towards 20 surgeries Sophia needs to save her arm. Funds also provide Sophia's father some financial support to take care of his daughter. Their insurance will not cover all of the expenses and can only cover a certain percentage of it especially with this type of surgery. So we are asking to donate gracefully because this will help provide financial support toward Sophia's long recovery. The rest of the money will be delivered to Mr. Wilansky when he gets back one in NYC. They frequently post information about Sophia's well-being. Thank you for the support you have given us. Please try again. She stood in silence. She was sanding to close to a truck and they didn't like that. I suppose an unarmed, unarmored young woman is threatening to them. They ordered for her to retreat, the whole time shooting rubber bullets. When they finally stopped, she attempted to retreat, as they ordered. She took a few steps towards us, and that's when they directly launched the flash grenade at her. It exploded right on her. I want people who are not here to understand, we assemble in PEACE. Sophia said not a word to them. She is the proof that they will use violent tactics no matter what. We are not to blame here. Anyone who would blame the people and not the government in this situation astounds me... Wilansky family, please contact me. I am a witness to what Morton County did to your daughter. I think it's beautiful for everyone to help but that is a lot of money and maybe we can petition for them to donate their fee to her medical bills. It would be an estimate of half a million dollars if she needs a prosthetic arm. Calling the FBI could result in you providing information that could be potentially incriminating to yourself and others. Many of these police do not see your constitutional right to peacefully assemble. They do not see your point of view or what you are fighting for. Clearing a public road resulted in use of deadly force against hundreds of people. They have responded to us with escalating violence, and increased charges. Put pressure on your legislators, federal agencies, and the White House. Put pressure on North Dakota's governor. Call on the Department of Justice. Please keep eachother safe, and learn about your rights. May she recover more beautifully than could be imagined. May she know the love of thousands. May all her old ones enfold her now. May her story wake up the hearts of tens of thousands. May the protectors and the waters they protect be kept safe from harms way. Sorry for my skepticism. I should have researched better. They are just jealous they don't have this kind of support. And the police will be looking at serious charges against them for crimes against humanity. Thank you all water protectors for the fight. Sending troops in to back you up and lots of them. Below is her statement as conveyed by her father, lawyer Wayne Wilansky. A grenade exploded right as it hit Sophia in the left forearm taking most of the undersurface of her left arm with it. Both her radial and ulnar artery were completely destroyed. Her radius was shattered and a large piece of it is missing. Her medial nerve is missing a large section as well. All of the muscle and soft tissue between her elbow and wrist were blown away. The police did not do this by accident - it was an intentional act of throwing it directly at her. Additionally police were shooting people in face and groin intending to do the most possible damage. Sophia will have surgery again tomorrow as bit by bit they try to rebuild a somewhat functioning arm and hand. The first surgery took a vein from her leg which they have implanted in her arm to take the place of the missing arteries. She will need multiple surgeries to try to gain some functional use of the arm and hand. She will be, every day for the foreseeable future, fearful of losing her arm and hand. There are no words to describe the pain of watching my daughter cry and say she was sorry for the pain she caused me and my wife. I died a thousand deaths today and will continue to do so for quite some time. Prayers for her healing. And for a good attorney. This needs to be taken to court. The sacrifices that this young woman made to be there to support an important cause will be with her the rest of her life. She chose to stand up, she chose to help others that were in need that night and ended up getting severely injured. The least we can all do is come together and support her in her recovery. Her physical, emotional and mental state are fragile at this time and in need of lots of support to assist her. I don't know her personally but thank her from the bottom of my heart. I love that so many folks are pulling together and showing so much love and support. Let's keep this momentum going and make sure all her expenses are covered. We are in this together and together everyone achieves more. Please. Water is life. Let's try to do better and be better. Best wishes for Sophia and her family. She was just passing out water and helping This gotton of control when this girl could loose and an arm or hand. The violent use police are doing is wrong. This has to stop before more people get hurt. Thank you. Victory to the protectors. You can bring a horse to water but cannot make them drink. These same people believe thousands of climate scientists with multiple degrees making 60 grand a year are in on some giant world wide climate conspiracy, vs the koch brothers making billions upon billions funding the darn site they are reading this garbage from that says ignore science and they do.
