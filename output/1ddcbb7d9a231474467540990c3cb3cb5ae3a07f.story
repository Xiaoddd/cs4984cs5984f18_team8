Had Carr pursued his original mandate, Canada could be on the way to significantly diversifying its trade, since facilitating pipeline projects to tidewater would open substantial markets in Asia and Europe for our oil and gas. That trade represented 76 per cent of our exports and 20 per cent of our GDP last year. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau now claims he takes seriously the need to diversify our trading markets, yet he gives short shrift to the most effective way to achieve that objective. It would be faster, more certain and cost the government nothing if it simply liberated the private sector to invest capital, foster trade and pay more of the royalties and taxes that fund our critical social programs. Furthermore, despite all the fear-mongering about apocalyptic global warming, the government will not meet its Paris climate accord commitments and cannot even marginally reduce global temperatures without sending Canada back to the Stone Age. Trudeau claims he takes seriously the need to diversify our trading markets, yet he gives short shrift to the most effective way to achieve that objective We will soon see whether the new minister of natural resources, Amarjeet Sohi, does his job and responsibly promotes the resource sector or, like his predecessor, willingly succumbs to the anti-development zealots in cabinet and the PMO. His first task should be to fundamentally revise the Impact Assessment Act, which creates so much risk and cost that no new major private-sector pipeline is likely to ever be built in Canada as long as the act remains. A failure to fix this problem would be proof positive the Liberal government intends to strand much of our vast resource wealth in pursuit of its unattainable green objectives. I doubt that Sohi will take up the fight for fossil fuels, but would love to be proven wrong. The federal government is not alone in sacrificing our resource exports on the altar of environmental delusions. Several provinces are doing the same. Needless to say, this is devastating for the natural gas industry and its workers in Quebec. In sharp contrast, America has become the largest producer of oil and gas in the world, largely due to fracking, with immense advantages for economic growth, jobs, its standard of living and national security. Western Canadians also benefitted enormously from using fracking technology safely for over 60 years. It perfectly meets the definition of bad policy: One that is costly and undercuts its stated objective. But today there are new realities that have made that approach even more harmful to our national well-being, as Canada contends with a trade-fighting American president and signs of slower economic growth. Diversifying oil and gas exports to energy-hungry overseas markets is the most effective way to reduce our dependency on the U.S. Joe Oliver is the former minister of finance, minister of natural resources and the Chairman of Echelon Wealth Partners.
