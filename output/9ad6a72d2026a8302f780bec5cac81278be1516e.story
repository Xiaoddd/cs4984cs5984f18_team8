No law enforcement officers or pipeline contractors were injured. The man, whose identity was not immediately released, reportedly brandished a weapon at officers after the chase, according to Capt. The incident began at about 9 a.m. Sunday when the Marion County Sheriff's Office received a report of someone shooting at the pipeline and the equipment in the 12500 block of State Road 200 near Dunnellon. The driver did not stop, so a pursuit began. Soon, the Florida Highway Patrol joined the chase, which covered about 20 miles, DeCarlo said. A FHP trooper then performed a PIT maneuver that spun the truck before it crashed into an embankment on the east side of U.S. 41. The driver then got out of the truck and threatened officers with a weapon, DeCarlo said. Officers then shot and killed the man, said DeCarlo. The stretch of U.S. 41 where the shooting occurred was closed for several hours as law enforcement processed the scene. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement was investigating the incident, as is standard in police shootings. CCSO spokeswoman Heather Yates said, per policy and protocol, the officers involved in the shooting, who will not be identified, will be placed on administrative leave while undergoing evaluations. The FDLE will take over the investigation, she said. The pipeline is a project of Sabal Trail Transmission, a joint venture between Spectra Energy, NextEra Energy and Duke Energy. Spectra Energy spokeswoman Andrea Grover said in an email she is aware of the events that occurred in Marion and Citrus counties Sunday morning and no Sabal Trail workers were working at the time of the incident. Construction of the Sabal Trail pipeline has spurred mass protests in recent months by those who believe the pipeline and its contribution process are harmful to the environment and the Floridian aquifer. Earlier last week, two protesters were arrested in Marion County after crawling into the pipeline, marking a total of 26 Sabal Trail protest arrests in Florida. The pipeline is expected to bring about a billion cubic feet of natural gas to the state everyday and will branch into Citrus and Martin counties for existing power plants.
