Nadia Stewart reports. Protesters eventually marched across the Cambie Street Bridge toward Library Square in downtown Vancouver. The federal government is expected to make a decision regarding the controversial pipeline by mid-December, and protesters are demanding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau shut down the plans. An aerial view of crowds gathering outside Vancouver City Hall protesting the Kinder Morgan TransMountain pipeline expansion. Opponents argue the expansion would increase the chance of an oil spill on land or in coastal waters, disrupting the local economy and destroying sensitive ecosystems. The last major spill in Metro Vancouver from the TransMountain pipeline occurred in Burnaby in 2007. About 250,000 litres of oil spilled when city workers accidentally struck the pipeline on Inlet Drive. About 70,000 litres poured into Burrard Inlet through the Burnaby storm sewer system, and 250 local residents were evacuated from their homes. Please read our Commenting Policy first.
