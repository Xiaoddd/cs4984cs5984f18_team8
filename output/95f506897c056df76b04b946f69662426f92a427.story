The decision is the latest fallout from the scandal surrounding Wells Fargo, which admitted to creating as many as 3.5 million accounts without customer permission. Mike Feuer, who sued the bank following a Times investigation into its sales practices. That contract to provide financial services expires next summer, and the city is seeking new proposals from banks vying to get the deal. That includes punitive action from regulators and how banks are rated under the Community Reinvestment Act, which encourages banks to operate and lend in low-income and minority communities. Wells Fargo was downgraded earlier this year by regulators, partly because of its sham accounts scandal. It is unclear how quickly that rating could be updated, but it appears unlikely that it would happen before banks must turn in their proposals for the city contract next year. At the Wednesday meeting, the City Council voted to move forward with those requirements for companies seeking the city contract. The City Council also voted to draft a new law that would impose similar requirements on any future banking contracts, mandating that the city give lower scores to banks if they have flouted state or federal regulations. In addition, financial institutions would have to certify whether they set sales goals for consumer financial services and whether they use sales to decide what employees are paid or whether they are promoted, a requirement championed by Councilwoman Nury Martinez. The new rules would apply to banks that either are seeking or already doing business with the city. If a bank fails to follow the rules, the city could have cause to terminate its contract, Bouey said. The council voted to draft the new rules, which now will be drawn up by city lawyers before they come back to the council for final approval. Earlier this year, the California Bankers Assn. and other business groups argued that some requirements under the proposed law could be unnecessarily burdensome, saying that agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau already make information about enforcement actions available to the city. Other cities, including New York and San Francisco, as well as states, including California and Illinois, have vowed to cut off some business ties to Wells Fargo. Last year, California Treasurer John Chiang said his office no longer would go through Wells Fargo to buy or sell securities, a move quickly echoed by Chiang's counterpart in Illinois. In New York City, officials in May moved to block the bank from selling municipal bonds and said they would not sign a new banking contract with Wells Fargo until its CRA rating improves. The suit claims that Wells Fargo, the only major bank with branch locations within the massive Navajo Nation, pressured or duped elderly tribal members and those who did not speak English well into opening bank accounts they did not need.
