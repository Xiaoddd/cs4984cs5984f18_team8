With his recent approval of that project, write Shawn McCarthy and Justine Hunter, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's biggest challenge may be yet to come Jesse Jaso, 12, enters the Unity Teepee at the Sacred Stone Camp near Cannon Ball, N.D. Camp supporters from across North America and around the world have left messages and signatures on the walls. Since the age of 7, she has joined blockades and protests aimed at protecting her community's traditional lands from resource development. Her parents' generation was the last to live off the land; their hunting and trapping was disrupted by the thousands of oil and gas wells that have been installed there over her lifetime. Forged by that experience, Ms. Laboucan-Massimo is now working at Greenpeace and throwing herself into the campaign to stop the freshly approved Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion that will dramatically increase the amount of oil-sands crude shipped through Vancouver Harbour. Story continues below advertisement She draws inspiration from the Standing Rock Sioux pipeline battle, and from protests two years ago against Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain project when she and scores of others protested and many people were arrested. They faced threats of rubber bullets, attack dogs and water cannons in frigid weather. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will have to balance his promise to get Canadian resources to market, on the one hand, with his commitment to First Nations' reconciliation, on the other. Industry executives say their companies are desperate for access to markets in Asia as well as additional pipeline capacity to key U.S. refining centres. Alberta's NDP Premier Rachel Notley argues the pipelines are critical infrastructure needed to boost her province's economy, which has been devastated by the 30-month-long price slump. Several First Nations have launched court challenges that assert that their treaty and constitutional rights are being violated and many leaders are promising direct action aimed at blocking construction should the courts rule against them. The day after federal approval for the Trans Mountain expansion was announced, Ian Anderson, president of Kinder Morgan Canada, raised concerns about the safety of his workers in light of vows of continued opposition. There is clearly no single view among indigenous leaders on resource development. Mr. Anderson emphasized that his company has sought, and in some cases won, consent from First Nations along the route. At the Assembly of First Nations annual meeting near Ottawa this week, there was vigorous debate, with some chiefs arguing that communities should look to profit from oil and gas development in order to escape poverty. Others suggest companies mistakenly tout benefit agreements as expressions of support, when often they merely reflect the desire of the community to benefit from a project over which they have no control. Among the gathered chiefs, there was widespread opposition to resource development that threatens to create environmental damage, and the assembly passed a resolution supporting Standing Rock. Several speakers portrayed the North Dakota standoff as a signature moment for indigenous people in North America as they undergo a political renaissance and assume a leading role in the environmental movement. Mr. Bear, a student at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, visited Standing Rock in August and was impressed by the alliance of indigenous and non-indigenous people. The recently formed Treaty Alliance against Tar Sands Expansion has won support from some 120 chiefs in Canada and the United States. The alliance held an official signing ceremony during the annual meeting of the Assembly of First Nations this week in Gatineau, Que., across the river from Ottawa. The AFNQL opposes the Energy East project, which is currently before the National Energy Board for an environmental assessment. Manitoba's regional chief Kevin Hart is also a supporter of the Treaty Alliance, and he warns that Enbridge will encounter opposition despite the Liberal government's approval. Canadian opponents are teaming up with indigenous American activists who are promising to stop the Enbridge project in Minnesota. Winona Laduke, an Ojibwa from the White Earth reservation, is a veteran of the Standing Rock camps and has been waging the battle against Line 3 south of the border. She said that Enbridge has been misleading people by portraying the project as a rebuild of an existing line, noting it follows a new route through much of Minnesota. The Calgary-based pipeline company is indirectly involved in the Standing Rock fight after having announced it would acquire a minority interest in the project back in August, though it has not yet completed the purchase. Ms. Laduke said that she urged Enbridge to condemn the violence against protesters but the company remained silent. Now, the tribes in Minnesota are preparing for a showdown with Enbridge, whose route skirts the White Earth reservation's treaty area. The Tsleil-Waututh, the Squamish and the Kwantlen are pursuing legal challenges and preparing for direct action. But Tsleil-Waututh Chief Maureen Thomas said her community wants to avoid the confrontation with police that characterized the Standing Rock standoff. Ed John, grand chief of the First Nations Summit, travelled to Standing Rock in late October in his capacity as an expert member of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. He recalled meeting fully armed officers wearing body armour. At its heart, he concluded, the conflict over pipelines and resource development is rooted in government's failure to address the inherent land rights of indigenous people. Federal Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr argues that, in its review of the two pipeline proposals, Ottawa discharged its duty to consult and accommodate First Nations whose traditional territories will be affected by the pipelines. He believes the process will withstand court challenges. Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr. He later apologized for referring to the military, which is not responsible for domestic policing. The comment was seen as particularly galling among the Mohawk leaders at Kanesatake, who were involved in the Oka crisis 26 years ago, when then Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa called out the military to end a standoff over a land dispute between the Mohawks and the town of Oka, Que. Then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney announced and publicly supported that decision. After his remark, Mr. Carr called Kanesatake Chief Serge Simon, who is a key organizer in the Treaty Alliance against Tar Sands Expansion. In the interview, the minister refused to comment on what steps the government would take to end a blockade of a construction site, or to deal with possible conflict. Government security forces, however, have sometimes been accused of blurring the lines between peaceful protest and civil disobedience on the one hand, and extremist criminal activity on the other. Several speakers at the closed-door session spoke on emerging threats from the indigenous community. Of those, 89 were judged to have some propensity toward criminality, and their names are being kept in a data base. One former industry executive says Prime Minister Trudeau may find his greatest challenge was not in approving the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, but in ensuring the critics do not derail a government-sanctioned project. But there is a fundamental divide between that industry view that First Nations do not have a veto, which is widely supported by politicians like B.C. Premier Christy Clark, and the view of indigenous Canadians that they have an inherent right to exercise free, prior and informed consent over development that would have an impact on their traditional territory. The Trudeau government is attempting to bridge that chasm after endorsing the United Nations Declarations on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which includes the principle of free, prior and informed consent. Mr. Carr says that principle does not provide a veto to First Nations who oppose projects, but does require companies and governments to work closely with indigenous communities to ensure they are partners in the evaluation and monitoring of projects, are properly consulted, and have their concerns accommodated. And if Mr. Carr is right, the legal avenue will not provide indigenous pipeline opponents with the answer they are seeking. Indeed, the story of Standing Rock is not over. Under U.S. President Barack Obama, the government backed away from conflict. After ordering the activists to dismantle their camps, Washington did nothing to enforce the ruling. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which has responsibility for that segment of the Missouri River, last week handed the Standing Rock Sioux and their allies an exhilarating win by denying the company a permit to cross the river and ordering a new environmental assessment. But with president-elect Donald Trump set to take office next month, there are no illusions that the victory will stand; Mr. Trump's Republican allies have made it clear they expect the pipeline will win approval. If he's right, Canada will be looking for new lessons to draw from the Sioux standoff. Editor's note: An earlier version of this story said the government of then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney called out the military to end a standoff over a land dispute between the Mohawks and the town of Oka, Que. In fact, the government of then Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa called out the military. Mr. Mulroney announced and publicly supported that decision. This is a corrected version.

This is what she's seen A protester meets a police blockade on Highway 1806 near Cannon Ball. Many people were injured when, in sub-zero temperatures, police deployed water cannons, pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets. When it was warmer, I would wake up before the sun and work long after it was gone. Now that winter has truly arrived, I have to work a bit slower but my routine is the same: I spend the day talking and connecting with people and their stories. They are stories of community, healing, sacrifice, family, grief, survival and most of all, determination. Thousands of people representing hundreds of tribes and non-indigenous groups, including many Canadians, have gathered together in opposition to the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which would transport crude oil beneath sacred Sioux land, including the Missouri River, the source of their drinking water. The last time there was a similar assembly of nations was before the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn. In my time at the camp, I've dodged water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray while peaceful demonstrators stood fast. I've watched young Sioux and Crow men tend carefully to their horses. I've seen the gentle and absolute leadership of the Elders. I've been invited to share venison jerky, squash soups, and rice goulash made over the fire and welcomed into warm winter buses, tepees, military tents and wigwams. I've been moved to tears in a morning water ceremony led by women. On Sunday, the Army Corps of Engineers called a halt to the proposed construction, but many feel this victory is tenuous: the company building the project is fighting the Army in court and Donald Trump made the of tapping America's oil reserves one of the centrepieces of his campaign. While some protestors have dispersed, others have vowed to remain gathered in prayer until they are certain their land is safe. The battle for the land has become something larger: a united stand for indigenous rights everywhere. Sun and shadow move across the North Dakota plains near Cannon Ball on Standing Rock Indian Reservation. In the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, the Sioux Nation agreed to peace in exchange for exclusive use of the sacred Black Hills, and for land in South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. The U.S. government first seized the Black Hills in 1877, when gold was discovered there. Over the ensuing decades, the government expropriated more and more of the treaty lands. Today, the land is less than half the original size. A young woman listens to speakers after a demonstration in Bismarck, N.D., in November. Demonstrators, blocked from marching down a main street by riot police, stood and prayed for several hours before leaving peacefully. Cousins Jiselle Ross, 8, and Ohiya Shaw, 8, wake up for the first time at Sacred Stone Camp near Cannon Ball in September. Riot police outside a Dakota Access Pipeline worker camp in Mandan, N.D. confront protestors who were drawing attention to sexual violence against indigenous women. The violence is exacerbated by the presence of the mostly male work crews that have formed temporary communities around pipeline construction sites. A man is treated with milk of magnesia after being pepper-sprayed at a police blockade on Highway 1806, near Cannon Ball. Hundreds of veterans and supporters march through a blizzard to pray at the Backwater Bridge police barricade near Cannon Ball. The protest began in April. The sun rises over a frosty camp near Cannon Ball at the end of November. Yurts, tepees, military structures, tiny homes, trailers, wigwams and other improvised structures are in use for winter shelter. Amber Bracken is a member of the Rogue Collective of Canadian photojournalists. He was 28 when he lived through the 1990 Oka crisis, during which historically frayed relations were amplified to an explosive degree: In the town of Oka, Que., the Mohawk community became embattled with the provincial police force and the Canadian military to prevent burial grounds from being destroyed to make way for a proposed golf-course expansion and condominium development. Mr. Simon was guiding a small pack of journalists through the pines toward the action the morning that a Quebec police officer was killed in a barrage of bullets, he says. Mr. Simon takes time choosing his words when asked if he fears if history could repeat itself, given the greenlighting of controversial pipeline projects such as Trans Mountain (designed to run from Edmonton through B.C. to the Pacific Coast) and Line 3 (meant to boost capacity on an existing route to the U.S. Midwest), which could likewise encroach on indigenous titles and rights. I cherish peace above all. In Edmonton during the last week of November, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said that military and police forces could be used to subdue anti-pipeline protests for the sake of public safety. But he adds that, before the AFN meeting on Tuesday, the minister phoned him to apologize for his remarks. Mr. Simon, working alongside numerous chiefs across Canada, has devised a more pacifist mode of opposition: a treaty that would bolster the lobbying power of indigenous people against energy developments such as Alberta's oil sands. As an instrument of unification, the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion includes more than 100 signatories, including David Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. The treaty seeks to preserve and protect what is sacred to them. This week, Mr. Simon spoke to The Globe and Mail about indigenous initiatives to fight pipelines, the situation in North Dakota, and what he sees as echoes of the Oka crisis. I am feeling relieved about the decision. It's more of a stay of execution. Like, we're not going to kill you today. We're talking about a chiefs' alliance, the governing bodies of every respective territory that signs. We're not the grassroots. We could look at lobbying internationally. We could look at the possibility of charging Canada at the International Criminal Court and lobbying international partners, such as Germany, Portugal, Spain, whoever we can have who would be sympathetic to the First Nations here and whatever it is we're fighting. We are First Nations, not first communities or municipalities. We were a nation long before Canada was created, and I think we'll be nations long after it's gone. Investing further into the tar sands is equal to investing in the company that made the last buggy whip. There are some First Nations who are pro-pipeline. They don't have to be. There are alternatives out there. If you want to diversify your community's portfolio, look elsewhere. I'm sitting here with the same damn boots I came into the office with five years ago. My community is also poor. But it will not submit to irresponsible development as a means of making money. My community has a little more integrity. I'm not saying others don't; they're just not informed about what's really going on. Poverty, yes, is a huge incentive to sign on the dotted line. The Canadian government's. National Chief Perry Bellegarde's position on the matter of energy development and indigenous people is neutral. I think Perry is trying to do the best he can in view of Alberta and the First Nations that are benefiting. But then he also has to take into consideration those that are not and those that are just getting all the negative health impacts. Canadian soldier Patrick Cloutier and Ojibwa Brad Larocque come face-to-face in a tense standoff at the Kanesatake reserve in Quebec on Sept. 1, 1990. I was involved with bringing food from the Oka village. I was taking these little trails I knew through the bush and trying to smuggle food up there. I was there that morning when the shooting started. Just as we crossed the field to where the barricade was, we smelled the teargas, saw band members running away. Then all hell broke loose. That's when we dove into the sand. They were running like hell. Our jaws dropped. If one more person died on either side, I think you would have seen a civil war erupt in this country. I saw firsthand when respect and dialogue fail. When the rule of law, when it comes to our treaties and the promises that were made, when those are broken, that's what happens. And that's what we're seeing again. We're seeing partially that same monster rearing its head again. No dialogue, no respect, absolutely no recognition of the law with regards to First Nations and their titles and rights. We can live in peace between the non-native society and ours, like we've always intended through our treaties. Let's say if Canada did to France what they did to First Nations: They would call that an act of war. Julien Gignac is a reporter at The Globe and Mail.
