FERC Chairman Kevin McIntyre signed the memorandum of understanding April 9, along with 11 other federal agencies. Environmental groups have increased their opposition, including public protests and lawsuits against pipelines under review at FERC to account for downstream greenhouse gas emissions. Analysts and attorneys said that speeding up environmental reviews could cut out public participation. For example, he said, FERC may just give the minimum amount of time for public comment at a particular stage of the project review, instead of providing more time to accommodate all perspectives. Others took a different view. The memorandum implements Executive Order No. 13807, issued in August 2017, which aims to streamline infrastructure review timetables that require environmental impact statements under NEPA. But Earthjustice said the memorandum sets arbitrary timelines that go against FERC mandates, which require a thorough review of the entire project. Public participation is primarily accomplished using formal commenting. Natural Gas Pipeline Reviews Separately, FERC is currently reviewing how it issues natural gas pipeline certificates. Shaving Off Review Times Christine Tezak, managing director for ClearView Energy Partners LLC, an energy analysis group, predicts that FERC can shorten reviews without sacrificing public input. This review period starts when FERC issues a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement and ends when FERC issues the natural gas certificate, Tezak told Bloomberg Environment. The notice of intent is issued during the informal pre-filing stage of the FERC review process before the pipeline company formally submits their application for review, which is the time frame tracked under the memorandum. Right now, FERC starts its review clock at a later point: When a pipeline formally submits its application. FERC takes on average 18 months to two years to approve natural gas pipelines from application submission to issuance of the natural gas certificate, Tamara Young-Allen, a FERC spokeswoman, told Bloomberg Environment. Tezak said that if FERC were to revisit when it issues the notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement, it would likely shave off a month. She also said time could be saved between issuing an environmental impact statement and when FERC generates a final certificate. Call us for a prepaid UPS label for your return.
