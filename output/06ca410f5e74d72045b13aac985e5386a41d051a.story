Larsen had come to Oslo to meet with pension fund KLP to discuss the Dakota Access Pipeline and welcomed the news when she arrived. KLP had originally said it would not divest, but after reassessing, changed its mind. It will exclude Energy Transfer Partners, Enbridge Energy Partners, Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum from its investments. Other Norwegian companies have already divested from companies involved in the pipeline. Nordea Bank AB sold its bonds in three companies in February, and Storebrand financial group said it would divest earlier this month. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.
