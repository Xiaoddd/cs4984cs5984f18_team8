She said that will mean the pipeline may have to go into deeper waters to avoid the ice that scrapes along the ocean bottom. Cloutier said the new information means a delay in the company filing its environmental assessment report, and will lead to higher project costs. Under provincial legislation, the mill has until Jan. 30, 2020, to replace its current wastewater treatment plant in Boat Harbour. The wastewater lagoons contain nearly 50 years worth of toxic waste that provincial Environment Minister Iain Rankin has called one of the worst cases of environmental racism in the province. The proposal for a pipeline to transport the treated effluent from a new facility into the ocean has also met with opposition. In February, groups representing fishermen in Nova Scotia, P.E.I., and New Brunswick suspended further meetings with the mill after voicing frustration over its insistence on a pipe. The company has said it had thoroughly investigated the treatment options available to bleached kraft mills like Northern Pulp, which produce a higher quality paper. Effluent would be carried by polyethelyne pipe across Pictou Harbour and released through six dispersal pipes into the Strait. The company said the proposed system would reduce the need for bleaching chemicals by about 30 to 40 per cent. Please read our Commenting Policy first.
