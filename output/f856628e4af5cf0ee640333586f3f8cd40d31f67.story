When despair hits, I turn to various remedies, most of which involve music and image. I do a lot of dancing by myself. I started with humor at the wand of Lele Pons. Abrazotes, mi chula. May all our precious water protectors remain brave. I need and needed all three channels this morning. Prayer is the most natural drug on the scene and world political stage. I call it political medicina, this melding of the spirit, emotions, movement. Here, I mean social movement, not just dance. We need to dance, mi gente. We need to laugh, my peeps. And we need to be a magical movement of many hues, kinds, and stripes. For realz. No deals behind the scenes. I hope that means you too, my dear readers :) Peace, Darshan Elena Campos, PhD FollowFollowingUnfollowDarshan Elena Campos, PhD Sign in to follow this author Darshan Elena Campos, PhD I help people design, launch, and assess businesses that heal Mother Nature and her diverse communities.
