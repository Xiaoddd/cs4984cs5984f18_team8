Yaw is chairman of the Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, which organized the hearing along with the Senate Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure Committee. The multi-billion-dollar project has been largely supported by state business, political and labor leaders. But Rebecca Britton of the Uwchlan Safety Coalition and Melissa DiBernadino of Goshen United for Public Safety said the pipelines pass very close to homes and schools and put their children, families and neighbors in danger. The citizens groups have called on the state to order a public risk assessment of the pipeline, and are raising money online to pay for their own study. PUC Chair Gladys Brown testifies at a Senate hearing Tuesday. The pipeline, shut down March 7, will remain out of service until the PUC takes a formal action to lift the emergency order.
