Since spring 2016, supporters of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe have been protesting the construction of a four-state Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Celebrities that have offered support include Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Shailene Woodley, and even Neil Young. Now, actress and activist Jane Fonda is expected to arrive in North Dakota within the week to help serve a Thanksgiving dinner to the protestors at Standing Rock. NativeNewsOnline reports that the two-time Academy Award-winner will visit the water protectors at the Oceti Sakowin camp as part of a delegation of 50 people from around the country. The intent is to serve a Wopila Feast to thank American Indian water protectors for their courage in defending Mother Earth. Fonda will also contribute five butchered Bison and four Mongolian yurts to the camp. As Native Village points out, Fonda is a long-time supporter of American Indian rights. In 1969, the activist supported the Alcatrez Island occupation by American Indians; this brought attention to treaty rights. And in 1970, Fonda traveled to Seattle, Washington, to offer support to a group of American Indians who occupied part of Fort Lawton to get land that was being surplussed by the United States Army. In that instance, the group succeeded. Here is a picture of her with my aunt Yet-Si-Blue (Janet McCloud) 19970. Those beautiful people are being unjustly hurt by the police. Please give them the support they need. May her bones explode. She was young and made a mistake that she has apologized for over and over again. Ridiculous.

The Vietnam war was a bad, unwarranted, war and it needed to be stopped. My boyfriend at the time was a Marine who donned a wig with several of his Marine brothers and went AWOL to come protest the war at The Ohio State University. They went to war, fought like they had been trained and, no thanks to narrow minded people like you, lived, although their lives were forever changed. Reply Stretcherbearer November 23, 2016 at 12:15 am Vietnam vet here and I supported what she did back then and I support here now. Use a bulldozer and clear them out of the way. Any time your cause is supported by an America-hating traitor like Fonda you know you suck. Reply mimi November 23, 2016 at 4:10 am Thank you Jane Fonda for bringing attention to the plight of the Dakota Sioux, something no major network has done and something our POTUS has failed to do. I have friends at Oceti Sakowin camp. They are there to help protect the land and the water of the Dakota Sioux. Jane, what a generous act. Reply Bobby Scott November 23, 2016 at 5:34 am If Hanoi Jane wanted to support this movement, she should have talked other celebrities with credibility into going there and just stayed in the shadows where traitors like her belong. Reply Malinda McFarland November 23, 2016 at 6:23 am amen true words of wisdom Reply Brian English November 23, 2016 at 6:06 pm Personal perspectives on Jane aside , she is a personality and a strong one . She carries weight and this is exactly what the people who are suffering at Standing Rock need . I really hope that President Obama puts out an executive order to halt the construction process and has the armed battalion of thugs stand down and leave the site . Good on you Jane for putting your name in the hat of supporters and thank you to Sen Sanders for working towards a solution from a different angle of attack . This movement could use a couple of other famous personalities to help the people fight this battle . But the President could fix this with one swipe of his mighty pen . Reply Marlene Crosby November 24, 2016 at 12:20 am Sorry, after Vietnam I have no repect for Hanoi Jane. She should have been tried for treason. Not to mention continuous mass tear gas, rubber bullets, as well as stinger grenades and LRAND (Long Range Acoustic Device) for 3 hours. Law enforcement also shot down three media drones and targeted journalists with less lethal rounds. National Lawyers Guild legal observers on the frontlines have confirmed that multiple people were unconscious and bleeding after being shot in the head with rubber bullets. One elder went into cardiac arrest at the frontlines but medics administered CPR and were able to resuscitate him. PLEASE CALL THE FOLLOWING AGENCIES NOW: ND Office of the Governor: 701-328-2200. CALL Energy Transfer tell Kelcy Warren STOP 214-981-0700 Reply Marylyn May November 24, 2016 at 8:23 pm Actually she was a real patriot, standing up for what she believed in. We should never have been in Vietnam and lost all of those brave young men.
