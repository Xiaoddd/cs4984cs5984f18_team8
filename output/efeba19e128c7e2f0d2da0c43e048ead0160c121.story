Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search For the 1851 treaty by the same name, see Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851). The treaty was divided into 17 articles. It established that the US government would hold authority to punish not only white settlers who committed crimes against the tribes, but also tribe members who committed crimes and who were to be delivered to the government rather than face charges in a tribal courts. The treaty protected specified rights of third parties not partaking in the negotiations, and effectively ended Red Cloud's War. It was negotiated by members of the government-appointed Indian Peace Commission, and signed between April and November 1868 at and near Fort Laramie in the Wyoming Territory, with the final signatories being Red Cloud himself and others who accompanied him. Animosities over the agreement arose quickly, with neither side fully honoring the terms. Open war again broke out in 1876, and the US government unilaterally annexed native land protected under the treaty in 1877. The treaty formed the basis of the 1980 Supreme Court case, United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians, in which the court ruled that tribal lands covered under the treaty had been taken illegally by the US government, and the tribe was owed compensation plus interest. The Sioux have refused the payment, demanding instead the return of their land. Some of the 1851 Fort Laramie territories. Later and at different times, each tribe would enter into new treaties with the US. The result was an often-changing patchwork of bigger and smaller parts of the initial allocations, newly established reservations, and former tribal land turned into new US territory. The bold outline shows the 1851 Sioux treaty area. The first Treaty of Fort Laramie, signed in 1851, attempted to resolve disputes between tribes and the US Government, as well as among tribes themselves, in the modern areas of Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, and North and South Dakota. It set out that the tribes would make peace among one another, allow for certain outside access to their lands (for activities such as travelling, surveying, and the construction of some government outposts and roads), and that tribes would be responsible for wrongs committed by their people. No land covered by the treaty was claimed by the US at the time of signing. North of the Sioux, the Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan held a joint territory. When the Senate reduced the annuity to 10 years from originally 50, all tribes except the Crow accepted the cut. The 1851 treaty had a number of shortcomings which contributed to the deterioration of relations, and subsequent violence over the next several years. Although the federal government operated via representative democracy, the tribes did so through consensus, and although local chiefs signed the treaty as representatives, they had limited power to control others who themselves had not consented to the terms. Finally, the discovery of gold in the west, and the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad, led to substantially increased travel through the area, largely outside the 1851 Sioux territory.

In 1868, the US and the Sioux entered into negotiations regarding the western Powder River area, although neither held the treaty rights to the land. A peace counsel chosen by the government arrived on April 19, 1868, at Fort Laramie, in what would later become the state of Wyoming. Similar provisions appeared in nine such treaties with various tribes. In 1873, the US exercised the right to withhold annuities and compensate for Sioux wrongs against anyone, including Indians. It made the total tribal lands smaller, and moved them further eastward. In addition, the US still recognized the 1851 Crow claim to the Indian territory west of the Powder. By 1871, 200 farms of 80 acres (32 ha) and 200 farms of 40 40 acres (16 ha) had been established including 80 homes. In practice, five were constructed and two more later added. In article eight, the government agreed to provide seeds, tools, and training for any of the residents who selected tracts of land, and agreed to farm them. Because of the Sioux massacre on the Pawnee in southern Nebraska during a hunting expedition in 1873, the US banned such hunts outside the reservation. As part of this, the government agreed to close the forts associated with the Bozeman Trail. The US Government could only dispose of Crow treaty territory, because it held parallel negotiations with the Crow tribe. It was possible for the Peace Commission to allow the Sioux to hunt on the Republican Fork in Nebraska (200 miles south of the Sioux reservation) along with others, because the US held the title to this river area. The US had bought the eastern part of the Republican Fork from the Pawnee in 1833. Throughout this process, no further amendments were made to the terms. As the source continues: These tribes had little interest in or understanding of what had taken place at the Fort Laramie councils. The process of abandoning the forts associated with the Bozeman Trail, as part of the conditions agreed to, proved to be a long process, and was stalled by difficulty arranging the sale of the goods from the fort to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Fort C.F. Smith was not emptied until July 29. Fort Phil Kearny and Fort Reno were not emptied until August 1. Two exceptions are included. Henderson was a commissioner, but did not sign the treaty. Red Cloud was among the last to sign, but is listed here out-of-order along with the other Oglala. This was notwithstanding that the treaty did not make any stipulation that the tribes could not travel outside their land, only that they would not permanently occupy outside land. Although a treaty between the US and the Sioux, it had profound effect on the Crow tribe, since it held the title to some of the territories set aside in the new treaty. This eastern part of the Crow reservation was taken over a few years later by the Sioux in quest of buffalo. The first talks of actions against the Sioux arose. The government eventually broke the terms of the treaty following the Black Hills Gold Rush and an expedition into the area by George Armstrong Custer in 1874, and failed to prevent white settlers from moving onto tribal lands.
