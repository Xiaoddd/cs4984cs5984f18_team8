He wants Enbridge to notify the HDI of work along the pipeline, and to pay to have Haudenosaunee monitoring staff on worksites to make sure the work is being done safely and to environmental standards. In court documents, Enbridge says that it wrote letters to two First Nations (Six Nations of the Grand River and the Mississaugas of the New Credit) and to HDI describing the nature of the work. Treaty rights versus property rights Williams says he started camping out at sites and setting traps (which are humane cage traps), citing the Nanfan Treaty of 1701, which he says include his harvesting and hunting rights to the land. In the end, the court found that Enbridge was entitled to an injunction restraining Williams and Hill from interfering with any dig sites. Williams said that ruling is not being appealed. Workers were present at the Enbridge maintenance dig site on Wilson Street in Ancaster on Tuesday. Williams says that he can dip into his retirement funds to pay it off, but that treaty rights and environmental safety are both bigger issues. Enbridge would not confirm or deny that offer when asked, citing the court proceedings.
