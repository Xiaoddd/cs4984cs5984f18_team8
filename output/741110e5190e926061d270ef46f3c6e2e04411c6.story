The arrests, of 46 people, came a day after an evacuation deadline issued by Gov. Doug Burgum.

The protest lasted months, drew international attention and was widely credited with leading to a temporary halt in construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Smaller numbers of protesters remain camped at other sites. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and protesters say the oil pipeline, which crosses the Missouri River nearby, will pose a grave threat to drinking water on the reservation and farther downstream if it ever leaks. Construction on the pipeline, which will carry oil from the Bakken fields in western North Dakota, resumed this month with support from President Trump, and the project could be finished this spring. The North Dakota authorities said the closing of the main protest camp, which sits on Army Corps of Engineers land, was necessary to prevent pollution during imminent spring floods. The protest site had developed into a make-do city, with semipermanent buildings, medical tents and abandoned cars. If that washed into the Missouri River, the authorities said, the results could be damaging to the environment. It is a new beginning. About an hour after the protest camp was cleared, Mr. Burgum signed into law four bills that had been passed largely as a result of the protests. They expand the scope of criminal trespassing laws, make it illegal to cover your face with a mask or hood while committing a crime, and increase the penalties for riot offenses. The protests, which have included clashes with law enforcement and an influx of outsiders to a sparsely populated state, have tested the patience of some in North Dakota.
