Last Friday, under the heavy rain of an afternoon thunderstorm, hundreds of people gathered with umbrellas and sweatshirts on the front lawn of the North Dakota State Capitol in Bismarck. The crowd cheered in solidarity; they had just heard, with dismay, that Judge James Boasberg had ruled against their request for a temporary injunction to halt construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). Charger is from the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, just south of Standing Rock. A member of the International Indigenous Youth Council, she worked against the Keystone XL pipeline last year, which would have crossed her reservation. Now, she is a leader of the youth movement here. I knew what they were going to go through. In an unprecedented move, their decision also moved to reassess and improve how governments and corporations consult with tribal governments. The mood on the field turned celebratory, and the crowds broke into song and dance, while, almost as if choreographed, the thunderstorm passed and the clouds dissipated.

Because the joint statement is not legally binding, the water protectors urge only cautious celebration. They will work to hold the government to its word, but emphasize that the real successes here are the historic levels of momentum and solidarity galvanized by the movement, and that this is only the beginning of what it can achieve. I see amazing things. The evening before the rally, I spoke with Kandi Mosset of the Indigenous Environmental Network. She is Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara, and the land in question is the traditional territory of her ancestors. In fact, she explains, the history of environmental mismanagement on these lands is inseparable from the history of colonization and land appropriation. Lake Oahe, under which the pipeline would bore, was created in the late 1940s along with four other large dams, largely as flood control for cities like St. Louis. Every one of the five reservoirs forced the relocation of hundreds of people without their consent and flooded some of the most fertile agricultural lands in the area.

Sharon White Bear, of the Arikara Nation, told me her parents were teenagers when they were forced from their homes when Lake Sakakawea (the reservoir to the north of Lake Oahe) was flooded in 1956. Many noted that their work here arose from their own lived experiences and carried personal meaning far beyond the pipeline itself. But what happened was, when someone pushes you back against the wall, what you gotta do is take one step forward. I truly believe in what I am doing. Gonzales told me that for them, this struggle also means honoring their experience as a two-spirit person and pushing back against the misogyny and transmisogyny they experience. Gonzales emphasized that this work is also a rallying point for other social justice issues too. All those intersections, they all impact me, and they make me a better leader.

Even in our own culture, we are shunned, even though it was a part of our culture before the colonists came. Gonzales, Charger, and others also noted the intersections between their environmental concerns and gendered and sexual violence. Mary Kathryn Nagle, who is an enrolled citizen of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and a partner at Pipestem Law in Tulsa, noted the connections between the sexual violence of colonization and present-day resource extraction. The water protectors plan to stay until January 1, and longer if necessary, to ensure that construction stops. Meanwhile, noting that threats like the DAPL will never fully end while there is a demand for oil and gas, speakers at the Red Warrior Camp on Friday evening and Saturday morning began to outline plans to address the root causes of the pipeline. These included both personal and organizational divestment from the banks that fund the pipeline (which include Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan Chase, among others) and discussions about alternative energy options. Beyond any judicial or executive action, that is cause for celebration. Follow her at vivianunderhill.wordpress.com.
