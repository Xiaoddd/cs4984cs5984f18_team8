At least five times, Pruitt says this, or words substantially the same: The climate is changing and human activity impacts our changing climate in some manner. The ability to measure with precision the degree and extent of that impact, and what to do about it, are subject to continuing debate and dialogue. Instead, Pruitt gave only this evasive but revealing answer: There is a diverse range of views regarding the key drivers of our changing climate among scientists. I believe that these differences should be the subject of robust and open debate free from intimidation. If confirmed, I will continue to encourage an honest debate on our changing climate, the role of human activity, our ability to measure the degree and extent of human activity, and what to do about it. I am also aware that the discrepancy between land-based temperature stations and satellite temperature stations can be attributed to expansive urbanization within in our country where artificial substances such as asphalt can interfere with the accuracy of land-based temperature stations and that the agencies charged with keeping the data do not accurately account for this type of interference. I am also aware that 'warmest year ever' claims from NASA and NOAA are based on minimal temperature differences that fall within the margin of error. Finally, I am aware that temperatures have been changing for millions of years that predate the relatively short modern record keeping efforts that began in 1880. Temperatures have indeed changed over millions of years. Far from a reason to relax, that should be a cause of great concern, because it shows the climate is sensitive to forcing factors, including changes in atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases. Thankfully, he failed. Asked several times whether he will commit not to tamper with that finding, Pruitt carefully responded: To my knowledge, there is nothing currently pending before the EPA that would require I take any additional actions on the Endangerment Finding on Greenhouse Gases and if there were, it would not be wise to prejudge the outcome. Watch out. Put his answers together, and Pruitt is virtually inviting a new petition to revoke the endangerment finding based on fringe science like what he included in his Senate answers.
