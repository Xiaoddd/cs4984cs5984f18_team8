VINE VOICE 5.0 out of 5 stars Good item, great ability to fit in many different places. January 12, 2017 Size: 66 Pack Verified Purchase This is pretty good tasting water. I have bought Datrex for a long time. The reason for this is you can fit them pretty much anywhere. Unlike water bottles this will lay flat, fit in small areas and stay stable for 5 years. I dont know if anyone reading this has had a water bottle for 5 years but they start getting funky after about 1. The bottle begins to take on a weird feel and the water begins to take on a plastic taste. Everyone should have a stash of these somewhere. They last for a long time and have a very stable life. They do have a very minor aftertaste but it is nothing that someone could not live with in a situation where these might be important Read more 24 people found this helpful Helpful Comment Report abuse Honest Reviews 5.0 out of 5 stars I highly recommend this product. January 30, 2018 Size: 66 Pack Verified Purchase I bought these to go into my emergency pack and I am very happy with my purchase. Though these where purchased to be stored, as soon as they arrived I ripped one open, tested the water with a testing kit and tried a glass. The water test was great, and it tasted better than the best bottled water I have ever bought. It was more like really clean natural spring water in nature. I am ordering another box today.

December 31, 2017 Size: 66 Pack Verified Purchase Just got this case of 66 bags of drinking water. The bags look fairly sturdy - I tested each one by squeezing gently (as suggested) as I took them out of the box. Only one bag was compromised and did not survive the trip to my house. Looks like it's gonna meet my needs. The back of the bag says you should not drink any water the first 24 hours when packing out during an emergency, but then to drink a minimum of 2 bags per person per day (a little more than 8 oz.) to stay hydrated, unless you're sick or injured or in a desert environment.

Smith 5.0 out of 5 stars Small But Tough Packages September 28, 2015 Size: 66 Pack Verified Purchase These are really small, as indicated in the advertising, but they are well packaged and have held up inside my purse (dangerous territory) for taking necessary medication, as well as inside my internal frame pack for emergency cooking and drinking water. It isn't much water, but it's enough to get by with and it won't rupture easily.

The pouches were double bagged, but apparently had pinhole leaks making for a messy order as well as being short a dozen pouches.

I checked the majority of the packets and there doesn't seem to be a leak in any of them. Shelf life per the expiration date is around 4.5 years. Good item to have in case of any kind of emergency.

September 7, 2015 Size: 66 Pack Verified Purchase Item as described. Good price. Great to have for a disaster preparedness kit. Newly produced date so item is not old. It is good for at least 5 years. Better to have extra water and never need it than to need it and not have it.

Great to have on hand. Water still is heavy, but packs of water easier to carry than bottles and the packs are tough. Mine expire in 2023.
