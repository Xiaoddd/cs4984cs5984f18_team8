Protesters trying to push past a long-blocked bridge on a state highway late Sunday and early Monday were turned back by authorities using tear gas, rubber bullets and water hoses. At least 17 protesters were injured severely enough to be taken to hospitals, said Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network. Although Goldtrooth said a water cannon was used to douse the protesters, Morton County Sheriff's spokesman Rob Keller denied that. Goldtooth said the fires were set to warm people soaked with water. He criticized authorities' use of water on a frigid night. Morton County Sheriff's spokesman Rob Keller could not verify the number of protester injuries. Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Tarah Demant, spokeswoman for the human rights group Amnesty International, which has had observers at the protest area. Keller said the American Red Cross set up an emergency shelter in Fort Yates for any protesters needing help. The skirmish began Sunday evening after protesters tried to remove two burned-out trucks on what's known as the Backwater Bridge, not far from the encampment where they've been for weeks as they demonstrate against the pipeline. The Morton County Sheriff's Department estimated 400 protesters sought to cross the bridge on state Highway 1806. One person was arrested. Rema Loeb said he was forced to retreat from the bridge because he feared being doused with water on the freezing night. Others, he said, needed medical treatment after being hit with tear gas. The 1,200-mile, four-state pipeline is being built to carry oil from western North Dakota to a shipping point in Illinois. They also worry that construction could threaten sacred sites. Pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners has said no sites have been disturbed and that the pipeline will have safeguards against leaks, and is a safer method of transport for oil than rail or truck. The company has said the pipeline is largely complete except for the section under Lake Oahe, a Missouri River reservoir in southern North Dakota. On Friday, ETP Chief Executive Kelcy Warren said the company is unwilling to reroute the pipeline. Associated Press writer Blake Nicholson reported from Bismarck.
