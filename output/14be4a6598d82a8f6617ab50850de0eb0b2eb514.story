FELONY criminal mischief. Leonard shut down the Spectra Express tar sands pipeline last year in Montana. Possible sentence of 10 years in prison.

Samuel Jessup of Winooski, Vermont, who filmed Foster's protest, also stood trial and was convicted of conspiracy. Sentencing for both men is scheduled for January 18.
