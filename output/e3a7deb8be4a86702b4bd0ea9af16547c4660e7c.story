An impassioned writer turned biologist turned environmental activist, Carson understood from a young age her place in nature. Her mother, Marie Carson, was a former schoolteacher, who like many women during the early 1900s gave up her career for marriage and motherhood. Though a poverty-stricken housewife, Marie was an educated woman who enjoyed reading and music and possessed an insatiable love for nature. Fortunately for mankind, that love and respect for nature was passed down to Rachel, who today is accredited for the existence of environmental protections, and the simple willingness to weigh the impacts of technology on nature. Together, the two spent entire afternoons outdoors identifying birds and insects while listening to and appreciating the sounds of nature. Carson was a solitary, yet thoughtful, young girl who greeted the birds on her way to school. At 14, Carson was selling her work to magazines. A Creative Writer Who Fell in Love With Science Marie did everything in her power to ensure Rachel received the education she longed for, but never received. Carson landed a research position at a marine laboratory in Massachusetts where she discovered the ocean and her unshakable love for the vast, unexplored body of water. It was then Carson realized that everything was interconnected, and man was not in control. Her journey into environmental activism began during World War II, a tense and fearful time in which Americans were suffering the brunt of a brutal war and infectious disease outbreaks that caused unbearable symptoms and killed millions. She realized her stories would make excellent feature pieces, and began selling them to newspapers including the Baltimore Sun. Weary about losing credibility simply because she was a woman, Carson omitted her first name from her articles. These feelings receded though, once she learned how to marry biology with writing. It painted a vivid, yet mysterious picture of a never-before-seen world. Though it received early praise, the book never hit stores and ultimately flopped as its release coincided with the bombing of Pearl Harbor. As formidable as the war itself was the massive outbreaks of typhoid fever faced by soldiers abroad and Americans at home. Crowded and unsanitary living conditions proved to be the perfect breeding ground for body lice, which carried and spread the disease. But the discovery of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) as a powerful insecticide offered hope in combating the insufferable disease, while giving man a sense of control over his environment. Acutely toxic to insects, but seemingly harmless to humans, DDT was sprayed indiscriminately abroad and at home to kill mosquitos carrying malaria, body lice and eventually agriculture pests. As shown in the film, millions of people were dusted with DDT. It was sprayed in their hair, inside their clothing and even on sleeping babies. At the time, DDT seemed like a miracle, a gift from God even. More than 4.5 million homes and 20 million acres of farmland in the southern U.S. were treated with DDT, according to the film. Dead Birds and Fish Kills Eventually biologists began seeing evidence that DDT was causing mass bird and fish kills. As a biologist for the Fish and Wildlife Services (FWS), Carson witnessed the evidence firsthand and wanted to write an article warning people about the possible dangers. Carson had no choice but to shelve the idea. The chemical was used in countless products including DDT-coated shelf paper and paints and varnishes. Meanwhile, Carson was focused on her second book. Carson had managed to take a complicated subject and relay it in an almost poetic way that both relaxed and intrigued readers. It reached the No. 1 spot, where it remained for 32 straight weeks. The development of the atomic bomb and chemicals like DDT made people feel as if they had mastered the planet. Carson, however, viewed unlimited human ingenuity as dangerous and believed that human arrogance outruns human wisdom. As the development of weapons of mass destruction continued, Carson realized humans could in fact destroy nature. By 1956, pesticide sales had increased 25 percent. It soon became evident pesticide scientists were thinking only about acute toxicity and not the long-term effects. Biologists learned that pesticides like DDT were bio-accumulating in wildlife and becoming more concentrated as they moved up the food chain. One study found that earthworms were so toxic one year after DDT exposure that they poisoned the robins feasting on them. Even more disturbing was evidence of insect resistance, which meant that birds and fish were needlessly dying while the targeted insects continued to thrive. In 1959, the U.S. government finally admitted the health hazards of nuclear fallout. Per the advice of her doctor, Carson underwent a radical mastectomy and was told that it was gone and not cancerous. But a second hard lump soon appeared, prompting her to get a second opinion from a doctor who diagnosed it as cancer. The devastating news gave Carson a newfound sense of urgency. No witchcraft. No enemy. No witchcraft, no enemy action had snuffed out life in this stricken world. The book sparked major controversy, selling 65,000 copies in less than two weeks; every newspaper in the nation reviewed it. Monsanto resorted to scare tactics, running advertisements that depicted a world overrun with infectious disease and famine. We can do dramatic things, and we can do them quickly. By the time damaging side effects are apparent, it is often too late or impossible to reverse our actions. Carson singlehandedly managed to enact a paradigm shift in the way humans view the environment. Some say there is a before and after Rachel Carson in terms of how we think about the environment. Carson believed that we as humans are not separate from this living world, but in fact are a part of it. On April 14, 1964, Carson succumbed to cancer and died at the young age of 56. The 'Silent Spring' Continues Carson rightfully questioned the logic and sanity of using such vast amounts of a chemical without knowing much about its ecological and human health impact. Her book triggered a revolution in thinking that gave birth to the modern environmental movement, and the public outcry that resulted from her book eventually led to DDT being banned for agricultural use in the U.S. in 1972. Disturbingly, some believe glyphosate may actually be WORSE than DDT, yet the U.S. government has repeatedly failed to take affirmative action to protect us from this pervasive toxin. Today, we're also exposed to even vaster amounts of pesticides, and a wider variety of them. Consider this: The very same companies that developed chemical warfare weapons during World War II simply transitioned into agriculture after the war, and many of the same warfare chemicals are now sprayed on our food. The notion that these chemicals are good for humans, the environment and the business of agriculture is a fabricated one. DDT, which is harmful even at very low levels, is also linked to male infertility, miscarriages, developmental delays, nervous system and liver damage. Modern day research proves Carson was right about her suspicions that DDT caused health effects, yet Offit and other chemical industry proponents continue to attack a woman who displayed one of the most remarkable cases of bravery our nation has ever seen.
