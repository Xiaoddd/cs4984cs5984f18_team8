Col. John G. Buck, commander of the Seattle District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, was honored with the gift of a hand-woven traditional blanket, a high honor in Indian Country. Also honored was Hilary Franz, the newly elected commissioner of the state Department of Natural Resources. The department manages lands and waters across the state and is working to permanently protect the waters at Cherry Point from industrial development. About the DAPL protest The Trump administration has advanced the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipeline projects. And here's what we're reading related to the controversy. March 28: What the completed Dakota Access pipeline means for key players. Feb. 22: Preparing to leave, Standing Rock protesters ceremonially burn camp. Feb. 1: Hundreds rally as the Seattle City Council considers divesting from Wells Fargo because of its role as a Dakota Access Pipeline lender. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says it will push back. That victory, gained with support from tribes across the Northwest, was a spark that helped inspire and encourage opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. Leaders of the Tulalip, Spokane and Yakama Nations also joined the celebration, which featured clam chowder, fresh crabs, oysters and salmon, all caught by Lummi fishermen from local waters. Fire-roasted on sticks, the fish was succulent, crimson and delicious like no other food, just one reason for the joy in the hall. Children and youth in traditional regalia performed tribal dances as tribal members cracked open steamed crab legs. Tim Ballew, chairman of the Lummi Nation, took in the scene. Washington tribes are fighting fossil-fuel projects around the state to preserve fisheries and sacred sites. The hope expressed now among many here was that the victory would stick at Standing Rock, hard won by thousands of opponents encamped by the Cannonball River near the proposed river crossing, now in bitter cold. Energy Transfer Partners on Monday issued a statement vowing to complete the pipeline project, in the same crossing area, basically as if nothing had ever happened. But no drilling is going on, according to law-enforcement officials in North Dakota. The work that remains is major. Whether that will ever happen, or where, is now under a new round of consideration. If the new president seeks to cancel the environmental review, the tribe will go to court to insist on it. Many tribal leaders addressed the crowd first in their native language. Without these we cease to exist as a people. As we are able to shoot these fossil-fuel proposals down, they will rise again. And we will need to remember who we are and where we come from. View Comments No personal attacks or insults, no hate speech, no profanity.
