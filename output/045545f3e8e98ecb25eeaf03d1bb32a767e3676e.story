What killed them was the betrayal that clad itself with a black garment. The Yazidi Kurds, who call the genocides perpetrated on them 'Ferman', the Kurdish term for decree, fell this time into the grip of almost total annihilation, captivity and enslavement by the ferocious ISIS gangs. But what was more suffocating for the Yazidis than the stranglehold of ISIS, was the betrayal that clad itself in a black garment. THE WELL-PREPARED GENOCIDE When the ISIS gangs stood at the doors of Shengal, thousands of Peshmerga and asayish members of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) chaired by Masoud Barzani, who until that very moment controlled the Shengal town, made a quick getaway without shooting even one single bullet. As a result of the flight of the KDP Peshmerga, thousands of Yazidis were slaughtered by the ISIS gangs, thousands more were abducted, predominantly women and children, and sold at markets into slavery. Interestingly, shortly before the genocide took place, the KDP forces seized all the arms and weapons the Yazidis had at that time and took into custody three of the twelve guerrillas of the People's Defense Forces (HPG) and the Free Women's Troops (YJA-Star), who came to the rescue of the fleeing Yazidi people. All this made it indeed very clear, how well prepared and organized this extensive genocide actually was. THE UN REPORT ON THE GENOCIDE According to the investigations of the High Commissioner of Human Rights of the United Nations, which were made public in October 2014, the results of the attacks launched on the 3rd August 2014 were as follows: - around 5000 Yazidi men were massacred - around 100 Yazidi men were beheaded - 7000 Yazidi girls and women were abducted and sold at slave markets - A number of Yazidi girls and women were raped - Some Yazidi women were forced to marry ISIS commanders The later revealed actual numbers of the victims and the countless Yazidis who starved to death and died of thirst, clearly showed that the estimated number of unknown cases was much higher than what was written in the report of the United Nations. Most of those mass murders were perpetrated by the Ottoman empire. The first genocide was ordered in the year 1246 by the lord of Zengi of Mosul, Bedreddin Lulu, the last one by the Neo Ottoman AKP and its ally KDP and perpetrated by the ISIS gangs. In each and every genocide, the name of Islam was used. THE MASSACRE OF 2007 One of the more recent mass killings against the Yazidi Kurds took place in 2007. On the 14th August 2007 attacks were carried out with four bomb laden trucks in the villages Siba Shex Xidir and Til Izer of Shengal. As a result 300 people were killed. No investigations were launched in this case whatsoever. It was reported that this massacre was perpetrated by a group of gangs called Ensar El Sune affiliated with Al-Qaeda, which tried at that time to get some foothold in Southern Kurdistan. However many sources said that the gang Turkmen Front of Iraq (ITC) was involved in the attack, which was forged by the Turkish secret service in Southern Kurdistan. In 1975 under the Iraqi Ba'ath regime the Yazidis were forcibly resettled. In each and every genocide they faced, the Yazidi people saved themselves into the protective arms of Mount Shengal. When in 2003 the US intervened in Iraq and toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein, a new constitution was prepared for Iraq. A referendum was planned for 2007 to be held in Shengal as well, but until today that referendum was never realised. However unlike the cities of Kirkuk, Jalawla, Khanaqin and Tuz Khurmatu, the KDP established its monocracy in Shengal. The KDP even used the faith of the Yazidis for its own advantages and supported this sheikh system, keeping tabs on the entire Yazidi people. They told them, go eat and drink and take your money, but do not think. They did not appreciate it when people were talking about things like honour, freedom and values. But one must not let out the continuous resistance of the women against this. Yet those struggles were mostly constricted to some private persons. TOWARDS THE AUGUST 3 GENOCIDE On the 10th of June 2014 when ISIS invaded Mosul, Shengal ran into danger more than any other district of Mosul. On the growing imminent threats that were hovering over Shengal, the leadership of the PKK got in contact with the KDP and called attention to the grave situation. The PKK made clear, that it could send some of its forces to Shengal, but the KDP did not answer this call of the PKK. A FORCE OF 11000 WELL EQUIPPED MEN WERE ON SITE After invading Mosul, the ISIS gangs charged Tal Afar, a district of the Turkmen community in immediate vicinity of Shengal. A great deal of the Shia Turkmen people here fled to Shengal. The gangs were now very close to attack Shengal next. According to official statistics that were revealed afterwards, prior to the barbaric attacks of the ISIS gangs on Shengal, the number of the Peshmerga and asayish members of Southern Kurdistan and the Iraqi Federal Police, traffic police and armed units that were affiliated with some other political parties comprised altogether 11000 personnel positioned in Shengal and the surrounding villages. Because we were surrounded by a massive army of Peshmergas and even Iraqi soldiers. And we trusted them. They used to tell us: 'We will protect you'. But unfortunately, they fled when the attacks started. When ISIS swept over ravaging, all the arms of the Yazidi youth were taken away from them here. They assured us with words like: 'We will protect you, don't worry, you don't need to take up arms'. And they seized there all the weapons. However during the genocide they did not even shoot a bullet, they did not give one martyr and had not even one of their fingers bleed.
