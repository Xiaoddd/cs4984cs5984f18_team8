Casey Sykes Facebook Twitter Email Print Save At 6:30 p.m. Thursday night, a small group of students huddled at the corner of the Arch with signs and sweaters, talking and waiting for their Standing Rock protest to begin. The Standing Rock protests across the nation are resisting the installation of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which would run an oil pipeline through a Native American reservation and their sacred land and under the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. People across the nation, specifically the Sioux Native Americans, have rallied against the pipeline with protests that began in the spring. But it is not just Native Americans who oppose the pipeline. Osama Mor, a senior biology major from Augusta, headed the protest as the president of SJP. Mor is Palestinian and has family who has faced hardships from Zionists in Palestine. Mor said they were protesting for Standing Rock as an act of solidarity because he sees parallels between colonization in Palestine and colonization in the United States. SJP organized the protest through social media and met beforehand to talk about the protest and make posters. Mor said he expected more people to come, but thanked those who did participate and talked about the Standing Rock efforts and their opposition to the Dakota Pipeline. Other people also came to join and talk with protesters. Yazzie, a first-year graduate student in agriculture and environmental education from New Mexico, said she heard about the event through Facebook. As a Native American, she thanked the protesters for bringing awareness of Standing Rock to the University of Georgia. Mor said there are only six Native American UGA students, and he did not want to talk on behalf of them, but wanted to support them through the SJP. The group dispersed at 7:45 p.m. after standing in a line for about an hour. Stop watching this discussion.
