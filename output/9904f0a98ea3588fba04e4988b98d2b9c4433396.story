Building great dangerous leaky pipelines to pump poison over water supplies, and to torment and abuse the people most affected by them, is not. The pipeline was ignoring all the environmental laws and the treaties; the state government was violating human rights. Nerd of Redhead, Dances OM Trolls says 4 December 2016 at 6:23 pm Sounds to me like the Army Corps of Engineers finally got off their duffs and looked at what they were supposed to do in the first place. Anything less than double-walled construction where a spill would endanger the water supply for even one person is caving in to the industry with a bad reputation. Make them truly respect the concept that failure is not an option. No bankruptcy will stop the liens on their personal liability for their decisions. Mike Smith says 4 December 2016 at 6:59 pm To be reversed Jan. 20 with impunity. Winter is coming. Nerd of Redhead, Dances OM Trolls says 4 December 2016 at 7:02 pm Winter is coming. slithey tove (twas brillig (stevem)) says 4 December 2016 at 7:05 pm Roads, bridges, transmission lines, pipelines, wind farms and water lines will be very difficult, if not impossible, to build when criminal behavior is rewarded this way. You got it. Hypocrisy knows no bounds. jrkrideau says 4 December 2016 at 7:38 pm Congratulations to all those people defending the land at Standing Rock. Regulations, like the FDA cGMP, are the equivalent of Federal Laws, and can only be overturned if they follow the protocol in the USC. Which requires, per USC, public hearings, time for responses, etc. Takes months, if not years to greatly change it. What is Science, it works. Silver Fox says 4 December 2016 at 8:05 pm The original planned route for the pipeline was through Bismarck, a mostly white city, but it was deemed too dangerous so they decided to run it through Indian Country instead. They should go back to the original plan and see how those good, upstanding Republican voters think about that. Oh, and lets not forget the dogs, the truncheons, the rubber bullets, the gas. I can already hear the outrage on Fox News. Maybe build some new ones for Flint and countless other cities that need them. A Government, dealing with a huge project such as this, sometimes has to choose between a rock and a hard place (no pun intended) when making decisions. Real life sucks sometimes, deal with it. I am not deliberately being a dick, just pointing out reality. We are still an oil-based country in the US, so horrible choices will need to be made. yes you are. SC (Salty Current) says 4 December 2016 at 8:58 pm Congratulations and thank you to all of the protesters. If so, their participation will make it that much harder or the Army Corps to reverse it. The responses so far are beautiful. Ryan is so forward-looking. In 2012 and 2014, along with 2016. Stop spreading that damn lie. A big ass section of it went into land six miles from my house. unclefrogy says 4 December 2016 at 9:37 pm Real life sucks sometimes, deal with it. I am not deliberately being a dick, just pointing out reality. We are still an oil-based country in the US, so horrible choices will need to be made. absolutely agree with that. The problem is that is not what we they were attempting to do here. What they were doing here was finding the cheapest way to do it like always, cost the least and make the most money. Very few were involved in this for the greater good of society they were in for the sole motive of making the most money they could by delivering a valuable commodity to customers who will pay top dollar for it. They can get off the pedestal now and take the flag off their shoulders. Cheap is not the be all and end all if they can not build and operator a pipe lines that meets proper safety standards and make a profit that is tough. if they can not make money from the oil business without what is increasingly clear are unacceptable pollution levels and compliance is impossible that also is tough. Water Protectors, please. Not protestors. SC (Salty Current) says 4 December 2016 at 9:45 pm Apologies. Caine says 4 December 2016 at 9:48 pm In October, Mark Trahant pointed out that here in nDakota, making the switch to clean energy right now would boost the economy and bring permanent jobs to the state. ck, the Irate Lump says 4 December 2016 at 10:41 pm miles links wrote: Science, it works. What you linked was not science. Some highlights: From 1990 through 2012, 17 605 pipeline incidents were reported to the oil and gas regulator in Alberta at the time. 2012 saw 550 leaks and 17 ruptures, of which, 463 released hydrocarbon liquid or gas. The report brags that pipeline failures are down to a new low of 1.5 incidents per 1000km of pipeline, but the vast majority of the gains were from more reliable water pipelines which pose limited environmental risk when they leak or rupture. Go look it up and educate yourself. As of that date we became a net EXPORTER of petroleum products. At no time has any sane policy ever formally depended on tax base status. The actual taxpaying residents within Yellowstone or Grand Tetons or wherever are NEVER part of the decision process. Stop being a dick. This pipeline is a profit generation device that should never have been considered on merit. ESPECIALLY when it was relocated away from Bismarck. Stop being a dick and start learning stuff. Stop being part of dozens of millions of dicks who think crap that is false. Title sounded good. Title sounded good. Title sounded good. You did bad. Acknowledge your wrong, and learn from it. Nerd of Redhead, Dances OM Trolls says 5 December 2016 at 12:17 am And Miles, try this about pipelines versus other modes of transport. Fortune Magazine, hardly a bastion of green politics, talks about the potential problems. In 2010, a pipeline owned by Enbridge leaked 843,444 gallons of crude oil into wetlands around the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. The environmentalist Polaris Institute found that, according to Enbridge data, that company experienced 804 spills and released 5 million gallons of oil between 1999 and 2010. This spill is meaningful to me, since it occurred upstream from where I grew up in Battle Creek, MI, where it flows through the city from east to west. The Kalamazoo River flows west from Battle Creek, past Kalamazoo, and through south west Michigan, which has a lot of fruit orchards and grape vineyards. A large scale problem not just localized to a small area. The Wall Street Journal shows certain advantages to rail. PROS: Trains tend to spill a smaller amount of oil than other forms of transport. Rail transport can be speedier, too. It takes about five to seven days to move oil by train from North Dakota to the Gulf Coast or Atlantic Coast, the CRS says, versus about 40 days by pipeline. CONS: Rail accidents potentially threaten lives and can cause widespread property damage. As I recall from an oil and gas law symposium I attended, it is standard practice to have double-walled pipes reinforced with concrete. When I tried to leave messages at the North Dakota messaging service, the line was busy nine times out of 10. I hope the community up there will stay the course and not leave the camp quite yet. Avoid cities and head through sparsely populated areas. Sorry if that upsets the ghosts of a few religious lunatics. Ill maintained and supervised pipelines are, lousily designed pipelines add to the potential for disaster on an ill maintained, ill supervised pipeline. We had more pipelines than I can count in the area I grew up in, with leaks few and far between. Bankruptcy, forbidden. We do need to get a major fuel used for everything from lubricating machinery through fueling the literal engines of commerce, we do need to find superior alternatives as well. I prefer peace, but not at all costs, I long ago ran out of cheeks. Which only adds to my respect for you. I managed to not retch, but did get him off of the property and summon both EMS and law enforcement, who sent him to a good mental health care facility. Headed to bed now. the attitude that seems to be applied in these questions is it is about survival to build this pipe line. It is about the oil business it is the one that is fighting for survival they can see the righting on the wall it is going to change and the longer we struggle to keep oil cheap at all costs the longer it will take to the alternative to take over. It does nothing for us the citizens it just puts money in the pockets of the already rich oil business. These decisions are not long term decisions made with the success and prosperity of the country in mind they are short term decisions made at the behest and in favor to the oil business which will reap the profits. When oil finally goes away as our primary energy source because it is absofuckinglutely a finite source we can buy the new stuff from other countries who do not fancy putting all their eggs in one basket and are not controlled by the oil business. Rowan vet-tech says 5 December 2016 at 1:44 am Miles. Please stop showing us your asshole. Tethys says 5 December 2016 at 2:27 am I think a route well away from the river valley (and the water source for many ND people and others downstream) is far preferable to the stupidity of running it under the Missouri. The risk of destroying an entire watershed is unacceptable. Not building it at all is acceptable. Railroads could use some business if they would like to contribute to some domestic job growth. Then we are left with the treaty obligations and the rights and privileges recognized by The United States Constitution to all people. The Fraser Inititue will say whatever they are paid to say. The quality of their analysis often does rise to a Gr. 12 student level though. Any safety assurance by the pipeline company to Standing Rock probably should be considered a pius hope at best and complete lie more likely. My god. Yes, Indians engaged in warfare. They also practiced torture. They fought with each other over territory. On a few occasions, they committed atrocities against European settlers. People do bad things sometimes, and they are people. This cannot be used to justify generic slaughter and criminal maltreatment of any other people. The simple fact of the matter is that the people of Standing Rock are as deserving of lawful and humane treatment as any other people in the world, yet they are victims of historical and ongoing inequities against their group as a whole that deserve correction. Or maybe you do. Then get the fuck out of here. The Fraser Inititue will say whatever they are paid to say. The quality of their analysis often does rise to a Gr. 12 student level though. Indeed. Their report even owns up to the fact that pipelines spill a lot more than trains. But since the pipeline industry commissioned the report, they pushed hard on incident rates (which means nothing) and the fatality rate (lots more people killed directly by trains than by pipe). Regardless, it rather begs the question of whether we should be shipping the oil in the first place. Dunc says 5 December 2016 at 10:30 am Their report even owns up to the fact that pipelines spill a lot more than trains. But since the pipeline industry commissioned the report, they pushed hard on incident rates (which means nothing) and the fatality rate (lots more people killed directly by trains than by pipe). Stripping that one incident out changes the average number of injuries per billion ton-miles per year from 0.2594 to 0.0732, which is almost a factor of 4. It also give you a number which is a little over half that of natural gas pipelines (although still much higher than hazardous liquid pipelines). Title sounded good. Olav says 5 December 2016 at 1:23 pm From where I am sitting, half a world away, this does not look so much like a victory for the NODAPL movement. Sorry to have to say this but it looks more like a stay of execution. The outgoing administration does not want to be seen as the one that violently forced the pipeline to be completed, so it leaves that to the next. It looks like a rather cynical move. slithey tove (twas brillig (stevem)) says 5 December 2016 at 1:53 pm shit, let me butt in. Present Train Transport vs Pipeline transport, that way. numerobis says 5 December 2016 at 2:00 pm Leaks per mile and gallons per incident are shitty measures. Thank you. Lila wopila, Rietpluim. Present Train Transport vs Pipeline transport, that way. Even with the limits of per-incident reporting, 460 incidents of hydrocarbons (with a relatively even split between gas and liquid leaks) being released from a pipeline in one year from a single Canadian province should be concern enough. Maybe pipelines can be operated safely, but not at the cost businesses tend to be willing to operate them at. I agree. Anyone buffoon who says this should be ignored. I have had this accusation before, but sadly no, I am not a person from that place. Confused. chigau (ever-elliptical) says 5 December 2016 at 11:44 pm Liar. Tethys says 6 December 2016 at 12:12 am Confused. This word is true. The rest is simply extra foul bait, so I wrote a poem. Confused. This is a very serious point, made in completely good faith. Your words, as I read them, completely dismiss the arguments of NA Indians. Honestly, confused. John Morales says 6 December 2016 at 5:17 am miles links: A Government, dealing with a huge project such as this, sometimes has to choose between a rock and a hard place (no pun intended) when making decisions. Real life sucks sometimes, deal with it. I am not deliberately being a dick, just pointing out reality. Even were that true, what you describe is a Government which cares more for short-term profit than for the welfare of its constituents and of the environment. No need to argue hypothetically; they most certainly predated the European conquest. The more you post, the pyttier you sound, regardless of your protestations. Confused. The objections are present and pragmatic no less than they relate to breaches of promises (though they also breach a historical treaty). my back is sore must see a chiropractic Please do; you deserve that. Present Train Transport vs Pipeline transport, that way. On this measure, rail transport is significantly better (see, for example, U.S. Rail Transportation of Crude Oil: Background and Issues for Congress). For an example of some discussion of these issues, see Risk Assessment of Oil Spills to US Inland Waterways. Confused. No. Europeans killed Indians with warfare and disease, took over their land, and then promised the survivors that they could live on these scattered tracts of empty reservation land. Our ancestors committed genocide, but they stepped back from the brink of completely exterminating native residents of the land we took. To suggest there is parity between the actions of powerless Indians and powerful white American money interests is ignorant and offensive. not confused though the arguments are confused and not stupid or at least I am having a hard time believing he is stupid but I do not find it very hard to belief he is in fact thinking about this from a prejudicial frame of mind in fact he is showing signs of bigotry. giving the pipeline business and by extension the oil business all the benefit of the doubt and not considering any other out come than would not be a direct benefit for the energy business. He is acting and sounding to me like a shill for the pipeline business. I hope he is getting payed well. Nerd of Redhead, Dances OM Trolls says 13 December 2016 at 3:29 pm Prima facie evidence that the pipeline should not be built and run as designed. Creek in ND polluted due to a pipeline break. Roughly a third of the more than 3,000 barrels of oil that spilled into a North Dakota creek following a pipeline leak last week has been recovered, a local official said on Tuesday. An estimated 4,200 barrels of oil leaked from the Belle Fourche Pipeline on a hill just above the Ash Coulee Creek, and an estimated 3,100 barrels made it into the water, said Bill Seuss, a program manager for the North Dakota Department of Health. The leak was first reported to regulators on Dec. 5, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). The incident may serve as something of a rallying cry for groups opposing the pipeline, which have said a spill could enter important watersheds and contaminate water. The point of release into the Ash Coulee Creek is about 18 miles from where it feeds into the Little Missouri River, which then feeds the Missouri, a major drinking water source, Seuss said.
