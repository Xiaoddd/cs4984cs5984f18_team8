In one 2005 incident, 436,000 gallons of crude oil spewed from a tank farm into a Delaware River tributary outside Philadelphia. That same year, a pipeline built in the 1950s dumped enough oil into the Kentucky and Ohio river to leave a 17-mile oil slick. Cleaning up those sorts of spills is no easy job. Sunoco, which merged with ETP, is included in the report's analysis. The new report finds that ETP's pipelines have a somewhat higher-than-average rate of problems. Many living near Mariner East's path are concerned about the risk of more accidents. Other ETP pipeline construction projects that have had a lower national profile also caused major spills. Greenpeace is currently defending against those charges in court and argues that the case is what's known as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, or SLAPP suit, aimed at silencing discussion of harms caused by ETP.
