In a word, he looks backward at all times. On questions of jobs and industry, he looks back at least to the 1950s. Like some Soviet Realist painter, Mr. Trump seems to have an image stuck in his head of brawny men building a nation. Image Opponents of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines protested near the White House on Tuesday. If the Keystone XL Pipeline is ever completed, for instance, it will employ about 35 full-time workers, relying for its operation on a vast network of sensors, drones and the like. The number of workers employed in generating solar power now surpasses those employed in the generation of electricity from coal, gas and oil combined. On questions of energy economics, Mr. Trump is stuck somewhere in the Reagan era, when energy independence at any cost was the watchword. Standing Rock, the scene of the battle over the Dakota pipeline, stands with Flint., Mich., as the flash points of environmental racism in our recent history. The Obama administration made a significant stride forward when it took seriously the complaints of Native Americans; Mr. Trump clearly prefers a world where Indians are simply colorful set decorations in the diorama of American history. Each is a complex mix of commercial, political and legal calculation. What is clear, however, is that there will be enormous resistance. Many Indian nations were represented at the Standing Rock camp, and they drew big contingents of clergy members, military veterans and young people as allies. Farmers and ranchers across the heartland are far more sophisticated than they were a decade ago in standing up to eminent domain actions by foreign corporations. There will be a major gathering in the capital on April 29 to demand a clean energy revolution. Temperatures around the planet are rising, and rising fast; we may be weeks away from observing an iceberg the size of Delaware dropping off the edge of the Antarctic. In the real, fact-based world the pressure for change will become impossible to resist, and the only question is who will get to lead, and benefit from, the transition. It is larger than the work force employed in the generation of electricity from coal, gas and oil, not than the work force employed in extracting those fossil fuels.
