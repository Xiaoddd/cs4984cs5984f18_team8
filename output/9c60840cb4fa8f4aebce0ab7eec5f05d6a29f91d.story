While Todays news was positive, it is only a temporary victory. The decision not to give an easement to the pipeline company is not necessarily permanent. There are too many factors to explain here, but more importantly to abandon the camps now would be a huge risk with a new administration coming in. In short nothing has changed on the front lines, and our groups plans have remained unchanged. Thank you for donating and we will send updates from the front lines. This week Union volunteers are building a more permanent shelter as well as a Mess Hall for Tribal Water Protectors. They have no plans on leaving no matter how harsh the conditions get. This week the high will be 7 degrees and it will reach -18 overnight. All Donations will be used to help with the building of these two very important structures. Thank you all for donating.
