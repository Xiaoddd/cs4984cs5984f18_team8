Your Image was too big. Something went wrong. post has not been vetted or endorsed by BuzzFeed's editorial staff. Gunner is in China ahead of an economic summit and also met gas industry officials, including a key stakeholder in Jemena, the company with the contract to construct and operate the NGP, in Beijing on Wednesday. Several Wakaya families whose traditional land would be intersected by parts of the pipeline say they have been ignored by the authorities after raising concerns about the pipeline's potential damage to the environment and sacred sites. There is currently a moratorium on fracking in the NT, imposed by Gunner after coming to power in August, until a review of the impact of shale oil and gas extraction methods can be undertaken. Traditional owners opposed to the NGP are convinced that fracking will go ahead if they give consent. Formerly with BuzzFeed News, Allan Clarke is a NITV reporter based in Sydney. Submit it here.
