At a campaign rally on Thursday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump revealed that he favors letting states decide whether to legalize marijuana for recreational use. While taking questions at the Nugget (heh) Convention Center in Sparks, Nevada, outside of Reno, Trump reaffirmed his strong support for giving sick people access to medical marijuana. Nevada recently legalized medical marijuana and an initiative to regulate and tax the drug like alcohol will be on the state ballot next year. Colorado, which hosted the third Republican debate on Wednesday night, legalized recreational marijuana in 2014. Trump, who claims not to drink alcohol, is no fan of drugs but has expressed a range of opinions on drug policy. Way back in 1990, he expressed support for legalizing drugs and using the tax revenue to fund anti-drug education initiatives. On Wednesday, Democrat Bernie Sanders came out in favor of fully decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level, paving the way for states to regulate it as they do alcohol and cigarettes.
