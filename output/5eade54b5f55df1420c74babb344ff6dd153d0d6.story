FILE - In this Sept. 29, 2016, file photo, shows a section of the Dakota Access pipeline under construction near St. Anthony in Morton County, N.D. North Dakota regulators are investigating whether the developer of the pipeline removed too many trees while laying pipe in the state. A report from a third-party inspector identified more than 80 sites where trees might have been improperly cleared. Energy Transfer Partners denies violating terms of its permit. And its plan for replacing trees calls for crews to plant more than two trees for every one that was removed. The Public Service Commission planned to discuss both matters during a closed executive session on Friday, with resolutions to both issues possible by the group's next public meeting on Wednesday, Chairwoman Julie Fedorchak said. Construction is complete, however, and the pipeline should be fully operating by June 1, said Vicki Granado, spokeswoman for the Texas-based developer, Energy Transfer Partners. Mop-up work remains, such as tree restoration. A December report from third-party inspector Keitu Engineers and Consultants Inc. identified 83 sites along the 380-mile (610-kilometer) pipeline corridor in North Dakota where trees might have been cleared in violation of the commission's orders. The report by analyst Dean Mostad doesn't estimate the number of trees involved. Granado insisted to The Associated Press that ETP didn't violate terms of its permit. Mike Futch, ETP's pipeline project manager in North Dakota, said in a letter to commission attorney John Schuh in March that it's possible the company cleared the disputed areas of trees before the company and commission agreed in June 2016 how large an area could be cleared. The company submitted its tree replacement plan in April. The PSC must approve the plan. Fedorchak said ETP could be fined for any violation of the Public Service Commission's tree removal orders. No artifacts were disturbed. ETP maintains it didn't intentionally violate state rules and has asked for that case to be dismissed.
