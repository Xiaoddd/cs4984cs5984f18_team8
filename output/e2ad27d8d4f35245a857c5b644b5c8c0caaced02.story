Rivas spend six months living in the resistance camp in Cannon Ball, N.D., outside the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation photographing the people of the camp. Rivas is a Mexica photographer from Los Angeles who traveled to Cannon Ball, N.D., in August 2016 to document the indigenous-led movement against the Dakota Access pipeline near the border of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. He remained embedded in the main Oceti Sakowin resistance camp for six months, until law enforcement shut it down in late February of this year. Rivas took more than 10,000 photographs while he was there, some of which have appeared in the New York Times, The Guardian and Rolling Stone. Earlier this month he was awarded a fellowship through the Magnum Foundation, a prestigious organization in the world of documentary photography. Rivas was one of a dozen presenters who spoke at the Rapid City Performing Arts Center during TEDxRapidCity, an all-day event that showcased a range of unique ideas in short talks about everything from environmental policy to sociolinguistics. This is the third year that the event has been held in Rapid City. It is important, he noted, that non-Native journalists be present and willing to learn how to interact with indigenous peoples, but if stories are to be told with indigenous peoples at their hearts, then Rivas believes that indigenous voices need to be there to tell them. Helping to encourage and strengthen those voices is the work he wants to throw himself into next as he looks beyond Standing Rock and into the future. The fight against the Dakota Access pipeline began last April and continued for nearly an entire year, bringing together hundreds of tribes in one of the largest gathering of indigenous people in American history. In the final months, the resistance camps along the Missouri River swelled to as many as 10,000 people in size. With construction completed, crude oil from the Bakken Shale formations in North Dakota has begun flowing through the 1,172-mile-long pipeline to a distribution hub in Illinois. The fight to shutdown the pipeline continues in federal court. As a photographer, he sees his role as not a taker but a co-creator of images that he hopes will continue what was started at Standing Rock.
