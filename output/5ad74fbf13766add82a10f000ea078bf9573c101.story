Even if that is not the intent, the project has already succeeded in one critical Russian objective: dividing the West. Pipes are loaded for stacking at the Nord Stream 2 facility in Mukran. Germany gave the project final permitting approval last month. Preparatory construction at the quiet German harbor where the pipeline is intended to come ashore began in January. We expect more permits in the coming weeks and months. The route follows that of the original Nord Stream, which was built in 2011. The new pipeline would double the capacity of Russian gas to enter Europe via the Baltic. That figure is expected to rise substantially if Nord Stream 2 gets built. Russia has played such games before. It has turned off the gas to Ukraine as a means of pressuring the former Soviet republic whenever it appeared to be drifting toward the West. Sefcovic, the E.U. official, said he was hopeful negotiations could yield a deal to protect Ukrainian interests. Nord Stream 2, a sister company of the Russian energy giant Gazprom, does not lack for high-profile supporters in Germany. The project boasts investors from across Europe. Critics also ignore that Europe has more energy options than it did several years ago, given the construction of liquid natural gas (LNG) terminals, said Kirsten Westphal, a senior associate at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. That could limit the potential for Russian leverage. The proposed pipeline may be causing a rift in the Western alliance. Your subscription supports journalism that matters.
