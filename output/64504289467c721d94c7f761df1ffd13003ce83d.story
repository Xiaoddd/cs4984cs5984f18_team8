Long day. On a tiny plane from Minnesota to Bismarck. My seat mate is a middle aged man with graying hair, glasses, kind eyes, a weird mouth (half was smiling, the other was not) and very large hands. Born in ND, he resides in Montana now, flying back intermittently to visit his parents. A successful owner of a large trucking business, he proudly tells me he was interviewed on the radio the other day. As for Native Americans, he feels that they get subsidies from the government, that they have squandered their opportunities by lack of education, alcoholism, gambling. He says no. I hop into a cute dark red Nissan on Rt. 1806, towards Standing Rock, but at the end, the highway is blocked by police in camouflage, at the scene of the riot violence, adjacent to the camp. I feel like I am at a border checkpoint, one officer has a clipboard recording license plates. Another has a gun, and the third a sweet young man is kindly directing people in cars like mine to take the detour. One hour later, I am back on 1806. I feel this is a deliberate action on their part to discourage us from coming. The air is invigorating, it reminds me of Iceland. Horses, cattle and bison huddle together awaiting winter, with a few motionless sentinels in a field. The casino from the distance looms on top of the hill like a dark fortress. Inside it too is grim, there are protestors huddled around the lobby on their Iphones and laptops trying to find comfort in the virtual world. The visitors look like Bernie Bros, or Occupy people, unwashed, having been camping out for a while. I think many are in shock. The casino has opened their doors to them. There are mostly Native Americans though. Some have come to gamble. Next to reception there is a dark room with lots of slot machines. It is a sad spectacle to watch people, with no money gambling away. I am beginning to get glimmers why. As I gaze around at the empty plains, I think of them. This is their land, their birthright. Everything that matters to them flourished once. Their customs, their water, their families, their freedom, their food was taken away from them. They were decimated by white America. And now they are treated as foreigners and outcasts. The irony of this burns me up. Annette Beyer (teacher) and Bernadette Dauenhauer (School Principal, married a German) are from the school where we will be serving Thanksgiving dinner to 2,000 Natives. We discuss many things. I want to get the facts straight and help get them out to the public at large. Both sides are furious, I feel the need to stay calm and encourage a comprehensive Press release with clear details. Kids with alcoholic parents who have just checked out, they are not involved at all in their kids education. Lots of drug abuse, troubled teens. Bernadette recounts being racially profiled the other day in Bismarck. She took the afternoon off for a dentist appointment and decided since she was a little early that she wanted to buy some dress pants. Bernadette said she felt so enraged, she wanted to explode. Instead she walked over quietly asked to see the manager. When the manager appeared she told her and the clerk that she was a Standing Rock member, the principal of its school, and an American citizen who felt profiled. The store clerks listened, and apologized. I told her she handled herself really well and should be proud. Bernadette revisits the first demonstration. She worried that her father, who is a ND police officer would not approve of her taking that risk. When she arrived, her father and her mother were already on the bridge. A group of about thirty of us meet at the local school to begin the prep for dinner tomorrow. It reminds me of my time as a teenager working in the kitchen on a kibbutz called Haogen. Peeling potatoes, dicing onions, carrots, butternut squash in pleasant, easy conversation with others. The amount of food donated is staggering. Hundreds of turkeys from Niman Ranch in California, roasting in many ovens, huge bins of vibrant fresh vegetables; a well coordinated effort orchestrated by Jeremy Stanton from Massachusetts and his crew, who drove 1700 miles to get here. A kind, robust woman from Philly, Rhonda Fabian who has experience in food prep, lovingly directs each of us in our duties. She shines in this job, not wanting credit, being completely present in service. In the hotel elevator, I meet three Native American women, Rebecca Kanady, her friend Rebecca Anderson, and her daughter Kelsey Anderson (from Missouri). Rebecca Kanady and I hit it off immediately. She is a mental health worker from Austin, Texas. They tag along with me to the school food prep because they want to help, and afterwards Rebecca K and I drive together in my car to Oceti Sakowin Camp. We discuss many things. A few years ago she reconnected with her first, true love and they planned to marry. But he had a heart attack, and now she wears his ashes in a silver locket around her neck. He has appeared to her many times and she feels she will reconnect with him in the spirit world someday. I ask her about the problems facing the Native American community, and the prejudices of many locals and law enforcement towards them. She explains that trauma is in their DNA, hundreds of years of mistreatment, their sacred land stolen from them, the 1812 Treaty of Laramie being revoked and the massacres at Wounded Knee. And now their life blood, their water and land of their ancestors is at risk, they are depressed and angry. But they are rising again. From a distance we can see the camps, it is quite an extraordinary sight. Every tribe nation has come in solidarity, as well as non-Natives from the US and around the world. And they keep coming. Standing Rock is a war zone right now; tensions are high and people are nervous about infiltrators. Each tribe nation has brought their flag and we pass through them into the camp. The air smells intoxicating, a combination of cedar, tobacco, and sage being offered to the Sacred Fires around the camp all day and night. There is no alcohol or drugs or weapons allowed. The mood is somber, but peaceful and loving. All visitors in support of the Water Protectors are welcome and asked to be respectful of Native customs. The elders are gathered around the sacred fire, and everyone else, natives and non-natives are working together to build this camp up for the winter. Yurts are designated centers: Medical, Mental Health, Legal, Herbal Healing, There is a huge geodesic dome for meetings. Everyone is busy and no one is wanting. It is taking place in a small domed hut, there is a small fire in front with glowing ancestral stones and we decide to partake. I have no idea what to expect or how long the ceremony will last. We partially disrobe, are smudged and directed to walk around the fire into the small hut. Inside there are about fifteen of us, native and non-native. Cedar water is poured over the first five stones, the dome flap closed, and in the darkness the ceremony begins.. A drum is passed around and we are each asked to speak. It is the most extraordinary experience I have ever had, so richly genuine and profound. There is a lot of gratitude. We hear war cries as we leave the camp. Shadows inside the teepees. This is the end of the line. A turning point. This morning, at the hotel, I run into filmmaker Josh Fox (director of Gasland). He is working on a documentary about Standing Rock, and will include the dinner in his film. After my run, while eating breakfast on my own, Jane Fonda appears. As she passes by me, I say hi. Jane, in full makeup and Indian style skirt, walks away with her tray to her posse of young hip guys at another table. I have always felt that a true measure of a person is how they treat others that are of no use to them. Jane Fonda and a few others are now front and center in the PR for this dinner. One of my lessons on this trip is about humility, generosity and service. I am learning this from the Natives; it is they who have set the tone at Standing Rock and have much to teach all of us. For Native Americans, Thanksgiving as a holiday is fraught with trauma. The Lakotas are grateful for our presence here today, but wary. I look around the room, there is enough food and supplies to feed an army. It is now 2:45, the doors are opening at 3pm. We walk back into the school auditorium. On the stage my new friends, the school principal (Bernadette), the teacher (Annette) and a few other Native American women directly responsible for allowing this Feast to move from Camp to the school, given the increase in numbers, want to say something. I notice extreme distress on their faces. Bernadette speaks first. She welcomes all of the organizers and volunteers, thanks us for organizing this feast and for coming, but she also admits that she is feeling devastated about an action at the camp that is unfolding, and that their hearts are heavy and wanting to be there. Despite our best intentions, we cannot completely fathom their pain; they are walking a fine line of trust and despair, like grown children of trauma, wanting to forgive, but never forgetting. They have constructed a bridge out of wood, which they plan to take across the river. At the top of the cliff, there are 80 snipers. Suddenly, the elders appear on horseback, and convince the Water Protectors to retreat back to the camp. The Standing Rock elders are the guiding spirits of this movement, they are revered. A crisis is averted for the day. The doors open at 3pm, there is a massive tidal wave of people. Earlier Rhonda, my heroine of the kitchen, who is a Buddhist, had all 40 volunteers stand in a prayer circle as she did a guided meditation. With those gentle words, she calmed and focused us, tasks were given, and for the next 4 hours, the feeding of many Standing Rock people went as smoothly as silk. They did come. The extra silverware and goods from the storage closet was brought out. Hot showers were offered. No oil. And there we all were, in harmony. Here- as earlier at the camp, I am reminded me of a Fellini movie, where noisy pushy Italians are assembling, and it starts to rain. Suddenly there is a hush, everyone is silent, and surprisingly for a moment in time, there is grace. The following morning, I wake up at 5:30am and return to camp for the water ceremony with Lou Ann and Judy. Under a cobalt cloak of darkness, and a clear eyed moon, we walk through the flags of Nations to the sacred fire. Hundreds of people, bundled in the frigid air are welcoming the sunrise. The Chief sits motionless in the center, with a large feathered headpiece. littering, putting your diapers in the toilet, tossing cigarette butts. Think about what you are doing. Keep your negative energy in check. She apologizes for scolding, but it is important for her to say. Besides the enormous eagle feather in her hand, my eyes are transfixed on a vivid pink circle with crystals. There are small white stones around them. After the sun rises we are asked to join hands and form four circles: women in front, then men, then women again, then men. The women are asked to move to the right (honoring the male in us), the men to the left (honoring their female side). She explains that in different lives we have been both male and female and need to honor that, as well as those dual natures within us. Even with dance training, it takes me a few minutes to learn this step, I have never moved like that before. Us circle dancers are slightly out of step at first, but in a few minutes, everyone is in sync. She invites two women and a male who have brought water from sacred streams around the country to place them in the center. Each container is smudged with burning sage before they are gently placed down. This pink center is charged, a healing holy place, the water is getting further energized. We are quiet, bundled, tearful, praying, freezing. I look around at the mix of people who have felt the same call to be there at this place together, right now. I imagine us as the last survivors on earth. There is a Lokata prophecy which appeared in a vision hundreds of years ago that a Black Snake would come from the North to the South in a final attempt to destroy them. The Black Snake is the pipeline. For the Lakota, there is no distinction between their bodies and nature. There is no separation. Everything is one. We walk together to the water. The River is beginning to freeze, there are icicle patterns forming at the edge. Three women take turns leading the ceremony. Stepping mindfully on an icy wooden plank, they are held by each other mentally and physically. In song, the first jug of sacred water is slowly poured into the river. Upon contact, it makes a circle and then vanishes underneath the ice. And suddenly, I see the first empty pitcher freeze. Jewel like crystals, like beaded necklaces light up the dawn, as if by magic. Winter is coming. Give Marianne Bernstein a round of applause. From a quick cheer to a standing ovation, clap to show how much you enjoyed this story. 7 1 BlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Marianne Bernstein 7 Never miss a story from Marianne Bernstein, when you sign up for Medium. day.
