(Also note, I clicked the link to donate to the Sacred Stone Camp supply fund, they are no longer accepting donations to their gofundme campaign). You can go to the Sacred Stone Camp website for more information on the Standing Rock Sioux actions and make a donation to their legal fund. This week has been incredible. I'm so proud to be part of this big, beautiful movement with you -- here's just the latest reason why: On Tuesday, more than 200 actions were organized in just a few short days to show our collective solidarity with the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline. This week's largest rally, in Washington, DC, had over 3,000 people calling on President Obama to stop the pipeline (along with featured speakers like Senator Bernie Sanders, Tara Houska, Van Jones, Chase Iron Eyes, Rev Yearwood, and Jasilyn Charger). Last week, President Obama blocked the final federal permit needed to build the pipeline. Now, the Administration has opened the door to using a more thorough review process, one that takes climate and tribal consultation into account, like Keystone XL. You can still stand with the Standing Rock Sioux, who are leading this fight on the ground, by calling on President Obama to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline for good. Add your voice here. This isn't the first pipeline we've fought together -- and it won't be the last -- but something special about the Dakota Access uprising has captured the country's imagination. The dedication, moral clarity, and brilliant organizing on the part of Native tribes and Indigenous-led organizations is that something special. The actions this week have been a powerful show of solidarity, but this fight is definitely not over. Let's keep showing up and standing with the Standing Rock Sioux and everyone fighting this thing on the ground. Right now, the best way to do that is to add your voice: Sign the petition to President Obama here. There's plenty more to do: Join one of the upcoming actions targeting financial institutions that are funding the pipeline here, contribute to efforts on the ground via the Sacred Stone Camp supply fund, the Sacred Stone Camp legal defense fund, or the Red Warrior Camp legal defense fund, or contribute to farmer and landowner organizing efforts in Iowa here. Dakota Access hasn't seen the last of us. Together, we can stop this pipeline -- and every pipeline after it. 350.org is building a global climate movement. Become a sustaining donor to keep this movement strong and growing. These companies are hoping to finalzye this deal by the end of September. We are calling on these companies to pull out of the project or to cancel it outright. So we are calling on these lenders to cut off this line of credit to the pipeline companies and to stop funding the DAPL. Three of the main lenders are Citigroup, TD Securities and Mizuho Bank. Michels Corporation The contractor actually building the pipeline is Michels Corporation, an international company that has worked on several other controversial projects including the Southern Leg of the Keystone XL pipeline. We are calling on Michels to halt construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline until a Environmental Impact Statement on the project is completed and a full consultation with the impacted tribes takes place. Fredrikson & Byron, 10-Code LLC, G4S and Frost Kennels We have added the law firm that represents the Dakota Access Pipeline and the security firms that have been hired by the pipeline companies to attack peaceful protestors. We need these institutions to dissociate themselves from the Dakota Access Pipeline and to be held accountable for their dangerous actions.
