Despite state and federal evacuation orders, a government roadblock, escalating police violence and aggressive prosecutions that attorneys say lack basic evidence, thousands of veterans are preparing to travel to Cannon Ball this weekend to support the growing movement to stop the Dakota Access pipeline. Police claimed that Red Fawn Fallis, a 37-year-old Native American woman, fired shots at officers during a protest in October, but her friends and family argued that police lacked evidence and were targeting a peaceful activist. Law enforcement officials have not commented on the dismissal, except to note that Fallis has been transferred to federal court where she is now facing only a firearm possession charge. Separately, prosecutors levied blanket felony conspiracy by fire charges against 139 protesters swept up in a mass arrest on 27 October.

In her decision, Feland emphasized that prosecutors lacked any evidence tying the individual defendants to the crimes. In October, another judge also rejected riot charges against journalist Amy Goodman, who had filmed a confrontation between protesters and pipeline security officers. State and local officials sewed confusion throughout the day on Tuesday with conflicting statements about the possibility of road blockades.
