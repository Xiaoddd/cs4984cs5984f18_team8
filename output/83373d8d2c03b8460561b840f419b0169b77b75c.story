Only one of the nine defense attorneys involved in the case had received about three hours of aerial video and 500-plus photos of the protest site from law enforcement, said Sandra Freeman, who was present during the closed proceeding. Freeman is the criminal case coordinator for the Water Protector Legal Collective, a group that assists Dakota Access Pipeline protesters with their cases. South Central District Judge Cynthia Feland reset the trial for Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, according to the Morton County court clerk's office. Freeman said she did not believe there was bad intent behind the prosecution's failure to turn over the evidence. A total of 65 people were called for jury duty, according to the clerk's office. She wrote in her order that the defendants did not have adequate time before trial to respond to the motion, which was filed Dec. 12. Erickson could raise objections if such issues arose at trial, she wrote. The defendants are from nine states, including North Dakota, South Dakota, Oregon and Hawaii. They range in age from 23 to 57 years old. The defendants include Sara Jumping Eagle, a doctor and wife of former congressional candidate Chase Iron Eyes. Two of the 10 defendants have additional open cases relating to pipeline arrests. There are two more pipeline protester trials scheduled for this week on Tuesday and Friday. A total of 571 people have been arrested in connection with the pipeline protests, according to the Morton County Sheriff's Department.
