Published on Jan 4, 2017 Part 1: If given the green light by the Trump Administration, the Dakota Access Pipeline will pump crude oil diagonally through the state of Iowa, unless the people of Iowa find a way to stop them. The land was returned to them after the pipeline was put in the ground, but many farmers found that the land soil was damaged and that pieces of metal had been left behind. This is part 1 of a series that will be presented in the order in which it was shot, starting with this, the drive from Des Moines out to Iowa farm country, with a snow storm on the way.
