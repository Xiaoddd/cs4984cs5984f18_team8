CANNON BALL, North Dakota -- Hundreds of water protectors were injured at the Standing Rock encampments when law enforcement blasted them with water cannons in freezing temperatures Sunday evening. The attacks came as water protectors used a semi-truck to remove burnt military vehicles that police had chained to concrete barriers weeks ago, blocking traffic on Highway 1806. Some flares shot by law enforcement started grass fires which were ignored by the water cannons and had to be extinguished by water protectors. Law enforcement also shot down three media drones and targeted journalists with less lethal rounds. National Lawyers Guild legal observers on the frontlines have confirmed that multiple people were unconscious and bleeding after being shot in the head with rubber bullets. One elder went into cardiac arrest at the frontlines but medics administered CPR and were able to resuscitate him. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe also sent Emergency Medical Service vehicles to the Oceti Sakowin Camp to assist. Hundreds are receiving treatment for contamination by CS gas, hypothermia, and blunt traumas as a result of rubber bullets and other less lethal ammunition. Despite the obvious public safety risk, and despite promises from Morton County that they would clear the road, law enforcement has insisted on keeping the vehicles on the bridge for weeks. This obstruction of Highway 1806 threatens the lives of the water protectors and residents of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, as emergency services have been needed but unable to reach camp quickly. The blockage also unjustly restricts the free movement of local residents and hurts the Tribe economically by cutting off travel to and from the Prairie Knights Casino. Images of the burned vehicles have fed negative, distorted, and sensationalist media portrayals of the encampment. Stop the Dakota Access pipeline. We are asking for clean water, we are asking for the right to live, we are asking for our children to live. Instead they attack us, because they protect oil. Tribal EMS are stepping up and providing services that should be the responsibility of Morton County, this is ridiculous. Because of the police enforced road block, ambulances now have an extra 30 minutes to get to the hospital. If law enforcement had done this to animals, they would have been charged with animal cruelty and put in jail. Anger, Hatred. Greed. I know violence is what the corporate and state fascists want. Even still, use of water in that weather is clearly attempted murder. Use of lethal force in return by the protectors would have been justified. Police have no special rights. The only real crime involves a victim, or property damage, all else is fraud to call a crime, such as a parking ticket. The courts are criminals commuting fraud and they know it. The Missouri is a huge river that provides water and irrigation of agricultural and ranch land for many thousands of people and even more heads of livestock. Pollution of the environment and a valuable water source will affect people regardless of their race. No mention of the pipeline was heard until the water protectors blocked it, and very little since, because the government and corporations want to keep it quiet as they continue this outrage against humanity. Human biengs that dwell on this earth. We were here first willing to share this earth. But we were slaughtered and bribed. Now this is where we stand. The government has been trying to rid of us since day one. This is our land. We will do what is right for it. Let love conquer. Open your heart to all that have the heart to heal. Let them know and see the error of there hearts. Bring awareness like the water in sky. This is so frightening. Private business has run this country for far too long. History repeating itself, and no lessons learned from the past. We have fallen away from our true essence. Let us gather unto Christ. To shot down an aircraft is a federal offense. Its also assault on a peace officer if they hit any of our officers with that. Fight fire with fire. To hell with the collateral aspect measured in Human lives, as blood spilled on sacred grounds. There has to be a higher road for history teaches us each time we take the lower road it ends in disaster. Problem solving that resorts to violence is born in the branches of hatred, growing from the tree of fear, rooted in ignorance. There are groups and individuals fighting them but, just like here, they are getting little if any press. These pipelines are pushed through in secret so as to avoid the publicity that would stand in the way of their greedy activities. Our precious country is being sacrificed to the Gods of Oil and Money, and the Hell with the people, the planet or life itself. I should be standing with you physically as well and am ashamed and sorry that I am on the other side of the country. But I am sharing your story, trying my best to show the world your brave fight, and working every day to gather more support for you. He is doing the very same thing in Syria and Libya and Iraq. He supports and funds the terrorist to harm the land and kill anyone that gets in the way. He wants that pipeline thru both Syria and Dapl. A joke, a slap to the face to wake the fuck up America but you ate the she disgusting misguided racist pieces of filth that elected Donald MotherFuckinPieceOfCapitalistCombedOverShit as your President. Then Again Obama just sits by and watches this go on while enjoy Sunday Football. I left last night after my car threw a piston rod after somehow it was drained of all oil. I have personally seen grinds hurt from tear gas pepper spray rubber bullets and now the set fires to the campground on one end while blasting these water cannons in subfreezing temp from the other direction. I have had no contact today with my friends whose camp would of been right where those fires were started. I have no idea if anything I help build us still standing. I pray my friends are okay but I sense that some are not at all. These cowards waited til after dark on s Sunday night to declare war. They fired at medics and the medic tents. Yet Obama the Governor of ND allows and encourages it to go on. They want their kickbacks from the oil giants who fund them. So this is the beginning of the end. This is war. If you sit idly by and wait for you corrupt politicians to do this it will never end. I hate it all so much. I am sick I was in Bismark last night when this was going on. The peaceful protests make the camp sitting ducks all lived up to be shot gassed beaten abused and arrested. This is sick. These cops are sick test water cannon guy I would if driven my car at him and plowed him straight to hell with my car had it been running and I was there. My ticket to go home was purchased by my friend Saturday morning. I am 100 percent sure she saved my life. Stop this madness this assault on all that is right any way you can. I call in rogue warriors to join me and help me send these Nazi cocksuckers to their grave .Ill give all I have every ounce of energy down to my final breath. THIS HAS TO STOP NOW. I laugh at you Obama, you neutered impotent lap dog to the oil companies. You sick you powerless fool. FO something you spineless gutless coward. Do Something you chicken shit loser. Happy Thanksgiving. Yeah Right. This country makes me sick. I pray for you Americans because you are so evil. This country is about to explode from within. Last warning. Kevin Morgan Pittsburgh Water Protector til the End.. Which looks like it more every day. I will be back STANDing with STANDing Rock. ...we r being treated badly..its tyme that we as Native American have our traditional believes when ppl r treating us bad...enemies...than we...kno how to take care of the enemies...thru our traditions. I tried commenters number and it was a fast busy signal. The White House switchboard (202-456-1414) is manned by professional White House operators. I catch everything about your struggle on social media that I can and contribute in any ways that I can. You are protecting our mother the Earth and water that is the source of all life. Many of us are profoundly grateful to you and care so deeply. I am content that those that are trying to destroy my relatives at Standing Rock will get what they deserve in the end. Evil begets evil. I know Violence is what they want. Theuse of water in that frezzing weather is clearly attempted murder. Use of lethal force in return by the water protectors would have been justified. Police have no special rights. The only real crime involves a victim, or property damage, all else is fraud to call a crime, such as a parking ticket. The courts are criminals commuting fraud and they know it. The police are the criminals now, as they create victims of violence and property damage. They are destroying property and hurting people. For the record I was worried about either person becoming president. But I pray for our country and our new leaders to make the right decisions. God be with everyone involved with the fight up there. But unfortunately sometimes as with our troops they are forced to follow orders no matter if they agree or not. I say to you now human rights violations are occurring. I say to you now unequivocally it is. People are being shot in the face and groin with rubber bullets. Even though the bloody photo is in your face. Yes. Peaceable protesters are being blasted in the face with water cannons in 20 degree weather. Yes. Yes it is. Yes. just ask Sophie Whitaker who was hit with a grenade in the arm and might likely lose it. this non-lethal grenade was taped so that it would have greater impact upon the body so that it would do devastating damage. I say to you to wash that apathy from your face just as the water protectors wash the mace and blood from their face. Take action as you sit on your warm couch and write an email to your congressman and demand that they get involved. add Sacred Stone Camp to your Christmas list and send winter supplies to those that are suffering on the ground. Human biengs that dwell on this earth. We were here first willing to share this earth. But we were slaughtered and bribed. Now this is where we stand. Still fighting for what we believe in...our land and it's elements. The government has been trying to rid of us since day one. This is our land. We will do what is right for it.

ReplyDelete Celia November 22, 2016 at 12:11 AM One commenter mentioned calling the white house and demand justice for the water protectors and to stop the pipeline. I tried commenters number and it was a fast busy signal. Mar 17, 2010 - The public comment line (202-456-1111) is manned by volunteers recruited by the current administration. The White House switchboard (202-456-1414) is manned by professional White House operators. I catch everything about your struggle on social media that I can and contribute in any ways that I can.

Dear bothers and sisters you are fighting for life against the sick minded killers. Many of us are profoundly grateful to you and care so deeply. ALL THAT WERE INVOLVED IN SPRAYING THE WATER AND CAUSING THE FIRES AND CAUSING HARM AND INJURY TO THE WATER PROTECTORS ARE GUILTY, UNDER ARREST, BEING CHARGED AND CONVICTED OF ILLEGALLY BRINGING DANGER TO PERSONS AND PROPERTY OF A PEACEFUL PROTECTOR. GO BACK TO YOUR PEACEFUL PROTECTORS OF WATER AND CONTINUE WITH YOUR EFFORTS. ReplyDelete Fred Walters November 22, 2016 at 2:34 PM I DO NOT commend the non violent approach. I know Violence is what they want. Theuse of water in that frezzing weather is clearly attempted murder. Use of lethal force in return by the water protectors would have been justified. Police have no special rights. The only real crime involves a victim, or property damage, all else is fraud to call a crime, such as a parking ticket. The courts are criminals commuting fraud and they know it. The police are the criminals now, as they create victims of violence and property damage. They are destroying property and hurting people. Apparently it's okay to protest for that but not for the protection of a basic need. For the record I was worried about either person becoming president. But I pray for our country and our new leaders to make the right decisions. God be with everyone involved with the fight up there. I don't really believe these officers wanted to do what hey did. But unfortunately sometimes as with our troops they are forced to follow orders no matter if they agree or not. God Bless you all.
