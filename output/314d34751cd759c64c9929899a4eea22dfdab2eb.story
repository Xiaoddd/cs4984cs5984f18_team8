Current Native Americans have a different perspective on the holiday. One of betrayal. Of land grabs and injustices that were inflicted upon them by European settlers. And this year, that perspective is particularly important. Because at Standing Rock, indigenous Americans are once more standing up to an invasive, outside force. To my people who are out there speaking and standing up to protect the water, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Because countries that ignore their pasts are unlikely to learn from them. This is true of countries like the US, Britain, and Japan. And perhaps because of this, the country has recently shown a much kinder approach to refugees than many of its neighbours. In fact, activists have been lending support to Native Americans there for weeks and months. Increasingly, that means the battle for Standing Rock is no longer just a stand-off between Native Americans and the US government. The American public and America Incorporated are also in direct conflict. Native Americans are still the ones with the most to lose in this fight. And the ones who have fought the hardest and longest. But many US progressives are now showing that, for them, an assault on one group in society is an assault on all groups. In other words, in the fight against corporate tyranny, we can either stand together or fall apart. Thanksgiving celebrates when Native Americans came to the aid of European migrants.
