LinkedIn Sign in Join now Main content starts below. LinkedIn is now banned in Russia. At least, that is the simple headline. The deeper headline focuses on concerns over data storage. As I understand the new law and its enforcement, the issue involves where to store the personal information of people who reside in what are now seen as Russian territories. Pause. Reflect. Think. Activate. Dunno. Personally, I don't even know what questions to ask of my personal data's storage or its usage by, say, LinkedIn or Facebook or Google. I also don't know what to know, ask, or feel about the third-party companies that 'mine' data for gold, as in dollars, as in knowledge, as in leverage. It shows no human diversity other than a view from above of some random folk strolling the streets like ants. The issue isn't just about data. It is about personal information in the Trump age. Third-party aggregators exist across all domains of your life and mine. Dunno. I don't what what it means for me, you, us. I don't know what to make of this time when folk can 'use' such services and be used by them in kind. 2015 was also the year when traditional banking institutions started to more actively challenge the rise of internet companies dedicated to helping people more easy monitor their personal finances. I don't know what the tech gods of Silicon Valley and the US Armed Forces know about our lives. I don't know what they really want for the future of our mother planet, what I love to call the Earth Mother Spaceship. I do know that they can't make me and many peeps in my beloved communities behave for their profit, not ours. We can do the math. We see the score. Life on this planet is on the line. We know the laws aren't in our favor, and the clock is ticking when it comes to global climate change. Reflect. Raise your middle finger high if you think that today's economic structures are hella wacky and rigged. They also make themselves irresistible :) FollowFollowingUnfollowDarshan Elena Campos, PhD Sign in to follow this author Darshan Elena Campos, PhD I help people design, launch, and assess businesses that heal Mother Nature and her diverse communities.
