On Friday night, Wells Fargo was hit with one of the harshest punishments ever handed down by the Federal Reserve.

The bank agreed to replace four members of its board of directors. The past 17 months have brought one bad headline after another. The bank's culture of misconduct extended well beyond the original revelations. Wells Fargo was dragged before Congress, put under the microscope by government officials, and embarrassed before its customers. A new CEO and management team were brought in, and the old regime lost millions of dollars in docked pay. 2016 September 8: Fake account scandal breaks wide open.
