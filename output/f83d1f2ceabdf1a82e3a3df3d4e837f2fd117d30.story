Violence is escalating against the Water Protectors of the Standing Rock Sioux. On Sunday night, November 20th, temperatures were below freezing when peaceful protesters were fired on with water cannons, tear gas, and rubber bullets. We need to act now to help support their peaceful, unarmed efforts to protect their sacred sites and native homelands from the encroaching Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). In an email to Edenkeeper from Susan Stephenson, Executive Director of Interfaith Power & Light (IPL), Susan shared the beautiful experience of Minnesota IPL members participating in a prayer event with the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota. Undoubtedly, one of the best ways to help is prayer. Lifting up our Native American sisters and brothers on the frontline of this crisis offers a tangible solace to our souls. Both those being prayed for and those offering the prayers are joined in a cosmic bond of compassion, invigorated by an unseen force unlimited in its ability to strengthen our resolve, patience, and energy. LaDonna Brave Bull Allard is a member of the Standing Rock Sioux of Fort Yates, North Dakota. She is a landowner impacted by the DAPL route and is one of the founders of the Sacred Stone Camp. If we are to live as a people, we must have water, without water we die. So everything we do as we stand here, we must make sure that we do it in prayer, and that we do it in civil-disobedience. We stand. But this past Sunday evening, November 20, water protectors faced an even worse onslaught of abuse as police authorities attacked again. As temperatures fell below freezing, police forces outfitted in riot gear formed a line to prevent protesters from moving. Then, careless of inflicting hypothermia on their trapped victims, police sprayed the activists with a water cannon mounted on top of an armored vehicle. Throughout the terrible attack, which lasted long into the night, mace, tear gas, rubber bullets, and concussion grenades were also used against the unarmed Water Protectors. Tara Houska, an organizer with Honor the Earth, said over 200 people had been sprayed with mace and tear gas, pelted with rubber bullets, or soaked with water. Sign the petition today asking President Obama to direct the Army Corps to deny the permit. We urge you to direct the Army Corps to deny the permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline which violates the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty, would endanger the drinking water of 10 million people, and is a risk to our climate. This pipeline will not only jeopardize the local environment in North Dakota, but by sending dangerous tar sands oil 1200 miles across the heartland of our nation, it threats many millions more. We know by now that leaks and spills are almost inevitable, and we do not believe this is a risk worth taking with our Earth and our communities. Constructing one thousand miles of pipeline through 58 counties and four states represents a long-term investment in fossil fuels. Scientists tell us we have only a few short years to transition to renewable energy and stop burning fossil fuels if we are to have any hope of keeping global warming under 2 degrees Celsius, as we committed to do in the Paris climate accord. Approving a new pipeline now, to carry the most dangerous and dirtiest form of oil, is counter to that commitment and will undermine our progress in shifting to clean energy. Therefore we implore you to revoke the permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline project entirely.
