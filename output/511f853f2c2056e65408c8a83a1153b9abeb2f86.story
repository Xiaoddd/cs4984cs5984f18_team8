Tribal opponents said Tuesday they will battle a revival of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) project in court. Many Washington tribes have supported the opposition to DAPL with money, donations and repeated travels to the site. She said pipeline opponents now back home from the North Dakota protest camps are either going to return or turn up the volume at home, but the fight is just beginning. About the DAPL protest The Trump administration has advanced the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipeline projects. And here's what we're reading related to the controversy. March 28: What the completed Dakota Access pipeline means for key players. Feb. 22: Preparing to leave, Standing Rock protesters ceremonially burn camp. Feb. 1: Hundreds rally as the Seattle City Council considers divesting from Wells Fargo because of its role as a Dakota Access Pipeline lender. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says it will push back. Roy Murphy, of the Muckleshoot Tribe, said he is beginning a protest walk across the country to Standing Rock and then to Washington, D.C. An opponent of the pipeline who stayed in a North Dakota protest camp for months, Murphy said his commitment remains strong. Millie Kennedy, a lawyer from Des Moines and a Tsimshian Alaska Native, said the struggle ahead is all too familiar to native people. Chanting and waving signs, the Seattle group Tuesday briefly marched downtown, including across Pine Street to Wells Fargo Bank, which is one of numerous banks lending money to the Dakota project. Tess Meyer, a stay-at-home mom from Renton, joined with her family. The pipeline is intended to carry up to half a billion barrels a day of crude from the Bakken in western North Dakota, to connect with other pipelines at Patoka, Ill. The company has said the pipeline will be a cheaper and safer way to bring oil to market than either trucks or trains. Staff writer Lynda Mapes and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
