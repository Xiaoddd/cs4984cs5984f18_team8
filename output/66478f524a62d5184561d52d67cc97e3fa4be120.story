With an evacuation deadline looming, the protest camp at Standing Rock went up in flames. For nearly a year, it had been the setting for a bitter showdown between opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) project and the project's developers. Crowds that once numbered 10,000 dwindled to dozens Wednesday after an evacuation order from North Dakota's governor. Stragglers faced arrest. Some set fire to the tents and teepees that housed them there in an act of defiance, native ritual or both. He'd gone to Standing Rock last year and been there during a violent clash between protesters and security personnel that helped thrust the protest into the international spotlight. He's also spent years fighting a natural gas pipeline project in his own backyard, one set to cross through 10 Pennsylvania counties and 200 miles of terrain. For Clatterbuck and activists like him, Standing Rock was a watershed moment, he explained, and its lessons and catalytic properties capable of being taken home and re-harnessed. Just last week, Clatterbuck helped oversee the beginnings of a DAPL-inspired encampment on an Amish farm in Lancaster County atop the route of the proposed pipeline he's spent years working to stop. Much of this interest owes to the pre-existing efforts of organizers like Clatterbuck and his wife Malinda, who've spent years relentlessly -- and sometimes controversially -- drumming up a local opposition. But the heightened profile and popular support for Standing Rock hasn't hurt either. 'Center of the resistance' Mark Clatterbuck made the 1,500-mile drive from Lancaster County to Standing Rock over Labor Day weekend. He was joined by his high-school-age daughter and two other members of the Lancaster Against Pipelines group that Mark and his wife co-founded almost three years earlier. In North Dakota, the foursome joined members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, representatives of more than 200 Indigenous nations from across the Americas and their supporters. Some had been encamped at the site for months by then in an attempt to block construction of the pipeline they say violates sacred sites and threatens the Standing Rock Reservation's primary water source. That Saturday, when protesters attempted to block construction equipment at the site, a phalanx of private security guards met them with dogs and mace in a confrontation rebroadcast on news sites and social media networks for weeks after. Clatterbuck says his daughter was at the scene of the melee that day. And while she wasn't injured, he was clearly shaken. ... Atlantic Sunrise natural gas pipeline will have 'less-than-significant' impact, feds say Clatterbuck would soon return to Lancaster County and his teenage daughter to school, while the other members of their party stayed behind. Clatterbuck would also resume what has been a years-long and some might argue quixotic effort to block construction of the Atlantic Sunrise Pipeline project at home. In January of 2015, Clatterbuck was among eight people arrested for blocking equipment they said was being used to improperly drill test bores on sacred grounds along the pipeline route in Conestoga Township, Lancaster County. In October of last year, a wooden structure -- picture a mix between a lookout tower and garden shed -- was erected nearby in an attempt to help opponents block future pipeline construction. Clatterbuck told NPR's State Impact website that they had been inspired to do so by the Dakota Access opposition. But even long before Dakota Access became a household name, Lancaster County was the scene of numerous public meetings in which angry crowds denounced the Atlantic Sunrise project and a regulatory system seen as toothless at best and beholden to the energy industry at worst. 'As long as it takes' There are concerns about the potential futility of such an exercise, though, especially given the outcome in North Dakota and the support for similar pipeline projects currently emanating from the Oval Office. Alex Bomstein, senior litigation attorney with the Clean Air Council in Philadelphia, said for agencies like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which oversees and already approved the Atlantic Sunrise project, he expects no radical shift under Trump. Instead, he said the agency viewed as pro-pipeline under Obama may somehow find a way to become even more so. After several decades of approving every pipeline project it reviewed, FERC issued its first rejection in March of last year. It is against this backdrop and new political climate that the smaller protest groups that coalesced around the Dakota Access cause find themselves returning to their respective corners of the country looking to seize some kind of momentum in the face of ever-mounting odds. Meanwhile, in Lancaster County, a Dakota Access-inspired encampment is already taking shape. It's located at the site of the wooden structure (now structures) erected along the Atlantic Sunrise route in Conestoga last fall. For now, occupancy is fairly informal, but Clatterbuck expects that to change once construction on the pipeline begins. Trump orders U.S. steel be used for oil and gas pipelines, while Pa. Martin said the tentative plan is to use the camp as a home base and move near construction as it crops up. And while there are differences between the Dakota Access pipeline's opposition -- one buoyed by a deep-seated tribal sovereignty movement and historic tensions between the U.S. government and native peoples -- there are also parallels, as explained here.

This is of no comfort to the project's critics, including those Native Americans among them. In the end, and if Dakota Access's success as a broader rallying cry is any indication, this tension may benefit and bolster the resistance planned in Lancaster County, some believe. 'Physically stop construction' But even Clatterbuck's supporters acknowledge that the odds of stopping the Atlantic Sunrise project are perhaps steeper than ever, although they're not resigned to that reality, even in the wake of Standing Rock's fall. This is the first step in eminent domain proceedings. Another 13 have been filed in the federal Eastern District for property easements in Lancaster County. Meanwhile, some 1,500 miles to the west on Thursday, law enforcement agents began rounding up the last of the Dakota Access protesters to begin a clean up of the Standing Rock site. The project is completed except for the contested portion under North Dakota's Lake Oahe, half a mile upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's reservation, CNN reports. President Trump signed an executive memorandum in late January meant to expedite that process. In Pennsylvania, the Atlantic Sunrise project has received FERC approval and is currently awaiting approval from the Department of Environmental Protection and Army Corps of Engineers. And after years of unsuccessfully lobbying regulators to pull the plug, and with the chances of a successful legal challenge before construction begins largely debunked, opponents like Clatterbuck say they fully expect the project to clear those final hurdles as well. They are prepared for that eventuality, he added. Meanwhile, with the experience at Standing Rock still ringing in his ears, Clatterbuck said he's also preparing for much, much more.
