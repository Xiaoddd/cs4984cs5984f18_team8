However, the governor's order did not foreclose the possibility that state and local authorities operating under his jurisdiction would do just that. It also specifically notes the evacuation order will remain in effect even if the corps rescinds their designated restricted areas. According to SayAnythingBlog's Rob Port, North Dakota Department of Emergency Services spokeswoman Cecily Fong said the state will not be enforcing the order and is intended as a warning that emergency services will not be provided to those who remain. However, Cherokee Nation scholar Adrienne Keene argued the state has already been preventing emergency services from accessing the site, and law enforcement, not winter conditions, are behind the blockade. THIS is what's currently preventing emergency services, not the snow. Human rights observers including Amnesty International have harshly criticized law enforcement use of force against the activists. This month, a group of the activists filed a North Dakota district court lawsuit alleging authorities used excessive force. All rights reserved.
