This decision will prevent Dakota Access from any drilling under the tribal waters of Mni Sose at this time. Chairman Frazier responded with profound gratitude for the water protectors and their allies who have fought for this decision. I am so proud today of our Native people and our non-Native allies. Chairman Frazier was quick to say that the work of the water protectors is not over, as the Tribe expects Dakota Access to litigate this issue. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe is prepared to respond to any litigation on this issue. The legal team of Fredrick, Peebles and Morgan issues this statement on behalf of the tribe. It appears that the Corps will be actively considering alternative routes, and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe will insist on being full and active participants in consultation on that. Although no timeframe was given as to when the full review will begin, the Tribe does not expect it to conclude until after January 1, 2017. Chairman Frazier reiterated that he understands that the water protectors have no plans to vacate the Standing Rock camp at this point. While we will savor this victory, we must continue to prepare for the long road ahead of us. The court battle will continue and the political battle will wage on. While the fight continues for now, the mood is celebratory as people come together in gratitude for this new development. Previously, he served as editor of the Native News Network.

What is going on is against the Geneva Convention. The USACE have denied the easement order until further assessment of an alternative site is found, but DAPL stated that they will continue to bulldoze the area and JUST PAY FINES. Everyone, Contact POTUS OBAMA and AJ LYNCH of the Justice Dept. Sha 2 years ago That was a battle won but the war goes on. The contractors will continue to build and happily pay the fine. This was just a strategy to deflate the Stand Against Pollution of the Sacred Waters. I was thanking everyone who has prayed with us and the President. For their help and understanding of the facts presented here. ALSO perhaps the modern day US Army is of a different mind set than the past one. My prayers will continue to be with our people and the Chairman David Leon Archambault II, who I view as a wonderful and humble speaker. Thank you Chairman, for standing with your people. Thank you so much Water Protectors, your commitment and bravery is so humbling.
