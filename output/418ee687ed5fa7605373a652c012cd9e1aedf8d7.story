-- Nebraska activists are urging state officials to summon back the law enforcement officers who were sent to North Dakota to help respond to anti-pipeline protests. Bold Nebraska organizers and activist Joseph Hams are planning to deliver 29,000 petition signatures to the governor's residence on Monday. Protesters have gathered near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, to try to block construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Nebraska State Patrol troopers were sent at North Dakota's request under a 50-state compact that allows states to support each other in an emergency. Thirteen Nebraska State Patrol employees returned to the state from North Dakota earlier this month, but more were sent at North Dakota's request. North Dakota is covering their costs. The petition is directed at Gov. Pete Ricketts.
