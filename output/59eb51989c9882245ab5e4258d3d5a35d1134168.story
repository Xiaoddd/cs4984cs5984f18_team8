As a matter of fact, they are a downright dangerous and a totally stupid and insane move by the state. The Avengers first came to light on January 16, when pictures taken at the drill pad site were posted on Facebook. Missile launch system overlooking drill pad. I guess this goes along with the state's newest law that allows someone to run down a protester, just by accident.
