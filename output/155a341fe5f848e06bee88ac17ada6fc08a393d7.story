For the fourth day, protesters marched to the site of Texas-based Kinder Morgan's pipeline terminal and blocked the entrance. Since March 17, a total of 60 people opposed to Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline expansion have been arrested for violating a court injunction mandating a five metre no-go zone around the terminal. If there is a tanker spill or spill from the pipeline itself, from Edmonton to Vancouver and down to Washington, the best Trans Mountain will be able to do, even today, is between 10 and 20 per cent recovery. On Monday, a 70-year old protester climbed and set up camp in a tree at the Kinder Morgan facility. He was arrested by Burnaby RCMP, as was Greenpeace founder Rex Weyler along with four other protesters.

Six local First Nations as well as the cities of Vancouver, Burnaby, and the Province of British Columbia have challenged the project in court, while proponents for the pipeline include the Province of Alberta and Federal government.
