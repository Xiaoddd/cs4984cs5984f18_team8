This report concludes that the pollution threat from the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipelines presents a health risk, prompting NRDC to call for further study of water threats by state agencies and the Northam administration while halting the projects. WDBJ story here. The new groundwater report illustrates why general permits issued by federal agencies, such as the Army Corps of Engineers, are insufficient. Given that the Virginia Water Board and Department of Environmental Quality are required by law to protect groundwater as well as surface waters from contamination, this new report provides multiple reasons for the Water Board to require individual permits for water crossings. Individual permits are the best way to fully know the threats to water along the proposed pipeline routes. The report shows that pipeline construction can harm groundwater in various ways, including: Construction methods. Surface spills of petrochemicals from construction or drilling can leach down into groundwater. Blasting, trenching, sinkhole filling, drilling and soil management present significant risks to underground sources of drinking water. Changing topography The pipelines pose a risk to groundwater across 100 miles of Virginia with karst topography, noted by underground caves, porous rock and aquifers that provide direct access for pollutants to quickly reach water tables, wells and springs. The pipelines are also a danger to non-karst areas of more solid underground rock. To help ensure protection of groundwater, the report calls for much more testing of private water wells along the routes. Design. The threats worry landowners in their path. Without clean drinking water, my property and others could become worthless. You'll receive your first NRDC action alert and update email soon.
