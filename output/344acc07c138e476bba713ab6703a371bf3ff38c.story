TransCanada shut down a portion of its highly contested Keystone Pipeline, which transports oil from the Canadian tar sands to refineries in the U.S., at 6 a.m. on Thursday after 210,000 gallons, or around 5,000 barrels, of oil spilled across South Dakota farmland. The type of oil in the pipeline, however, makes pinpointing the size of the spill more difficult than usual, worrying local environmental groups and landowners about its environmental effects. The spill also comes just days before a crucial moment for the pipeline: Nebraskans will vote on Monday whether to approve the final step in the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would move 830,000 extra barrels of Canadian oil through the Midwest to refineries in Texas and Illinois. Worries of water contamination A viscous type of oil called diluted bitumen, or tar sands oil, flows through the Keystone Pipeline. Bitumen is also one of the dirtiest fuels in the world. The company did not respond to a request for further comment. Read more An oil spill in South Dakota that leaked thousands of gallons of highly polluting oil could damage the environment more than the company has let on. TransCanada shut down a portion of its highly contested Keystone Pipeline, which transports oil from the Canadian tar sands to refineries in the U.S., at 6 a.m. on Thursday after 210,000 gallons, or around 5,000 barrels, of oil spilled across South Dakota farmland.

Bitumen is also one of the dirtiest fuels in the world. The company did not respond to a request for further comment. After the last major Keystone oil spill in South Dakota, in April 2016, TransCanada revised its initial estimate of the spill from 187 gallons to 16,800 gallons after the company started digging up the field where the spill occurred. Because diluted bitumen is so dense, it seeps into the soil and river beds rather than rising like conventional, lighter crude, potentially masking the full spill. That could make spills less costly for oil companies like TransCanada but more expensive for landowners and communities. Another concern for Moeckly is the proximity of the spill to the Crow Creek drainage ditch, a small tributary to a major water supply for South Dakota, which flows just a few dozen feet from where the spill happened. A spill from the Keystone XL pipeline over this aquifer, in a worst-case scenario, could contaminate 5 billion gallons of water. But President Donald Trump put the pipeline back on track in one of his first executive orders earlier this year.A crucial moment The spill comes at another critical moment for the future of the Keystone XL pipeline, which has triggered massive protests since its proposal. Diverse groups, such as Native American tribes, landowners, farming associations, and environmental conservation groups, have argued the pipeline unnecessarily threatens the environment. On Monday, five members of the Nebraska Public Service Commission will vote on whether to go forward with the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would add 1,179 miles to the existing Keystone system. All the extension needs to move forward is approval on a 275-mile portion of the pipeline that cuts through Nebraska.
