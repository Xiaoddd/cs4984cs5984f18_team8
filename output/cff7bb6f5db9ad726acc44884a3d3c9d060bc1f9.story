This project will be launching soon. April 25, 2017 Over the past two months, we have been working closely with Mass Design Group to define the scope of work of the Mni Wiconi Health Clinic and to imagine the buildings that will hold this important work. The clinic was gifted a 3 acre parcel of land by the Standing Rock Medic Healer Council, to build the clinic and surrounding farm and garden that will allow us to fully realize the vision of the work we are manifesting. These next few months will be a time of raising more funds for the building structures. January 30, 2017 We are excited to announce that we are pursuing a partnership with Mass Design Group to design and build the Mni Wiconi Health Clinic at Standing Rock. They have been building clinics and hospitals around the world for Partners in Health and have been using architecture to make the invisible structures of violence in our society visible so that we can move with more equity and healing. We will convene back in Standing Rock in just over one month to start assessing the site and mapping out the design plan which will involve community dialogue and training to be able to employ local labor to get it done. Please help us make the vision real. It is truly the most exciting thing that I have personally participated in during the past 20 years of my work in medicine. We recognize that we cannot practice decolonized medicine without the work of decolonizing our own mentality and our ways of relating. It is an honor to serve these NAHA students and to bring forth a model of interaction that will teach and humble me throughout my years of practice as a physician. We are committed to working to birth this project in correct relationship with all the healers at the table and the community we are serving. This medicine is so powerful, because it is awakening us to our own colonial wounds and wounding through the process of serving. Water is Life. It is an honor to accompany you. We will be starting our clinical service in the upcoming month and will have several groups of health workers from UCSF out to develop our clinical work out at Standing Rock. We truly believe that the development of decolonized medicine has the potential to radically change how we think of medical care and standards of practice, moving into a more humane, balanced and encompassing vision of health. It is inspiring what we can do together, with mass support. As we move into a period of time where divisiveness may define the ethos of our national political stage, we must remember that we can work together, forge our own partnerships and work together at the community level to ensure the safety, health and dignity of all.

Onwards in health and justice. November 22, 2016 We are grateful for your support. We have extended our goal to cover needs that are immediate in the Standing Rock Camps. This include EKG machines, exam beds, stove for herbalists, iSTAT point of care lab testing and medications which we are mobilizing this month. We will be engaging the community to imagine what the clinic should look and feel like and will rely on natural building materials with the goal of creating a completely energy-efficient structure. They will be conducting ongoing interviews around community needs and continuing to develop the curriculum on decolonized medicine and serving where needed. The perspectives of these indigenous health students are invaluable to the process of how we develop our clinical response. We are also currently working with the IHS to obtain flu vaccinations to offer to the camp community. Rupa Marya, MD Phase II . During our first assessment trip to Standing Rock, we met with the tribe's healer and professor of ethnobotany Linda Black Elk and other community members to develop ideas how to best serve the community in the long run. As we are working out the nuts and bolts of our partnership, we are seeking funds to help make the process as smooth as possible.
