Thank you. We are veterans of the United States Armed Forces, including the U.S. Army, United States Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Coast Guard and we are calling for our fellow veterans to assemble as a peaceful, unarmed militia at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation on Dec 4-7 and defend the water protectors from assault and intimidation at the hands of the militarized police force and DAPL security. 2K EVENT CAPACITY ACHIEVED: Event capacity based on accommodations, travel logistics and supplies; given the time we have to coordinate, resources available and the shipping and weather conditions in the region has been set at 2,000 rostered participants. We currently have over 2,100 Veterans on the roster. Our goal now is to prioritize this list to Veterans and Civilian personnel involved with operations, planning & onsite execution. next mission could be as early as the 2nd week of December. More to come The funds we raise on this page will go towards providing transportation and supplies for the brave patriots that come and stand with us. We have full support of the Sioux tribe elders and will be cooperating with them every step of the way. Several had to be treated for hypothermia and one protestor who was hit directly with a grenade has reportedly had her arm amputated as a result. Everyday becomes more evident that the defenders of America must stand with the Water Protectors. Let's stop this savage injustice being committed right here at home. Not if you allow this the be the United States. Please donate and pass this page along to your friends, family, coworkers and community members. It's time to display that honor, courage, and commitment we claim to represent. It's time for real Patriots. In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community. We are launching this second GoFundMe to create a Standing Rock Fund to address the ongoing needs at Standing Rock and our partners in camp. Please take moment to check out our new campaign and share with your networks. We are formulating organizational structure under a 501c4. This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement. This has been a life-changing experience for everybody involved and we plan to keep fighting for you as long as we have to. Please try again. I have 5 more seats in my Grand Caravan. Or we can take your car and I'll pay for some gas. Let me know. thank you for standing up for the people. my clan duty is to protect the tribe. i am also a 10 year 2x war veteran, U.S. Army Infantry. Honorably discharged and i would like to join this 3 day deployment to protect and defend. Still waiting to hear back on details for the trip. A world filled with broken promises, selfishness and separations. A world longing for light again. I see a time of Seven Generations when all the colors of mankind will gather under the Sacred Tree of Life and the whole Earth will become one circle again. In that day, there will be those among the Lakota who will carry knowledge and understanding of unity among all living things and the young white ones will come to those of my people and ask for this wisdom. I salute the light within your eyes where the whole Universe dwells. Thank you for offering material help and laying your bodies on the line. I am proud that you are defending our nation's water and helping stop the depredation of First Nations land. I wish I could have given more. Thank you for yet another sacrifice you are doing for the American people. Please sign the petition to President Obama. Petition The Dakota Access pipeline poses a catastrophic threat to Native American sacred lands and to the critical water source for more than 17 million Americans down stream of the Missouri River crossing. We know that President Elect Trump has a serious conflict of interest by owning large investments in DAPL and other fossil fuel assets; and his energy team includes Harold Hamm, billionaire founder of Continental Resources oil company, and someone Mr. Trump might name as his Secretary of Energy. Mr. Trump and the Koch brothers said they support extractive exploitation of public lands and National Parks. After suffering centuries of persecution and exploitation, Native Americans deserve justice. This land belonged to the Standing Rock Sioux Nation Rez before it was taken back. President Elect Trump has stated he will quickly approve the Dakota Access pipeline and also reverse President Obama's decision to deny approval of Keystone XL pipeline. We have an enormous glut of oil reserves at Cushing, Oklahoma. The clear purpose of Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines is not to make America energy independent but to reap enormous profits for greedy oil interests exporting oil to China. We must protect our environment and our oil resources. This outdated fossil fuel infrastructure is not needed and railroads serving the Bakkan North Dakota oil fields have invested heavily in improved railroad oil tank car safety and have stated that they have more than enough railroad capacity to transport the Bakkan oil. They will also be able to permanently rehire thousands of laid off North Dakota railroad workers. America must finally honor the first Americans and our first environmentalists by stopping Dakota Access. Thank you for standing on the right side of history. read Operations Order.
