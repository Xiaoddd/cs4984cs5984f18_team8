It will link with another pipeline that will transport the black gold to terminals and refineries along the Gulf of Mexico. These 1000s strong intrepid folks are supported nationally and internationally by 100,000s. Last week a long-awaited district court ruling in Des Moines gave DA, ETP, Enbridge, and Marathon and their big financial backers what they wanted. This pipeline would make that prospect increasingly difficult, because it is designed to facilitate the continuing extraction of the Bakken Shale in North Dakota. Worse than that, this pipeline represents the further colonization of indigenous lands, particularly that which lie adjacent to or solidly within the path of this project. None of this is necessary. The 100,000s of people who oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline understand this. On the contrary, the existing evidence shows the protesters to be peaceful, non violent, and very sympathetic to the needs and concerns of the pipeline workers. Sunoco Logistics Partners, which is headquartered in Newtown Square, is another key pipeline investor along with ETP, and the Dakota Access Pipeline is slated to feed into a Sunoco Logistics terminal. What an irony: Pennsylvania science teachers are out on the front lines teaching school kids about the impact of global warming at the same time their retirement dollars are hard at work building this monstrosity of a pipeline. How typical that the Keystone State is going in the other direction from the rest of the enlightened world. It is true that several Building Trades unions have supported this project, based on misleading claims told by Dakota Access and its parent company, Energy Transfer, that it would create 1000s of local jobs. In reality, however, the project will only create a couple dozen local, permanent jobs and maybe a couple of temporary contractor jobs, which Dakota Access has already said would be hired from elsewhere. Many unions courageously opposed Keystone XL, and they should do no less to the Dakota Access Pipeline. As for jobs, there are already more workers employed in the renewable energy sector than in fossil fuels in the US and Canada, and those differences are only going to become increasingly more stark as the world transitions from a fossil fuel based energy system to one based on renewables. That transition will happen whether the new green jobs are union or not. It is therefore incumbent upon unions to embrace the transition and organize these new jobs, because green capitalism is still capitalism. The union movement should therefore take a clue from forward thinking workers and union activists including the fine folks in Climate Workers, Iron and Earth, Labor Network for Sustainability, Movement Generation, National Nurses United, Trade Unions for Democracy, and the IWW Environmental Unionism Caucus (among others), and develop an organizing strategy for a Just Transition that includes and encompasses organizing the unorganized renewable energy workers. And there is an urgent need to focus efforts doing just that. And what we need is those skilled laborers to be put to work, pipelines for people. I am all for organized labor, but what I want is I want pipelines, I want infrastructure, for people, not for fossil fuels, not for oil companies. So I am all for that. There are plenty of people that could be put to work. And let us be absolutely clear: not all jobs are just jobs. One would scarcely be standing upon the moral high ground if they justified the construction of Nazi or Stalinist death camps if the jobs building them were union jobs. This is a dead end strategy and will only serve to further weaken the union movement. We must break the harmful alliance between unions and the energy bosses and build active working class solidarity with Native people and all those fighting to defend the earth from capitalist exploitation and destruction. The union movement can be sure to be on the right side by sending members to join the fight, by coming to the Standing Rock or Red Warrior Camps (or at least send money to support them). They can pass resolutions against the Dakota Access Pipeline. They can join or organize demonstrations against the DAPL (or its financial supporters) within their communities. There are many rank and file union members who already stand in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. The time is now to formally join them and say that another world is not just possible; another world is necessary.
