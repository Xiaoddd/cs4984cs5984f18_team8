If the FBI had its way, the infiltration loopholes would still be secret. The 2011 edition of the book, which covers everything from wiretapping to how to read Miranda rights, was made public in redacted form thanks to a lawsuit brought by civil liberties groups. The bureau adopted new rules and stricter oversight. What the public has not known is by exactly how much. The FBI sees it exactly the other way. The requirements for a particular operation vary depending on how intimately the FBI employee or informant will be involved with the group, and what kind of group it is. An informant doing the same thing does not require extra approval. These rules appear to offer layers of oversight. But they only kick in when certain conditions are met. There have been many recent examples of the FBI twisting or ignoring the rules in order to investigate political or religious groups. In 2010, to take just one example, a Justice Department inspector general found that the FBI had violated policy in investigating groups including the Catholic Worker, Greenpeace, and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Documents released last year showed that the bureau tracked Keystone Pipeline protesters without proper authorization. The FBI has also generated legal controversy with its use of informants in mosques. The FBI, which has no single statute governing its activities, has operated under a series of guidelines issued by attorneys general over the years. The DIOG first came out in the last months of the Bush administration in 2008, implementing guidelines from then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey. Muslim Advocates, with other groups, sued to have the whole rulebook released without redactions. But in 2011, a judge disagreed and allowed the redactions to remain. Some of the redactions are inconsistent, with identical text covered in one place and not in another. We depend on the support of readers like you to help keep our nonprofit newsroom strong and independent. This is the 2011 edition, which remains the baseline document today, although the FBI recently released some updates from 2013. Classified secret. This unreleased September 2015 document is a major expansion and update of a manual from 2007 on the same topic. Classified secret. Not previously released. Dates to April 2015. It is classified secret, and dates from 2011. The document is undated but contains references to another document from November 2015. See Document Editor-in-Chief: Betsy Reed.
