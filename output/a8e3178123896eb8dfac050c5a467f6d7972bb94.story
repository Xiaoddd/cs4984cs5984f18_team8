RAPID CITY --At 5 am on October 28, a group of Native American runners left Flagstaff, Arizona, to run 1,400 miles to the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota. Riley Ortega, a 15-year-old Hopi, created the Perseverance for Preservation Run. Young Ortega said a long run to Standing Rock seemed like the best way to raise awareness and to honor the original runners who started the No DAPL movement when they ran 2,000 miles to the White House last April. Riley also wanted to honor his late uncle, Dennis Poolhaca, who was a marathon runner. He said he would run with him. So did Joseph White Eyes, Lawrence Lind III, Lavern Jefferson and Donniell Wanatee. Six months earlier the five of them - along with other youths from Standing Rock - had run 2,000 miles to the White House. They began each day with prayer and ended each day with prayer. They still do. They ran 2,000 miles to carry a petition that they wanted to deliver in person to President Obama explaining why the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) must be stopped. Water is sacred. DAPL would contaminate the Missouri River, the longest river in North America and desecrate sacred burial grounds. But the runners did not get to deliver their petition or meet with the President after running all that way to the White House. They returned to North Dakota still determined to stop DAPL. There they helped create a campground near the pipeline that is prayer-based. As water protectors they would pray and commit acts of non-violent resistance to the pipeline. DAPL would destroy sacred burial sites and go under the Missouri River next to the Standing Rock Reservation. Authorities say it will leak or break as hundreds of pipelines already have, and that it will contaminate the Missouri River which provides water to the Standing Rock Reservation, to other tribal nations and to18 million people downstream. And look at all the movements today - the environmentalist movements, Black Lives Matter, the other movements. So in October he and the other four runners who had gone to the White House with him borrowed a bus. They drove to Arizona to meet Riley and run 1,400 miles with him to the campground at the Standing Rock Reservation. Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Archambault urges all who are able, to come there and join them in prayer and non-violent resistance to the pipeline. So far members of 300 indigenous tribes have come to support them and protect the water. Non-natives are joining them too. He wanted to lend support too. He offered to be a guide and meet the runners from Arizona with young Oglala Lakota runners from Pine Ridge, South Dakota. The two groups of runners met in Utah. They come from seven tribes: Hopi, Oglala Lakota, Cheyenne River Sioux, Standing Rock , Dine-Navajo, Apache and Meskwaki. But they are going to Standing Rock for everyone. The run was grueling. Most of the runners had not run in altitudes of 7,000 feet before. They ran relay-style night and day through rough terrain and mountains, usually without stopping. They prayed. Gray Grass advised the runners to stay in their rooms and be quiet until morning. Despite ever-growing numbers of armed police clad in riot gear in North Dakota, all of these young runners are steadfastly and committed to protect the water using prayer and non-violent resistance to DAPL. One of them is 21-year-old Trevor Standing Soldier. I'm doing it because we're helping this young boy from Arizona who started the run. I'm doing it because water is life. It's so important. This is not just a native thing. And by November 4, they had been running for days and were only one day away. Everybody was exhausted, The next day they would finally reach the Standing Rock campground. On Saturday, November 5, after running hundreds and hundreds of miles through mountains and prairies and high plains desert, the runners ran the last miles to the Standing Rock campground together. When they reached it, they walked in through the avenue of tribal nation flags. They were moved and grateful. Thank you to anyone and everyone who supported us whether spiritually, mentally or physically. Now they plan to help protect the water.
