On Friday morning, thousands of indigenous nations and environmental activists descended on Washington, D.C. for what they called the Native Nations Rise march and rally. The 1.5 mile march from the US Army Corps of Engineers headquarters to the White House was the culmination of a week-long event that included cultural workshops and panels. Fighting against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a controversial 1,172 mile-long pipeline that will eventually carry crude oil through North Dakota to Southern Illinois. Indigenous activists and their allies began fighting the pipeline in 2015, but their most serious set back took place immediately after the inauguration when President Trump signed executive orders to advance approval of the pipeline. This week, a federal judge signed an order refusing to halt the construction. Megan, who is 19-years-old and Navajo, traveled to Washington, D.C. from Arizona to help spread the word about the concerns of indigenous peoples. Rachel, 19-years-old, drove to the rally from Columbus, Ohio. It is unclear what will happen next and if the tribes have any more legal avenues to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.
