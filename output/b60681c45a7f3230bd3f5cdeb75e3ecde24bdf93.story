the corporate face of the gulf oil disaster will answer for all of it. we have team coverage of tony hayward's big day on the hill. we will also go to the gulf and show you one method to keep the oil offshore and the burn method. and if you love gulf seafood get ready to pay for it. from the bayou to the beltway. all eyes turn to the ceo of bp. tony hayward, two months ago, barely knew of him. bp's chief executive officer will be in the hot seat on capitol hill. he will arrive on the hill this hour and once again, apologize for the country's worst 9:01 am environmental disaster and in an early release of his statement to congress, he will say he hears, quote, the concerns, fears, frustrations, and anger being voiced across america. we are covering this story from many angles from new orleans to new york and atlanta and to washington. before we go to washington, that testimony beginning about an hour from now, billowing towers of smoke hang over much of the gulf of mexico. and that's a welcomed sight for gulf residents. the smoke is coming from crews that are burning the blankets of oil before they actually reach ashore. ali velshi went out on the water to see the practice of up close and joins us from new orleans. you are seeing thick black smoke burning from oil. that's a good thing because 9:02 am that's oil that's not going to make it to shore. it is being burned. it is being burned in situ, in place. it is a team headed by the coast guard and overseen by the coast guard but private contractors who are out there and hire these shrimpers, take the two boots, attach boom to it, corral the oil and until it is deep enough and sort of together enough. then they ignited it using diesel. a gallon of diesel. they set it on fire and hope it burns. you see the spectacular result of that burning. when we got there yesterday with the coast guard, three hours of -- on a boat on the way in there, we saw seven of these plumes. you can go up and follow them up into the sky and just see endless smoke and it is like tornadic smoke into the sky. the sky around us was bright. but above us was entirely dark. around it, fred, airplanes are circling and monitoring to see 9:03 am where there are better collections of oil and then guiding the fleet. about 15 vessels out there. guiding the fleet to other patches of oil where they start those fires again. we saw about seven fires yesterday burning. very hot and very big fires. they claim they can get thousands of barrels a day out this way. they are going to keep on doing it until there is no more oil to burn. give me an idea what this smoke does to the environment, whether it the water, the wildlife or perhaps even the air quality. liked over. there were fish jumping in the sea. sort of near the oil at an area it already had been burned. i don't know whether they are eating some of the material that has been burned. look, this was not allowed for a long time because there were concerns if you burn this smoke it gets into the atmosphere and it pollute it is environment. it was determined now that it would be better to burn the smoke and create that polltution than allow that oil to move its way to coast because we have seen the damage that that does 9:04 am to wildlife and pelicans. other birds and the shrimp and oyster. the fish. the determination was that it is beer to do this now and it is the better of two evils. there is an epa person on site where this burn sing taking place. the coast guard is making sure that they go around. we went with them and asked them if they are hot, if exhausted. they are taking measurements of their breathing. so far they are reporting lower than aloud incidents of the chemicals that come out burning oil. you can see from that smoke clearly something is going somewhere into the environment. let's go to washington, d.c., where we find senior congressional correspondent dana bash. we know this hearing is taking place an hour from now. tony hayward, ceo of bp is likely to make his way to capitol hill. somewhere within this hour. while we do know based on his early release of the statement, he will give to house members, he is going to apologize and 9:05 am knowledge mistakes were made. he's really got to expect that he will be the subject of a firing squad. if he was listening to anything that the senior members of the committee were saying, especially there democrats before happened, i talked to the chairman of the committee holding this hearing at the top of the hour. i asked him about the fact that tony hayward the man before him, will be sitting alone at the witness table, has sort of become not only the poster child but in many ways the villain of this whole drama and disaster. he said whether or not that's true, he said he is not sure but bart stupak did say that he's worried and warning tony hayward not to come before this committee as a typical corporate at executive saying he's sorry, saying he didn't know dash congressman stupak and other members of congress here say they are not going to stand for that and they want answers to what happened and what led to this explosion. not necessarily a congressional hearing. i don't know what happened at the white house other than congratulations to the president and bp for disagreement but members are -- going to take his hide off as they should. these are top engineers. crazy well. runaway wells. nightmare. keep moving forward. cut corners. get it done. create a bigger nightmare. he's the head of the corporation. he goes down with the ship, as they say. in this case, they pay him well for having this responsibility. now it is time for him to accept it. specifically, five areas where they said that bp cut corners in crucial, crucial moments before the explosion. and so what he -- what con man stupak told me is that he expects tony hayward to be able to answer questions about why those things happened and he said he won't believe that hayward in this situation when this rig was 43 days overdue and going to its next stop and millions and millions of dollars overbudget doesn't believe he didn't know some of these cost-cutting decisions that ultimately led to this horrible 9:08 am disaster according to congressman stupak. one quick color -- tell you about color here. you can probably see a lot of hustling and bustling while i was talking. the security here is not like it is for a normal ceo. we sometimes are kind of kept at bay when you have members of the president's cabinet or dignitaries. not when you see executives of companies. that's going on right here. there definitely is stepped-up security. so it is -- very noteworthy that this definitely feels not just from our perspective but from the people who are putting on this hearing and the people who secure the capitol, this is not. tony hayward and others enter and take their seats, they first have to listen to opening remarks coming from a number of the house members before tony hayward gets to go through the 11-page statement, perhaps even more if he's added a few more 9:09 am notes. then there's more question and answer coming from members of congress. what's going to be interesting and we saw this earlier this week when he had the five ceos at the five major oil companies before the same committee and same committee room is that tony hayward is going to be sitting at that desk alone. listening to the opening statements of all of the panel members and it will likely take an hour, hour and a half and will have to listen to this before he even gets a chance to speak or before he raises his hand and is sworn in under oath. and then the barrage of questioning will begin. he will have a good sense of where the pan sell coming from if he doesn't already before he gets top his mouth. dana bash, we will check back with you periodically throughout the morning on capitol hill there. so the hearing before that house energy commerce subcommittee is set to get under way next hour. cnn, of course, obtained the opening statement i have been referring to that hayward will be presenting to lawmakers. here is a bit more of what he is expected to say before being grilled by lawmakers. bp's chief executive says, 9:10 am quote, the explosion and fire aboard the deep water horizon is and the resulting oil spill in the gulf of mexico should never have happened. i am deeply sorry that they did. hayward goes on to say that he was, quote, personally devastated when he learned 11 men had lost their lives and in his words, quote, my sadness has only grown as the disaster continues. end quote. we will have much more of that on capitol hill and beyond. also, coming up, death by firing squad. you don't hear that too often. but that's how the man in this orange jumpsuit is set to be executed in just a few hours. we are taking a look at how it will happen after this. or any , you can feed a family of four. comfort suites. power up. limit the cell phone minutes. that's not good enough. we're not leaving this room unless we can cut something else. all this stuff. time, effort, people. trust your business processes to xerox. xerox. ready for real business. this is power with efficiency. this is an interior that exceeds even the promise of the exterior. this is the all-new jaguar xj. the stunning result of taking a very different road. 9:12 am we make meeting times, lunch times and conference times. but what we'd rather be making are tee times. tee times are the official start of what we love to do. the time for shots we'd rather forget, and the ones we'll talk about forever. in michigan long days, relaxing weather and more than 800 pristine courses make for the perfect tee time. because being able to play all day is pure michigan. your trip begins at michigan.org. fidelity investments. turn here. literally. sounds like wild west style justice. but just after midnight, a double murder in utah is scheduled to be hooded, strapped to a chair, shot through the heart by a string of unnamed marksmen. 49-year-old ronnie lee gardner is now asking for a last-minute stay from the tenth u.s. circuit court and u.s. supreme court. and if they don't intervene, the state supreme court, gardner will be the first person to die by firing squad in the u.s. in 14 years. he could be one of the last. utah officials say that ronnie gardner's life was troubled early on. by the age of 6 he was a drug addict and sent to a mental institution. at 23 he killed a bartender 9:15 am during a robbery in 1985 while heading into a courtroom in connection with that case, he murdered attorney michael burdell and shot a bailiff. nate, thanks so much for joining us. give me an idea of logistically how this will happen and really how did it come to this firing squad. shortly after midnight. he will be strapped into a chair. there will be a paper target placed over his heart. and then gardner will be allowed to say a few final words. and then a hood will be placed over his head. and five gunmen will be given the order to fire. 9:16 am ordinarily people think about the death penalty in this country, they have become conditioned with lethal injection. the electric chair. no question about that. this was the preferred method in utah for -- since pioneers entered the valley. and for one reason or another the legislature didn't do away with it until 2004. at that point they made -- lethal injection the only option. so now i understand that gardner is asking for a stay of execution. viewers heard a little bit about 9:17 am that. gardner thinks if jury members knew about his early drug use, about possible brain damage he suffered, that they would have voted for life in prison rather than death. give me an idea of how the marksmen came to be and what are the details. we don't know who those are going to be. there's about 400 officers in that office. it could possibly be any one of them. the sheriffs said in the past 9:18 am they had so many volunteers they have to have a lottery. and then -- four of them will have a live round. they all have 30 caliber rifles and don't know which of them has the blank. and then past procedures, one of the five has been designated the captain. when everything is ready, the captain will sound off in a cadence. and at the end of that cadence, they are supposed to fire in unison. all right. thanks so much. it is scheduled for midnight. you are scheduled to be a witness for the execution by firing squad. thanks so much. we will tell you what one actually did to the storm chaser who got these images. 9:19 am live pictures of capitol hill. soon ceo of bp tony hayward will be making his way to capitol hill for a house subcommittee hearing. he will be trying to apologize once again and trying to answer many questions, not just lawmakers have, but members of the general public have also. that promise to make my patients look younger. but

gulf of mexico oil disaster. the expectation is there will be fireworks on capitol hill this morning. bp chief executive officer tony hayward testifies before lawmakers who are outraged at the company's response to the oil spill. severe weather strikes the northwestern part of south dakota. take a look at the images. storm chaser andy gabrielson spotted eight tornadoes. all within on few miles of each other. he says one of those tornadoes almost lifted his car. the maker of benadryl and tylenol is adding five more types of drugs to the company's list of recalled products. the voluntary recall was made because of a chemical odor with the product's shipping palette. 9:23 am live pictures now of capitol hill of -- actually, threes not live. what you are seeing are taped pictures of bp's ceo tony hayward among others. but tony hayward today will be in the hot seat on capitol hill and will be testifying among -- to the house energy subcommittee. he will try to apologize for the bp disaster. he will be acknowledging mistakes. he says, of course, there are lots of questions like how could this have happened. he still does not have a complete answer to that. he, too will be riddled with a number of questions from many angry lawmakers. he will be on capitol hill later on this hour to testify in the next hour as well. we will have much more on that here in the newsroom. only from at&t. 9:25 am 9:26 am talk show host oprah winfrey is defending president obama's handling of the gulf coast oil disaster. she also expressed heartfelt concern for the devastation in that region. don lemon caught up with oprah in atlanta yesterday. you have been so supportive of the folks down south and what's going on with the oil. we can only hope and pray that this will soon be resolved in a way that people can pick themselves up and begin to move forward. i really don't understand what people want him to do. i think that he's the president of the united states. you are not supposed to be emotional. you are supposed to take action and get things done. and make sure those things happen. i really don't know what it is people want him to do. so i think that all of us being united in our sense of understanding, what is going on, what's happening no only to the people but animals which is what breaks my heart. we will break down the numbers and see how this all might work. now the ceo of bp is expected to be on capitol hill. he's to arrive there momentarily to testify before the house, energy and subcommittee. he will be apologizing according to material release of his statement and ex-plan even he is still looking for answers for many questions that still continue to riddle much of 9:29 am america. much more of our coverage right after this.

posed from lawmakers with the house subcommittee of energy and commerce. posing these questions to the ceo tony hayward of bp. he's expected to stick with his 11-page script. he has a statement that we have also been privy to where he will apologize profusely, acknowledge mistakes have been made involving bp and the oil spill that took place. now 59 days ago. i'm joined in washington by my colleague john king. john, while we see this 11-page testimony that tony hayward will be sticking to, this really is 9:33 am going to be an aside because the lawmakers have a host of questions. they want to know what bp knew about this. what was their contingency plan why they didn't have a better contingency plan for an accident like this to happen while drilling a 5,000 feet below. his statement of apology is no way going to soften the blow of questioning from these lawmakers. good morning to you. this will be a day of great drama in washington. the big question is will it be a day we get any new details about what happen order the deep-water horizon on april 20th. and perhaps any new details about how optimistic or pessimistic mr. hayward is when they will able to stop that leak. remember this. as he testifies today, this is america's favorite new villain. this committee is going to treat him like a pinatta. we will have at least an hour before we hear from mr. hayward. you can be sure none of them 9:34 am will be complimentary to mr. hayward and bp. the question is when we get to him and the questioning, this is a committee that has thousands of pages of documents from bp. the committee believes what happen order this rig was negligent, if not criminal. they say it was behind schedule, overbudget, pressure to get the job done and leaders on the rig, bp officials ignored warnings from the staff that they had a problem and should shut things down. mr. hayward is the ceo of a publicly traded company whose stock has fallen in value by half since the disaster. anything that he says will affect the value of the company. there are criminal investigations of the company and potential of dozens of civil lawsuits. anything he says can and will be used against him in a court of law down the road. so this is a ceo who while he has to be there, he understands his obligation to the american people to testify before the congress, he's going to be very, very careful. he's also a guy, though, this is why this could be so dramatic, who has made mistakes in his 9:35 am public statements in the past. early on he told sky news this would be a very modest environmental impact but also said bp would be a model in its response after this. he famously said at one point i want my life back. i have for you before i break some of our others into the conversation, i want on show you this. we brought this t-shirt back from may trip to the gulf coast. tony hayward has become the poster child for the outrage of bp about this. to that point i want to bring our national political correspondent jessica yellen into the conversation. for congress they see a chance to score points with the american public. it's both a fact-finding mission because they do want to get some answers. and this is the first time hayward has been in to testify. they can get some answers, though we all know he has to be cautious and guarded with reasons you point out. a lot of it is theater. mine, think back to not so long ago, the goldman sachs hearing where we saw all the members of 9:36 am congress supposed to be doing oversight during the years that the financial crisis was unraveling. and suddenly there's -- they are so indignant and outraged this was going on under their noses. i think we will see that again today where we hear this indignant rage, washington theater, and you have to ask congress had a role in this, too. oh, my gosh, we have to look at this agency. let's go to capitol hill. senior congressional correspondent dana bash had an exclusive interview with the chairman of the subcommittee and can give us a sneak peek of what we are about to hear. look, he made very clear, talking about bart stupak, who will be chairing this hearing, made very clear that apologies are not going to be enough. that what they want, particularly the democrats on 9:37 am this committee, when they want from tony hayward, detailed answers. they gave him the answers to the test. what this committee did on monday, they sent him a 14-page letter going through the narrative that this committee has built through its investigation. and into what they say five incidents that they call crucial incidents where corners were cut and costs were -- tried to save costs for time and for money and you name it. where they say that -- those were the -- crucial, crucial times that perhaps led to this explosion and would -- congressman stupak told me is he doesn't buy that tony hayward, head of the company, such a massive project was going on, 43 days behind schedule, millions of dollars overbudget, he didn't know about why these corners were cut. that's, i think, going to be one of the major thrusts of the questions. really looking back at culpability and as many of these members have said, they want to 9:38 am build a record to show that bp from their perspective really does have a lot of culpability in what happen. maybe in the country you don't think they are important to you, just those of us that cover washington. this is an american problem. indeed an international problem. nowhere more do they xwar what they might hear today and answers they are looking for today along the gulf coast. that's where cnn's chris lawrence is now and is live in new orleans. one, emotional level and the second thing on a specific level. under the emotional level, they want to hear something from the bp official that speaks to him understanding what he's caused here, what the company caused down here. fishing, food, more than just industries down here. they are really engrained in the culture and part of the way of life down here. i think on an emotional level they want to see some understanding of the damage that's been caused. more specifically, i have been talking to a lot of small businesses. especially the supporting businesses, not necessarily just the workers that work on the rig. a lot of they want to hear some specific assurances that they are going to get their money. you know, historically in spills like this, small businesses often end up in years of litigation, recovering just a fraction of their losses. and a lot of people here have been telling me that they will -- they are going to get their money, when bp says they are going to get their money, they say i will believe that when i see it. so you mentioned earlier about saying things on the record, statements that can then come back to haunt you, so to speak. i think a lot of people here want to hear statements on the record from the bp's ceo that 9:40 am locks the company in to paying some of the damages that some of the businesses have suffered here. you know, i don't want to by any means, you know, i don't want to say, you know, frustration and anger here is only directed at bp. you know, as much praise as we have lavished on admiraled that allen and some, you know, justifiably so for the job he has done, there's frustration about the coast guard. feeling the coast guard has not taken the reins of leadership, used some of its authority and power that a lot of people here felt they had and felt that the coast guard and the administration, especially early on but even, you know, up until the last couple of weeks, just 9:41 am too cozy with bp and not champion challenging them enough. we can show you live pictures of the committee hearing where tony hayward, bpceo, in 20 minutes will be sitting down. as we go to break, remember the picture in the middle. as the bp ceo testifies today, sad fact is oil, millions of gallons of oil, continue to spew into the gulf of mexico. two months from now the company says will be the earliest they will able to shut it off completely. p your skin get healthy and

the arrival p bp's ceo tony 9:45 am hayward. he is in the hot seat today. he is to testify today in part to apologize, to acknowledge mistakes were made and also make promise that bp will try to do right as we are now in day 59 of the continued oil leak in the gulf of mexico. we have team coverage on the testimony on capitol hill and the ripple effect from coast to coast. let's begin with christine. break it down for us. for the united states government saying to bp we want to make sure the money is there. we want to make sure you are 9:46 am going to pit for the victims of this spill and that there will be money available. this is unprecedented. this is simply -- have never seen a government sort of demand -- this government in particular demand money set aside from a company like this to cover an unprecedented problem. well, yes. i mean, up until the april 20th spill, this company's financial statements clearly show it was a cash machine. it has lines of credit for that. and keep in mind, it also has other things here. 9:47 am they will be paying that money for being share holders and will cutback on research and development on the capital expenditures and more money available along those lines. it identified places where there is an awful lot of money and scope there to fill this nubd r fu fund but also to pay for what's happening now, cap the well, relief wells. try to immediately burn off oil that's spilling into the gulf of mexico. so very wide range of estimates, fredricka about what that oil you are seeing on your screen right now is going to do, how much cost damage it will be. no one really knows for sure. bp says that it can and will pay. however, the oil continues to gush. this as ceo of bp, tony hayward, will be making his way to capitol hill for that testimony to begin. our live coverage continues after this. it nt neti dne. pyte veen. on fm mps. 9:49 am that's why we're investing one million dollars every hour... to improve our technology and your safety. it's an investment that's helped toyota earn multiple top safety pick awards for 2010 by the insurance institute for highway safety. 9:50 am no other brand has won more. 9:51 am welcome back to the newsroom. i'm frederica whitfield in atlanta. live pictures of all points. in the center, capitol hill in the nation's capital as they await the bp ceo tony hayward. he is to testify today and acknowledge in his words that the oil spill in the gulf is 9:52 am unacceptable and that his sadness grows, and in his words during an 11-page statement he is expected to read, that he will not rest until the well is under control. we have team coverage of the testimony that is expected to be rather fiery on capitol hill today before a house energy and commerce subcommittee. we have team coverage from atlanta to the gulf coast and to washington as well. this is likely to be a very fiery, tough testimony for mr. hayward. i hope he has got his mitchell on today. we should make clear to our viewers it will be a while before they hear in mr. hayward because the angry committee members want to make opening statements and you can be sure they will not be kind to the ceo or to his company. 9:53 am let's bring in someone who has the perspective of what it's like to lead a big oil company and to be in the situation tony hayward is in today. john hofmeister is with us today. explain first and foremost as someone who led a big company, they want answers but tony hayward has to worry about shareholders and the markets and potential criminal and civil lawsuits. try not to make your position any worse in your testimony. he will clearly be on the back foot. hofmeister, i'm sorry. i want to interrupt for a second. we are watching mr. hayward pass through the security, the visitor's entrance. mr. hayward was in the shot and then stepped out. to our viewers, as we continue the conversation with mr. hofmeister, you may see tony 9:54 am hayward coming into capitol hill. like everyone else, including reporters and visitors, he has to go through a bit of security. don't dig your hole any deeper. he'll do a lot of listening, undoubtedly and hear passionate remarks from very respectable people, who really do feel as they are expressing themselves. also, there's a bit of theater in all of this as well. if there was true culpability here, not just for bp for the blowout but for the u.s. congress and its failure to set energy policy in motion which enables us to deliver on the energy independence which we've been promised for almost 40 years, the american people ought to be having a hearing with congress about why have you failed u.s.s a a leadership group in terms of enabling an energy policy that doesn't push us into the high risk deepwater in the first place. you are looking at bp ceo tony hayward. he just enared the hearing room and he will be grilled and will offer an opening statement in which he apologizes. i want to continue to the conversation. congress has an oversiblt obligation. they should look in the mirror because they have promised for a long time going back to jimmy carter that they have not delivered to the american people on the energy always. i want to talk about the industry that you have worked in for some time because one of the seeds of this disaster is it what many describe is an incestuous relationship between the oil industry and the mms, which is supposed to regulate that agency, a revolving door of people going through, corruption and bribery and the like. there was a 2007 inspector general report that talked about some isolated instances in colorado, and that has been magnified in painting the entire industry with a broad brush stroke. i think people are using anecdotal evidence to suggest there is a permeating corruption across the industry. i didn't experience it. for the three years running that my company attempted to get permits from the mms to drill off the coast of alaska. for three years running, we failed to get the permits because the environmental requirements kept changing, and we were always rushing to catch up to the new definitions or the new standards being put in place and i did not find a cozy relationship whatsoever, and i can't deny things may have happened but i can't recognize this as a broad brush way of behaving within the mm schlts. as we watch the pictures, this is the prelude. this is the coming attractions in the movie theater. we see tony hayward with staff and attorneys in the room. we see journalists in the room. the members are beginning to come in. this is america's new villain at the moment. fairly or unfairly, the american people, and especially the people in the gulf coast -- the mention of his name causes outright visceral anger. a huge challenge for him and also a challenge for the congress. it's a performance for both of them as you point out. it's in no way criminal but it's a bit like a court case where they want to hear does the suspect show remorse. is he going to come on and express in adequate terms how much he understands what people are going through. 9:58 am we've seen bp officials start to do that increasingly in recent days, especially yesterday at the white house, expressing how sorry they are in very compassionate terms. you know, there is clearly nothing he's going to say today that's going to satisfy americans' outrage. it's really about not saying anything, as the ceo and how mun congress show how angry they are. this committee has thousands of documents from bp that the committee says proves that this deepwater horizon rig was behind schedule and bp wanted to move onto another project and rushed ahead and ignored warnings from their subcontractors, including halliburton. you see the drama, bp kills, bp lies. and mostly in the gulf coast. that's where we find ali velshi. we were together along the coast, and we both visited small towns where the fishermen and oystermen, and they look out at the waters and personalize it. they believe that hayward and his company not only sent millions of gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico and destroyed their way of life. when you go out there, you see a busy place for the first 50 miles or so into the gulf of mexico. there's a lot of activity, a lot of people working with the fish and oil. those people we talked to earlier this week have three concerns. one, stop the oil from coming out, two, stop the oil from getting to the shore, and three, do something to protect the wildlife in the marshes and shrimp and oysters that they have to collect. one thing you don't see from 10:00 am shore is yesterday i went out with the coast guard to burn the oil gathered around the spill site. it's about 3 to 12 miles from the site of the deepwater horizon. they are collecting these oil in booms and burning them. this is actually, john, a relative success in this operation. they are burning on some days -- we only know this anecdote tale, up to 5,000 barrels of oil an hour and up to 30,000 or 40,000 barrels a day. you see a success burning the oil so it doesn't get to shore and kill pelicans and shrimp and oysters. you also see a big, big plume of smoke in the area, and everybody says, what are we doing to the environment with the smoke. can you imagine we are in a place where we decided it is less dangerous to burn the oil and have the pollution go into the air than to have that oil go to shore and continue to damage 10:01 am more wildlife, more seafood and affect the livelihoods of people around here. this is very personal in this part of the gulf. this isn't about political decisions and who to blame. this is about stop the oil, give me my sea back. this is jens ragsal. these people say my grandfather, my father worked these waters or some worked in the oil industry. one thing we don't know, the biggest question you noted is, when, when, when will they stop the flow of oil into the gulf and then you have the environmental and economic impact. we don't know the ill pact on the tuna or sea turtles. commercial and environmental interests are in two separate areas. here they are not. now they have the moratorium on the oil industry, the oil industry has a bad name. they're mad at the oil industry but if you can't get shrimp or oysters, the other job is working in the oil industry. they are very, very krned they are getting hit on both sides, and the environment and economy have come together as one story in the gulf of mexico. on the right side of your screen, that is the house committee hearing room, and bart stupak has just taken his seat. we will go to that hearing. that's bart stupak in the middle, a retiring member of congress. he has decided not to run for re-election. 10:03 am first, let's check in with ed lavandera, he's down in kenner, louisiana. i'm getting the pulse as we're watching tony hayward begin to testify, kind of get a sense of how people are reacting to it. he has a lot of people's hearts to win over in this city and state. the hearing is just getting under way. we want to take you into the house committee hearing room right now. today we have a hearing entitled 10:04 am the role of bp in the deepwater horizon explosion and oil spill. we have a lot of members present who are not members of subcommittee but are meshes of the full energy and commerce committee. i welcome them and note that they will be allowed to submit written statements for the record but will not deliver verbal opening statements. after all subcommittee members complete their questions, full committee members will be allowed to ask questions. people who are not on the committee or subcommittee will be allowed to observe but will not be allowed to offer opening statements or ask questions due to time constraints. the chairman and ranking member will be recognized for five minute statements. other members will be recognized for three-minute opening statements. i will yield to the chairman of the full committee, mr. waxman, for the first opening statement. 10:05 am chairman. thank you for holding this important hearing. and mr. hayward, thank you for being here today. i'm sure that was not an easy decision for you but they were the right ones and i commend you for them. we are examining the committees for the spill. some are working on the reorganization of the regulatory agencies, and some, including chairman marquee's subcommittee are drafting legislation to reform our oil exploration laws. you are testifying today before the oversight and investigation subcommittee and this subcommittee has a special role, to examine the facts and determine what went wrong and to 10:06 am make recommendations to prevent future spills. when it's time for questioning, i and other members of the subcommittee will ask you about a series of internal bp documents. they appear to show that bp repeatedly took shortcuts that endangered lives and increased the richks of a catastrophic blowout and i sent you a letter in advance indicating that we're going to question you about those issues. but what is equally important is what is missing from the documents. when you became ceo of bp you promised to focus like a laser on safe and reliable operations. we wanted to know what you had done to keep this promise, so we asked what e-mails you had received, what documents you had reviewed about the deepwater horizon rig or the mkcando well 10:07 am before the blowout. deepwater drills is inherently dangerous as the entire country now knows. an uncontrolled blowout can kill rig workers and cause an environmental disaster. we want to know whether you were briefed about the risks and were monitoring the safety of the drilling operation. we could find no evidence that you paid any attention to the tremendous risks bp was taking. we've reviewed 30,000 pages of documents from bp, including your e-mails. there is not a single e-mail or document that shows you paid even the slightest attention to the dangers at this well. you are the ceo, so we consider the possibility that you may have delegated the oversight responsibility to someone else. we reviewed the e-mails and briefing documents received by 10:08 am andy englis and doug suttles, the chief operating officer for exploration and production, and the person now leading bp's response to the spill. according to bp, these are the senior officials who are responsible for the mecondo well, but they, too, were apparently oblivious to what was happening. we could find no evidence that either of them received any e-mails or briefings about the deepwater horizon rig or drilling activities at the well. bp's corporate complacency is astonishing. the drilling engineer for the rig called mecando a nightmare well. other bp employees predicted that the cement job would fail. halliburton warned of a severe 10:09 am gas flow problem. these warnings fell on deaf ears. bp's corporate attitude may best be summed up in an e-mail from its operations drilling engineer who oversaw bp's team of drilling engineers after learning of the risks and bp's decision to ignore them, he wrote, quote, who cares, end of story, we'll probably be fined end quote. there is a complete contradiction between bp's words and deeds. you were brought in to make safety the top priority of bp, but under your leadership bp has taken the most extreme risks. bp cut corner after corner to save a million dollars here, a few hours or days there, and now the whole gulf coast is paying the price. today's hearing will focus on bp's actions, but we learned 10:10 am from our hearing earlier this week that the other oil companies are just as unprepared to deal with a massive spill as bp. we are seeing in the oil industry the same corporate indifference to risk that caused the collapse on wall street, and that is why reform is so urgently needed. part of this reform must be to put teeth into our regulatory system and also our transition to a clean energy economy. we're addicted to oil. this addiction is fouling our beaches, polluting our atmosphere and undermining our national security. we can't snap our fingers or transform our energy economy overnight but we need to start down a path to a clean energy future. mr. chairman, i look forward to today's hearing, and mr. hayward, i thank you for appearing and cooperating with our investigation. mr. burgess and i will do our opening next. chairman and thank you, mr. hayward, for appearing before us. we have kind of a dual track under way in my opinion. we obviously are trying to gather the facts of what happened in the oil spill in the gulf of mexico a month and a half ago, trying to mind out the causes of that spill, what can be done to prevent it in the future. we are obviously very concerned about the mitigation and the cleanup. we have a system in america built up based on the british tradition over 200 years of due process and fairness where people that do bad things, in 10:12 am this case, a corporation that's responsible for a bad accident oh we want to hold them responsible, do what we can to make the liable parties pay for the damages. mr. stupak and mr. waxman are doing an excellent job working with dr. burgess and myself in conducting, i think, a very fair oversite investigation, and we're going to get into a number of those issuesen in hearing, and we're going to ask you some pretty tough questions. i'm speaking now totally for myself. i'm not speaking for the republican party or anybody in the house of representatives but myself. but i'm ashamed of what happened in the white house yesterday. if i called you into my office and i had the subcommittee chairman, mr. stupak, with me, who was legitimately conducting an oversight investigation on your company and said, if you put so many millions of dollars in a project in my congressional district, i could go to jail. and should go to jail. 10:14 am now, there is no question that british petroleum owns this lease. there is no question that bp -- i'm sorry, it's not british petroleum anymore -- that bp made decisions that objective people think compromise safety. there is no question that bp is liable for the damages. but we have a due process system where we go through hearings and in some cases court cases and litigation and determine what those damages are and when those damages should be paid. so i'm only speaking for myself and not speaking for anybody else, but i apologize. i do not want to live in a country where anytime a citizen or a corporation does something that is legitimately wrong is 10:15 am subject to some sort of political pressure that is, again in my words amounts to a shakedown. so i apologize. but on this hearing today i am with mr. waxman, with mr. stupak. there are answers that need to be -- questions that need to be asked that are legitimate because we don't want another oil spill of this magnitude in the gulf of mexico, and if there is anything that can be done to prevent this type of an accident in the future, then we have done our work for the american people. with that, mr. you just had your first wow of the day. this is the third hearing the subcommittee has held and the fifth hearing overall in the energy and commerce committee. our first hearing exposed problems with the blowout preventer and several other problems related to the disaster. our second hearing was a field hearing that contributed to -- our second hearing was a field hearing in new orleans where we heard from the widows of two men who died in the deepwater horizon explosion as well as shrimpers and others who shoved in the environmental catastrophe that followed. our staff has spent weeks combing through hundreds of thousands of documents and sitting through briefings by corporate, academic and scientific experts to find out 10:17 am what went wrong in the exploration of the mecando well. we have considered decisions may by bp in the hours and minutes before the explosion. what we learned is alarming. we learned that time after time, bp had warning signs that this was a nightmare well as one employee put it. bp made choices that set safety aside in exchange for cost cutting and time saving results. bp disregarded questionable results from pressure after cementing in the well. bp selected the riskier of two options. they could have hung a line from a casing already in the well and installed a tie back on the top of the liner which would have provided additional barriers for the release of hydrocarbons but entered if you string which cost less and took less time but did not provide the same protection against escaping hydrocarbons. 10:18 am halliburton said that the well could have a severe gas flow problem if bp lowered the final string of casing with only six centralizers instead of the 21 that halliburton recommended. bp rejected the advice to use additional centralizers in an e-mail on april 16th. bp employee said it will take ten hours to install them. i don't like it. bp chose not to fully circulate the mud in the well from the bottom to the top which was an industry recommended best practice that would have allowed them to test for gas in the mud. bp chose not to use a chase casing hanger lockdown sleeve which would have provided extra protection from a blowout from below. these are a few of the issues that led to the disaster. once deepwater horizon exploded and sank to the bottom of the 10:19 am sea, bp's response to contain the leak and clean up the spill was equally as poor. they issued law-ball estimates of the amount of oil flowing from the well which may have led to a scaled-back response. we discovered that bp's oil response plan was virtually identical to other oil companies' plans. rex tiller son admitted that once the spills occur, he says, quote, we are not well equipped to handle them end of quote. all of the other companies testified at tuesday's hearings that they would not have drilled the well as bp did. our witness today, mr. tony hayward, is the chief executive officer of bp. shortly after he took over as the ceo in 2007, he held a town haul meetings in houston and discussed that bp needed to be the leader with fewer people in the process. 10:20 am an article from september 27th, 2007, guardian newspaper in london, hayward says oil company has become too cautious reads, and i quote, assurance is killing us. mr. hayward told u.s. staff, noting that too many people were engaged in decision making, leading to excessive cautiousness, something that critics of its safety performance in the u.s. might question. let me put up these other notes from the same meeting. we received notes from bp and from employees and their note taking. the employee notes summarize mr. hayward's statements as follows, i don't think all of these layers of assurance reduces risk. the best way to reduce risk is to have deepwater competence where we need it. individuals need to be responsible for risk and to manage it end quote. i find this cavalier atud unbelievable, given the fact that bp had just been 10:21 am responsible for the largest leak in alaska on the north slope as well as the 2005 texas refinery which killed 14 workers and injured another 170. i must ask whether it was wise to adopt this leaner decision making process with input from fewer people and a new approach to managing risk. under the leadership of the former president of bp america, bp created an independent office of the ombudsman headed by stantry sporkman. line members feared retaliation if they reported safety concerns to management. when lamar mckay took over, i suggested that he hoped to improve the culture enough to make the ombudsman office unnecessary so he could shut it down. i urged him not to eliminate the office because it serves a 10:22 am significant role in investigating employee complaints. i'm more concerned now than ever about bp's safety and the role they take in assuming risk. i'm concerned that the corporate culture from tony hayward down to lamar mckay and chief operating officer that they are willing to take risk. i look forward to hearing the answers from tony hayward from the many questions our committee members will ask today. i hope for contrite substantive answers. you owe it to all americans. we are not small people but we wish to get our lives back. for the americans that live and work on the gulf coast, it may be years before they get their lives back. for the americans who lost their lives on the rigs, their families may never get their lives back. mr. hayward, i'm sure you will get your life back and with a golden parachute back to london. 10:23 am we in america are left with the consequences of bp's recklessness. i yield back my time to mr. burgess for an opening statement. this hearing provides the subcommittee withen opportunity to question the man who leads bp, mr. tony hayward, the e company's chief executive officer. bp has been central to the incident and the response. over the course of the inquiry to date, committee members have conducted numerous interviews and briefings and reviewed tens of thousands of pages of documents. our staff has done an excellent 10:24 am job and this subcommittee has been focused on gathering facts rather than rushes to judgment. we have begun to identify a number of serious questions about bp's decision making that led up to the disaster. exploring these and related questions today will epius identify. tony hayward and the ranking member giving his opening statement and of course on the left of the screen why we're here, the continuing leaking and spewing of millions of gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico. our first wow of the hearing came up a short time ago. 10:25 am most of what you will hear is sharp criticism of bp. you heard that from bart stupak who says he has eveils and documents that say bp was interested in cutting costs and not worried about safety. i want to bring into the conversation first our national political correspondent jessica yellin. i said at the beginning i did not expect mr. hayward to get any kind words. i was wrong. there is a sense in the conservative movement that government should be muscular and aggressive in a crisis and come in and, frerks, clean up a spill which is one thing the government can't handle well, but stay out of the way when it comes to corporate matters and all other things, that between 10:26 am private citizens and business is, that's not the proper role for the federal government. so no bailout, and no escrow accounts. i wouldn't be surprised if this becomes a huge rallying cry in the tea party movement, another example for them of the way government is being too involved in private industry. also, john hofmeister, the former president of shell oil in houston this morning. i don't see it as a shakedown 10:27 am but as a negotiated solution so work can go forward. so i don't completely agree with congressman barton, but i do question the legality of what happened. it's a goeshs. if you have cooperative agreement between two parties, i don't think there's anything wrong with that. stupak reading the e-mails and minutes and notes from employees that in his view, when mr. hayward became the leader of bp, he says mr. hayward in his view instance stuted a culture in which profits and getting things done took press sengs over safety. when i was president, if people selected just a few words of what i said without the entire context and the meaning, i think it would have led to a different interpretation. we also know that tony hayward 10:28 am made a commitment to the bp organization to institute stronger global processes that had not existed, including a safety management process which was in progress. i don't think it was completed yet. like chevron or exxon or shell, safety management processes are in place to prevent this very thing from happening. i was shocked when i learned about the design of the well, knowing what i know. i'm not a technical person, but i know enough from being around the technical people that you have to put more safeguards into something that is this high pressured, this large of a 10:29 am reservoir. you don't take chances. i will be interested to hear the explanation of why this design was chosen. so far, you had a culture of corporate complacency and that put profits over safety and that led to the deepwater horizon explosion and the tragedy that we see in the gulf of mexico, but from the most senior republican to speak so far, something quite different. hofmeister, joe barton is from where you are. you are in texas today. i assume you have known him a long time. he's an ally of the industry. bp under political pressure sat across the table and negotiated this deal with the white house. why would he call. i know congressman barton has very strong views on this is a nation of laws. there is no law that provides for this. i respect the fact that he has a different opinion but if i were in such a negotiating posture on the back foot, caused the damage, i would look for a way to work cooperatively with the 10:31 am white house without thinking about the laws on the books. we can't lose sight of the fact that the 1984 bhopal disaster and the lawsuits that were related to it were only settled last week. we have to ensure that the citizens of the gulf are 10:32 am protected. the families in the gulf will be crushed financially. unless this compensation fund is put into place. as each day and week and month goes by, the history of these families are going to be altered. and permanently altered unless 10:33 am he are given the financial capacity to take care of their loved ones, their children, their families. that's why this compensation fund is so important. that's why it is not a slush fund. that is why it is not a shakedown. it is, in fact, president obama ensuring that a company which has just spoiled the waters of our nation is made accountable for the harm which is done to our people, a company which said for the first week that it was only 1,000 barrels of oil per day when we now know that they knew it was at least 1,000 to 14,000 barrels. a company which continues to deny there are underwater toxic plumes, a company which has not 10:34 am been providing the proper protective gear for the workers in the gulf, a company which contended it could respond to a spill of 250,000 barrels per day. no, this is not a shakedown of that company. this is the american government, president obama, ensuring that this company is made accountable and sending a signal to all other companies that seek to treat ordinary american families in a way that can destroy their entire family's history. this is, in my opinion, the american government working at its best. this is creating truly the kind of partnership between the public and private sector that could make sure that innocent victims are not road kill as a result of corporate plans that did not actually factor in the 10:35 am harm that can occur to ordinary families. so, i just could not disagree more strongly. i think that this is, in my opinion, one of the most important hearings that this congress will ever have because it is sending a signal to any corporations out there, including the ones that testified on tuesday that all admitted that they had no plans, either, to respond to the harm which could be done in the gulf in one of their rigs had the same kind of catastrophic event, that they will be made accountable. so i thank you mr. chairman for holding this hearing, and i thank you, mr. hayward, because yesterday was the day where the page began to be turned, and we move to a new era. hayward for setting up the fund to help the families in the gulf of mexico. ed markey taking his time to lash back at the leading republican in the room, joe barton of texas. jessica yellin, a partisan fight now breaking out, congressman barton saying this is a shakedown, a slush fund it musseled out of bp. ed markey saying that it's what should happen. i was watching when they cut away to hayward while barton was making this comment. i don't know if a foreigner would understand the domestic politics of the tea party movement versus the democratic party. it i will point out it brings to 10:37 am mind he has hired some top democratic pr firms and democratic lawyer in this town to give him advice. now you have a gentleman from the gulf coast, darryl willis. he is the face of bp in its television advertising. john hofmeister, the former president of shell oil is with us in houston. it's very typical of a what i experienced. the partisanship that plays out in hearings can often times be truly disgraceful in the sense that it gets in the way of creating sound public policy. the american people need energy. the american people need a way 10:38 am forward. we have a team of reporters across the gulf of mexico. we are continuing to wait for the testimony from tony hayward on the top right of your screen, and he will testify that they still don't know what caused the continued spewing of oil into the gulf of mexico. he will say he is sorry. we are going to take a quick break. 10:40 am you are watching live pictures. tony hayward listening now to opening statements. members of the house subcommittee. he will testify in a short bit but first is listening to testimony from members of the committee. that is john dingell of michigan. i do not like this. i'm very concerned about using it. so, also, were we. on the same matter, bp's operations drilling engineers said, even if the hole is perfectly straight, a straight piece of pipe even in tension will not sink the center of the hole unless it has something to centralize it. i want you to listen to this. but who cares. it's done. end of story. it will probably be fine, and note the word probably, and we'll get a good cement job. i would rather have to squeeze than get stuck. mr. chairman, the comments of our witness today reveal little sorrow for the events that have occurred and here he said, the gulf of mexico is a very big ocean. the amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting in is tiny in relation to the total water volume, and, then, the environmental impact of the disaster is likely to be very, very modest. i wonder if he wishes to stand on that statement today. when mr. hayward responded to the claims that cleanup workers were becoming ill because of oil fumes and such, he said this, food poisoning is clearly a big issue. and, finally, most famously, mr. hayward informs us he wants his life back. last year, mr. mr. chairman again, i thank you for your diligence and hard work on this issue. i look forward to hearing from our witnesses today and look forward to working with you on this matter. chairman. next, miss backburn, three-minute opening statement, please. chairman, i thank you and ranking member burgess for holding the hearing, and mr. hayward, i thank you for your willing ms. to testify before this committee. you know, when news of the bp spill began and information about the well started to circulate, it seemed that there was problems not only with bp but also with mms bureaucracy, 10:44 am and that maybe the problem lay there rather than with anything that could have gone wrong with bp, that it was there with mms, and what we've learned and confirmed that that is not correct, that the problem does lie with bp and what went wrong and while there are many faumts with mms and doing its job on inspection and safety oversight, most of the data now presents to wrong decision making by bp's management, and this is not the first time, and we've talked about that in several of our opening statements this morning. this is not the first time that you've been before this kmirtty on safety problems, and certainly as recently as the texas 2005 and alaska '07 incidents which revealed insufficient protocols in bp's management and safety hierarchy. there was a statement particular bp that you all would quote unquote focus like a laser on safety, and it is concerning to us that the appearance is that 10:45 am bp has not learned from previous mistakes. so it leaves us asking the questions of you and of bp, was this accident caused by negligence, was it caused by risk-taking, was it caused by cost-cutting measures by bp decision makers, and unfortunately for citizens, beaches and wildlife all along the coastal region, they are paying a price for those misplaced decisions. bp cannot blame mother nature or equipment failure or even other subcontractors. their actions have put at risk the livelihood of communities and businesses that depend on the gulf. not only for seafood and tourism but also for energy production that this nation as a whole relies upon. in addition, the current administration also shares a 10:46 am significant portion of the blame for the oil spill. i mentioned mm schlts earlier, and the mms officials approved inadequate spill response plans, and field inspectors rubber stach. ed field inspection documents. this is another area where as members of congress doing our due diligence mms why. what is the most damaging is that the president and senior officials knew on day one the blowout preventer was not working and knew of the potential spillage. while bp shoulders much of the responsibility for the spill, the lack of effort by this administration to contain the spill has doomed the economy and wildlife of the gulf coast from an oil spill which could have been contained. and now recently imposed drilling moratoriums will further devastate america's 10:47 am energy production and destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs in the gulf coast region. thank you for being with us today, mr. chairman. i yield the balance of my time. brayly, three minutes, sir. chairman. mr. hayward, you are not going to get a lecture from me today and you're not going to get annal polg, either. we are here to find get answers from you. one of the things that i think we need to know about today is the decisions that your company made. tony hayward will testify shortly but first each member of the committee gets to make a statement. the congressman said he would not lecture but has a list of questions. we have heard democrats mostly scornful saying under mr. hayward bp had a culture of 10:49 am profits, getting things done quickly, putting safety lower on the list. most republicans also say there are tough questions facing bp, but one republican, joe barton of texas said he owed mr. ali velshi is among our correspondents down in the gulf region. as you listen to this, based on your conversations with so many people in the region, obviously they want to hear most from mr. hayward. you discussed it with respect to the claims process. the frustration on the ground, as you know, john, from being around here, these are not people who live high on the hog. these people make a living, and it's something your father did and your kids might do after you. that's the frustration. let's check in back quickly with the hearing on capitol hill. remember, we're watching the oil spill here, but remember just moments ago, they played some sound from the widows. 11 men died on the deepwater horizon, and as they prepare to question mr. hayward, they are reminding him of the stakes. we have an opportunity in this oversight hearing to ask questions that get to the facts of what happened. however, today's hearing is incomplete. we can only ascertain half of the story today because we do not have anyone representing the administration, the mineral management service to discussion their oversight role and their responsibility in assuring that an accident like this didn't happen. deep ocean drilling is not knew. in fact we have been doing it for decades in the gulf coast. if that's the case, why did this not happen in the last decade. why did this occur almost a year and a half into the current administration. we need to hear from our own department of interior and mineral management services. certainly mr. hayward should be prepared to answer for bp's responsibility but we should hear from the administration to implement prudent reforms to return us to safe drilling in our owings because simply saying no is not a realistic answer. i further realize there are some in this administration who have a penchant for not letting a crisis go to waste. we can't take our ball and go home when the consequences mean a weaker america. everyone depending on foreign 10:53 am fuels are all too inclined it seems to let jobs leave this country. no, mr. chairman, we have to under what happened leading up to and on april the 20th. we have to learn in the rules and oversight was insufficient or if this was purely an act of negligence disregard for sound regulations. we can try to enact the perfect reform that ensures this never happens again. we are waiting to hear tony hayward testify. they are saying bp has a lot to answer for but the obama administration has a lot to answer for. it has been in charge fore15 months now and the interior department under this president granted the waiverers and the licenses for the deepwater horizon rig. 10:54 am as we watch the hearing, there is a huge reaction on line to the proceedings as there has been throughout the past eight weeks of the drama. josh levs has this. we're hearing from you, live tweeting. let me show you the examples. i want to know why he thought he would get away with this. i really hope that they do grill him and do it with a lot of heat. people talking about what they want to hear from tony hayward. this grilling serves no purpose. tony hayward is going to tell us what we want to hear and we are going to see our representatives look, indill nant. i'm interested in knowing about the disaster plans for bp's oil rig platforms. a lot of people are saying there is actual information they are hoping to get from the proceedings. congress needs to look at its own regulations and the laws that permed this disaster. tony is not the only guilty 10:55 am party. the truth would be nice for a change. that is from beverly joe. mr. waxman told mr. hayward straight. it's time he is held to account ability. it is sad it happened but it was an accident. chris said that and they are jumping on chris for that. we have time to two little tweets. he should show good faith in helping the affected communities like giving up benefits receiving from bp. we stopped the leak. i don't think he could say anything better. you can send us tweets and facebook messages. join us on the blog throughout the day while everything happens on capitol hill. we will be following those and have more later today. tony hayward is in the hot seat in congress. tony hayward will be testifying in the hour ahead. we are going to take a quick break. 10:56 am 10:57 am 10:58 am welcome back to our special continuing coverage. honeny hayward is at the top right of your screen before the subcommittee on oversight and investigations. he will testify shortly and will deliver testimony in which he will apologize and say bp promises to get to the bottom of it and bp is committed to making right to the people of the gulf coast who have been affected. let's go back now as we wait for tony hayward and listen to the continuing opening statements. you are never as good as they say you are or as bad as they say you are, so this hearing will go back and forth. the other thing i'd like to remind the committee is that the greatest environmental disaster in america has been cigarettes. 10:59 am 60,000 americans today this year will die from cigarette-related cancers. so if we're going to talk about the environment, let's not leave this out. i'm a cancer specialist by training and i never fail to bring that up. the environment is it an important concept. we regret the loss of life and we'll do what we can do. this is not the worst thing that ever happened to america. chairman. at this very moment, oil is gushing from deepwater horizon blowout at a rate between we learned 35,000 and 60,000 barrels a day, killing animals and wiping out entire populations of fish and along with it the jobs of hundreds of thousands of people. most upsetting about this travesty is that it could have been avoided. New.
