Block Kavanaugh's nomination. '.banner-ad-row'); George Takei Calls Trump Exactly What He Is. x History shall record that you are not only the stupidest, most incompetent president ever, but also the cruelest and pettiest. Takei also had some advice for any LGBT Trump supporters: x Trump is banning all transgenders from the military. There are thousands of transgender people already serving among the 1.3 million active-duty members of the military. Imagine the scale of this insult. It also reveals yet another layer of his political cynicism, and his willingness to use any tactical means available to try to emerge whole from his current predicament. The President is in the midst of a colossal scandal, and the country, to an increasing measure, knows it. A sizable portion of the country wants to be rid of him and suspects he is unworthy of his office.
