Skip to content The Daniels Daily Reader Don't sell your soul for a salary. A Fault in the Foundation I woke up this morning at 1:50AM with plans to lazily scroll though Instagram until sleep reappeared. They were doing it because of the very real chance that the pipeline would leak, contaminating their environment. Yesterday, the pipeline leaked, contaminating their environment. Things like this would make a more innocent version of myself wonder why our nation puts the good of the economy over the good of its citizens. Not only has America historically trivialized the lives of our Native American brothers and sisters because of its insatiable greed, to this day we spit in their faces and poison their water in an attempt to make the rich richer. A system that, at its base, was meant to serve only those of a certain race and class will always primarily serve only those who meet that criteria until the foundation is replaced. We cannot fix this from the top down or the floor up. We have to dig deep, get to the bedrock, and redefine who we are as a nation. As I said in a piece published yesterday on Blavity, America is in such turmoil right now because its values do not align with its actions, and never have. You need to be held accountable. We must hold America accountable. So, to my Native American brothers and sisters, I hope Sioux nation sues the pants off the American government, pun intended. I pray they have wronged you for the last time. Make integrity a priority. account.
