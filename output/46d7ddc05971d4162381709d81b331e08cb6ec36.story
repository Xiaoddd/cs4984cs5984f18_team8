We appreciate the time and effort it took to get us to this point; yet another small victory on the path to justice. We commend Jo Ellen Darcy for her leadership and decision to require the EIS, and are thankful to both our supporters and the many government workers who it took to bring us to this point today. This continues to be historic. The notice issued today opens the public scoping phase and invites anyone interested to help them to identify potential issues, concerns, and reasonable alternatives that should be considered in an EIS. It is, however, still not over. We still need your support. While the EIS is exactly what we called for, the final product must be stronger and more broad in scope. We understand that the process is just starting and we anticipate working closely with the Army as this process moves forward. This is an official site of standingrock.org.
