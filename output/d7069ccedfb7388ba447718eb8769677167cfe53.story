Their mission: to help the Sioux tribes stop the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) from being drilled under the great Missouri River, befouling the water supply for 17 million people, desecrating sacred sites and trampling on Native lands and sovereignty. At Oceti Sakowin Camp, thousands gathered around the sacred fire to hear the good news that the Army Corps of Engineers denied a permit to drill under the Missouri River. But they know that may not be enough to stop the Big Black Snake, the Dakota Access Pipeline that serves no purpose but to make the ultra-rich richer. Then, on Nov. 25, the Army Corps of Engineers, backed by the North Dakota governor, issued an ultimatum, ordering all 7,000 people then living in the Oceti Sakowin (Seven Council Fires of the Great Sioux Nation) camp to pack up and leave. Tribal leaders refused, demanding respect for their community and territorial treaty rights. The evacuation order, in addition to ongoing vicious police repression against the water protectors, prompted a howl of outrage from all over. Military veterans, youth and the elderly, individually and in groups, dropped whatever personal plans they may have had and headed for Standing Rock. Social media definitely helped. Tribal leaders refused, demanding respect for their community and territorial treaty rights. Some came on bicycles or walked hundreds of miles to get there. They stayed in tents (with deadman tent-stake anchors), tipis, campers, yurts, old school buses, Winnebagos or hastily built wooden structures. Some came with body armor, gas masks and spray bottles with diluted Mylanta to minimize the effects of tear gas. So by the time Dec. 4 rolled around, on the eve of the threatened police eviction, many thousands were arriving at the camps. Celebrating a temporary victory As the line of cars waiting to get into the Oceti Sakowin camp stretched for three miles along Highway 1806, you could hear updates on the struggle on the Native radio station, 89.5, along with recordings of powerful, emotional singing and drums by Native artists and country songs that told a story by Freddy Fender and Conway Twitty. Then came the unexpected announcement. The Army Corps statement mentioned exploring possible alternative routes for the pipeline and the need for an Environmental Impact Statement, all requiring months of delay. Nearby the flags of over a hundred tribes flapped in the wind on the edge of the dirt road. These young warriors expressed defiance at the encroachments on Native land and water rights, but also sorrow about the recent suicide of a teenaged member of the tribe. Then came the unexpected announcement. A Native woman from Washington state said she came with two gifts. The first was traditional medicine from her tribe. The second was music, performed live by a young singer and drummer from her tribe. She said that back home Indigenous people were fighting a similar struggle to stop a toxic oil terminal. But we know they lie. They always lie, the government and the police. A huge march of defiance, led by military veterans, left from the camp to the bridge near where Energy Transfer Partners, co-owner of the pipeline project, had planned to drill the DAPL under the Missouri River. By now it was snowing, soon to become a blinding blizzard that whipped people with 25-mile-an-hour winds as they approached the Backwater Bridge. A young woman hit by a concussion grenade lost her arm. They beat, arrested, pepper-sprayed, maced, tear-gassed, strip-searched and hit the water protectors with flash grenades, rubber bullets and beanbags filled with lead pellets. Some who were captured got numbers marked on their bodies; others were caged in dog kennels. A Native elder suffered cardiac arrest. A young woman, seriously wounded by a concussion grenade, a weapon of war, was airlifted to Minnesota for treatment. Together with folks from the Sioux and nearby Cheyenne River Nations, this was described by one participant as the largest Indigenous gathering in living memory. Relationships were built between the different tribes, bonded in their common struggle. The size of the veteran participation may have played a decisive role. Brenda White Bull, who is a 20-year Marine veteran and also a direct descendant of Chief Sitting Bull, also played a role. Instead, 4,000 veterans showed up, filling three campsites. The day before the deadline for eviction, thousands of veterans, many of them Indigenous, arrived to defend the water protectors. They marched to Backwater Bridge, where, on Nov. 20, law enforcement in service to the oil barons had launched a potentially deadly attack. The march was a dramatic show of force by a united people in the face of a blizzard. Others came from Iraq Veterans Against the War and Veterans of Foreign Wars. Some identified themselves as Jewish-American veterans, African-American veterans, Italian-American veterans. The ratio of men to women was about 60-40. One said Standing Rock was a historic gathering for veterans, with many more vets coming to North Dakota than had come to the major Vietnam Veterans Against the War action in Washington, D.C., in 1971. By mid-week, forecasts were calling for winds up to 39 mph, wind-chill as low as 40 below. Many of the vets who answered the call are Indigenous, including Navy veteran Remy, member of the Navajo Nation from Arizona and the Indigenous Veterans Council at Standing Rock. This is our land originally. Land and the water are life-giving elements. Joan Baez and Willie Nelson offered key support. Warren is deftly dissected by YouTube personality Jimmy Dore. The main highway going north from the camp (1806) is still blockaded, with military-style checkpoints. Ominously, Energy Transfer Partners issued a statement Dec. 4 saying it would ignore the Army Corps permit decision and go ahead with drilling under the Missouri River. It could decide to drill and just absorb any fines or penalties.

If it misses the deadline, as now appears likely, companies with long-term commitments to ship oil through the pipeline may cancel, according to a November report by Sightline Institute. As a consequence of the global oil glut, oil prices have dropped sharply since ETP began the project in 2014. Wells Fargo has apparently experienced a drop in deposits, following the divestment campaign. Welsh, an Army veteran and retired letter carrier, stayed at the Oceti Sakowin camp in early December, working in the mess hall and kitchen that provided three meals a day to hordes of water protectors. Many thanks for the information and insights of Maurice Martin of Veterans for Peace, who worked tirelessly at Eagle Butte to provide medical support for the tribes and the huge contingent of veterans. They are fighting to stop the completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which will carry highly flammable crude oil under the Missouri River. The pipeline would endanger the drinking water of millions downstream and threatening sacred native burial grounds. A Lakota prophecy says a great black snake will run through the land and bring destruction to the people and to the earth. But media attention has dwindled since the Army Corps of Engineers announced it would deny the permit necessary to build the DAPL through Sioux treaty lands. The world has stopped watching; we all cried victory. But climate change denier Trump is likely to overturn the Army Corps order once he takes office, and native leaders fear that Energy Transfer Partnership, the owner, will simply drill without a permit and just pay the daily fines. So the protectors are standing their ground and enduring the harsh winter. With limited resources and support, the Sioux tribe has been waging war against a multi-billion-dollar corporation that is set on destroying sovereign tribal lands, all in the name of monetary gain. Now we need to do everything we can to help the water protectors keep fighting and survive the winter. They are fighting for a cleaner, healthier environment: a better tomorrow for all of us. They are fighting this fight for everyone. water is very important for all of us and i think we all should do efforts in saving more water for ourselves. I want to get more update about it from you here.
