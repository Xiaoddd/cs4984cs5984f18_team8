Democrats went with their personal will instead of the will of the people and now we all have to pay the price. No more will we let people so out of touch from the average American's life make decisions on their behalf. Today is the day we make sure our voices are heard. We'll accomplish this goal not with the help of parties that have failed us countless times before, but with a new people's party. One that's sole purpose is representing the working class, the real majority of Americans. Much of this work is already underway. We just need Bernie to lead this party to success. Now he just needs a little motivation. A pledge today would show Bernie that we're serious about this, and give the final push he needs to form this party and lead us to a land of peace and prosperity. Don't worry about your donation, for you will only be charged if Bernie decides to start the party. Remember, this isn't a pledge for just one man, this is a pledge for a free and just society. A glorious 21st century progressive era. Visit our website, sign up to volunteer, and join us on Facebook and Twitter. Too many are beholding to the richest donors instead of ALL THEIR CONSTITUENTS. For this reason, those who cannot contribute or are limited in what they can contribute have little voice in government, though we be in the majority. - Declaration of Independence, July 3 1776. It is time for independence from the Democratic Party. The People deserve a party for them. We must elect politicians that will represent us and not just their donors. Just imagine for a minute how different the country could be with that leadership. Too many are beholding to the richest donors instead of ALL THEIR CONSTITUENTS.

Just imagine for a minute how different the country could be with that leadership. We have tried changing them, pushing them left, tried to unify them and us but they refuse to change. The DNC will NEVER allow a true, pure Progressive to win the nomination. We KNOW that. 2016 was less than a year ago. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... shame on us all. The Repubs were never there. It's time for a new party, a People's Party. A new, progressive party would give those disaffected with both major parties' the comfort of supporting their choice without feeling like their pawns. Now, tell people why. Now, tell people why.
