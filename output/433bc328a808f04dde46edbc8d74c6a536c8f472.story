The state's votes were expected to go toward Hillary Clinton. However, four voters cast their ballots in protest. According to KOMO News, eight of them voted for Clinton, three voted for former Secretary of State Colin Powell and 1 voted for Native American elder Faith Spotted Eagle. Many on social media reacted to the name Faith Spotted Eagle with confusion. KOMO News mentioned the elder's name in quotations, leaving the impression that they didn't consider it as a real name or a considerable choice. The news site has since apologized for their original tweet. Apologies to Faith Spotted Eagle. We erroneously put her name in quotes when announcing the WA electoral tally. Bad error on our part. Spotted Eagle is an indigenous activist with a lot of achievements and influence. The Native American elder has become a prominent name in the indigenous movement to halt the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline on the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Spotted Eagle also led the efforts to protest the Keystone Pipeline XL in 2015. In 1994, Spotted Eagle created the Braveheart Society. The Braveheart Society, located within Ihanktonwan homelands, is a grassroots organization dedicated to advocating for environmental justice within indigenous communities, healing sexual violence survivors and using traditional Native American ceremonies to heal trauma for members of the community.
