Andrea Ixchiu, a Mayan activist and campaigner for indigenous land rights, said the pipeline protests allowed the public to speak out about injustices committed against indigenous communities in the United States. Indigenous Mayan groups from Guatemala traveled to the Standing Rock protest camp on the North Dakota plains as a show of solidarity with Native Americans, she said. Ixchiu was in London to promote a documentary she appears in which she hopes will raise awareness of the struggles faced by indigenous communities in Guatemala. The documentary highlights the links between abuses against indigenous Maya communities during Guatemala's civil war and current land rights battles. Former Guatemala dictator Efrain Rios Montt is on trial on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity committed during the civil war. He is accused of overseeing the slaughter of 1,771 members of the Maya Ixil indigenous population in the Quiche region of Guatemala in 1982 and 1983. A U.N.-backed truth commission found that 626 indigenous villages were destroyed by the Guatemalan military during the 36-year war that ended in 1996. Villagers now face the installation of multi-national projects, from hydroelectric dams to open pit mining sites, the film says. Ten environmental activists were killed in Guatemala in 2015, the last year on record, six of them from indigenous communities. Ixchiu, from the community of Totonicapan in the country's southwest, said as a land rights activist she had been kidnapped and threatened with death. Caceres was shot and killed after receiving death threats over her opposition to a hydroelectric dam project.
