by Nika Knight, staff writer 0 Comments Veterans and water protectors unite in prayer, calling for an end to the entire Dakota Access Pipeline project, in the midst of a blizzard Monday. Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline, on Monday filed a lawsuit against the Army Corps' decision, and the suit will be heard in court on Friday. Photos and videos of the peaceful action showed water protectors and veterans united in prayer, and standing strong despite the barrage of wind and snow: Even as the frigid and harsh blizzard conditions are predicted to continue, many water protectors are vowing to remain at the site. The chairman wrote: While the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe does its part to defeat this Black Snake and water protectors continue to keep watch over our sacred Mni Sose, we must all be aware that winter has finally come to the Great Plains. Conditions out there are hard. Winter weather in Sioux Country can be life threatening if you are not prepared. Please, do not put your life in jeopardy. If you are elderly, have medical issues, are camping with children, or are not properly equipped for our harsh weather, you should consider moving on so that you do not endager yourself, your family, the emergency responders, or the larger movement of killing the Black Snake. If you choose to go home, I thank you and honor your decision. Welcome home. You have all shown the world that courage, peace, unity, and fortitude can indeed change the world. Those of you who choose to stay, I thank you. But you must be strong and prepared if this is your choice. As you know and have experienced, North Dakota winters are brutal and harsh, so please take all precautions to stay safe, warm, and healthy. Amnesty International and the United Nations have both raised the alarm about police brutality against the water protectors. The tribunal should be broadcast here at 9:15am EST on Friday. They also reiterated their commitment to the fight to protect their drinking water and treaty land. This is the way of the Standing Rock people, the Lakota people, the Hunkpapa people. The Indigenous Environmental Network's Dallas Goldtooth also released a video statement Wednesday, asking supporters unable to come to the protest camp to take part in the movement to divest from DAPL, and to research and support other pipeline and fossil fuel infrastructure battles. The Indigenous organizer argued that each battle is a part of the same larger fight. We're going to keep on going. We will continue to push on. Many of the Indigenous water protectors who traveled from their own reservations to join the Standing Rock Sioux in their fight against the pipeline have found the movement transformative, and plan to bring the movement home with them.

As the Oceti Sakowin camp statement concluded: We are not protestors. We are not terrorists. We are not rioters. We are in fact, Protectors.
