Toggle navigation Start a Campaign Start a Campaign Log in To: PRESIDENT OBAMA Dear Pres. On October 25th the Episcopal Priest Rev. John Floberg of Standing Rock issued an urgent call to Faith Leaders and people of faith and conscience around the nation to stand with the Water Protectors at Standing Rock. Hundreds of faith leaders have responded to this call by going to Standing Rock, and by calling on their communities to take action to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. Clergy and Faith Leaders acknowledge the role we and our institutions have played in past and ongoing oppression of Indigenous people. We ask that all people across the nation sign on to this letter in support of the demands outlined by Chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Dave Archambault, and Rev. John Floberg, supervising Priest of the Episcopal Church in North Dakota. First, we call on the Army Corps to deny the permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline which violates the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty, would endanger the drinking water of 10 million people, and is a risk to our climate. Fourth, President Obama, we call on you to fulfill your commitment to protect the children of Standing Rock. We implore you to honor the commitment you made to the Indigenous people of this country, and to act with honor and justice and defend all we hold sacred: our children, water, and the health of all communities.

We never prepare for the worst, we just wring our hands when it happens. Let's not contaminate water or destroy sacred places for some quick profit now.

President Obama must follow through on his commitment. It will help him leave a good legacy especially in regard to the Native Americans who have had plenty of broken promises from past leaders.
