There are currently law enforcement and emergency services vehicles on site. Two other individuals were also reportedly arrested this morning near the site of a pipeline compressor station, also under construction in Suwannee County. The group is comprised of people from across Florida, and other states, who have been organizing against new pipeline construction, many of whom have been to North Dakota and Iowa to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL).
