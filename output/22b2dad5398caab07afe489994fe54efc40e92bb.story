Jessup was also found guilty of a misdemeanor criminal conspiracy charge, while Foster added felony criminal mischief and a criminal trespass misdemeanor. Foster faces up to three years in prison, while Jessup will serve two years of supervised probation. Foster had faced as many as 21 years in prison. Foster had questioned his own actions, however, after hearing the verdict in October. Foster and Jessup were members of a group called Climate Direct Action, which launched a coordinated effort in late 2016 to sabotage pipelines. Valve Turners from Steve Liptay on Vimeo. In addition to praising Foster, Hansen had traveled to North Dakota for the trial to testify as a climate expert as part of the defense, but the judge ruled his testimony inadmissible. The judge in the case rejected the tactic. But a separate Climate Direct Action anti-pipeline effort in Minnesota that led to the arrest of two activists, Emily Johnston and Annette Klapstein, will be permitted to use the necessity defense at trial. Johnston and Klapstein have admitted they coordinated with Climate Direct Action to shut down targeted pipelines. Their trial awaits a state appeals court ruling on their ability to exercise the necessity defense. A total of 11 anti-pipeline activists affiliated with Climate Direct Action were arrested in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and Washington. Two others convicted of felonies in the pipeline attacks, Ken Ward and Leonard Higgins, were barred from using the necessity defense at trial. Ward has been sentenced to 30 days of community service, while Higgins will receive his sentence in March.
