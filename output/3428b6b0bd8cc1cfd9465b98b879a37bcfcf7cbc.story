After nearly a decade since the last major oil pipeline was built, and with existing ones brimming with crude, Canada's energy industry is wondering when and if any new lifelines to foreign markets will go into the ground. Energy East, which would have delivered bitumen from the oilpatch to Eastern Canada, was cancelled by TransCanada Corp. in October 2017 after strong opposition from municipalities and Indigenous groups. Northern Gateway would have sent bitumen from Bruderheim, AB, to Kitimat, BC, for transportation to Asian markets. It too faced strong opposition, and was rejected by Trudeau in 2016. Those difficulties include landowner permissions and local permitting, as well as court challenges in Nebraska from some of the many groups still opposed to it, but overall the regulators involved look to be on board, said Rogers. Replacing Line 3 would allow the company to restore the original 760,000 barrel a day capacity, adding about 375,000 barrels of shipping capacity because of current pressure restrictions on the line. The progress on pipelines to the U.S. is encouraging, but producers need access to new markets and predictability in building projects after several failed attempts, said Canadian Energy Pipeline Association president Chris Bloomer. He said the U.S. administration has a clear vision on pipelines and the energy sector, and that the series of failed pipelines has hurt investment in Canada. Greenpeace campaigner Keith Stewart said both pipelines can expect continued resistance on all fronts, on both sides of the border. All rights reserved.
