Home Archive Standing Rock Tribal Council Approves Evacuation Order for All Camps Jenni Monet Water protectors learned Friday they have thirty days to leave the camps that have helped swell the movement to stop construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Council members also voted against providing any temporary camps or shelters to individuals who should remain at the camps after the February 19 deadline. The talks were scheduled following a motion approved by tribal members of the Cannon Ball District two nights earlier on Wednesday, January 18. In that meeting, residents voted in favor of closing the sprawling network of camps where an estimated 1,000 people remain living on lands bordering the reservation. The evacuation decision was made following a week of renewed clashes between police and pipeline protesters who call themselves water protectors. Since Monday, January 16, 35 people have been arrested from demonstrations, or actions, carried out at various sites blocking access to the pipeline drill pad, bringing the total number of arrests to 624 since August 10. Jenni Monet Standing Rock Tribal Council votes unanimously to close all camps within 30 days, including Oceti Sakowin, Rosebud and Sacred Stone, following a 10-point resolution passed by the Cannon Ball District January 18. Wednesday night, police crossed the blockade to raze a tipi that had been erected by water protectors. The incident sparked a violent stand-off by police who shot bean-bag rounds and sprayed chemical gas on dozens of people. One water protector who remains unidentified was hospitalized with injuries to the face, according to officials with Morton County. State officials closed the Backwater Bridge October 27 following the massive militarized sweep on the prairie where two vehicles were set ablaze near the river crossing. Last week, January 12, state transportation officials declared the bridge was structurally sound and could be re-opened. But North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier applied concessions: the clashes at the bridge had to come to an end. In a meeting with campers held January 5, Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II called on protesters to practice restraint from further actions on the bridge. He told them that the blockade needed to be removed. The bridge is on Highway 1806, the main route Cannon Ball residents use for work and access to services. Its closure has led to financial hardships at the Prairie Knights Casino and Resort, its main economic engine. According to the Chairman, the shortfall has cut into tribal programs for children and elders. Standing Rock Sioux tribal member, Edward Black Cloud criticized the tribe. Less than a dozen water protectors were present at the meeting and many were tribal members like Black Cloud. JoBeth Brown Otter shared her views and personal camp experiences with the council. Meantime others complained about how elders and women no longer felt safe in the community due to an increase in crime, alcohol and drug use, a concern also raised by residents of the Cannon Ball District. From this action, it was also the first time a water protector had been arrested on drug charges, in this case, possession of marijuana, according to Morton County officials. LaDonna Tamakawestewin Allard, founder of the original encampment, the Sacred Stone camp, was in Park City, Utah for the release of the documentary series RISE at the Sundance Film Festival, which features the struggle at Standing Rock.

But for one organization that has helped swell the movement from the start, the Indigenous Environmental Network, the decision by the council was a timely one. His point about flooding echoed recent concerns of tribal and state officials. He also signaled new political realities and how that might impact the movement. Grandmother and activist Tunwin Faith Spotted Eagle also weighed in with a public statement. The bridge needs to be opened through strong leadership not agitation by anyone. Standing Rock OYATE severely need that bridge open for emergency and economic reasons so stay away from the bridge please and pray in camp, at ceremonies and together because it is working. Please younger generation stay off the bridge, Turtle Island and Turtle Hill. The tribe has called for a January 30 start date to begin clearing out the abandoned debris at the camps.
