My cousin, Amos Cloud and I purchased the 16 x 32 foot Michigan Host Tent at Standing Rock, ND. The Michigan Host Tent at Standing Rock is a home away from home for those from Michigan who have traveled to support the fight for our water at Standing Rock. We vow to help provide shelter, food, and protection to all who come out from Michigan. We are located at the Crazy Horse Blvd and Wild Oglala Way. We have a 16 x 32 ft army tent with two wood stoves and a kitchen, as well as other tents around in the area. Please try again. Not clear on the water issue in standing rock,nd.
