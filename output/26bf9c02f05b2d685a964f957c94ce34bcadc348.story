Those opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline were sprayed down with water cannons in below freezing temperatures. Along with the water cannons, a large amount of tear gas was used on the crowd, along with rubber bullets and concussion grenades. The total count of people injured was reportedly almost 200. One man was hit in the head with a non-lethal round that split his head open. At least a dozen people had to go to the hospital. One woman in specific may have had her life changed forever. Sophia Wilansky may lose her arm after she was struck by what is thought to be a concussion grenade. Wilansky is reportedly at a hospital in Minneapolis. It has not been confirmed that she will have to face amputation, but for the time being, it is a real possibility. Human rights have been a concern for all those standing against the Dakota Access, but last night those concerns were pushed to a new level. Not only were the officers carelessly firing non-lethal weapons into a large crowd, they were spraying that crowd down with water in 23-degree weather. Medics in the area were doing everything they could to prevent hypothermia from setting in. To add insult to injury, law enforcement took the main thing these people are fighting for and turned it into a weapon to use against them. To think that water protectors were attacked with water in the freezing cold shows just how heartless the law enforcement in the area really is. On Sunday afternoon, peaceful water protectors went to Blackwater Bridge to remove two burnt vehicles off of the bridge. The vehicles have been used as a barricade by law enforcement for weeks. It was a peaceful gesture that was met with severe oppression and violence from law enforcement.
