On March 3, 84 gallons spilled from a leak in Watford City, North Dakota, where two sections of the pipeline connect. A smaller leak of 20 gallons occurred two days later, on March 5. The second leak happened in rural Mercer County, North Dakota, the result of an above-ground valve malfunction. The two leaks preceded the most widely-known incident to date, which occurred April 4 at a pump station north of Crandon, South Dakota. The April leak spilled 84 gallons of oil before officials contained it, again with no damage being done to the local environment. Protesters argued that the oil could spill and endanger the water. No spills have been reported in the Lake Oahe section of the pipeline, but with three spills occurring elsewhere before the pipeline is even fully operational, it has been an inauspicious beginning so far. Authorities clear the Oceti Sakowin camp in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, U.S., February 24, 2017. Under former President Barack Obama 's U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, construction of the pipeline was halted in December 2016 pending an environmental impact statement that would have assessed how great a danger the project posed to locals. Trump scrapped the delay as soon as he took office. In an executive action, he ordered the project to continue as planned, effective immediately. The Dakota Access pipeline runs 1,172 miles through North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. Read the original article on Mic. Copyright 2017. Follow Mic on Twitter. All rights reserved.
