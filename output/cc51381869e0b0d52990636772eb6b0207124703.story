Though the Ponca lost this land 140 years ago to colonizers and now live in Oklahoma, they continue to hold it sacred. As the story points out, the Ponca have teamed up with White farmers and landowners who are opposed to the project for its forced land grabbing and potential environmental impacts. The concerns for the Keystone XL are similar to what was seen in North Dakota for the Dakota Access Pipeline: land, water and decision-making power. Now, organizers have some solid practice and know what to expect with the Trump administration, which steamrolled both pipelines through presidential memorandums on January 24. And the Keystone XL is a battle activists have won in the past; former President Barack Obama rejected a key permit in November 2015 after seven years of resistance. But some believe there are valuable lessons to learn from the Dakota Access, which the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is still challenging in court but is now operational. The Ponca play a key role in this alliance. For them, the pipeline route poses risks to sacred sites and ancient burial grounds. is published by Race Forward, a national organization that advances racial justice through research, media and practice.
