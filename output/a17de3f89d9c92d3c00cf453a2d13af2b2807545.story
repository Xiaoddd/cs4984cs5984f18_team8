A GoFundMe to raise money for the veterans to travel to Standing Rock has received half a million dollars in support. The veterans are coordinating directly with the elders of the Standing Rock Sioux. The veterans will be joined by Tulsi Gabbard, the Democratic representative from Hawaii, who has developed a positive reputation among Republicans and Democrats alike. After the South Carolina Democratic primary, Gabbard formally resigned from the DNC to join Sanders as a surrogate for his campaign. Gabbard is an Iraq War veteran and continues to serve as a major in the National Guard. She has been one of the most vocal opponents to interventionist U.S. foreign policy, which was the subject of a meeting she had with President-elect Donald Trump, inciting speculation that she was being considered for a role in his administration.
