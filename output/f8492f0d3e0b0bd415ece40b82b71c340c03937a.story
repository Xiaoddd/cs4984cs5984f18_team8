A lot of other work was directly paid for by Sunoco, but the total cost of the cleanup has not been released by the company. Sutton said the agreement recoups about 80 percent of Great Parks' costs. The work is not yet done. A containment wall, created to keep oil out of other areas, is currently being removed and in the spring, the gravel lots and other remnants of the cleanup process will be restored. Cleanup efforts early on included vacuuming up thousands of gallons of oil and removing tens of thousands of rocks from a creek, so they could be cleaned and returning to the creek bed. Sunoco is required to physically address the area with absorbent pads and remove the oil when found. The staging area for the emergency response was placed in a known habitat for the bird.
