RELATED: Dakota Pipeline Protests Face Harsh Repression in Freezing Cold Water Protector Legal Collective, an initiative of the National Lawyers Guild, NLG, filed suit in U.S. District Court against Morton County, Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirschmeier, and other law enforcement agencies. Indeed, on that frigid evening last week, as protesters rallied, chanted, danced and prayed, they were met with police clad in riot gear, face masks, shields, guns, giant fire extinguisher-sized containers of chemical weapons, grenade launchers of tear gas, Tasers and batons. A press release by Civil Liberties Defense Center describes the scene. One woman had a cop intentionally aim a flash bang grenade into her groin. These were just some of the 300 reported injuries that evening.
