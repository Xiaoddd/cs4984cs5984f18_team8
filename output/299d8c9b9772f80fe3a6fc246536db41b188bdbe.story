Last April, US Bank CEO Andrew Cecere won praise from Indigenous and climate advocates when he promised shareholders that US Bank would stop lending to oil and gas pipelines. Unlike US Bank, leading financial institutions are withdrawing from the oil and gas industry. ING and DNB banks have both upheld their commitments to cut ties with ETP. Then in December, the World Bank announced that it would end all financing to oil and gas extraction by 2019.
