I put on my teacher hat and tried to explain: Responsible citizenship does not mean wait and see. Responsible citizenship means listening to your elected leaders and taking what they say seriously. It means examining proposed policy from multiple angles and when your leaders propose things that concern you, you speak up and voice your concerns. It means that when you feel that people will be harmed by a proposed course of action you raise your voice to see if the course of action can be altered or improved to avoid causing as much harm. It means reaching out to your elected representatives and communicating your concerns so they can best represent their constituents. This, you would think, is a fairly non-partisan statement. A statement about civic participation that is as applicable to Republicans under a Democratic President as it is to Democrats under a Republican president. I was stunned, but more I was disappointed. They were canned talking points being hurled with venom at the notion that civic participation in government is important. So, to the person who says we should wait and see, I give you the same challenge I left my student with: I challenge you to be better. I challenge you to engage with political opponents thoughtfully and with nuance rather than canned talking points. I challenge you to engage in cooperative dialogue rather than defiant and oppositional dialogue. To the person who says we should wait and see: No. We should not be passive, we should be active and involved. Not blindly, not dogmatically, but rather as mutual participants with the shared goal of doing right by our citizens, our allies, and our partners around the world. Listen, pay attention, examine things critically and participate in charting the course our nation takes forward from this moment. Class dismissed.
