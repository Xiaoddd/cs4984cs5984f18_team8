Art Show Was the Backdrop for a Major Discussion About the Future of Standing Rock Alicia Eler EXPAND Dave Archambault II, Jane Fonda and Bruce Kapsan spoke at the first public conversation in Los Angeles about the Dakota Access Pipeline. On a recent Thursday afternoon in West Hollywood, the Depart Foundation hosted the first public discussion in Los Angeles with Standing Rock Sioux tribal chairman Dave Archambault II, Jane Fonda, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Bruce Kapson and moderator Jon Christensen, about DAPL's impact. The talk took place at a serendipitous time of waiting and wondering: After more than nine months of protests, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers halted construction on Dec. 4 to conduct an environmental impact review, determining if there was a way to not cross the Missouri River. DAPL has created a stir nationally and globally, raising awareness about the convergence of corporations, financial institutions and the government, all while the 2016 election was heating up. DAPL is also just another indication of the colonial mindset and the continual, 500-year genocide carried out against Native Americans. The U.S. government violated treaties with the Sioux in 1825, 1837, 1851 and 1868; this was unfortunately no different yet still completely questionable. In total, 300 American tribes gathered to protest the illegal construction, and the number of protesters reached into the thousands. Just before the decision to halt, protesters were joined by 2,000 U.S. veterans of wars in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. On this chilly afternoon in L.A., his message was about the bigger environmental disaster facing not just America but the world. Kennedy, president of the Waterkeeper Alliance, has always been firmly against the pipeline and the fossil fuel industry at large. The company building DAPL, Energy Transfer Partners (which works with Sunoco Logistics), has an extremely anti-environmental history. Kennedy called for an immediate need to shift to green energy, which he believes is the only possibility for sustaining life on Earth as we know it. The pipeline will not create new jobs, as many pro-pipeline people have stated. In fact, the pipeline will create around 35 new jobs, all of them maintenance and operational. If there were ever a pipeline more symbolic of the corporate plutocracy, we've yet to see it. And it's threatening the basics needed to sustain human life. On the brink of this catastrophe, however, Archambault emphasized the power and importance of prayer in addition to the actions being taken against DAPL. The struggle has not been easy, especially with what seemed like the odds stacked against the tribe. Many representatives from Native tribes showed up for the panel, including Standing Rock Sioux historian LaDonna Brave Bull Allard. She is the direct descendent of survivors of the historic Whitestone Massacre, which occurred in 1863 when the U.S. Army killed more than 300 Sioux. Her grandmother, then a 9-year-old child, was shot in the leg but not killed by one of the soldiers, who spared her life. When Allard was approached about opening up her land as a camp during the protest, she agreed and allowed people to stay at Sacred Stone Camp. Everyone who went out to Standing Rock played a different part. Some, like actress Jane Fonda, came in late November with 2,700 pounds of bison meat for use in a Wopila Feast to thank the water protectors for their courage, and for defending the planet. Fonda, who has been outspoken about DAPL and has been involved with and supporting Native rights since the late 1960s, when she supported the Alcatraz Island occupations, went out to Standing Rock as part of a delegation of 50 people. Aside from the discussions about the deeper meaning and impact of the Standing Rock protests, Fonda took it back to the underlying problem: the banks funding the pipeline. One way to combat that, she explained, is to simply take your money out of the bank. Curated by Bruce Kapson, who also joined the panel, the exihibit offered a glimpse into what Archambault had been saying all along: This was just part of the long cycle of genocide against Native people.
