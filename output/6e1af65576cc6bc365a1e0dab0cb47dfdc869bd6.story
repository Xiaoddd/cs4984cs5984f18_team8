The Obama administration dragged out the protests by delaying and then revoking a previously issued easement allowing the final 1,100 feet of the 1,172-mile pipeline to run on the federally managed property under Lake Oahe. The North Dakota lawmakers are likely to receive a friendlier reception under Mr. Trump, who issued a memorandum in January to expedite the pipeline review process, than under President Obama, who offered little in the way of federal assistance despite repeated pleas by state officials. However, tribal chairman Dave Archambault II later urged the activists to leave as accumulated trash and debris threatened to wash into the Cannonball River during the spring melt. The last of the camps on federal property was cleared in late February under federal and state evacuation orders, allowing the Army Corps to finish a clean-up job that saw the removal of 21.48 million pounds of garbage from the floodplain. Starting Aug. 10, officers made 761 arrests, only 6.7 percent of which involved North Dakota residents, the rest coming from 47 other states and four countries. Protesters accused law enforcement of engaging in police brutality by deploying tear gas, beanbag rounds, rubber bullets and water hoses against activists, while activists set fires and threw rocks, feces, frozen water bottles and Molotov cocktails at police. The Dakota Access protest has since inspired similar protest camps in at least a half-dozen states as activists attempt to block other pipeline projects. Click here for reprint permission.
