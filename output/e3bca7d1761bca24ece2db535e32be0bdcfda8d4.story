Law enforcement may try to disperse water protectors with unnecessary and dangerous use of force. Call North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and urge him to do everything in his power to remove the road blockade and prevent police violence against Standing Rock water protectors. We teamed up with Amnesty International, CREDO Action, and National Council of Jewish Women in December 2016 to deliver your demand that the Justice Department investigate possible constitutional and federal law violations by law enforcement at the Dakota Access pipeline. Right now on a North Dakota prairie, nonviolent protesters are being confronted by police in riot gear with armored military vehicles, automatic rifles, sonic weapons, concussion grenades, attack dogs, pepper spray, and beanbag bullets. But law enforcement agencies are treating them like wartime enemies. Riot police raiding a protest camp even yanked indigenous people from prayer in sweat lodges. On top of that, more than a half dozen states have sent equipment and officers to North Dakota. The Department of Justice can help stop this militarized response to indigenous activists and their allies fighting for clean water. Thousands from across the globe have joined in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The pipeline could destroy ancestral burial grounds and poison the water supply for an entire sovereign nation and millions of Americans downstream who rely on the Missouri River. Join us and petition partner National Council of Jewish Women and tell the DOJ to investigate possible constitutional violations and suspend police use of federally supplied military equipment. These tribal communities and the allied activists should not be treated like enemies in war. Investigate possible federal law breaches and constitutional violations of the rights of nonviolent protesters by law enforcement around the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. Pending the outcome of investigations, immediately suspend law enforcement use of any federally resourced military weapons and equipment.
