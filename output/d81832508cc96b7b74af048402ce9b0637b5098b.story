Critics claim that the project violates the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie, and activists are concerned that the pipeline poses a serious threat to the water supply of millions, particularly the indigenous people of Standing Rock. After white citizens had protested the original pipeline route, also over concerns that their water supply would be contaminated, Energy Transfer Partners adjusted the planned pipeline project. Instead of running just north of Bismarck, the pipeline would be rerouted through the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers recognizes the danger that the pipeline poses to the water supply, leaders of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe claim the reroute was approved without the federally mandated tribal consultation. Since the approval of the rerouted pipeline in late July, the local Standing Rock Sioux, along with thousands of supporters, have held nonviolent protests and prayer circles near Standing Rock in an attempt to block construction. From hired guards with attack dogs, to a militarized police force firing on protesters with rubber bullets, tear gas, and water cannons in frigid weather, human rights appear to have been blatantly and repeatedly violated without any serious repercussions. In late Oct, police in riot gear used tanks, armored vehicles, pepper spray, and a sound cannon to attack, arrest, and lock nonviolent activists in dog kennels. However, according to the Guardian, authorities are making every effort to escalate the situation to justify further repression. From sending supplies to helping cover legal fees, the water protectors can always use more resources. Solidarity Events Organize and take part in local events. Public interest makes it more difficult for elected officials and media outlets to ignore this issue. Currently, over 2000 veterans have signed up to peacefully protest alongside the water protectors. Anyone willing to risk arrest, deliver supplies, chop wood, and help prepare food is welcome at Standing Rock. Nurses, medics, and others with experience in healthcare are especially needed. Also, since the weather conditions in North Dakota at this time of year can be harsh, please pack proper gear. For many people, donating money or supplies may be a better way to contribute to this cause. Contact the White House and remind President Obama that this issue will play a huge role in shaping his legacy. Tell North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple to stop government suppression of the right to protest. Break up with Big Banks Seventeen banks are directly funding the Dakota Access Pipeline. If your bank is one of them, close your account and let them know why. Some protesters, not content to merely close their accounts, have also taken to holding local, nonviolent protests at pipeline-supporting banks.
