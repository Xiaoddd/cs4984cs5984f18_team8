It is hard to imagine how, in such a short time, an elected president could reveal how truly bad he is; how ignorant, insensitive, mendacious, dysfunctional, self-centered, and at times borderline psychotic. But it's also important to check in on public opinion, or rather media opinion, to contextualize Trump's horrific standing. Trump was also number one in 2016, which kind of says it all. SPONSORED Trump's most serious competition for most hated person alive is Martin Shkreli, who is high on most lists of people the public loathes. Shkreli, the former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, earned the ire of millions of Americans by hiking the price for the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim by 5,000 percent. He was also arrested for fraud. Others who find their way onto various most-hated lists are child molester Jared Fogle, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian (both as a couple and when measured separately), O.J. Simpson, Casey Anthony, Bernie Madoff, Michael Moore, Mel Gibson, and Tiger Woods. And some of the worst dead people in history consistently show up on these kinds of lists: Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Osama bin Laden to name a few. In the end, Trump triumphs as the most despised man alive today in America, and probably the world. He has appointed a government of plutocrats, mostly mirroring his own unfitness for office, who appear determined to dismantle the institutions that have made this country humane, strong, prosperous, and respected. They cannot make America great again. Instead of accountability or transparency, ideas or innovation, you get a commander-in-chief whose most salient traits are narcissistic self-interest, hypersensitivity to criticism and a knee-jerk tendency toward abuse. His intellectual interests would not fill a safe-deposit box at Trump Tower. This is a man who likes to strut and gloat. It seeks to achieve dominance through a whirlwind of individually meaningless but cumulatively manipulative statements. To his credit, much like his racism, his xenophobia, his sexism, his narcissism, his creepy obsession with his daughter and his insecurities, 45 has not been shy about sharing his laziness with the world. And according to Uhlmann, we all need to give up on any hope that the speeches written for Trump and delivered by the man himself are any reflection of his true thoughts. His vulgarity was unstoppable and without limit. We're dealing with a man who literally thinks exercising too much is bad because your body has a finite amount of energy. Then again, maybe the rudimentary practices of government are simply beyond him. The President is served Diet Coke at lunch while his guests get only water; the President gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream, his guests one. A regular visitor to the White House told me that leaks about the President shouting at his senior staff were true. Donald Trump is the con man huckster of all time, and in his sway are the many descendants of those suckers who back in the day provided a steady livelihood for good old P.T. Barnum did it for fun and profit; Trump out of malice, a desperate need for attention and most important to the country, the desire to divert attention from the fact that in less than six months his administration has flamed out in many spectacular ways, while at the same time effectively wrought havoc with representative democracy and government. If he were writing The Art of the Deal today, Schwartz said, it would be a very different book with a very different title.
