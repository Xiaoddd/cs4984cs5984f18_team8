And yet those, too, have been targeted by the government. The TFR applies only to civilians; law enforcement helicopters and aircraft buzz over protesters with impunity. Many of the videos have thousands of views on YouTube and millions of people have seen them on Facebook. A Native American from Nevada, Dewey went to Standing Rock because he wanted to stand up for indigenous rights after seeing mining destroy native lands near his home. The pilots burn through batteries at an astonishing rate, and spotty 4G signal limits where the pilots can livestream from. Violating it is a felony. A percussion grenade at another. We're on drone number eight. Soon after, it petitioned the FAA for the TFR, which extends until at least Friday (in the past, TFRs have been immediately renewed after they expire). In that case, the helicopter followed me. The Morton County Sheriff's Department did not respond to a voicemail or text message I left its public information officer. I made four phone calls to two phone numbers given to me by a secretary in the department's main office, none were answered. Rather than attempt to find a balance between the First Amendment and safety, it has repeatedly erred on the side of censorship. In theory, it shouldn't matter whether the journalist is part of the protest or is part of a traditional mainstream media company. To start, they would file a temporary restraining order seeking to stay the TFR, and then there would be a court proceeding. The drones will continue to fly. We've called the FAA and said it's very important we get an exception. They have told us their hands are tied. Yes we do. Because it's our right. journalists are documenting human rights abuses in North Dakota. And yet those, too, have been targeted by the government.

A no fly zone enacted by the FAA violates the First Amendment, experts say. They have shown people being knocked backward with a constant barrage of water being shot from fire hoses. They've shown a line of body armor-clad cops aiming guns at unarmed water protectors holding their hands high above their heads. Another video, shot at night, shows that construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline continues under the cover of darkness. In recent weeks, Dakota Access Pipeline protesters have been tear gassed, sprayed with water cannons in freezing temperatures, and shot with rubber bullets by a police force using military-style vehicles and violent riot suppression tactics. These drone-shot videos have been invaluable in recording these abuses. And yet those, too, have been targeted by the government. The Federal Aviation Administration has set up a Temporary Flight Restriction over a four-mile radius surrounding the Standing Rock protests. The TFR applies only to civilians; law enforcement helicopters and aircraft buzz over protesters with impunity. Experts say the no fly zone is a blatant violation of the First Amendment that has normalized a chilling precedent set by the FAA during the 2014 protests in Ferguson following the police killing of Mike Brown. By any definition of the word, the drone pilots documenting the Dakota Access Pipeline protests are conducting journalism. Many of the videos have thousands of views on YouTube and millions of people have seen them on Facebook. Digital Smoke Signals Image: Digital Smoke Signals Since August, Myron Dewey has been flying drones above Standing Rock. A Native American from Nevada, Dewey went to Standing Rock because he wanted to stand up for indigenous rights after seeing mining destroy native lands near his home. He and a person called Dr0ne2bwild have been the main drone journalists documenting the protests and the law enforcement response to it. The drone footage has given the public a general sense of the scale and tenor of the protests. Dewey said numerous water protectors who have been arrested have had their charges dropped based on the footage his drones have taken, and thousands of people have watched as law enforcement have used military-style tactics to suppress the protesters. Flying drones in rural North Dakota in November has been difficult. The pilots burn through batteries at an astonishing rate, and spotty 4G signal limits where the pilots can livestream from. Most concerning, videos show that the law enforcement regularly shoot at them, which is a violation of a federal law that prevents anyone from firing on civil aircraft in US airspace. Violating it is a felony. A percussion grenade at another. We're on drone number eight. Soon after, it petitioned the FAA for the TFR, which extends until at least Friday (in the past, TFRs have been immediately renewed after they expire). In that case, the helicopter followed me. The Morton County Sheriff's Department did not respond to a voicemail or text message I left its public information officer. I made four phone calls to two phone numbers given to me by a secretary in the department's main office, none were answered. The FAA has been placed in an odd position for an agency whose primary job has been making sure planes don't crash into each other. Rather than attempt to find a balance between the First Amendment and safety, it has repeatedly erred on the side of censorship. In theory, it shouldn't matter whether the journalist is part of the protest or is part of a traditional mainstream media company. Gutterman says in order to challenge the no fly zone, journalists would have to sue the FAA in federal court to have the TFR lifted as an emergency maneuver. To start, they would file a temporary restraining order seeking to stay the TFR, and then there would be a court proceeding. Dewey says it's simply unfeasible to get FAA approval for flights documenting abuses. The drones will continue to fly. We've called the FAA and said it's very important we get an exception.
