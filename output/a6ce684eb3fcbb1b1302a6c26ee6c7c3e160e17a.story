The three companies are partial owners of the pipeline. Thousands of people traveled to encampments established near the site of the proposed river crossing in North Dakota. In addition to the protest encampments, opponents of the pipeline have waged divestment campaigns against the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners. Using the slogan Defund DAPL, activists have also urged individuals and institutions to move money out of banks that are financing pipeline construction, including Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Victories thus far include the decisions by a Norwegian bank, DNB, and the Norwegian mutual fund Odin Fund Management to sell their shares in companies connected to the pipeline last November. Other cities are considering similar moves. On Tuesday, the indigenous activist Jackie Fielder helped lead a protest at the San Francisco board of supervisors, which she is hoping to persuade to divest from DAPL-connected banks. Smith said Storeband had worked for months to attempt to influence the pipeline route, with no success. The divestment campaign is gaining steam as the hope of stopping the pipeline dwindles. Construction recommenced on 9 February. According to court filings, the pipeline will be complete and ready to transport oil between 6 March and 1 April. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe is continuing to fight the pipeline through a federal lawsuit.
