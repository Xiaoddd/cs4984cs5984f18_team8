The individuals Chariton spoke to believed that the protesters were wasting their time and were merely interested in raising a fuss rather than standing up for the issues. They felt that their protest lacked direction and a clear message. To be clear, the individuals that Chariton interviewed are not stupid or uneducated, they are merely misinformed by a local media with an agenda. This is the sort of thing we need to be paying attention to, both in regards to NoDAPL and the wider conversation about media and politics. Thank you, Chariton, for trying something different in a sea of uniformity in reporting. Watch.
