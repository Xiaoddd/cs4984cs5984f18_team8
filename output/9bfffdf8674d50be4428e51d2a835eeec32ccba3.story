The previous day, President Trump had dined with Democratic leaders at the White House, and had impetuously agreed to a major policy reversal, granting provisional residency to undocumented immigrants who came to America as children. Republican legislators were blindsided. Within hours, Trump disavowed the deal, then reaffirmed it. Pence, who has dutifully stood by the President, mustering a devotional gaze rarely seen since the days of Nancy Reagan, serves as a daily reminder that the Constitution offers an alternative to Trump. The worse the President looks, the more desirable his understudy seems. Of his forty-seven predecessors, nine eventually assumed the Presidency, because of a death or a resignation. If the job is a gamble for Pence, he himself is something of a gamble for the country. During the tumultuous 2016 Presidential campaign, relatively little attention was paid to how Pence was chosen, or to his political record. Newt Gingrich told me recently that the three people with the most policy influence in the Administration are Trump, Chief of Staff John Kelly, and Pence. But look at the schedule. Pence has lunches with the President. Even so, they are almost comically mismatched. Trump campaigned as an unorthodox outsider, but Pence is a doctrinaire ideologue. Pence leans so far to the right that he has occasionally echoed A.C.L.U. arguments against government overreach; he has, for instance, supported a federal shield law that would protect journalists from having to identify whistle-blowers. But Pence has the political experience, the connections, the discipline, and the ideological mooring that Trump lacks. Pence is the inside man of the conservative money machine. A.C.S. was notorious for outsourcing U.S. office work to cheaper foreign-labor markets. Trump campaigned against outsourcing, but the Deasons became Trump backers nonetheless, donating a million dollars to his campaign. Doug Deason was enlisted, in part, by Pence, whom he had known and supported for years. Since the election, Deason has attended two dinners for wealthy backers at the Vice-Presidential residence. Among the billionaires who gathered in the room at the Hilton, Deason recalled, were the financier Wilbur Ross, whom Trump later appointed his Secretary of Commerce; the corporate investor Carl Icahn, who became a top adviser to Trump but resigned eight months later, when allegations of financial impropriety were published by The New Yorker; Harold Hamm, the founder and chairman of Continental Resources, an Oklahoma-based oil-and-gas company that has made billions of dollars through fracking; and David Koch, the richest resident of New York City. He and his brother Charles are libertarians who object to most government spending, including investments in infrastructure. Bannon is equally alarmed at the prospect of a Pence Presidency. Eighty-four and energetic, Fritsch met me for coffee this summer, along with her eldest son, Gregory, who is in the antiques business in the Columbus area. Like the Vice-President, they are good-looking, with chiselled features, and have an unpretentious, amiable manner. All the boys had nicknames. The family identifies as Catholic, and Mike was an altar boy. Brief mentions of Edward in the press have described him as having worked in the Chicago stockyards, leaving the impression that he was poor. But Gregory told me that Edward was well off, with a seat on the Chicago Stock Exchange. Fritsch went to secretarial school. A Korean War veteran, Edward Pence, Jr., was in uniform that night. In 1959, after leaving law school, he moved with Fritsch from Chicago to Columbus, where he sold fuel to gas stations, farms, and convenience stores. Edward, Jr., like his father, was a tough disciplinarian. He expected his children to stand up whenever an adult entered the room. At dinner, the kids were forbidden to speak. While Gregory was in college, he was sleeping late on a visit home when his father pulled the covers off him and told him to get up for church. His father stopped paying his tuition altogether. Columbus, which has a population of forty-five thousand, was dominated by a major engine manufacturer, Cummins, and escaped the economic woes that afflicted many other parts of the region. Protestant kids had thrown stones at him, he recalled. The Pence children attended St. Columba Catholic School through eighth grade. Mike discovered a talent for public speaking that made him a favorite with the nuns. In fifth grade, he won a local oratory contest, defeating kids several years older. In high school, Pence won third place in a national contest. Nonetheless, by senior year, Mike was talking to classmates about becoming President of the United States. Mike Pence attended Hanover College, a liberal-arts school in southeast Indiana. On a visit home, he told his father that he was thinking of either joining the priesthood or attending law school. His father suggested he start with law; he could always join the priesthood later. His conversion was part of a larger movement. Pence voted for Jimmy Carter in 1980, but he soon joined the march of many Christians toward the Republican Party. Weyrich condemned homosexuality, feminism, abortion, and government-imposed racial integration, and he partnered with some controversial figures, including Laszlo Pasztor, a former member of a pro-Nazi party in Hungary. While in law school, at Indiana University, Pence met and married Karen Batten, a schoolteacher whom he had noticed playing guitar in a church service. Pence took her ice-skating; she made him taco salad for dinner. They shellacked the loaf. The couple became almost inseparable. As the Washington Post reported, he kept it on his office desk long after the advent of cell phones. At home, they worked out on twin treadmills. Critics have argued that this approach reduces women to sexual temptresses and precludes men from working with women on an equal basis. He drew a blank. But after Mike entered the race Edward became his biggest booster, helping him raise money and put up lawn signs. Then, just a few weeks before the Republican primary, Edward, who was fifty-eight, had a heart attack and died. In 1990, Pence tried and failed again to unseat Sharp, waging a campaign that is remembered as especially nasty. One ad featured an actor dressed in Middle Eastern garb and sunglasses, who accused Sharp, falsely, of being a tool of Arab oil interests. There was a clear hierarchy in the Indianapolis legal world, and Pence was far from its top rungs, relying on referrals for work. Pence was thrown a lifeline in 1991, when he was offered a job as president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, a tiny new think tank that promoted free-market policies. But the early funders of the Heritage Foundation included some Fortune 500 companies, in fields such as oil, chemicals, and tobacco, that opposed health, safety, and environmental regulations. In the early nineties, he joined the board of the Indiana Family Institute, a far-right group that supported the criminalization of abortion and campaigned against equal rights for homosexuals. And, while Pence ran the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, it published an essay arguing that unmarried women should be denied access to birth control. In 2012, after serving twenty-eight years in the legislature, she ran for lieutenant governor on a ticket with the gubernatorial candidate John R. Gregg, who lost the election to Pence. In 1992, he became a host on conservative talk radio, which had been booming since the F.C.C., in 1987, repealed the Fairness Doctrine and stopped requiring broadcasters to provide all sides of controversial issues. At a time when bombastic, angry voices proliferated, Pence was different. Like Reagan, who had become his political hero, he could present even extreme positions in genial, nonthreatening terms. In 1994, Pence was on eighteen Emmis stations, five days a week. He won, by a twelve-point margin. Pence was in demand on the conservative speaking circuit, and frequently appeared on Sunday talk shows. Michael Leppert, a Democratic lobbyist in Indiana, saw Pence differently. Pence served twelve years in Congress, but never authored a single successful bill. In 2006, Pence boldly challenged the House Minority Leader at the time, John Boehner, a more centrist Republican from Ohio, for his post. The chair presides over weekly meetings in which Republican House members discuss policy and legislative goals. After Barack Obama was elected President, Pence became an early voice of the Tea Party movement, which opposed taxes and government spending with an angry edge. In 2011, he made the evening news by threatening to shut down the federal government unless it defunded Planned Parenthood. His radicalism, however, only boosted his national profile. Pence became best known for fiercely opposing abortion. He sponsored an unsuccessful amendment to the Affordable Care Act that would have made it legal for government-funded hospitals to turn away a dying woman who needed an abortion. (Later, as governor of Indiana, he signed a bill barring women from aborting a physically abnormal fetus; the bill also required fetal burial or cremation, including after a miscarriage. It guides him. According to Scott Peterson, the executive director of the Checks & Balances Project, a watchdog group that monitors attempts to influence environmental policy, Pence was invited to the Koch seminar only after he did the brothers a major political favor. By the spring of 2009, Koch Industries, like other fossil-fuel companies, felt threatened by growing support in Congress for curbing carbon emissions, the primary cause of climate change. At first, the campaign languished, attracting only fourteen signatures. If the bill were enacted, the costs could be catastrophic to Koch Industries, which releases some twenty-four million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year, and owns millions of acres of untapped oil reserves in Canada, plus coal-fired power plants and oil refineries. He not only signed their pledge but urged others to do so as well. His language echoed that of the Koch groups. The cap-and-trade bill died in the Senate. In any event, the pledge marked a pivotal turn in the climate-change debate, cementing Republican opposition to addressing the environmental crisis. But the House of Representatives is a tough platform from which to get elected President. And so, in 2012, after mulling over his national prospects, Pence ran instead for governor of Indiana. David Koch contributed two hundred thousand dollars. It served as a dark-money bank, enabling donors to stay anonymous while distributing funds to favored campaigns and political organizations. But after he was elected he began taking controversial far-right stands that, critics believed, were geared more toward building his national profile than toward serving Indiana voters. At first, Pence highlighted fiscal conservatism. In 2013, he proposed cutting the state income tax. Indiana Republicans, who had majorities in both legislative chambers, initially balked at the tax cut, deeming it irresponsible. The state recently had to increase its gas tax by ten cents per gallon, to repair its crumbling infrastructure. In a few surprising instances, Pence veered from conservative orthodoxy. In 2014, he broke with many other Republican governors and agreed to expand Medicaid in Indiana. Nevertheless, Pence negotiated with the Obama Administration and established waivers that made the expansion acceptable to him. Critics argued that such measures were needlessly punitive toward poor residents. But the Medicaid-expansion plan was, and remains, popular in the state. After this apostasy, Pence tilted back toward the right. At the last minute, he killed an application for an eighty-million-dollar federal grant to start a statewide preschool program. Eventually, after widespread criticism, Pence reapplied for the grant. Political handicappers noticed that Pence was spending a lot of time taking trips to states with important Presidential primaries and mingling with big out-of-state donors. In the summer of 2014, Pence spoke at an Americans for Prosperity summit in Dallas. That fall, Pence reached out to Nick Ayers, a young, sharp-elbowed political consultant, to see if he would help him in a 2016 Presidential run. Nothing came of it, but Pence clearly had White House ambitions. In the spring of 2015, Pence signed a bill called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which he presented as innocuous. Oesterle recalled. But then a photograph of the closed signing session surfaced. It showed Pence surrounded by monks and nuns, along with three of the most virulently anti-gay activists in the state. The image went viral. Indiana residents began examining the law more closely, and discovered that it essentially legalized discrimination against homosexuals by businesses in the state. In his view, Pence should have prevented it and other extreme bills from moving forward. The outcry over the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was enormous. Gay-rights groups condemned the bill and urged boycotts of the state. Pete Buttigieg, the young gay mayor of South Bend, who is a rising figure in the Democratic Party, told me that he tried to talk to Pence about the legislation, which he felt would cause major economic damage to Indiana. In an effort to quell criticism, Pence consented, against the advice of his staff, to be interviewed by George Stephanopoulos on his Sunday-morning show on ABC. Stephanopoulos asked him five times if it was now legal in Indiana for businesses to discriminate against homosexuals, and each time Pence was evasive. Pence also sidestepped when Stephanopoulos asked him if he personally supported discrimination against gays. Smulyan, the broadcasting executive, began getting calls from acquaintances all over the country, asking what was wrong with Indiana. Companies began cancelling conventions, and threatening to reverse plans to expand in the state. The Indiana business community foresaw millions of dollars in losses. When the N.C.A.A., which is based in Indianapolis, declared its opposition to the legislation, the pressure became intolerable. Even the Republican establishment turned on Pence. Within days, the legislature had pushed through a less discriminatory version of the bill, and Pence signed it, before hastily leaving town for the weekend. His polls were terrible. But he went from being a likely loser as an incumbent governor to Vice-President of the United States. Pence loyalists rushed in to help. Ayers, the political operative whom Pence had consulted in 2011 about a Presidential run, became an outside adviser. The state also signed a seven-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar contract with a public-relations firm, Porter Novelli, which proposed running ads featuring gay and lesbian couples posing in front of Indiana landmarks. In 2015, Ed Clere, a Republican state legislator who chaired the House Committee on Public Health, became aware of a spike in the number of H.I.V. cases in southern Indiana. The problem appeared to be caused by the sharing of needles among opioid abusers in Scott County, which sits across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky. Now they were getting up to twenty a week. The area was poor, and woefully unprepared for a health crisis. But conservatives blocked the idea, and Pence threatened to veto any such legislation. In March, 2015, Clere staged a huge public hearing, in which dozens of experts and sufferers testified about the crisis. Caught flat-footed, Pence scheduled his own event, where he announced that he would pray about the syringe-exchange issue. The next day, he said that he supported allowing an exchange program as an emergency measure, but only on a temporary basis and only in Scott County, with no state funding. After Scott County implemented the syringe exchange, the number of new H.I.V. cases fell. But Republican leaders later stripped Clere of his committee chairmanship, a highly unusual event. Clere remains bitter about Pence. After the November, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris, Pence, like several other U.S. governors, issued a controversial executive order barring the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the state. The Archdiocese of Indiana had long been deeply involved in resettling refugees, including Syrians, and was about to welcome a new Syrian family. Tobin, who has since been elevated to cardinal and become the archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, told me that he emphasized to Pence that the Syrian family was fleeing violence and terror, and had been vetted for nearly two years while living in a Jordanian refugee camp. He also explained that the family had relatives in the area. Tobin brought along a former refugee who now had a good job at an Indiana hotel, as an example of how successful the resettlement process was. Tobin is revered in the Catholic community of Indiana in which Pence grew up. Later that week, the Syrian family was sent to Connecticut. I asked Cardinal Tobin if there was a Christian argument in support of turning the refugees away. He was released in 2006, but on the condition that he admit guilt, which made it impossible for him to get a decent job. The prosecutor and the Indiana Parole Board, citing DNA evidence and victim recantations, urged Governor Pence to pardon him immediately. But Pence dragged out the process for years. Pence finally left the decision to his successor, Governor Eric Holcomb, who is also a Republican. Holcomb granted Cooper a pardon within weeks of taking office. It was the first time in Indiana that a pardon was granted on the basis of innocence, rather than clemency. Cooper, who was operating a forklift at the time, now cares for his grandchildren. He has become friendly with the robbery victims who mistakenly identified him in a police lineup; they supported his bid for a pardon. He wrote a letter. They saw that justice happened. He hates Muslims, he hates gay people, and he hates minorities. A spokesman for Pence, who declined to be quoted, said Pence believed that Cooper needed to go back to court and face a retrial, instead of seeking a pardon. Pence, seeing his poll numbers plummet, gave up on running for President, and decided to seek a second term as governor. Victory was far from assured. Once again, he faced John Gregg, a folksy Democratic lawyer. In the spring of 2016, polls showed the two in a dead heat. The national election, meanwhile, was confounding expectations. As Trump picked up momentum in the Republican primaries, the Koch network became unexpectedly paralyzed. Marc Short pressed the brothers to dedicate their resources to stopping Trump and promoting his rivals. But executives at Koch Industries considered the strategy risky, and the brothers stayed out of the Presidential race. The Indiana primary was on May 3rd. The previous month, Ted Cruz had trounced Trump in Wisconsin, but if Trump could win decisively in Indiana he was virtually certain to secure the nomination. Hilbert had built an insurance empire, Conseco, which had been valued at fifty-two billion dollars before collapsing into bankruptcy. In 1998, Hilbert loaned Trump money to buy the General Motors Building, and they had remained friends. As governor, he proclaimed his opposition to any expansion of the gaming industry, but, though the state had banned political contributions from casino operators, cash had flowed generously to him from such sources, through indirect paths. An L.L.C. connected to Centaur contributed two hundred thousand dollars to the R.G.A. that year. The casino operator Sheldon Adelson contributed a million dollars. But the single largest donor to the R.G.A. in 2016 was Koch Industries, which contributed more than two million dollars. Trump handily won the Indiana primary. Pence, who had tepidly endorsed Ted Cruz, switched to Trump. In 2011, Pence had gone to Trump Tower in Manhattan, seeking a campaign donation. Pence reacted stiffly, and their conversation grew awkward. Trump gave Pence a small contribution, but the coarse New York billionaire and the prim Indiana evangelical appeared to be on different wavelengths. Nevertheless, in 2016, political insiders in Indiana began hearing that Pence would welcome a spot on the Trump ticket. Pence was seen as a bridge to Christian conservatives, an asset in the Midwest, and a connection to the powerful Koch network. Still, Trump remained wary. According to a former campaign aide, he was disapproving when he learned how little money Pence had. In 2016, according to a campaign-finance disclosure form, Pence had one bank account, which held less than fifteen thousand dollars. Trump came closer to picking Christie than is generally known. On July 11th, Christie appeared at a campaign event with Trump. The next day, Trump flew to Indiana to do a campaign event with Pence. They joined the Pences for dinner at an Indianapolis restaurant. The foursome emerged looking happy. Christie said. But Christie was left hanging for the next three days. Trump began leaning toward Pence. They both knew what it was about. But it was a gamble. He took out student loans for the kids. Some politicians in Indiana were surprised that Trump wanted to pick Pence, who was flailing as governor, and that Pence wanted to run with Trump. But that night, as CNN reported, Trump called his aides to see if he could back out of his decision. A few hours later, Trump announced Pence as his running mate. Several days later, at the Republican National Convention, Newt Gingrich, who had also been passed over for the Vice-Presidency, found himself backstage next to Trump while Pence was giving his acceptance speech. They urged Trump to pray. Pence exceeded expectations in the Vice-Presidential debate, and traversed the Midwest tirelessly. The Kochs continued to withhold financial support from Trump, but Short, the former Koch operative, became a top adviser to Pence on the campaign. The Koch network gained even further sway after Trump won the Presidency. Three days after the election, Trump pushed aside Christie, who had been overseeing his transition team, and put Pence in charge, with Short as a top deputy. He was also superstitious, and during his campaign he had deflected discussions about post-election staffing, fearing that it would bring bad luck. Trump began to appoint an extraordinary number of officials with ties to the Kochs and to Pence, especially in positions that affected Koch Industries financially, such as those dealing with regulatory, environmental, and fiscal policy. Short, who a few months earlier had tried to enlist the Kochs to stop Trump, joined the White House as its director of legislative affairs. Scott Pruitt, the militantly anti-regulatory attorney general of Oklahoma, who had been heavily supported by the Kochs, was appointed director of the Environmental Protection Agency. Don McGahn, who had done legal work for Freedom Partners, became White House counsel. A recent analysis by the Checks & Balances Project found that sixteen high-ranking officials in the Trump White House had ties to the Kochs. Pence reportedly consulted with Charles Koch before hiring his speechwriter, Stephen Ford, who previously worked at Freedom Partners. Americans for Prosperity recently announced plans to spend four and a half million dollars on ads that will press three Democratic senators in red states to support the tax cuts. On September 25th, Trump dined at the White House with Tim Phillips, the head of Americans for Prosperity, along with Short and a handful of other conservative activists. After keeping a careful distance from one another during the campaign, Pence and the Kochs reunited openly for the first time on October 13th, when Pence attended a summit of Koch donors in New York. Before Pence took over the transition team, Christie had warned Trump not to give a high-level job to the retired general Michael Flynn, whose financial ties to foreign interests triggered the investigation. Christie considered him too risky. On November 11, 2016, Christie was chairing a transition meeting, when, according to four sources, Flynn walked in with an ally, General Keith Kellogg. Christie asked. Christie tried to reclaim control of the meeting, but Ivanka took over. Flynn expressed interest in becoming Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense. Eric Trump, who was also on the team, asked Flynn if he had been out of uniform long enough to head the Pentagon. A few hours later, Christie was deposed. Kushner, he felt, had humiliated him a second time. Bannon, who was given the job of dismissing him, admitted to Christie that Kushner had been against him all along, for personal reasons. In any event, when Pence replaced Christie, the door of the White House was opened to Flynn. But Cummings produced an e-mail from the transition staff acknowledging his letter and promising to review it carefully. It undoubtedly would have cost Pence to take a political stand against the worst instincts of Trump and his family. Pence soon delivered a series of misleading statements about Flynn. On January 15th, as questions about Russian manipulation of the election were mounting, Pence went on CBS and assured the public that, during the transition, Flynn had not discussed the topic of sanctions with the Russian Ambassador. But then the Washington Post reported that the Justice Department had wiretaps of Flynn doing just that. The Justice Department had informed the White House counsel about this well before Pence made his statement. On February 13th, Trump fired Flynn, ostensibly for deceiving Pence, who looked like either a liar or a chump. Pence has hired an outside lawyer, Richard Cullen, and has further strengthened his political armor by hiring Nick Ayers as his chief of staff. Unlike most Vice-Presidents, Pence has been given no particular portfolio of issues or projects. White House officials had miscalculated, believing that McCain was on their side. Before taking the job, Mondale got Carter to agree, in writing, that he could attend every meeting and see every memo that the President did. Mondale also requested that his office be moved from the Old Executive Office Building to the West Wing. Trump is known to humiliate subordinates, and Mondale noted that Trump often asks Pence to act as a master of ceremonies and introduce him at events, which Mondale finds demeaning. Pence readily complied when Trump asked him to stage a protest at an N.F.L. game in Indianapolis on October 8th, by leaving the stadium when some players refused to stand for the national anthem. The legal scholar had said that, if the Supreme Court did so, many states would likely legalize abortion on their own. At the White House, Pence has been hosting a Bible-study group for Cabinet officers, led by an evangelical pastor named Ralph Drollinger. Several Trump Cabinet officials have reportedly attended the Bible-study group, including DeVos, Pompeo, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Many Americans have debated whether the country would be better off with Pence as President. Newt Gingrich predicts that Pence will probably get a chance to do so.

Pence also sidestepped when Stephanopoulos asked him if he personally supported discrimination against gays. the broadcasting executive, began getting calls from acquaintances all over the country, asking what was wrong with Indiana. Companies began cancelling conventions, and threatening to reverse plans to expand in the state. The Indiana business community foresaw millions of dollars in losses. When the N.C.A.A., which is based in Indianapolis, declared its opposition to the legislation, the pressure became intolerable. Even the Republican establishment turned on Pence. days, the legislature had pushed through a less discriminatory version of the bill, and Pence signed it, before hastily leaving town for the weekend. His polls were terrible. But he went from being a likely loser as an incumbent governor to Vice-President of the United States. loyalists rushed in to help. Ayers, the political operative whom Pence had consulted in 2011 about a Presidential run, became an outside adviser. The state also signed a seven-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar contract with a public-relations firm, Porter Novelli, which proposed running ads featuring gay and lesbian couples posing in front of Indiana landmarks. 2015, Ed Clere, a Republican state legislator who chaired the House Committee on Public Health, became aware of a spike in the number of H.I.V. cases in southern Indiana. The problem appeared to be caused by the sharing of needles among opioid abusers in Scott County, which sits across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky. Now they were getting up to twenty a week. The area was poor, and woefully unprepared for a health crisis. conservatives blocked the idea, and Pence threatened to veto any such legislation. In March, 2015, Clere staged a huge public hearing, in which dozens of experts and sufferers testified about the crisis. Caught flat-footed, Pence scheduled his own event, where he announced that he would pray about the syringe-exchange issue. The next day, he said that he supported allowing an exchange program as an emergency measure, but only on a temporary basis and only in Scott County, with no state funding. After Scott County implemented the syringe exchange, the number of new H.I.V. cases fell. But Republican leaders later stripped Clere of his committee chairmanship, a highly unusual event. remains bitter about Pence. After the November, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris, Pence, like several other U.S. governors, issued a controversial executive order barring the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the state. The Archdiocese of Indiana had long been deeply involved in resettling refugees, including Syrians, and was about to welcome a new Syrian family. who has since been elevated to cardinal and become the archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, told me that he emphasized to Pence that the Syrian family was fleeing violence and terror, and had been vetted for nearly two years while living in a Jordanian refugee camp. He also explained that the family had relatives in the area. Tobin brought along a former refugee who now had a good job at an Indiana hotel, as an example of how successful the resettlement process was. Later that week, the Syrian family was sent to Connecticut. I asked Cardinal Tobin if there was a Christian argument in support of turning the refugees away. He was released in 2006, but on the condition that he admit guilt, which made it impossible for him to get a decent job. The prosecutor and the Indiana Parole Board, citing DNA evidence and victim recantations, urged Governor Pence to pardon him immediately. But Pence dragged out the process for years. Pence finally left the decision to his successor, Governor Eric Holcomb, who is also a Republican. Holcomb granted Cooper a pardon within weeks of taking office. Cooper, who was operating a forklift at the time, now cares for his grandchildren. He has become friendly with the robbery victims who mistakenly identified him in a police lineup; they supported his bid for a pardon. He wrote a letter. They saw that justice happened. He hates Muslims, he hates gay people, and he hates minorities. seeing his poll numbers plummet, gave up on running for President, and decided to seek a second term as governor. Victory was far from assured. Once again, he faced John Gregg, a folksy Democratic lawyer. national election, meanwhile, was confounding expectations. As Trump picked up momentum in the Republican primaries, the Koch network became unexpectedly paralyzed. Marc Short pressed the brothers to dedicate their resources to stopping Trump and promoting his rivals. But executives at Koch Industries considered the strategy risky, and the brothers stayed out of the Presidential race. Indiana primary was on May 3rd. The previous month, Ted Cruz had trounced Trump in Wisconsin, but if Trump could win decisively in Indiana he was virtually certain to secure the nomination. Hilbert had built an insurance empire, Conseco, which had been valued at fifty-two billion dollars before collapsing into bankruptcy. In 1998, Hilbert loaned Trump money to buy the General Motors Building, and they had remained friends. As governor, he proclaimed his opposition to any expansion of the gaming industry, but, though the state had banned political contributions from casino operators, cash had flowed generously to him from such sources, through indirect paths. An L.L.C. connected to Centaur contributed two hundred thousand dollars to the R.G.A. that year. The casino operator Sheldon Adelson contributed a million dollars. But the single largest donor to the R.G.A. in 2016 was Koch Industries, which contributed more than two million dollars. handily won the Indiana primary. In 2011, Pence had gone to Trump Tower in Manhattan, seeking a campaign donation. Pence reacted stiffly, and their conversation grew awkward. Pence was seen as a bridge to Christian conservatives, an asset in the Midwest, and a connection to the powerful Koch network. Trump remained wary. According to a former campaign aide, he was disapproving when he learned how little money Pence had. came closer to picking Christie than is generally known. On July 11th, Christie appeared at a campaign event with Trump. The next day, Trump flew to Indiana to do a campaign event with Pence. They joined the Pences for dinner at an Indianapolis restaurant. The foursome emerged looking happy. Christie was left hanging for the next three days. Trump began leaning toward Pence. They both knew what it was about. But it was a gamble. He took out student loans for the kids. Some politicians in Indiana were surprised that Trump wanted to pick Pence, who was flailing as governor, and that Pence wanted to run with Trump. But that night, as CNN reported, Trump called his aides to see if he could back out of his decision. days later, at the Republican National Convention, Newt Gingrich, who had also been passed over for the Vice-Presidency, found himself backstage next to Trump while Pence was giving his acceptance speech. They urged Trump to pray. exceeded expectations in the Vice-Presidential debate, and traversed the Midwest tirelessly. The Kochs continued to withhold financial support from Trump, but Short, the former Koch operative, became a top adviser to Pence on the campaign. Koch network gained even further sway after Trump won the Presidency. Three days after the election, Trump pushed aside Christie, who had been overseeing his transition team, and put Pence in charge, with Short as a top deputy. He was also superstitious, and during his campaign he had deflected discussions about post-election staffing, fearing that it would bring bad luck. began to appoint an extraordinary number of officials with ties to the Kochs and to Pence, especially in positions that affected Koch Industries financially, such as those dealing with regulatory, environmental, and fiscal policy. Short, who a few months earlier had tried to enlist the Kochs to stop Trump, joined the White House as its director of legislative affairs. Scott Pruitt, the militantly anti-regulatory attorney general of Oklahoma, who had been heavily supported by the Kochs, was appointed director of the Environmental Protection Agency. Don McGahn, who had done legal work for Freedom Partners, became White House counsel. A recent analysis by the Checks & Balances Project found that sixteen high-ranking officials in the Trump White House had ties to the Kochs. for Prosperity recently announced plans to spend four and a half million dollars on ads that will press three Democratic senators in red states to support the tax cuts. On September 25th, Trump dined at the White House with Tim Phillips, the head of Americans for Prosperity, along with Short and a handful of other conservative activists. After keeping a careful distance from one another during the campaign, Pence and the Kochs reunited openly for the first time on October 13th, when Pence attended a summit of Koch donors in New York. Before Pence took over the transition team, Christie had warned Trump not to give a high-level job to the retired general Michael Flynn, whose financial ties to foreign interests triggered the investigation. November 11, 2016, Christie was chairing a transition meeting, when, according to four sources, Flynn walked in with an ally, General Keith Kellogg. Christie asked. Christie tried to reclaim control of the meeting, but Ivanka took over. expressed interest in becoming Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense. Eric Trump, who was also on the team, asked Flynn if he had been out of uniform long enough to head the Pentagon. few hours later, Christie was deposed. Kushner, he felt, had humiliated him a second time. Bannon, who was given the job of dismissing him, admitted to Christie that Kushner had been against him all along, for personal reasons. In any event, when Pence replaced Christie, the door of the White House was opened to Flynn. But Cummings produced an e-mail from the transition staff acknowledging his letter and promising to review it carefully. soon delivered a series of misleading statements about Flynn. On January 15th, as questions about Russian manipulation of the election were mounting, Pence went on CBS and assured the public that, during the transition, Flynn had not discussed the topic of sanctions with the Russian Ambassador. The Justice Department had informed the White House counsel about this well before Pence made his statement. Pence has hired an outside lawyer, Richard Cullen, and has further strengthened his political armor by hiring Nick Ayers as his chief of staff. most Vice-Presidents, Pence has been given no particular portfolio of issues or projects. Before taking the job, Mondale got Carter to agree, in writing, that he could attend every meeting and see every memo that the President did. Mondale also requested that his office be moved from the Old Executive Office Building to the West Wing. Trump is known to humiliate subordinates, and Mondale noted that Trump often asks Pence to act as a master of ceremonies and introduce him at events, which Mondale finds demeaning. Pence readily complied when Trump asked him to stage a protest at an N.F.L. game in Indianapolis on October 8th, by leaving the stadium when some players refused to stand for the national anthem. The legal scholar had said that, if the Supreme Court did so, many states would likely legalize abortion on their own. At the White House, Pence has been hosting a Bible-study group for Cabinet officers, led by an evangelical pastor named Ralph Drollinger. Several Trump Cabinet officials have reportedly attended the Bible-study group, including DeVos, Pompeo, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Americans have debated whether the country would be better off with Pence as President. Newt Gingrich predicts that Pence will probably get a chance to do so. Pence has shown nothing but unconditional support for Trump. H. Koch in 1996. critics yearn for his exit. girlfriend, V, and I were finishing college, with a summer to burn before the next thing, and New York beckoned. V went to the city and signed a three-month lease on the apartment of a Columbia student, Bobby Atkins, who may have been the son of the creator of the Atkins Diet, or maybe we just enjoyed imagining that he was. His place, on the southwest corner of 110th Street and Amsterdam, had two small bedrooms and was irremediably filthy. In 1981, before full-scale gentrification, before mass incarceration, the city seemed starkly drawn in black and white. I was aesthetically attracted to cities but morbidly afraid of being shot. In New York, Amsterdam Avenue was a sharp dividing line, and I stood on the east side of it only once, when I made the mistake of riding a C train to 110th and walking home from there. It was late afternoon and nobody paid attention to me, but I was light-headed with fear. Deepening my impression of menace were the heavy, light-blocking security gates on our windows and the police lock in our entry hall, its steel rod anchored to the floor and angling up to a slot on the front door. I associated it with our next-door neighbor, an elderly white man with raging senile dementia. He would pound on our door or stand on the landing, wearing only pajama bottoms, and asseverate, over and over, using a vile epithet, that his wife was having relations with black men. theory, V and I were trying to write fiction, but I was oppressed by the summer heat and by the penitentiary gloom of the Atkins place, the cockroaches, the wandering neighbor. V and I fought, wept, made up, and played with our black panther. Conceivably my parents, despite their disapproval of New York and of my cohabitation with V, had given me some hundreds of dollars. my brother Tom was in New York that summer, doing a loft conversion for the hot-shot young photographer Gregory Heisler. But Heisler could see that Tom had all the know-how. Before long, the friend was sent back to Chicago, leaving Tom without a laborer. His loft was at the corner of Broadway and Houston, on the top floor of the Cable Building, then a den of sweatshops, later the home of the Angelika Theatre. Heisler wanted every surface in the apartment covered with a trendy gray plastic laminate whose little raised dots made edging it with a router a nightmare. main job was to fetch things. Every morning, Tom gave me a shopping list of construction staples and exotica, and I made the rounds of supply stores on the Bowery and Canal Street. East of the Bowery were the dangerous alphabet streets and the projects, a zone of no-go on my mental map of the island. Lower Broadway was peopled with garment workers, and the city below Canal seemed hung over from the seventies, as if the buildings were surprised to find themselves still standing. I started with black-bean soup and was a few spoonfuls into it when the beans seemed to come alive on my tongue, churning with a kind of malevolent aggression. I reached into my mouth and pulled out a narrow shard of glass. V flagged down our server and complained to him. The server summoned the manager, who apologized, examined the piece of glass, disappeared with it, and then came back to hustle us out of the restaurant. I was pressing a napkin to my tongue to stanch the bleeding. At the door, I asked if it was O.K. for me to keep the napkin. Eventually, a doctor told me that my cut would heal quickly and did not require stitches, but I had to wait a couple of hours to receive this information and a tetanus shot. Directly across from me, in one of the corridors where I waited, a young African-American woman was lying on a gurney with a gunshot wound in her bared abdomen. The wound was leaking pinkish fluid but was evidently not life-threatening. I had a personal connection with the Harlemites in my building, and after work I could go downtown and safely walk with my friends on the alphabet streets, which were being colonized by young white people. White power had reasserted itself through the pressure of real-estate prices and police action. In hindsight, the era of white fear seems most remarkable for having lasted as long as it did. Before I left the bank, I discreetly slipped the bills into one of my socks. In this memoir, the author chronicles her relentless quest for religious fulfillment, which leads her from a voodoo shrine in Louisiana to a Presbyterian church in Brooklyn. Culled from interviews with the subject, this compilation offers an amiable portrait of the influential gallerist, curator, and museum director. At the center of this linguistically and structurally complex novel are two siblings, one of whom is adopted, who are deeply in love. Rachel and Zachariah, both Russian, share parents and a mania for boxing. Rachel is a scholar of the sport; Zach is a frustrated fighter, benched by a clot in his brain. The couple invent a lengthy story about a boxer named Sam the Russian, which is written to create a lineage for Zach, an orphan. This roving, ambitious novel follows two sisters from Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, Liz, her anthropologist sister, travels to a remote fictional island in the Southeast Pacific, called New Ulster, to study an enigmatic cult. Laird, who grew up during the Troubles, is well acquainted with the gods and ghosts that populate Northern Ireland. filmmakers were standing outside the Jefferson Street subway station, their first return to Bushwick since they shot on location there in 2015. remarked on how the area was changing. Skirting new construction on Wyckoff Avenue, he nodded toward an orange Jaguar parked outside a natural-food store. Murnion and Milott started what-iffing military scenarios and pitched a movie. they crossed Cypress Avenue, they pointed to an alley. tour ended, as the movie does, at Grover Cleveland Playground. The final scene is a night skirmish amid the swings and jungle gyms. There was not one complaint. I remember a monstrous tangle of arms and legs and fists, with me at the bottom, gouging at eyes and doing my utmost to mangle throats, but I arrived at the facility without a scratch or a bruise. I must have been easy to subdue. was a county lockup, with its ground level devoted to the intake area and the offices and so on and, above that, two levels for inmates. They put me on the lower tier, among the rowdies and thugs. The air smelled like disinfectant and something else that was meant to be killed by disinfectant. The cells stayed open, and we were free to go in and out and congregate in the central area or stroll on the catwalk that girded the whole tier. This resulted in a lot of wandering around by as many as twenty men in denim pants and blue work shirts and rubber-soled canvas moccasins, a lot of pacing and stopping, and leaning and sitting, and getting up and pacing again. Most of us would have fit in perfectly in a psych ward. Many of us had already been there. The jailers called him Michael, but he referred to himself as Jocko, and the other prisoners did, too. Jocko hustled around all day looking for somebody to listen to his opinions or, even better, arm-wrestle him. He was not yet twenty-one. Jocko knew all the deputies and staff around the jailhouse. He lacked any ambition or strategy for crowning himself king of the cell block, but he was nevertheless a star, and the lesser lights constellated around him. first morning on the tier I did sleep through breakfast, and somebody did steal mine. Cornflakes for breakfast. Lunch: baloney on white. For dinner, one of the canned creations of Chef Boyardee, or, on lucky days, Dinty Moore. lunch most days, Jocko organized a poker game that worked as follows: hands of five-card draw would be dealt out and the draw accomplished, and the player with the highest hand got the privilege of slugging each of the others in the meat of his shoulder with such a smack it echoed around the metal environment. Only half a dozen prisoners took part. The rest of us could see that damage was being done. I kept to the farthest margins. I stood five-seven and weighed a hundred and twenty. guy I never heard addressed by any name. After his episodes he sat on the floor, rolling the back of his head from side to side against the steel rivets in the wall. The others watched him from a distance. It was that moment in the day when time itself grew outrageously lopsided, getting further and further from lunch but somehow no closer to supper, and the bars became harder than iron, and you really felt locked up. It was the moment for another nap, or for staring at the television. poker players were well into their twenties, a couple in their thirties, men awaiting trial for felonies or serving lengthy misdemeanor time. Bob and I sat in our cell, side by side on his bunk. made himself the sentry now. boy went back to the central area and sat down. followed the boy and stood beside his chair. lost his cool. He pretty well combusted in his cell and came out already burning alive. Standing on the table, he lifted his arms and strained against invisible bars. He really was enormous, both muscular and overfed, looked fashioned from balloons, at least usually, but at this moment looked sculpted from quivering stone, his face plum-purple under the heap of yellow hair. With a certain grace he stepped from tabletop to chair to floor. He marched around with vicious movements, crushing hallucinatory animals. His footsteps thundered on the catwalk. HAD it. one knew what to make of these fireworks. bands were permitted, yes. Pets and children wandered loose in the streets. Respected citizens threw their litter anywhere. Dundun showed me how to roll a cigarette. Dundun came from the trailer courts, and I was middle class gone crazy, but we passed the time together freely because we both had long hair and chased after any kind of intoxicating substance. Dundun, only nineteen, already displayed up and down both his arms the tattooed veins of a hope-to-die heroin addict. The same went for B.D., a boy who arrived the week before Christmas. That was his dodge. His head, however, was pretty large, with a curly brown mane. In any case, B.D. was most generous. He tore the page from the magazine, divided it into thirds, and shared one third with me and one with Donald Dundun, offering us this shredded contraband as a surprise on Christmas Eve. We gave away our suppers and choked down the paper on empty stomachs and waited to get lost. Lemme see your tongue. A lot of disorderly characters rattled loose from there and ended up in Johnson County, often in the Johnson County jail. And, when I left the house, there was Chuckie sitting in his car out front, drinking a beer and puffing on a Kool. Parked right behind my rig. Probably sitting there the whole time me and Janet are rolling around in his bed. And when I open the door to my truck, he flashes me the finger. I had heard of him. Nobody else had. Viola. Viola will not forgive, and Viola will not forget. Hey. started climbing on the bars of the nearest cell. mental space, customarily empty, had been invaded by an animal spirit. feeling all the way back to my roots. To the caves. He turned his head and looked at us. His face was dark, but his eyeballs gave out sparks. He seemed to be positioned at the portal, bathed in prehistoric memories. B.D. had got most, if not all of it, which was fair, but sad. I did not eat my wife. What happened was, she kept a few chickens, and I ate one of those. He tried to make it an aggravating circumstance. Murderer. The idea of God disgusted me. Everybody yacked and blabbered about cosmic spirituality and Hindu yogic chakras and Zen koans.

During the festival of horrors, my cellmate, Strangler Bob, had evaporated. Now here he was, reconstituted full-length in his bed. never go back to jail. About fifteen years after all this, in the early nineteen-eighties, he hanged himself in a holding cell in Florida. A small, glittering rain would have perfected the picture, which was, all the same, as silent and remote and unattainable and sad as you could want. And very vague as to its meaning. I was kept there I wondered if this place was some kind of intersection for souls. B.D. and Dundun, in particular, turned up in my youth many times after this. I think they may have been not human beings but wayward angels. We consumed a lot of his stolen heroin while he outwaited his pursuers in my little apartment, and when he felt safe and went away he left me with a large quantity of the stuff, all mine, and over the course of the following month I became thoroughly addicted to heroin. My fate was sabotaged. Very often I sold my blood to buy wine. American critics and musicologists, searching for precedents, often reach back to Amy Beach (1867-1944), a superb professional who created a large and sturdy catalogue of late-Romantic music that compares well with that of her contemporaries. But the reasons for her limited output have everything to do with her gender, and are tragic. Instead, she turned her attention to collecting and publishing extant folk songs. David Stinson finished high school, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1977, the first thing he did was get a job building houses. After a few years, though, the business slowed. Stinson was then twenty-four, with two children to support. He needed something stable. As he explained over lunch recently, that meant finding a job at one of the two companies in the area that offered secure, blue-collar work. He has a full, reddish face, a thick head of silver hair, and a majestic midsection. The technology is really helping that kind of thing, too. Sandee, Jr., a sixty-four-year-old worker on the paint line, sat down next to Stinson with a carton of fries and a cup of ketchup, and tossed his safety goggles on the table. who has neatly combed gray hair and an alert, owlish face, began working at Steelcase in 1972, after waiting in line with six hundred people just to put in an application. the nineties, Steelcase employed more than ten thousand workers in the United States and operated seven factories around Grand Rapids, making chairs, filing cabinets, desks, and tables, and the screws, bolts, and casters that went into them. Packed shoulder to shoulder, workers polished and painted wood and assembled steel parts by hand. In total, they employ fewer than two thousand workers. history of Steelcase, in many ways, is the history of manufacturing in America. The company was founded in 1912 with one product, a fireproof metal wastebasket. By 2001, Steelcase had lost a third of its sales and started closing plants throughout western Michigan. Its manufacturing was moved to Mexico, China, and eventually India. In 2011, the company announced a new series of closings and layoffs, shutting another plant near Grand Rapids, one in Texas, and one in Ontario, Canada. days, as U.S. companies report record profits and demand millions of sleek new workspaces, Steelcase is again on the upswing. Its corporate headquarters, housed in a refurbished factory, is a laboratory of workplace trends, with open floor plans and glass-sheathed work pods where people recline with their laptops or hover at standing desks. There are automated assembly lines, and robotic arms lifting tabletops that were once hauled by men. Until last year, the plant workers had to consult a long list of steps, taking pains to remove the correct parts out of a cart filled with variously sized bolts and screws and pins and to insert each one in the correct hole and in the correct order. We stood behind a young woman wearing a polo shirt and Lycra shorts, with a long blond ponytail. A scanner overhead tracked everything as it was happening, beaming the data it collected to unseen engineers with iPads. Even the drill was attached to a computer-assisted arm; the worker just had to move it to the right position and let the machine do its magic. A decade ago, industrial robots assisted workers in their tasks. decades, the conventional view among economists was that technological advances create as many opportunities for workers as they take away. In the past several years, however, research has begun to suggest otherwise. process, Autor and other economists argue, can also exacerbate inequality. For people who have technical degrees and can manage automated systems, and for owners of companies that are in the process of automating, the potential for increased wealth is significant. In a paper from earlier this year, the economists Daron Acemoglu, of M.I.T., and Pascual Restrepo, of Boston University, studied local job markets in the United States between 1990 and 2007, and they found that the concentration of industrial robots in an area was directly related to a decline in jobs and in pay. Technology can compound the effects of globalization. By one measure, the average manufacturing worker in the United States earned nine per cent less in 2015 than the average worker in 1973, while the economy over all grew by two hundred per cent. Stinson nor Sandee thought that automation posed a threat to their jobs, though. Sandee remembers when Frank Merlotti, a legendary figure at Steelcase who retired as president and C.E.O. in 1990, used to visit the plant and deliver rousing speeches to the workers. He told me about a trip he had taken with his grandkids to New York City, where they had visited the Empire State Building. Building that building. Humans to Robots Laboratory, at Brown University, is on the ground floor of a red brick building in the center of Providence, Rhode Island. It has the feel of an oversized garage, filled with stained, lumpy sofas and scattered gadgets and toys, along with the odd takeout food carton. There, on a recent afternoon, a robot with bulky red arms set about pulling the petals from an artificial daisy. The robot, known around the lab as Winnie, held the flower in a pair of rubber-tipped pincers, then retracted its other arm, rotated it slightly, and pointed it down toward the daisy. It emitted an idling-motor sound, as though contemplating what to do next. Then the hand jerked down toward the flower, grabbed a petal, and flung it on the table. Even in highly automated factories, jobs that involve packing boxes or putting tiny parts together are done by people. In her class Topics in Collaborative Robotics, one student proposed to teach a robot to make a salad. industrial robot will pick up the same object, in the same location, over and over. The challenge, and the multibillion-dollar business opportunity, was to teach a robot to function in an environment that was constantly changing. Oberlin, another Ph.D. student, who wore a long brown ponytail, safety goggles, and sandals with wool socks, bent his tall frame over a computer on a side table. But these petals on this flower have more than one way to fall. Sometimes they can be rotated a little bit, sometimes they can droop, sometimes they can curve, so these petals are deformable. had retrofitted an artificial flower with little magnets on its petals, so that they could be reattached and reused. The cycle continued until there was only one petal left. moved in, its arm quivering slightly, and positioned its arm to the outside of the flower in a way that looked unlikely to succeed. The grippers opened, trying but failing to close around the petal. Then the arm pulled up again. Tellex said quietly, leaning against the window. She looked down at the table and the bare daisy stem. This is awesome. fruit and other produce, which involves hours under the hot sun, is the kind of job that Americans are increasingly reluctant to do and that often goes to low-paid immigrant labor. Yet the implications extend beyond agriculture. A robot that could efficiently pick blueberries could probably do a lot of things that are currently the exclusive province of human beings. Tellex said. Automation is a topic that gets treated with enormous diplomacy, both in Europe and in the United States. The Dutch supermarket chain Ahold Delhaize, which owns the Stop & Shop and Peapod grocery-store brands in the U.S., hopes to have all its retail outlets cleaned by robots within five years. He decided that the Danish hospital system, which was under pressure to reduce costs, could benefit from robotic orderlies. The machines worked well, scuttling through surgery wings and psych wards like helpful crabs, never complaining or taking cigarette breaks. If you do the math, you can have thirty-five robots for one human. So you might as well face reality and face facts. This is not entirely a misrepresentation. When I asked Dave Stinson and his colleagues at Steelcase about how automation had affected the assembly line, they said, for the most part, that it had made things easier. The factory was cleaner, less noisy, more productive. When something went wrong with the assembly, they could diagnose the problem swiftly, by consulting the data. work placed less stress on their bodies, too. At one time, twenty-five hundred steel tabletops came off the assembly line each day, requiring two men to sweat and strain to get each one into the right place; now a robotic arm with grippers moved the tops. Ergonomically, the difference today is huge. Now he could work longer without burning out, and the work was easier. The most immediate way that it makes manufacturing more efficient, of course, is by requiring fewer workers. Still, when manufacturing that has been sent overseas comes back, it brings some jobs back, too, even if they are not the same complement of jobs, and not in their old numbers. They belong to the Rodon Group, one of the largest family-owned injection-molding companies in the country. There were trade-offs with outsourcing: quality control was less reliable, and it was harder to respond nimbly to changing customer demands in the trend-driven toy business. Rodon laid off around forty people, about a third of its workforce. Araten said that when business picked up the discussion quickly turned to how the company could rehire those people. No people were visible. Most of the presses work twenty-four hours a day, drawing plastic resin into a hopper, heating it to six hundred degrees Fahrenheit, and then blasting the liquid into molds, which are enormous blocks of stainless steel, precision-fabricated in an adjacent tool shop to create the shape of the desired part. Automated arms lift the parts up to cool, before depositing them in boxes. The completed parts are bright orange, purple, and red, and resemble dime-store candies. Wilson is pale and thin, with glasses and a dark beard; he speaks in a low monotone, and gives the sense of someone who is more comfortable interacting with screens than with people. The child of two accountants, Wilson completed a mechanical-engineering degree at Philadelphia University in 2014, and said that he had sought out a manufacturing job where he could work directly with different types of automated machines. The Rodon Group had obliged. There was a time when a plant worker was dedicated to each press, shovelling in plastic polymers, pulling the cranks and pushing the buttons, and scooping out the finished products and loading them onto trucks. Now, Wilson explained, one operator manages between eight and ten presses, which are overseen by digital systems. As at Steelcase, the robots have reduced accidents. President Obama visited the Hatfield plant in 2012; Hillary Clinton stopped by in 2016. Our responsibility is, yes, to our shareholders but also to our employees, and to our community. acknowledged that, relative to sales, the Hatfield factory employed fewer people than it had done in the past. But the jobs that they do have and will have, he said, will be higher skilled and better paying. He argued that the government could encourage similar moves by other companies, through tax policy and major investments in education, while also preparing for the coming technological changes. Having so much inequality creates instability in a country. Maybe twenty years ago, we still had too many poor people, but they believed that they had a shot. As plants have closed, displaced employees have sought work in fast-food restaurants or in big-box retail stores, where the pay and the benefits are substantially less attractive. And, increasingly, even those jobs are fading away. Storefront retail is fast losing ground to the online marketplace. Meanwhile, companies like Uber and Google are investing heavily in autonomous-driving technology, betting that such vehicles will reshape transportation. In August, 2016, Uber purchased Otto, a startup based in San Francisco that sells technology designed to automate long-haul trucking. There are nearly two million long-distance truck drivers in the United States, most of whom are male and lack a college degree; paying for them accounts for a third of the costs in the seven-hundred-billion-dollar trucking industry. low-skilled workers, warehouse jobs have seemed to be something of a bright spot. the same factors that make warehouses a draw for labor have made them a tempting target for automation. In 2012, Amazon spent almost eight hundred million dollars to buy a robotics company called Kiva, which makes robots that can zoom around a factory floor and move tall stacks of shelves of up to seven hundred and fifty pounds in weight. A Deutsche Bank research report estimated that Amazon could save twenty-two million dollars a year by introducing the Kiva machines in a single warehouse; the savings company-wide could reach into the billions. With such a powerful incentive, Amazon is on a quest to acquire or develop systems that can replace human pickers. automating a legacy warehouse, however, is a halfway measure, as a visit to Symbotic makes clear. There are no aisles for lifts to pass through, and no stations for human product pickers. A fleet of little green robots that look like race cars in a Pixar film come to life and zoom inside the cage on dedicated tracks, emitting high-pitched whirring sounds. They collect the cases of products and stash them on shelves until they are needed. He is a muscular fellow with dirty-blond hair pulled back in a ponytail, and looks as if he could have had an alternate career leading tourists on spelunking trips through Belize. Cohen had wanted a system that would make his grocery warehouses more efficient; then he realized that he could make a business of selling it to other retailers. Symbotic says it now has more orders than it can swiftly fulfill. The automated system, Gahagan notes, produces more efficiencies than are obvious at first glance. Because it can store more products in a smaller space, companies could have more compact warehouses closer to their retail outlets, requiring less trucking. Many warehouse operators run their businesses based on labor hours, in order to minimize overtime pay, among other things. But an automated system could run twenty-four hours a day. That instantly puts pressure on competitors to follow suit. jobs in warehouses are undesirable and hard to fill, Gahagan assured me. A typical worker might lift thousands of pounds of goods each day and walk the equivalent of a marathon, five or six days a week. It could be freezing in the winter, and sweltering during the summer months. observed that technological innovation has been happening in one way or another for a hundred years. Tractors replaced manual plows, but we were now able to produce much more food, he said; A.T.M.s replaced tellers, but banks still employ hundreds of thousands of people. But the standard of living has gone up. walked onto a platform where we could see a track on which the mobile robots were lined up, waiting to be called into action. Occasionally, one of them would whirr its motor and blast off, like a little rocket. Gahagan looked down on his robot army with affection and awe. Gahagan had pointed out that other countries were embracing industrial robotics more aggressively than the United States was. I saw the scale of this during a recent trip to China. About half an hour later, I reached a vast, low building, where hundreds of bicycles were parked in a covered lot. Wong grew up in Beijing, studied electrical engineering at M.I.T., and worked at Bell Labs for fifteen years. He started C.I.G. in 2005, and says that the company produces between two and three million products each month. He quickly demonstrated the lack of sentimentality with which many businesspeople in China approach the subject of automation. C.I.G. is trying to replace as many human workers with robots as possible, he explained. Three or so years ago, the company had thirty-five hundred people at work in the factory. Two years ago, it was twenty-five hundred. Today, it is eighteen hundred. China was never a particularly convenient place for Western companies to have their sneakers and T-shirts and widgets made; the main allure was cheap labor. There was a labor shortage, he said, exacerbated by the longstanding one-child policy. And the employees seemed compliant. passed through a pressurized air lock that blasted away whatever dust or lint we had on our persons, and entered the clean part of the plant. Robotic arms, behind windows, were doing most of the work, while the mortals did tasks that required fine motor skills, like plugging tiny components into place. Every now and then, a cute little robotic trolley came ambling down an aisle, playing Mozart to alert the humans that it was approaching. (Until recently, most industrial robots were separated from human workers by steel cages, to protect the workers from injury. were thirteen people doing this. circuit boards continued down an automated conveyor belt. Other robots placed stickers on boxes, before a group of humans moved in to place the circuit boards in the boxes, along with packing materials. time I asked about what happened to the displaced workers, Hu and Wong waved away the question, amused at the predictable direction of my inquiries. Hu insisted that factory workers would simply find another place in the economy, such as the service sector. The world changes. back in the room with the surveillance monitors, Wong gave me a slide show on the history of industrial revolutions. The second phase, in 1900, saw the advent of electricity, and was centered in the U.S., the U.K., and Germany. The third was the information-technology revolution, beginning in 2000 and concentrated largely in the U.S., Germany, Japan, and Korea. Her father was an accountant; her mother taught second grade in downtown Rochester. Tellex became interested in computers as a child. Her father gave her an old DOS 486 when she was in grade school; her aunt, a programmer, supplied books of simple coding exercises. She completed her computer-science Ph.D. there in 2010. She told me that she had never thought about the political implications of her field until the tense months leading up to the 2016 Presidential election. Economic inequality was a driving theme of the election, and Tellex began to see that automation was a contributing factor. The economy was generating wealth, but almost all of it seemed to be going to the wealthy. 2015, the Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton identified a surprising data pattern that reflects these economic fault lines, finding that mortality rates for middle-aged white non-Hispanic Americans with only a high-school diploma have been increasing since the late nineteen-nineties. Deaton listed globalization, immigration, and technological change as likely factors behind the decline of middle-income workers and the related rise in inequality, but noted that, in the developed world, stagnant wages and an associated increase in death rates were unique to the United States. has been conducting her own research into the causes of income inequality and, with her friends, has amassed a reading list of academic studies and news articles. She is drawn to the idea of a universal basic income, in which citizens would receive enough money from the government to cover living expenses. Ultimately, she knows, blue-collar workers are not the only ones who may need such economic assistance. were ways, Tellex believed, to mitigate the effects of rising inequality without vilifying immigrants or blaming technology. It became a landmark of the Grand Rapids area; employees returning home from business trips would proudly make note of it as their flights descended into the Gerald R. Ford Airport. In 2009, in the midst of the financial crisis, Steelcase moved out of the building. It sat vacant until 2016, when a company called Switch moved in. Stinson, at Steelcase, told me that he often became emotional when he saw the building, and was reminded of what it represented. There was talk that they were going to tear it down. Bill Sandee, his colleague, tries to put those losses in perspective. And the company has to do something to survive. He paused. The night before the election, he and his wife attended a Trump rally in Grand Rapids, in the heart of a state that Hillary Clinton had expected to win comfortably. More than four thousand people lined up for blocks to hear Trump at a downtown convention center. Stinson said he decided that night to vote for the Republican ticket. was accustomed to politicians disappointing him. Stinson used to spend his days reminding workers of what they were supposed to be doing, or trying to figure out how faulty parts had sneaked into the system. He used to jump in and demonstrate precisely how a screw was supposed to go in, or whether the torque was correct. Now none of that was necessary. Automated machines were driving everything. No longer. The crews are thin; the pressure is less. The youngest of his three sons, aged thirty, works in a different department at the Steelcase plant. says he is, too. When I asked how many new workers Steelcase had hired to accommodate the increase in production, he said that workers were mainly being moved between production lines, to replace workers who had retired. gazed out at the smoothly functioning factory floor, the rows of machines diving and pecking in front of their human minders, performing a kind of dance. Even if the economy stayed strong and demand remained high the head count was expected to decline through attrition, year after year. One day, the factory might go dark.

I trained to be a doctor, some four decades ago, everyone neglected sleep. and lasted twenty-four hours; I often kept on working until early evening the next day, after which I would stumble back to my apartment and fall asleep in my clothes. The ethic was not to complain. In medical school, the subject had been covered in only the most cursory way. In a class on the brain, an instructor mentioned a neural pathway, the reticular activating system, that was associated with wakefulness. In passing, he also told us about narcolepsy, a rare condition that could cause people to sink into slumber at any moment and that had other fascinating features, such as vivid hallucinations and abrupt loss of muscle control. That was it. Sleep medicine has become a specialty, with fellowship training programs and clinics devoted to caring for those suffering from sleep disorders. And these disorders are not rare. In the workplace, sleep deprivation results in injuries and decreased productivity, which is thought to cost the U.S. eighteen billion dollars each year. numbers have not escaped the notice of the business world, and there is now a thriving sleep industry. Pharmaceutical companies ply us with Ambien and Lunesta, and entrepreneurs have devised any number of outlandish gadgets to foster slumber. Still, although we may know more about sleep than ever before, it remains one of the most enigmatic phenomena in our daily lives. Kryger, a professor at Yale Medical School, is a leader in the field of sleep medicine, and has treated more than thirty thousand patients with sleep problems during a career that spans four decades. He draws on this voluminous clinical experience in his book, which is an authoritative and accessible survey of what is known, what is believed, and what is still obscure about normal patterns of sleep and the conditions that disrupt it. hyperactive imagination produced hundreds of bizarre characters. In the nineteen-fifties, some researchers were reminded of Joe when they studied an obese amateur poker player who had fallen asleep in the middle of a game. We now know that being very overweight can prevent people from breathing deeply enough and quickly enough to keep themselves supplied with oxygen. Apnea can lead to heart attack and stroke from decreased oxygen, and may accelerate cognitive decline in older people. Dionysius, a tyrant who ruled the Cretan kingdom of Heraclea in the fourth century B.C., was massively overweight. Because he repeatedly fell asleep, Dionysius hired people to poke him with long, thin needles, probably to keep him breathing. Once it had been demonstrated that certain conditions associated with disrupted sleep could have dire clinical consequences, it became clear that sleep was a crucial factor in maintaining good health. book usefully outlines the current state of knowledge of sleep science in humans. The biology of sleep and wakefulness is complex, involving not just the one neural circuit I learned about in medical school but numerous pathways in the brain and countless chemical mediators. The gauge begins to signal after we have been awake for about fourteen hours, and increases in intensity until the eighteen-hour mark, after which we find it hard not to fall asleep. The wake gauge operates in the brain by means of a chemical called adenosine, which is involved in energy transfer. The longer our brain is active, the more adenosine accumulates and the sleepier we feel. body clock synchronizes our need for sleep with the rhythms of the world around us. Daylight is the primary regulator. At dusk, when light fades, the pineal gland (where Descartes believed the soul resided) releases melatonin and makes us drowsy. Melatonin regulates the circadian rhythm of a wide range of organisms; the molecule is found in bacteria, insects, jellyfish, and plants. By tracking eye movements and using electroencephalograms to measure brain waves, researchers have identified four main types of sleep and have established that we typically progress through them in cycles of about ninety minutes. During this phase, almost all of our muscles are paralyzed, except the diaphragm, which allows us to continue to breathe, and certain sphincters at the top and bottom of our gastrointestinal tract. All humans dream, usually three to five times a night. And every time a man dreams he has an erection; every time a woman dreams, the blood vessels of her vagina become engorged. These changes in our genitalia are apparently unrelated to sexual thoughts before sleep or to sexual content in the dreams themselves. offers a comprehensive analysis of physical conditions that can impair our sleep. Women may experience insomnia owing to the normal hormonal fluctuations of the menstrual cycle and to the changes in hormonal regulation that occur with menopause. Restless-leg syndrome, which causes lower limbs to spontaneously move and often cramp, is associated with certain vitamin deficiencies but often occurs without a known reason. for most of us it is the mind, rather than the body, that disrupts restorative sleep. Kryger explores in depth psychological conditions that are associated with disordered sleep, as well as psychotropic medications whose side effects can prevent a restful night. Kryger explains the difference between flying east and flying west. He recommends avoiding sleep for more than a short nap. mysteries that surround sleep are not merely scientific and clinical but also cultural. In some indigenous societies in Nigeria, Central America, and Brazil, segmented sleep persisted into the twentieth century. Ekirch hypothesized that segmented sleep was our natural, evolutionary heritage, and that it had been disrupted in the West by the demands of industrialization, and by electricity, which made artificial lighting ubiquitous. other studies cited by Reiss challenge the idea of a universal model of sleep across millennia. Jerome Siegel, a neuroscientist at U.C.L.A., studied three contemporary hunter-gatherer societies in Tanzania, Namibia, and Bolivia. None of the tribes experienced segmented sleep, but daytime naps were important, especially during the summer months. industrialization, sleep patterns were based largely on seasonal daylight. But the idea that modern industrial society alone is responsible for our discordant forms of sleep is belied by the taxing rhythms of agrarian life. Harvests required long days and late nights; cows would have been milked in the very early mornings, and shepherds, as the hymn says, watched their flocks by night, to save them from predators. Speaking of hymns, Reiss also ignores the demands that religious rituals have long made on daily schedules. In Judaism, there are three services for prayer: morning, afternoon, and night. In Islam, the muezzin calls the faithful to prayer five times a day, beginning at dawn. Thoreau suffered from insomnia, and his retreat, in 1845, to a simple cabin at Walden Pond was, in part, driven by a desperate need for rest. Thoreau attributed his nightly struggles to the fact that railroads and other industrial changes had disturbed the natural environment around Concord. The history of blaming modernity for lost sleep runs long. Where Thoreau once held railroads responsible for his insomnia, we now obsess over e-mail and social media and the glowing screens of our computers and smartphones. Societies have been looking for ways of forcing people to rest since at least the Iron Age, when the Sabbath tradition emerged in Judaism. As Kryger shows, sleep is utterly essential to life, organically speaking, but the act of living our lives to the fullest, with all the attendant toils, responsibilities, and worries, has probably always been the enemy of sleep. Groopman, a staff writer since 1998, writes primarily about medicine and biology. He holds the Dina and Raphael Recanati Chair of Medicine at the Harvard Medical School and is the chief of experimental medicine at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His research has focussed on the basic mechanisms of cancer and AIDS. He has been a major participant in the development of many AIDS-related therapies, including protease inhibitors, and he is active in regional and national education activities in AIDS and cancer medicine, as well as in the training and education of young scientists in these fields. Recently, he has extended the research infrastructure in genetics and cell biology to studies in lymphoma, myelodysplasia, and leukemia.

Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 is perhaps the single most frequently mocked act of Congress in history. It sparked a trade war in the early days of the Great Depression, and has become shorthand for self-destructive protectionism. decision is more than a throwback. Probably not, but now you can. this is just the early, land-rush phase of the Internet of Things, comparable to the first Internet land rush, in the late nineties. For most of its existence, Amazon has made little or no profit. Amazon can calculate this with increasing accuracy. Already, it likely knows which books you read, which movies you watch, what data you store, and what food you eat. In the old days, you might buy a washing machine or a refrigerator once a decade or so. Appliance-makers are built to profit from that one, rare purchase, focussing their marketing, customer research, and internal financial analysis on brief, sporadic, high-stakes interactions. But, when an appliance is sending a constant stream of data back to its maker, that company has continuous relationships with the owners of its products, and can find all sorts of ways to make money from those relationships. If a company knows, years after you bought its stove, exactly how often you cook, what you cook, when you shop, and what you watch (on a stove-top screen) while you cook, it can continuously monetize your relationship: selling you recipe subscriptions, maybe, or getting a cut of your food orders. Appliances now order their own supplies when they are about to run out. makes smart appliances, just like Samsung and LG. Maybe they should put their resources into serving their consumers better. But most of the tariffs were small and easy for the companies to get around. President Trump, of course, views free trade more skeptically, and may well impose huge tariffs on all laundry-machine imports. Irwin suspects that this will produce a flood of trade-protection complaints from other American firms. Moretti, playing himself, depicts his failed effort to make an anti-Berlusconi documentary. Hoover was the son of devout Quakers who lived in the frontier village of West Branch, Iowa. His father, a blacksmith, died when Herbert was six, and his mother died three years later. At the age of eleven, he was sent, by train, along a just completed rail line, to a small settlement in Oregon, to live with an uncle, who treated him coldly and loaded him down with chores. By early middle age, he was a celebrated international hero. The times demanded industrial-scale achievements, not limited to industry itself; Hoover was a public-service superman, a mega-bureaucrat. Nobody demonstrates this better than Hoover. Four years later, he got fifty-nine electoral votes and carried just six states. What intervened between his two Presidential runs was the 1929 stock-market crash and the early years of the Great Depression. Hoover was doomed to be remembered as the man who was too rigidly conservative to react adeptly to the Depression, as the hapless foil to the great Franklin Roosevelt, and as the politician who managed to turn a Republican country into a Democratic one. An inaugural graduate of Stanford, where he studied mechanical engineering and geology, Hoover became a mining engineer at a time when that was as glamorous and potentially profitable a career as launching a tech startup would be for a Stanford graduate now. Before he turned thirty, he was married and a father, running a large gold mine in Tientsin, China, and highly prosperous. Hoover seems to have been an almost brutally tough, obsessively hardworking manager; certainly charm was not the secret to his success. He soon broke with his employers and struck out on his own, mainly as a financier of mining projects, rather than as a manager of them, and did very well for himself. The Hoovers moved to London and lived in a large town house. That is, if one had the means to take part in its upper life. It was also the period in which a good deal of the familiar institutional architecture of the United States was created: big corporations and universities, the first government regulatory agencies, structured and licensed professions, charitable foundations, think tanks. Liberal intellectuals like Walter Lippmann and Herbert Croly saw the establishment of a class of trained, technocratic experts as essential to the future of democracy. In business, efficiency experts like Frederick Winslow Taylor and Frank Gilbreth systematized the operations of industrial mass production, down to the physical movements of workers on an assembly line. Psychologists like Lewis Terman invented tests that could be used to sort the population en masse. Hoover was a creature of the engineering division of this milieu. Then it moves to realization in stone or metal or energy. Then it brings jobs and homes to men. Then it elevates the standard of living and adds to the comforts of life. Unless the subject is a monster, all that intimacy typically turns the biographer into a personal partisan. This did not happen with Whyte and Hoover. Biographers want psychological access, but Hoover, though the records he left behind are vast, has the quality of not being personally present in a life that, for a long while, produced one triumph after another. gave him renown enough to make him a plausible Presidential candidate was his self-appointment as the manager of an international effort to get food into Belgium after it had fallen to the Germans during the First World War. Whatever qualities had made Hoover successful as an operator of mines in remote areas also made him successful at delivering relief under emergency conditions. He borrowed money to buy food before he had succeeded in getting government assistance. He persuaded George Bernard Shaw, Thomas Hardy, and other leading authors to publish statements in support of his efforts. He negotiated with food brokers and shipping companies. At a time when the world adored people who had spectacular organizational skills, here was somebody using them not to build a factory or administer an empire but for purely humanitarian purposes. 1917, after many years in London, Hoover returned to the United States, won the friendship and admiration of President Woodrow Wilson, and was made the director of a new government agency called the United States Food Administration, which was charged with managing the national food supply now that the country was a participant in the war. This was another widely publicized triumph: the troops abroad and the folks back home were well and reliably fed. He wound up not entering the race, but he eventually declared himself a Republican and was appointed Secretary of Commerce by President Warren Harding. those days, Hoover was, Whyte observes, on the liberal edge of the Republican Party. He also loved taking on projects like standardizing the sizes of bricks and wood screws. As early as 1923, Hoover was warning publicly that, sooner or later, the booming economy of the nineteen-twenties was going to go bust. In the early months of his Presidency, he began selling his own stocks in anticipation of a crash. And when the crash came, on October 29, 1929, Hoover immediately grasped its importance and began exploring what to most of Washington seemed like the outer acceptable limit of an aggressive government response to an economic crisis. launched infrastructure-building projects unprecedented in scale. Convinced that the heavy reparations payments imposed on Germany after the First World War were making the Depression more severe in Europe, he organized a politically risky moratorium on them. The atmosphere surrounding these activities was typically Hooverian: he confronted the Depression the way he had the humanitarian crises that brought him to the Presidency, with sheer hard work. Surrounded by a circle of loyal aides who had served him for decades and who were known collectively as the Firm, he apportioned his long days at the office (he was the first President to keep a telephone on his desk) into series of eight-minute appointments. The coming of the New Deal turned most Republican Progressives into conservatives, though, and none more than Hoover. Like many politicians, Hoover preferred to think of himself as someone who had reluctantly answered a call to public service, rather than as someone who craved power, but he took losing very hard. As the rise of Adolf Hitler forced Roosevelt to become a foreign-policy President, Hoover began to disapprove of him diplomatically just as much as he did economically. He believed that, if left alone, Hitler, whom he had visited in 1938, would direct his ambitions eastward and wage a mutually destructive war with the Soviet Union, leaving Britain and Western Europe alone. He used this as an occasion to reprise his decades-past role as a one-man food-distribution tsar in postwar Europe. The following year, a newly Republican Congress put him in charge of a vast efficiency study of the federal government. The Hoover Commission, run with typically obsessive thoroughness by its septuagenarian namesake, produced nineteen separate reports and two hundred and seventy-three recommendations. unlikely that any President elected in 1928, even Roosevelt, would have been returned to office in 1932. The magnitude of the economic disaster was just too great to be politically survivable. In fact, when Roosevelt took office the unemployment rate was at its all-time historical peak, twenty-five per cent, and the entire American banking system had stopped functioning. Even if Hoover had been able to devise a perfect plan for surmounting the disaster, his lack of political skills would have prevented him from enacting it. Hoover set out to govern in the manner in which he had accomplished the spectacular feats that had brought him to the Presidency: as an administrator of genius. He tried to defeat the Depression by grinding it down from behind his desk. He had been raised in a strict teetotalling environment. It concerned the size and the scope of the federal government. Roosevelt created the Works Projects Administration, Social Security, and other programs that conferred benefits directly on people in need. Roosevelt had more than doubled that figure even before the Second World War began. By the time of his death, it was twenty per cent, where it would roughly hover for the next seven decades. Roosevelt increased the number of federal employees from about five hundred thousand to more than six million. Hoover believed that a small central government was the only possible distinctively American alternative to Socialism, Communism, and Fascism. loyal aides to Roosevelt found him maddening. He used his charm as an aid to elusiveness. Everybody left a meeting with Roosevelt believing he had agreed to whatever the person had asked for. Nobody could figure out exactly what he thought. He encouraged rivalries and overlapping responsibilities. The man who was a trusted family member to Americans who listened to him on the radio was unknowable to the people in his immediate vicinity. Hoover, though by no means open, was always forthright, and he inspired intense loyalty among those who worked for him. He pointed to the sofa and chuckled. He patted his belly. They belonged to the People, the Party, the collective. He shook his head. apartment required one final touch. He picked up a swath of gold sheeting that was so shiny he could see his face in it, and began wrapping the sofa, Christo style. Xu stepped back. silver sheeting turned out to be too narrow to cover the double bed. Two art handlers with walkie-talkies arrived to troubleshoot; it was decided that the Mylar would be cut and re-sewn, to the right dimensions. A tattooed assistant named Sonia grabbed a pair of scissors and began snipping. up, Xu gazed at the tub. Alexander had a busy stage career in the years before George Costanza. He was cast anyway, which meant working with the mercurial Robbins, who was directing his own self-tribute. (The Manhattan Theatre Club production opens Oct. 24, at City Center Stage I.) Alexander plays a lawyer in Providence, Rhode Island, dealing with an overbearing mother (Mary Testa), a sexy Greek widow with a past (Sherie Rene Scott), and his own high anxiety. A starry cast, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright: Alexander knows from experience not to rest on pedigree. Weinstein combined a keen eye for promising scripts, directors, and actors with a bullying, even threatening, style of doing business, inspiring both fear and gratitude. Too few people were willing to speak, much less allow a reporter to use their names, and Weinstein and his associates used nondisclosure agreements, payoffs, and legal threats to suppress their accounts. story, however, is complex, and there is more to know and to understand. In the course of a ten-month investigation, I was told by thirteen women that, between the nineteen-nineties and 2015, Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them. Four women said that they had experienced unwanted touching that could be classified as an assault. They and others described a pattern of professional meetings that were little more than thin pretexts for sexual advances on young actresses and models. All sixteen said that the behavior was widely known within both Miramax and the Weinstein Company. Some employees said that they were enlisted in a subterfuge to make the victims feel safe. all of the people I spoke with told me that they were frightened of retaliation. Multiple sources said that Weinstein frequently bragged about planting items in media outlets about those who spoke against him; these sources feared similar retribution. likely that the women who spoke to me have recently felt increasingly emboldened to talk about their experiences because of the way the world has changed regarding issues of sex and power. Ailes, the former head of Fox News, resigned in July, 2016, after he was accused of sexual harassment. Cosby went on trial this summer, charged with drugging and sexually assaulting a woman. Hofmeister, a spokesperson for Weinstein, issued a new statement in response to the allegations detailed here. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path. Stoller, now Lucia Evans, was approached by Weinstein at Cipriani Upstairs, a club in New York, in 2004, the summer before her senior year at Middlebury College. Evans, who is now a marketing consultant, wanted to be an actress, and although she had heard rumors about Weinstein she let him have her number. Weinstein began calling her late at night, or having an assistant call her, asking to meet. She declined, but said that she would do readings during the day for a casting executive. Before long, an assistant called to set up a daytime meeting at the Miramax office in Tribeca, first with Weinstein and then with a casting executive, who was a woman. Evans arrived for the meeting, the building was full of people. She was led to an office with exercise equipment in it, and takeout boxes on the floor. Weinstein was there, alone. Evans said that she found him frightening. As she objected, Weinstein took his penis out of his pants and pulled her head down onto it. appeared to find the encounter unremarkable. Afterward, he acted as if nothing had happened. Weinstein, Evans said, began calling her again late at night. She told me that the entire sequence of events had a routine quality. Everything was designed to make me feel comfortable before it happened. She continued to blame herself for not fighting harder. I was disgusted with myself. Evans told friends some of what had happened, but felt largely unable to talk about it. Once, while she was walking her dog in Greenwich Village, she saw him getting into a car. I was so horrified. The distributor was Miramax. the time, Argento was twenty-one and had twice won the Italian equivalent of the Oscar. Argento felt professionally obliged to attend. At first, Weinstein was solicitous, praising her work. Then he left the room. When he returned, he was wearing a bathrobe and holding a bottle of lotion. some point, she stopped saying no and feigned enjoyment, because she thought it was the only way the assault would end. A big fat man wanting to eat you. Decades later, she said, oral sex is still ruined for her. He said he would put the phrase on a T-shirt. Weinstein dined with her, and introduced her to his mother. Years later, when she was a single mother dealing with childcare, Weinstein offered to pay for a nanny. told me that she knew this contact would be used to attack the credibility of her allegation. In part, she said, the initial assault made her feel overpowered each time she encountered Weinstein, even years later. She broke down as she struggled to explain. In the film, a heavyset producer corners Anna, the character played by Argento, in a hotel room, asks her for a massage, and tries to assault her. women were too afraid to allow me to use their names, but their stories are uncannily similar to these allegations. One, a woman who worked with Weinstein, explained her reluctance to be identified. She told him no, repeatedly and clearly. The woman continued to have professional contact with Weinstein after the alleged rape, and acknowledged that subsequent communications between them might suggest a normal working relationship. She scrambled for ways to ward him off, telling him that it was against her religion to date married men. few weeks later, in New York City, her phone rang after midnight. It was Weinstein, saying that he had new marketing ideas for the film and asking to get together. Sorvino offered to meet him at an all-night diner, but he said he was coming over to her apartment and hung up. She called a friend and asked him to come over and pose as her boyfriend. (Dix told me that she had locked herself in a hotel bathroom to escape Weinstein, and that he had masturbated in front of her. She had professional contact with Weinstein for years after the incident, and remains a close friend of his brother and business partner, Bob Weinstein. In the office, she sat with Weinstein on a couch to review the portfolio, and he began staring at her breasts, asking if they were real. Weinstein telephoned her later that evening, annoyed that she had failed to appear at the show. She picked up the call while sitting with investigators from the Special Victims Division, who listened in and devised a plan: Gutierrez would agree to see the show the following day and then meet with Weinstein. next day, Gutierrez met Weinstein at the bar of the Tribeca Grand Hotel. A team of undercover officers helped guide her through the interaction. On the recording, which I have heard in full, Weinstein lists actresses whose careers he has helped and offers Gutierrez the services of a dialect coach. Then he presses her to join him in his hotel room while he showers. Gutierrez says no repeatedly; Weinstein persists, and after a while she accedes to his demand to go upstairs. But, standing in the hallway outside his room, she refuses to go farther. In an increasingly tense exchange, he presses her to enter. Come on. Weinstein says. to a law-enforcement source, Weinstein, if charged, would most likely have faced a count of sexual abuse in the third degree, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of three months in jail. She claimed that she had been unaware of the nature of the party before arriving, and she eventually became a witness in a bribery case against Berlusconi, which is still ongoing. One of them, a police source, said that the department had collected more than enough evidence to prosecute Weinstein. when contacted for this story, said that she was unable to discuss the incident. Nestor was twenty-five when she started the job and, after finishing law school and starting business school, was considering a career in the movie industry. told her to meet him for drinks that night. Nestor invented an excuse. He did, and told her to meet him at the Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills, where he was staying. After Weinstein offered her career help, she said, he began to boast about his sexual liaisons with other women, including famous actresses. He asked to hold her hand; she said no. She recalled refusing his advances at least a dozen times. Afterward, Weinstein told Nestor to keep an eye on the news cycle, which he promised would be spun in his favor. And I knew how well connected he was. That was common knowledge across the board. told me that some people at the company did seem concerned. Irwin Reiter, a senior executive who had worked for Weinstein for almost three decades, sent her a series of messages via LinkedIn. (Reiter declined to comment for this article, but his lawyer, Debra Katz, confirmed the authenticity of the messages and said that Reiter had made diligent efforts to raise these issues, to no avail. no assault occurred, and Nestor left after completing her temporary placement, she was profoundly affected by the experience. In the meeting, Weinstein told de Caunes that he was going to be producing a movie with a prominent director, that he planned to shoot it in France, and that it had a strong female role. Weinstein pleaded with her to retrieve the book with him, and finally she agreed. As they got to his room, she received a telephone call from one of her colleagues, and Weinstein disappeared into a bathroom, leaving the door open. Weinstein came out, naked and with an erection. De Caunes told Weinstein that she was leaving, and he panicked. she remembered him saying. And then I left. She was shaking on the stairs going down to the lobby. A director she was working with on the TV show confirmed that she arrived at the studio distraught and that she recounted what had happened. Caunes, who was in her early thirties at the time, was already an established actress, but she wondered what would happen to younger and more vulnerable women in the same situation. evening in the early nineties, the actress Rosanna Arquette was supposed to meet Weinstein for dinner at the Beverly Hills Hotel to pick up the script for a new film. recalled that, when she arrived at the room, Weinstein opened the door wearing a white bathrobe. He said that his neck was sore and that he needed a massage. She told him that she could recommend a good masseuse. He put it on his neck. When she yanked her hand away, Weinstein grabbed it again and pulled it toward his penis, which was visible and erect. told her that she was making a huge mistake by rejecting him, and named an actress and a model who he claimed had given in to his sexual overtures and whose careers he said he had advanced as a result. In one case, she believes, she lost a role because of it. Jessica Barth, an actress who met him at a Golden Globes party in January, 2011, told me that he invited her to a business meeting at the Peninsula. When she arrived, he asked her over the phone to go up to his room. behavior deeply affected the day-to-day operations of his companies. Current and former employees described a pattern of meetings and strained complicity that closely matches the accounts of the many women I interviewed. executive said that she was especially disturbed by the involvement of other employees. former employee told me that she was frequently asked to join for the beginning of meetings that, she said, had in many cases already been moved from day to night and from hotel lobbies to hotel rooms. She said that when she refused to join one such meeting, Weinstein became enraged. She added that the pattern of meetings was nearly uninterrupted in her years of working for Weinstein. staffers who facilitated these meetings said that they felt morally compromised by them. He told me that most of the encounters that he saw seemed consensual, but others gave him pause. and his legal and public-relations teams have conducted a decades-long campaign to suppress these stories. In recent months, that campaign escalated. Weinstein and his associates began calling many of the women in this article. Weinstein asked Argento to meet with a private investigator and give testimony on his behalf. One actress who initially spoke to me on the record later asked that her allegation be removed from this piece. These employees continued to participate in the article partly because they felt that there was a growing culture of accountability, embodied in the relatively recent disclosures about high-profile men such as Cosby and Ailes. female executive who declined inappropriate meetings told me that her lawyer advised her that she could be liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages for violating the nondisclosure agreement attached to her employment contract. I wish I could have stopped it. happy families are alike. is afoot in the Meyerowitz clan. Eliza, the sanest and the most poised of them, will soon be heading to Bard for freshman year. The Whitney, which bought a piece of his, appears to have lost it. Bard, where he taught for a time, may mount a retrospective of his work, though only as part of a group show: clearly an insult, for an artist whose regal insultability is perhaps his proudest achievement. All in all, a charming fellow. Grace Van Patten, who is twenty, holds her own in style amid the starry names. The two of them bristle and spar, coming to blows in one of the least manly bouts of combat ever staged, which results in a very minor nosebleed. For all the horseplay, what matters most is that we actually believe in Danny, Matthew, and Jean as siblings. Though tugged apart by force of circumstance, they are bound by a history of shared jokes and unamusing pain. Danny and Matthew, reluctant to assault a fragile man, decide to trash his car instead. The dilemmas that it grapples with, involving parents and their frustrated offspring, could not be less parochial. One clever shot, tracking Harold and Matthew along a street, mid-argument, glides from left to right and back again as if on the sideline of a soccer field; their antagonism, we realize, is an established sport. Yikes. She comes in hope. First, we have Ben (Oakes Fegley), living in Gunflint, Minnesota, with his aunt. His mother died in an accident, and he barely knows who his father was, but he takes a bus to New York, alone, to learn more. All of this happens in 1977, in sweltering color, whereas the adventures of the second child, Rose (Millicent Simmonds), unfold half a century before, in black-and-white. Then, there is the sound of silence. Ben loses his hearing (after being struck by lightning, if you please) but he can still speak, whereas Rose is both deaf and mute. She radiates an eager sympathy, in her sign language and in the unguarded warmth of expression on her face. In 2001, his reviews received the National Magazine Award for Reviews and Criticism. His yearning was not foreseeable at his birth: his father was a hippie and his mother was an ex-nun, and they had met while counselling draft resisters during the Vietnam War. Jofie discovered golf as a child, when his mother began dropping him off at a local public course early on summer mornings and picking him up late in the afternoon, hoping to give him something inexpensive to do that would last all day. Quite a few of his clients are well known. I did Kenneth Cole. I did the floating green at GlenArbor Golf Club, in Bedford. I did two soccer fields at Greenwich Country Day School. laughed. basement greens. hollered instructions from above, and two helpers arranged fringe pieces around the perimeter of the putting surface, which was slightly kidney-shaped. Still, he said, he was pleased with the result. These include excellent octopus croquettes, a couple luscious little slices of Wagyu beef, and Not Ramen, which actually is ramen. The Black Truffle Explosion, a dish that made Achatz famous early on, at Trio in Evanston, Illinois, is here a single raviolo, enclosing a deeply truffled liquid. In fact, the landmark agreement capitalized on a rare consensus. After years of hesitating, China and Russia joined the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, along with Germany and the European Union, in supporting American pressure on Iran to change course. But the effect on its nuclear program was unquestionable. In return for the removal of sanctions imposed by the United States and other nations, which had crippled its economy, Iran agreed to shut down facilities and to give broad access to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. By early October, the White House had devised a plan to assuage his anger. If hawks in Congress push through a law demanding further concessions, it could provoke Iran to abandon the deal, eject the inspectors, and accelerate its nuclear program. a deal that Americans conceived, brokered, and secured would undercut decades of U.S. leadership on non-proliferation. that, during a Pentagon briefing, Trump called for a nearly tenfold increase in the nuclear arsenal. reflexive pursuit of manufactured conflict is becoming unbearable even to some of his most loyal erstwhile allies. It would open a rift with China just as it is weighing whether to join the United States again, this time in negotiating with North Korea. A decision to undermine the signature foreign-policy deal of a previous Administration would tilt the balance away from North Korean officials who argue for compromise. During the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962, President John F. Kennedy dispatched former Secretary of State Dean Acheson to Paris to inform President Charles de Gaulle that the Administration had decided to stage a naval blockade of Cuba. fierce critics of Tehran called the agreement vital to international security. Crowded with twentysomething Harlemites on the quietest of evenings, the Edge serves wine and sweet punch to a reggae and jazz soundtrack. A hibiscus mimosa is a Hudson River sunset in a glass. while, nearby, a professorial type held forth on an issue of Byzantine complexity, the topic unclear. Steem fish. Wednesdays are devoted to live music: blues and rock and world rhythms. The Edge feels like a place the young Langston would like, full of verse and the murmur of hours well spent. It was just smug, drab stuff.
