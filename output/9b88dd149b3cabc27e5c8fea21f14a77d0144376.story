TransCanada, which is planning to build the controversial Keystone XL pipeline to expand oil capacity heading south from Alberta, Canada, removed the damaged portion of pipe and replaced it. It is being sent to a National Transportation Safety Board lab for metallurgical testing. Crews are still working to clean up the oil that spilled from the underground pipe. In the meantime, however, PHMSA is allowing Keystone to restart operations. PHMSA is also requiring TransCanada to prepare a more detailed remedial action plan from the incident and an analysis of the root causes of it. Sign up for our daily email.
