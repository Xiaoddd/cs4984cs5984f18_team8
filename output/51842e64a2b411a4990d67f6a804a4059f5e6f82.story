When built driven they are a quiet and nonpolluting form of sustainable energy. These versatile energy sources will be valuable in medic and communications tents amongst other uses. I've attached a copy of our budget for building these resilient machines- this gofundme is to pay for just the devices and to ship them (way too much baggage to check). I'll be going out there to help set them up but have already paid for my travel. Ha I guess that means we had our hands full. I'm sitting on the plane right now about to take off. Happy to say the bikes and stands were successfully airport ninja'ed by me. Fox Barbara and Dylan will be joining me in Bismarck tonight and we'll be setting up three on Sunday. We'll be joining hero Mike Cobb who has been pedaling for power at Standing Rock the past few weeks. So here the thing- we still have 5 more motors. We just need the remainder of the gofundme to get them done and ship them out. Let's do it folks, we choose the world we make. Barbara Ross, James White Fox, Dylan Gutierrez, and myself will be departing for Standing Rock on Saturday. Tomorrow night we'll put the finishing touches on the stands that we will be bringing on the plane with us. We plan to bring out 3 working stands with us and ship the remainder next week when the materials come in to finish those stands (we already have the motors and most of the electronics). Tomorrow I'm picking up 8 used bikes. They too are consistent and dependable. Seeing the recent blizzard pics, it's too bad they're not fat bikes haha but they will turn a motor just fine. So, I still need your help. Everything else costs what it costs in the budget plus all the stuff we can't even predict and are gonna just eat anyways. So please help us with your contribution. It's not too late, we've got it going. Check out this short little video form Peter and Barbara. George and Fox explain the energy bikes with a little bit of their history. I'm really worried about the December 5th letter- with our current production schedule we will have one day to set these up to keep valuable services such as communications and medical running and lit.
