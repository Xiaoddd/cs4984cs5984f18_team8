We followed it out of the ground, through a refinery, and into someone's gas tank. It has driven industrial progress. It has also contributed to air pollution and climate change. For something so ubiquitous, oil is remarkably invisible. We wanted to change that. So we bought 100 barrels of oil and followed it out of the ground, through a refinery, and into someone's gas tank. We wait out a rainstorm, meet a preacher at an oil well and haggle over the price we'll pay for our oil. We go from an oil well in Kansas to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. And we track down an oil speculator. And we meet the mild-mannered oil engineer who unlocked the secret of modern fracking, largely by accident. We ask him what he regrets, and how it feels to change the world. Oil, coal and natural gas are this incredible store of energy, just sitting there in the ground waiting for us to dig them up. Now imagine that's actually a fun evening. That's what we're going for at Planet Money. Send us an email.
