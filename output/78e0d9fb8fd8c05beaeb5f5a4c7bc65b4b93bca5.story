Your Image was too big. Something went wrong. post has not been vetted or endorsed by BuzzFeed's editorial staff. Around 40 people were arrested. Hundreds of demonstrators on Wednesday at the encampment near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation had been given a deadline to leave the area or face arrest. As the deadline approached, some protesters were seen leaving the area, and a handful of wooden structures used by the demonstrators were set on fire. An executive evacuation order signed by North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum on Feb. 15 said the encampment would be closed down due to flooding concerns from melting snow in the area. Law enforcement formed a line along Highway 1806 and faced off with the final protesters who had refused to leave. Live video from the scene showed about five police officers detaining a man on the ground. Some were seen building a fire to stay warm and said they planned to stay overnight. The remaining protesters were arrested on Thursday, as more than 200 officers in addition to 18 National Guardsmen methodically searched the camp. But President Donald Trump effectively reversed the decision when he ordered an expedited review of the approvals needed to continue construction on Jan. 30. On Feb. 7, the Army announced that it would grant an easement for the construction of the pipeline. Some told BuzzFeed News they could not risk arrest. Authorities had anticipated that some of the protesters would try to stay beyond the Wednesday evacuation deadline, and they bolstered their presence as a result. Hours before the evacuation was set to begin, protesters took to burning down some of the structures. Some of the traditional structures, which were ceremoniously built, were ceremoniously burned down as protesters who have camped for months left Wednesday evening. Another protester, Noah Michael of the Octei Sakowin camp, expressed his appreciation for those who supported Standing Rock from afar. He added that the day of evacuation also marked the first day in the new fight against the pipeline. BuzzFeed News has reached out to the US Army for more information.
