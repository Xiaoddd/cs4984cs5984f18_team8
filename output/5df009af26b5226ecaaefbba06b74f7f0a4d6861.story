by Michael Shaw Of the most widely circulated photos of the Standing Rock protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline, this was one of the most interesting. A twist, though, is that we cannot see the man holding the mirror. The answer, by way of the prop, is that they are a reflection of the times, our ethnic, cultural and ecological priorities, and the conscience of the state. From still another perspective, a larger one, we are also prompted to look back in time. The glass, then, is also about perceiving the present in the past, and observing what is happening now in a historical mirror. Finally, I would also argue the photo has something to say about the presidential election and a radically different set of political conditions. With the election of Trump, we are going from a president famous for his deliberation to one already famous for impulsivity. That being the case, another element this photo frames is the merit and purpose of reflection itself.
