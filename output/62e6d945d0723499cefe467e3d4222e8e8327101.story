Six employees were cleaning a pipeline at the Paradis Pipeline Station on Thursday night when witnesses nearby heard a loud explosion, according to St. Charles Parish Sheriff Greg Champagne. The three others were treated at the scene with minor injuries. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation, and Champagne cited a possible gasket or valve failure. Sixty homes were evacuated and highways were being diverted around the area in Paradis, which is about 30 miles west of New Orleans.
