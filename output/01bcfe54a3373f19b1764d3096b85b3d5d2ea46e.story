The Standing Rock Lakota Sioux are taking a stand to protect the water, the land, and their heritage threatened by the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The construction led by Energy Transfer Inc. has already destroyed ancient burial sites, prayer grounds, and sacred artifacts. The Standing Rock Lakota have been joined by members of 280 other tribes, and the youth from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation want to join their elders and stand with them. The Pine Ridge Reservation has the shortest life expectancy of any community in the Western Hemisphere outside Haiti. Many Oglala Lakota have already played a key part in the pipeline opposition. Most of the youth have been supporting their elders from afar until now, but they are determined to reach the protest site to lend their voice to the movement in person.
