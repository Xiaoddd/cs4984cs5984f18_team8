The day-long event focused on educating students, faculty and staff about the problems being faced by the water protectors at Standing Rock. The company building the pipeline, Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners, disputes that. As of Monday, a few hundred protesters remained at an encampment in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, although state and federal authorities have given them until Wednesday to leave or face possible arrest, the Associated Press reported. And last week a federal judge rejected a motion for a restraining order that would have temporarily halted work on the pipeline. The keynote speaker at the Gonzaga teach-in was Edward Valandra, a member of the Rosebud Sioux and founder of the Community for the Advancement of Native Studies. Rashay Castillo, a teacher at the Salish School of Spokane, said she visited one of the encampments in North Dakota in September, shortly after a private security force hired by Energy Transfer Partners unleashed dogs on pipeline protesters.
