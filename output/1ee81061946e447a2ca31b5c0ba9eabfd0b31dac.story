An oil pipeline spill in Ash Coulee Creek is pictured Saturday, Dec. 10, 2016, northwest of Belfield, N.D. The Belle Fourche Pipeline spilled an estimated 176,400 gallons of oil. A Belle Fourche Pipeline spilled an estimated 176,400 gallons of oil. The rules also enable state inspectors to witness tests performed on the pipeline to check the integrity of the line before it's returned to service. In addition, pipeline owners are now required to report to state officials the root cause of a pipeline spill, allowing regulators to look for trends and work to prevent future incidents. A landowner discovered the leaking Belle Fourche Pipeline on Dec. 5 about 16 miles northwest of Belfield. Belle Fourche, which is part of True Companies of Wyoming, is not likely to repair the pipeline before the stronger pipeline rules take effect on Jan. 1. The hillside where the pipeline break occurred is slumping and concerns about instability of the rugged Badlands terrain have prevented crews from accessing the area. Officials hope a geotechnical evaluation can be performed next week, said Bill Suess, spill investigation program manager for the North Dakota Department of Health. True Companies is focused on cleaning up the environment and investigating the cause of the pipeline break, said spokeswoman Wendy Owen. There have been no discussions so far about putting the pipeline back into service, she said. The 6-inch oil pipeline dates back to the 1980s and Belle Fourche acquired it in the 1990s. The company also owns Bridger Pipeline, which had the January 2015 oil spill of more than 30,000 gallons in the Yellowstone River that contaminated the water supply for Glendive, Mont. In 2011, Dakota Gasification contacted the Public Service Commission after a cave-in left the carbon dioxide pipeline exposed in Dunn County. Dakota Gasification concluded that poor construction methods on the True Companies pipeline caused the cave-in on their parallel pipeline, PSC documents show. Loenbro was the contractor for that segment of the True Companies pipeline, the union said, citing PSC records. Weather conditions also were identified as contributing to the pipeline exposure, The Dickinson Press reported at the time. Dakota Gasification did not file a formal complaint to the PSC. The new pipeline rules, which the labor union supported, will provide stronger oversight and prohibit substandard construction practices, said spokesman Kevin Pranis. A representative for Loenbro did not return a call seeking comment. The Oil and Gas Division has been on site of the Belle Fourche spill and will be monitoring work on the pipeline. Even though some of the new rules don't take effect until Jan. 1, the state already has six pipeline inspectors who have been working in the field to oversee new pipeline construction and repair work, he said. Finding out the cause of pipeline spills should lead to reducing the frequency and severity of spills, said Troy Coons, chairman of the Northwest Landowners Association, which pushed for the new regulations. Companies are now required to tell state regulators the root cause of pipeline spills within 10 days after the cleanup is complete. However, major incidents can take months or years to clean up. In addition to state regulators, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has jurisdiction over the Belle Fourche Pipeline, which the federal agency considers to be a transmission line under its definitions. The agency's requirements vary depending on the circumstances of each incident, but generally the agency could require a test to determine the cause of the pipeline break as well as additional pressure tests or inspections before it can be put back in service. The North Dakota Department of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency also are investigating and monitoring the cleanup.
