U.S. officials on Monday, Nov.21, 2016 announced a ban on new mining claims across more than 30,000 acres in the area. The Trump administration can overturn much of the current protections on public lands. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R) is one potential candidate for Secretary of the Interior. She met with President-elect Donald Trump on Monday in New York. In a sea of Trump-allied fossil fuel supporters, Fallin stands out as a particularly pro-oil type. She also signed a bill banning local governments from restricting oil and gas drilling. Numerous Oklahoma outlets have blamed the governor for failing to address the causal relationship between oil extraction and earthquakes. The process creates huge amounts of wastewater, which is injected underground for storage. Advertisement Another candidate for the position, Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) has a stunningly low lifetime environmental record score of 5 percent from League of Conservation Voters. Lummis is reportedly meeting with the president-elect Tuesday. This is a woman who, along with many of her Republican colleagues, voted to block any efforts to increase the amount taxpayers are compensated for oil drilling on public land. Those votes do not portend a strong position of protecting public lands or even getting fair market value for their extractive possibilities. Other candidates for the position reportedly include former Gov. Sarah Palin (R-AK); former Gov. Jan Brewer (R-AZ); Harold Hamm, an Oklahoma billionaire; and Forrest Lucas, an oil executive. Advertisement The Interior Department oversees all of that. It also contains the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Geological Survey. Under the Obama administration, the department has maintained oil and gas leasing on public lands and in the Gulf of Mexico, allowed oil leasing in the Arctic, and toyed with allowing drilling in the Atlantic, off the southeastern states. But Obama has also presided over a huge preservation movement, dedicating millions of acres as national monuments. In January, Obama announced that there would be no new coal leases on public lands. That does not seem to be the approach of the Trump administration, given both the names floated for secretary and the transition team itself, which is being led by Doug Domenech. Advertisement Domenech is a former deputy chief of staff at the department and a former Virginia secretary of natural resources. The organization is funded in part by both the Koch Family Foundation and Koch Industries. In fact, the ability to harness and direct power has been the defining measure of modern life. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly said that extracting fossil fuels from public lands and waters would be a priority for his administration.
