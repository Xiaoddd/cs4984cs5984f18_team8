These tribes have been met with rubber bullets, pepper spray, attack dogs, and water canons for just peacefully protesting a monster oil pipeline slicing through their sacred waters and lands. But President Obama can stop this crisis with the stroke of a pen, and he's coming under increasing pressure from the Democratic Party to act.
