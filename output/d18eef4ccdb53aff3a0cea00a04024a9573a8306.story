If we can be driven to care about the stories of others, we can be driven to care about the policies that affect them. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe, located in North Dakota, with support from tribes across the country, are protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline across their land. The construction of this pipeline threatens burial grounds and the tribe's water source, itself considered sacred to the Sioux. We can be activist storytellers. We can amplify THIS voice, and we can make a difference, together. The best things in life; we don't ask for. These are the lucky things, like having a little sister who looks up to you so much that she keeps every single Barbie Doll you ever bought for her in the box; some of which remain unopened after 20 years. Luckier still if this little girl, grows up with the name you gave her your freshman year in college; and when SHE is 18, still thinks you walk on water. My little sister, Kayden, my confidant, my sidekick, and my teacher in life; had a beautiful son right before the New Year 2016; and I was so lucky to be his aunt. My profile picture is of my little nephew and I in late June or early July, 2016. The worst things in life; we don't ask for. My sister and my 6 month old nephew were tragically killed in a car accident; an all too common occurrence for young people on the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation in South Dakota; but an inconceivable one for a mother and a child. Only 23 years old, she and my nephew, along with 5 other passengers, were broadsided on a poorly maintained road in one of our smaller communities. 5 of the 7 were killed. Every person on our Reservation was affected; and everyone in our lives were devastated. Mother and son were buried together. In my grief, I was feeling quite sorry for myself. I was thinking only of myself and my hurt; until mid-August. Then, just a month after this tragedy, I found a light. Battles which are bigger than ourselves; battles that cause us to put our lives and emotions on hold and find a way to fight for a greater good. In August, my Tribe answered a call put out by the people of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, one of our original 7 historically, culturally, and linguistically connected Tribes (The Oceti Sakowin); a call to join them to fight the greatest battle known to any of our Tribes for the past decade; a call to fight for the preservation of the earth (Unci Maka) and clean water (Mni Wiconi). I answered that call for Kayden. It started with a simple plan to go and help deliver some supplies in a borrowed pickup with friends. We did this. In this great time of questioning; with Obama going out, with the lack of fruition that I could see in his promise of past to help the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe; I could see and still see with my own eyes; how he has not followed through with his promise. Despite our defenses being little more than lids from plastic tubs, these people, of all walks of life, have been putting their lives on the line to protect the Cannonball River from pollution and contamination. In the last large demonstration nearly a week ago, my friends were seriously injured by the police and hired Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) Security Agents via rubber bullets, tear gas grenades, and more. The greatest assault to all was to the women; with first-hand evidence via injury to women in the head, breasts, and other feminine areas. After that night, with some of my crew injured, I cried. I cried hard because in all my volunteerism in the past 3 months, there are quiet moments when I still just miss my sister. She would have been the first person that I would have called. She would have been the first to watch my children for me in all these days I have been away from home. She would have been the first person who went there by my side. I do many supply runs on my own. I drive many miles alone; but in those times, I know I am never alone. Even though this is a battle that is truly the test of all tests; and at times, seems so bleak; We STAND. And in the Trump environment, even if there are times when we all feel so, so small as Native people; We are trying to save ourselves. We are tolerating constant low-flying aircraft, and a real police-like state. I have a couple of little angels by my side; and this battle is bigger than any one of us; bigger than anything that we could ever do alone; and we are standing for what we believe in.
