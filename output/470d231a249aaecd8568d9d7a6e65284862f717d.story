Sacred burial grounds were swamped as well. Gone were the historic Lakota and Mandan villages along the lush river bottom where generations had grown gardens, hunted and subsisted off the earth. Phyllis Young, tribal councilwoman for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Fort Yates, ND. Through the 1950s and into the early 1960s, the U.S. government seized hundreds of thousands of acres of prime native American tribal land as part of an aggressive plan to build several dams along the Missouri River Basin, including a long stretch of the river in North and South Dakota that ran through the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. As part of that program, known as the Pick-Sloan Plan, hundreds of Indian families from various tribes were forcibly relocated and their way of life completely destroyed. The staggering poverty that resulted from the program lives on across the Dakotas today. Red Tomahawk was one of the last holdouts on Standing Rock, refusing the demands of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation to leave his home ahead of the planned flooding. According to locals, Red Tomahawk was eventually forced out at gunpoint. Lake Oahe, a large reservoir created by the Oahe Dam on the Missouri River, submerged many homes on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. By the early 1960s, five large dams erected along the river inundated nearly 360,000 acres of land. One of the dams, the Oahe, flooded more than 200,000 acres on the Standing Rock Reservation and the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota. The tribe used the wood to build shelters and hunted the animals that lived in the forests for food. The tribe was able to live largely outside of the dollars and cents economy because it was able to source much of what it needed right there in the wilderness. Entire towns were destroyed. Sacred ground, including gravesites and other places of spiritual significance, were lost. The tribes today contend they were never fully compensated for the lost assets or the relocations of their families. They say the seizure of the land was illegal and violated long-standing treaties between the federal government and the sovereign tribal nations. Pick-Sloan has been heralded as one of the great engineering marvels, having harnessed the power of the Missouri River to convert it to usable energy. The project created vast economic opportunities for many along the river, including greater irrigation for farmers, expanded barge navigation and hydroelectric power. Their losses, in both economic and cultural assets, were a blow to an already beleaguered community still grappling for an economic foothold. Such widespread loss meant the tribes developed a further dependence on the government. While the U.S. is bound by treaty obligations to protect Native rights and provide certain financial benefits to the tribes, often because of neglect, mismanagement and historic ill will, that relationship has often left tribes deeply vulnerable when it comes to economic, food and housing stability. That vulnerability, exacerbated by the impact of Pick-Sloan, continues today. Native populations and reservations are most often geographically and economically isolated and are among the poorest communities in the country. Crumbling homes and boarded up, graffiti-scarred buildings dot this forlorn place, where the great needs of families are etched in the faces of many who live here. A scattering of small, dilapidated one-story public housing units are in sharp contrast to the wide-open beauty of the buttes and flatlands that surround them. Health and housing are among the most pressing needs of residents, whose housing status is often dubious because of the willingness of families to pack into small substandard housing to meet the needs of relatives. There is little economic activity to speak of and childhood mortality, suicide and dropout rates are among the highest in the nation. Food insecurity is vast. Access to quality healthcare and education is lacking. Far too many go without electricity or running water. These conditions are made worse by political and economic red tape that stymie growth and development. A Lakota woman in the tribes buffalo pasture north of Fort Yates, Sioux County, North Dakota. Tribes have been forced to fight a series of losing battles to control and capitalize on the natural resources found on their land. Recent pipeline projects, including the proposed Keystone XL pipeline and the Dakota Access pipeline, would have cut through various tribal lands. That, tribal members and environmentalists contend, would have violated various pacts but also posed serious environmental threats to the land and water held dear by the tribes. The Standing Rock Sioux and many other tribes have fought the development of the pipeline projects, at times physically blocking them and other times fighting in court. Those on Standing Rock have already witnessed the profit and peril of the collusion between big industry and tribes. Upriver a few hours on the Fort Berthold Reservation and the surrounding area, home to the Three Affiliated Tribes, sit the Baaken oil fields, where massive fracking and oil drilling operations are taking place. Yet, at the same time, a sort of boomtown syndrome has set in. Crime is skyrocketing. Prostitution is rampant and drug traffickers have carved out new routes for the thriving illicit market. There have also been several toxic spills that have threatened the environmental well-being of the area. The spills, which have killed thousands of fish and wildlife as well as plant life, have increased with the drilling activity, environmentalists and energy watchdog groups say. Between 2006 and 2014, an estimated 5.9 million gallons of oil have been spilled in North Dakota along with 11.8 million gallons of brine, a wastewater byproduct of fracking. Unlike some of the upstream tribes, the Standing Rock Sioux so far has refused any drilling or pipe operations on their land. There are currently 55 pipeline applications that would propose crossing Lakota country, according to the tribe. The spill sent 3 million gallons of so-called wastewater into the river, a toxic byproduct of mining operations from several generations ago. The Navajo Nation, which the river runs through, declared a state of emergency, vowed to hold the EPA financially responsible for cleanup costs on their reservation and demanded that the agency provide the tribe with fresh water until the river was safe to drink from. Already facing extreme health issues including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, nutritional deficiencies and a lack of access to quality direct care, the tribe has been further affected by the loss of state resources being syphoned away toward the growing populations of the drilling towns. She shook her head in worry at the long-term health costs. For Standing Rock, already hampered by deep poverty and need, the struggle to protect the environment is as much about reclaiming its past as it is its future. And we need clean drinking water. We need the land to continue to live. Abject poverty on most of the reservations is gut wrenching and indicative of a host of social issues. The fates of many small cities and towns in that region have been tied to the extraction of natural resources like crude oil and lumber. In many places, the growl of lumber mills have long gone quiet. In Reedsport, Oregon, about an hour and a half west of Eugene, nearly one out of four residents also lives below the poverty line. The other three states were in the South. They are often stories of self-sacrifice and benevolence, a search for harmony and in some, a great flood and new beginnings. Of the birth of the sun, the wind and water, sometimes drowning the earth to beget a new world. In so many ways the Pick-Sloan flooding did just that. Community leader and historian, LaDonna Brave Bull, Fort Yates, Sioux County, North Dakota. Brave Bull spoke from a grassy hill overlooking a small valley and a winding stretch of the Missouri River, the big sky over the reservation lit in hues of orange with magenta. She walked through the grass, the tips of the stalks tickling her calves as she took in all the beauty that remained despite the years of devastation the molested river has caused. The historically tense relationship between Indian tribes and the federal government has been manifest in many ways. But for many native people alive today, it has been the relationship with the Army Corps of Engineers that gives them fits. Indeed, the flooding under the Pick-Sloan Plan was engineered by Lewis Pick, then director of the Corps Missouri River office, and William Sloan, director of the Montana office of the Bureau of Reclamation. Even with controversial projects and outcomes, the Corps has always enjoyed wide bipartisan support in Congress, Grunwald said. The Corps controls the dams and the raising and lowering of the Missouri River levels. Each time the Corps manipulates the river levels, the remnants of the old villages that once lined the river bottom are dislodged. That includes pottery, tools and the remains of Lakota ancestors. Throughout the year, volunteer teams head out to where someone reports seeing human remains, in order to rebury them in proper fashion. Walking along a stretch of the river on a recent afternoon, tribal archaeologist Kelly Morgan pointed to the river bank which she said had been pushed dozens of yards. Each layer, she said, contains calling cards from the ancestors. Her elders would take Brave Bull and her siblings out into the grass at night to lie beneath the stars and connect with the spirits and to listen to the whistling and singing of the wild. She remembers the buffalo, the beautiful beasts whose numbers have been thinned astronomically over the decades. A buffalo killed for food and ceremony in Fort Yates, Sioux County, North Dakota. So much of who the Lakota are is tied to the buffalo, which had once been a source of food, shelter, clothing and energy. The way of the buffalo also shaped the way the Lakota set up their family structure, one shared by proximity to and nourished by extended relatives. But as the buffalo have become an endangered lot, so too have the Lakota as the forces of time and development (or the lack thereof) have closed in on them. Because of heavy natural minerals in the groundwater on the reservation, good water is hard to find. The river is increasingly threatened and good groundwater exists below the same land that many of the big industrial developers are salivating to seize. Nobody. A Radical Idea Chase Iron Eyes, a young activist and lawyer who has become something of a thorn in the sides of local tribal politicians, walked through the Sioux Village housing projects where he spent part of his youth. A gaggle of smiling, scruffy young children surrounded him almost immediately, some wrapping their arms around him while others peppered him with inquiries about going on a bike ride or run with him the next day. A couple asked for money. Since moving back to the reservation from Colorado more than a year ago with his wife, Sarah Jumping Eagle, a local pediatrician, Iron Eyes has become something of a prodigal son. He ended up spending a short stretch in prison for a house break-in he committed while blinded by alcohol. He emerged sober and with his eyes wide open to what he needed to do. More than anything, he said he wanted to return to the reservation and help spark some sort of change to break the cycle. Winter counts are calendars in which histories are recorded by pictures, with one picture for each year. They are called waniyetu wowapi by the Lakota. He helped push for a Lakota language immersion school for young children. He started the Last Real Indians blog and website aimed at progressive young Indians. Iron Eyes, some elders say, is smart but rebellious, sometimes abrasive. But I just want something practical that says we are our own nation and we can provide for ourselves. One by one though, Chase is trying to shake awake tribal members. But his plan has a few hurdles and hiccups. Many have balked at the idea, linking industrial hemp to its more illicit cousin, marijuana. And, as Iron Eyes put it, the establishment is too scared to shake things up on behalf of the tribe. Iron Eyes has started a petition to force a hearing by the Tribal Council on a handful of referendums he hopes will be introduced during the upcoming elections. He needs 450 signatures to force the hearing. In recent weeks, he was just a few dozen away. On that day at the housing projects he knocked on doors and explained to folks what he was trying to do and how he planned on achieving it. In the couple hours he spent that day going door to door or catching people in their yards, not a single person refused to sign. We lost our natural medicines, farmland, and fertile river bottom land. Harvested wheat fields outside of Prescott, Walla Walla County, Wash. Hunger in the National Interest Phyllis Young, the tribal councilwoman, said staving off growing inequality on the reservation will take more than just a magic bullet. Having served four years on the council, she said she sees just how limited the tribal government is in effectuating meaningful change. She said she hopes that now, piggybacking on a wave of activism across the country calling for a reevaluation of how America values people of color, that now is a time for Indians to come together and demand the same. At the center of that fight, she said, are the rights of indigenous people to have full agency over the protection of its land and water. The memories of January 1960, of the water rising and of the waste left in its wake, are never far from her mind. She recalls heading into the hills with her family, all 23 members including relatives. With nowhere else to go they headed up into the hills of Fort Yates proper, they made a home out of one of the abandoned military barracks that her father had renovated. Having relatives is wealth. In the years to come, her family would struggle to get back on its feet both physically and emotionally, a fate replicated over and again for displaced families. The sacrifices made were great, matched only by the struggle of trying to cobble a life in the new, post-flood world. The depth of their despair took root in new ways as the world outside of the reservation continued to advance and grow as the tribe struggled to achieve the most basic semblance of stability. My uncles, my dad, my brother all fought in the military for the United States. We pledged allegiance, we were good Americans and we gave all that we could give to our country and more. She paused for a long minute, reflecting on an old photo of President John F. Kennedy standing on the Oahe Dam during its official dedication in 1962 before more than 10,000 people. Young balked.
