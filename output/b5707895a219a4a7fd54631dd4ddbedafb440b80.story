President Trump's latest budget plan is a disaster. On top of that, Trump wants new legislation that would allow polluting corporations to block new health and safety standards and dodge responsibility for the environmental damage they cause. Congress has a responsibility to stop these dangerous proposals in their tracks. Tell your senators and representative to oppose Trump's cuts and stand up for our environment and our health. Tell Congress to oppose President Trump's new budget, which offers colossal tax breaks to corporations in exchange for devastating cuts that threaten our clean air and water, our national parks and wildlands, our clean energy future and more. It's a blatant giveaway to corporate polluters at the expense of the American people. I urge you to do everything you can to oppose Trump's budget proposals and to ensure no anti-environmental riders are added to the budget by your congressional colleagues. The president's environmental assault includes a dirty budget proposal that drastically cuts nearly every agency that impacts our environment and health. We cannot let that happen, and I'm counting on you to make your voice -- and the voices of us, your constituents -- heard. Please stand strong against big polluters and fight to stop Trump's dangerous budget plan in its tracks. Thank you. Click here. Yes, I agree. Keep me updated with emails.
