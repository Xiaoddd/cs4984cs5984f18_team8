The event was called Big Yellow Taxi and included Adeem The Artist, Daje Morris, Luke Brogdon, and the Nashville-based Kiely Schlesinger. Each artist played one Joni Mitchell song that was meaningful to them. Her voice is amazing, and the setting was perfect for her to showcase it. Adeem, who closed out the night was also a witty, engaging emcee between sets introducing the other acts. The Central Collective was filled with rows of folding chairs, and the chairs were filled with butts. It was a full room, but a wonderfully intimate setting. The whole thing was played completely unplugged. No speakers. No cords. Just people and instruments playing to an attentive crowd. It was sublime. According to Adeem, there will be another show in this format in January, so definnitely keep an eye out for that. It would be so easy to gloss over the link between the cause and the name of the event. I almost did. Very honored to be a part of this community. If you haven't seen what's going on with that whole situation, you can learn more about that here, here, and here.
