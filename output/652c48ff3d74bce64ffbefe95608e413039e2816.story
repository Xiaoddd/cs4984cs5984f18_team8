You are in my thoughts and prayers. May G-d be with you always keeping you safe from harm. The Emergency Proclamation cited above is not in a truthful light. The Executive Order 2016-08 is not a threat. This is a legal statement as the Corps has been providing this information all along. The second WHEREAS is true, but still managed by the Corps. The fourth WHEREAS has also been recognized by appropriate entities through the months of this protest. The fifth WHEREAS is totally in the wrong context in accordance with the United States Constitution that protects other American citizens and clearly should have been discussed by all appropriate entities before inserted in this Emergency Proclamation. The Executive Order 20160-08 is a government-to-government document that is to be negotiated under Art. IV, Section 1(a). The seventh WHEREAS is not true due to a meeting of appropriate entities withdrew the State Law Enforcement directive and should have been corrected. The embarrassing element to this protest turned FUBAR (perfectly describes this current status of the protest by a veteran on my face book) is the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal government, a supposedly SOVEREIGN Nation within a Nation crying for help to the United Nations and the President. This entire protests is against the desecration of burial grounds and cultural sites. Lena Toledo 2 years ago Ms. Lessne, I never have responded to any comments as we do all have first amendment rights. I do want to encourage you to report me please. You live off the reservation and I have lived here for the past 50 years. Enid Lessne 2 years ago Lena Toledo, I have read the Sioux Constitution in its entirety. The Sioux Council is accountable to all residents of the Sioux Districts when allocating funds, using resources, selling a property, etc. I suggest you read your own Constitution in its entirety. I strongly recommend that you get involved in your own destiny on the Reservation, and not complain to those of us who have ABSOLUTELY NO JURISDICTION in Reservation laws. Your Constitution also allows you to have a Council person dismissed for illegal or unethical behavior. I want to read his or her comment. Enid Lessne 2 years ago Lena Toledo, Another thing Ms. Toledo- your prior posts were barely intelligible, and your recent comments are quite lucid. I have read the entire North Dakota Sioux Nation Constitution. I have read parts of the U. S. Constitution. I have complete comprehension of all that I have read in those two Constitutions. When someone does say something, however, they should be ready, willing and able to give sources to validate what they said. Lena Toledo 2 years ago Sending my heartfelt gratitude.
