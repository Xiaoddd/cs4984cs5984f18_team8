Your FOIA request asked for the following: Any communications, reports, contracts, or agreements that were made between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. concerning the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline through the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. There is no contract between the Omaha District, Corps of Engineers and Energy Transfer Partners concerning the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline nor is there any agreement. However, portions of the pipeline require permits under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. In addition, 33 U.S.C. Section 408 requires the Corps to give permission for Transfer Energy Partners to modify or occupy federal land beneath Lake Oahe by placing the pipeline there. Finally, the pipeline may not cross under Lake Oahe until the Corps executes an easement for its placement and operation. These permits, permissions and outgrants are necessary for only a small fraction of the overall pipeline. Please be more specific in describing the documents you are requesting. Once we receive more specific information from you on what you are requesting, we will attempt to give you an estimate of the cost to process your request. Thank you. In looking at your website, it appears you have a commercial interest in the information you have requested. You charge customers to make FOIA requests on their behalf. It is our determination, you are a commercial requester. Files There are no files associated with this request. Email Icon resembling an envelope.
