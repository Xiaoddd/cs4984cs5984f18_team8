A North Dakota sheriff on Monday dismissed a deadline from the Army Corps of Engineers as a meaningless move aimed only at reducing the government's legal responsibility for hundreds of demonstrators. The order includes the encampment called Oceti Sakowin, or Seven Council Fires camp. The agency cited North Dakota's oncoming winter and increasingly contentious clashes between protesters and police. Anyone on land north of the river, including the main protest camp, after the deadline may be prosecuted for trespassing. But the order didn't specify any action to be taken against protesters who don't comply, and state Emergency Services spokeswoman Cecily Fong later said no action would be taken to enforce it. The 1,172-mile pipeline is nearly complete except for a small section beneath a Missouri River reservoir near the encampment, which is about 50 miles south of Bismarck. They also believe the land near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers is still rightfully owned by the Standing Rock Sioux under a nearly 150-year-old treaty. The agency's later announcement that it would not forcibly evict any demonstrators dampened hopes that the issue would soon be resolved, Morton County Commission Chairman Cody Schulz said. The sheriff said state and local officials lack jurisdiction to remove the protesters. During a news conference Saturday at the camp, protest organizers said they will not leave or stop their acts of civil disobedience. North Dakota's notoriously brutal winters may help empty the camp of protesters, many of them who are from out of state, Kirchmeier said. Much of the state, including the encampment, was getting hit with the first big winter storm of the year Monday, as heavy snow and strong winds pounded the area. The sheriff said snowplow crews were working to clear roads throughout the county, but about a mile of a state highway leading to the encampment was being left unplowed. Law enforcement vehicles arrive at the closed Dakota Access pipeline protest camp near Cannon Ball, N.D. on Feb. 23, 2017.
