For starters, an order by the Army Corps of Engineers that was later dismissed stated that protesters would be forcibly removed or prosecuted for trespassing if they remained at the camps after December 5th. This may be because neither the state nor the Army Corps of Engineers wants to assume responsibility for removing the protectors, but this benefits the people that plan on continuing the protest throughout the winter season. By formally demanding a complete evacuation, the state is not held responsible for the deteriorating health of protesters caused by weather. Many speculate that this order will have little to no immediate effect on the water protectors, because federal officials would need to get involved if there were going to be any sort of removal. State and local officials are unable to forcibly remove people, except for when they are arresting them. This could prove to be a significant problem for protesters as their ability to access their own camps may dwindle. Since the investors behind the Dakota Access Pipeline lose more money as the protest goes on, drastic measures are being employed to strongly encourage protesters to abandon their efforts. However, a steadfast dedication to this cause that native people and other environmentalists are so passionate about has kept the effort going thus far. Hopefully, this passion will be enough to propel the protest through the hardest months of the year in North Dakota. We gather the news and films as we search the web and present them to our viewers.
