WE HAVE DELIVERED THIS PETITION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THANKS TO ALL WHO SIGNED. Standing Rock Needs a Lifeline, Not a Deadline. THIS PETITION IS NOW CLOSED. WE HAVE DELIVERED THIS PETITION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THANKS TO ALL WHO SIGNED. The Obama administration can bring an end to the construction of this pipeline that has trampled on Native rights, desecrated sacred lands, threatened the Missouri River, and unleashed an appalling militarized response. As many of you know, the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers and the Governor of North Dakota have issued eviction orders for the largest resistance camp opposing the pipeline. In response to an eviction deadline of December 5th, the statement below calls upon Obama to extend a lifeline by stopping construction. Our goal is to have more than a thousand faith leaders sign this statement that will be publicly released on the morning of the deadline. Please correctly spell out the full address, and do not abbreviate (for example, spell out SAINT PAUL instead of St. Paul). Please refrain from including any extra dashes or symbols when you enter your street address. Adding your name to the petition ...
