Stop the pipeline; Iowa is a wind energy state Jerry Kahl, Storm Lake, Letter to the Editor Published 4:19 p.m. CT Dec. 16, 2016 Buy Photo A crew positions pipe segments near Baxter, Iowa, on Tuesday Aug 16, 2016. Workers have to bend the pipe to match the contour of the land before welding and burying the sections. Workers clear and grade the land, bend pipe and dig trenches in countryside outside Newton just north of Interstate-80. Wind power is economically viable and good for the future of Iowa, the nation and the planet. Oil plays a fundamental role in today's world but it is not in the best economic interest of Iowa and should not flow through our state.
