The killings occurred between 1918 and 1931 and may have involved hundreds of deaths. avid Grann was already interested in writing a book about the serial murders of members of the Oklahoma-based Osage Indian tribe when he visited the Osage Nation Museum. On one wall was a panoramic photo of members of the tribe taken in 1924, but there was a panel missing. Author of the 2009 bestseller The Lost City of Z, about the search for a vanished civilization in the Amazon (the film version debuted April 14), Grann tells an entirely different story in his latest work, one that has elements of the Wild West, classic gangster movies, the birth of the FBI, greed, and racism. However, it was racism that made these killings nonchalant, and allowed them to go on for years. What is amazing is how some of the killers did not equate killing a Native American with murder. This gave the unscrupulous the incentive to bump off Indians and take over their oil leases. Grann says he first heard about this forgotten episode when a historian mentioned the killings. So many of them have stories that have not been told, so many of them are chasing ghosts. What Grann discovered, in fact, was that despite FBI intervention, which eventually put Hale and another killer behind bars, many of the murders remain unsolved. Yet that did not stop the young J. Edgar Hoover from touting the convictions as a public relations coup for the Bureau. Grann is a New Yorker staff writer who hit it big with The Lost City of Z, which became a number one New York Times paperback bestseller and was translated into 20 languages. Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections: For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S., particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century. The comments of our readers are the most vibrant, best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News. Accordingly, we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services. It is, however, important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in. Adapt and overcome.
