Plans had called for the pipeline to pass very near the reservation of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose leaders have repeatedly expressed fears that a spill could threaten the water supplies of their people. Advertisement The line also would have passed beneath a dammed section of Lake Oahe that tribes say is near sacred burial sites.

President-elect Donald Trump has said he supports finishing the project. Trump owns stock in the company building the pipeline but has said his support has nothing to do with his investment. What started as a small but fierce protest in a remote spot along the Missouri River months ago has evolved into an epic standoff involving hundreds of tribes, various celebrities, and activists. About 250 military veterans joined the protest Sunday. Environmental groups that protested alongside the tribes also rejoiced at the decision. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and its allies in the environmental and activist movements had said they were doing just that: using Lake Oahe in North Dakota as a place to take a stand by setting up camps and obstructing roads to block the Dakota Access Pipeline and its owner, Energy Transfer Partners. The pipeline, if completed, would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal in Illinois. At 30 inches in diameter, it could transport an estimated 470,000 barrels of oil per day. Army officials said the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an environmental-impact statement with full public input and analysis, a process likely to take many months. Energy Transfer Partners had said it was unwilling to reroute the project. The federal government had ordered people to leave the main encampment, which is on Army Corps of Engineers land, by Monday. But demonstrators said they were prepared to stay, and authorities said they would not forcibly remove them. About 250 members of the group Veterans Stand for Standing Rock gathered earlier Sunday about a mile from the Oceti Sakowin, or Seven Council Fires, camp. Art Grayson, 29, of Cambridge, Mass., a Navy veteran and Harvard graduate student, told the Associated Press that he came to the camp as part of the veterans group because he thought the demonstrators could use his help. Grayson said he flew to the state, then met with other veterans and rode the final leg of the trip from Bismarck in a pickup truck. Jo-Ellen Darcy said she based her decision on a need to explore alternate routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing. Her office had announced on November 14, 2016 that it was delaying the decision on the easement to allow for discussions with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation lies 0.5 miles south of the proposed crossing. Tribal officials have expressed repeated concerns over the risk that a pipeline rupture or spill could pose to its water supply and treaty rights. Darcy said that the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an Environmental Impact Statement with full public input and analysis. The Dakota Access Pipeline is an approximately 1,172 mile pipeline that would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Pakota, Illinois. The pipeline is 30 inches in diameter and is projected to transport approximately 470,000 barrels of oil per day, with a capacity as high as 570,000 barrels. Real journalism.
