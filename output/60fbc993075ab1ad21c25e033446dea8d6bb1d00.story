In the decade following the 1974 Boldt decision, the treaty tribes in western Washington quickly realized their treaty rights would be meaningless without fish. The biggest threat to salmon was the destruction of salmon habitat, so the tribes filed suit against the state of Washington. From the Seattle Times. The organizations include Weyerhauser, I.T.T., Puget Sound Power & Light, Seattle First National Bank (Sea-First), Intalco Aluminum, Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical and Rainier National Bank. This negotiate and litigate strategy raised the ire of tribal leaders that had just spent decades litigating their right to fish at all. So, they got to work. One Alaska Native Corporation, threatened to sever ties with Sea-First, putting millions more at risk for the bank. It was seconded and passed unanimously. The plane had yet to touch down in the Northwest when the phone rang. Mike Berry, president of Seafirst Bank, was desperate. They agreed to meet at the bank headquarters on 4th Avenue in downtown Seattle. You have to start moving forward with recognition of the tribes and the treaty in the Northwest, and lay out an agenda we can follow. Recognize this treaty is here to stay, and get away from trying to abrogate it. The talk opened the discussion to co-management. The bankers agreed to testify against bills proposed by Slade Gorton and Don Bonker to abrogate treaties. Jack Larsen from Weyerhauser took the lead in changing course. He turned out to be a thoughtful and reasonable guy, with no previous anti-treaty baggage. Things started to improve once Billy got a seat at the table, and Jim Waldo found his niche as the go-to guy for keeping folks talking instead of litigating. The Muckleshoot Tribe recently voted to cut ties with one of those banks, Wells Fargo. The City of Seattle and other non-tribal governments are also taking a look at their investments.
