On a November morning at the height of the Standing Rock standoff, dozens of anti-pipeline protesters stripped off their parkas and dog-paddled in their underwear across the Cantapeta Creek, an icy ribbon of water that wends into the Missouri River. As police assembled on the opposite bank, fingering rifles and tear-gas canisters, Lorenzo Serna, a co-founder of the media collective Unicorn Riot, leaped into the water. He wore black shorts and a helmet with a GoPro4 Plus camera mounted on it. The scene he captured was emblematic of the confrontation in North Dakota: When the protesters had nearly reached the shore, the police unleashed torrents of tear gas into their eyes as they shivered in waist-deep waves. It also found trouble: Serna will stand trial in North Dakota on May 5 for trespassing and rioting charges stemming from his coverage. The name Unicorn Riot captured the absurdity of their ambitions. In one video from November 2015, co-founder Niko Georgiades interviewed white supremacist Allen Scarsella at a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Minneapolis. Four days later Scarsella returned and shot five African American protesters. Today, the collective has a revolving cast of about 18 producers and writers who swap hosting duties. Being able to tell the story in the way that we want to brings me joy. I first met Serna a few days after the confrontation at Cantapeta Creek. Serna, who met me there, wore his black coils of hair tamped down beneath a ball cap. He sometimes used a car battery to charge his video camera. Their latest video had garnered nearly 4 million views. Unicorn Riot on the ground at Standing Rock Unicorn Riot Less hearty journalists had a more difficult time handling the harsh conditions at Standing Rock. On the hill, solar panels powered a couple dozen outlets reserved for credentialed journalists, who were mostly white, and mostly just dropping in for the weekend. Unicorn Riot was accepted within the camp to a degree few non-Native journalists were. One morning I happened upon Serna as he climbed out of his tent. The man was on guard duty at Red Warrior Camp, a fenced compound of militant activists that journalists were forbidden to enter. The peculiarities and challenges of reporting at Standing Rock made it the perfect environment in which Unicorn Riot could thrive. Because their costs were so low, its reporters could stay put even when things were calm and the mainstream media had left. The only way to effectively cover Standing Rock, Unicorn Riot discovered, was to occupy it. Yet in the eyes of the police, to do so erased the distinction between journalist and protester. And when it was, it made for great video. Schiano called the press number given out by the county, but no one answered. The media area was more than 100 yards from the entrance to the main protest camp, and far from view of the arrests that local, state and federal police carried out. Unicorn Riot was inside the camp, filming as plywood shacks and tents were set aflame by activists unwilling to let police demolish what had been their homes for months, as cops in full riot gear pointed loaded guns at men holding a sage-burning ceremony, and as officers chased and tackled a man, allegedly breaking his hip. It was a bitter moment: For 10 months, Unicorn Riot had helped show the world what was going on at Standing Rock; in its final days, Standing Rock helped show the world what Unicorn Riot was capable of as a media organization. Today, Serna, Schiano, and the collective are pursuing new projects while trekking back to North Dakota for court dates. Serna is spending time on the US-Mexico border reporting on immigration. One correspondent is in Chile covering clashes between university students and police. They plan to reach out more into music and cultural coverage. They entertain the idea of having a Unicorn Riot collective in every American city.
