Establishment politicians are a vastly greater threat to national security than any hacker ever could be. This is nuts. I just fixed your national security problem, America. Boom. Solved. You should peruse them if you ever get the chance, because they paint a much more complete picture of who these establishment politicians are as people. Nowhere did I ever see an email in which Clinton campaign staff discussed ways of helping people, or doing something in the name of honesty, or because it was the right thing to do. If you want national security, fire every politician who is willing to sell the American people down the river to prop up the Walmart economy and start wars to prop up the U.S. dollar instead of doing the right thing and getting us out of this neoliberal nightmare. Stop electing people who see government transparency as a terrifying threat that will cost them elections instead of something they should be giving the American people themselves voluntarily.
