Several Sioux tribes have legally challenged the Army Corps twice before, but failed to prove the controversial pipeline could hurt historic sites and spoil sacred waters, specifically the Missouri River and Lake Oahe, which are key to their religious practices. This time, however, Boasberg acknowledged that the federal permits, which were granted by Trump's executive order in January, broke the law in some aspects. The president had ordered the corps to expedite permits, enabling the pipeline to cross the Missouri River, upstream of the Standing Rock reservation. Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II hailed the judge's decision as a major victory. For now, though, the pipeline is still allowed to operate until Boasberg reviews further briefings from both parties in hearings starting on June 21. After months of protest, the pipeline started pumping commercially on June 1, sending domestic crude oil through an 1,170-mile pipeline from North Dakota's Bakken oil fields to Illinois. In March, its systems spilled more than 100 gallons of oil in two separate incidents in North Dakota as crews readied it for its debut. The line also leaked 84 gallons in South Dakota in April. Thousands of people had camped out to protest the pipeline and its possible effects on water quality and to support the tribe. In December, the Army Corps of Engineers said they would no longer allow the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe, a victory for protesters. That decision was reversed after President Trump took office, and on February 22, the final protesters were removed from the campsite. It was dead 120 days ago, and now it officially just opened for business. Submit it here.
