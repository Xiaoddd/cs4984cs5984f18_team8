By Camille Erickson The fight to protect Water Protectors who face state and federal charges from the Indigenous-led Dakota Access Pipeline resistance at Standing Rock is far from over. Beginning in 2016, the WPLC provided legal support on the front lines of the Dakota Access Pipeline resistance at Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. Led by Executive Director Terry Janis (Oglala Lakota), the organization continues to provide accessible criminal defense and legal representation in state and federal court at no cost to Native and non-Native Water Protectors. Stretching over 1,170 miles across the Midwest, the pipeline cuts directly through sacred land and threatens to contaminate the drinking water for both the Standing Rock Sioux and over 17 million people along the Missouri River. Yet, Water Protectors faced violent responses from private security forces and arrest from law enforcement during their encampment. Mounting tensions came to a head on September 3, 2016, when security guards used dogs to attack Water Protectors, harming at least six people. Private security also pepper-sprayed 30 people. As a member of the WPLC legal team, Carter remains fiercely committed to Indigenous rights. She arrived at Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in October 2016 from California to provide legal support. She watched the camp rapidly grow as thousands of Water Protectors, galvanized by the movement, poured into North Dakota from across the globe. As the camp swelled with people, arrests of Water Protectors, coupled with police and security misconduct, only increased with charges, including trespassing, resisting arrest, and participating in a riot. In one month alone, Water Protectors were met with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber pellets, sound cannons, and arrest from law enforcement in its attempts to evacuate individuals occupying roads near the camp. On Oct. 27, 2016, during a confrontation, 147 Water Protectors were arrested and some slapped with felony charges of Civil Disorder and Use of Fire to Commit a Federal Felony Offense. The following month, Brandy Toelupe, an attorney with WPLC, described the conditions arrestees endured following their arrest that day. Former Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault also submitted a complaint to the Department of Justice. In the wake of these mass arrests, what started as an informal legal tent at the camp quickly grew into a tenacious organization defending hundreds of lives afflicted by persecution. Over the course of a year, the number of Water Protectors facing state charges ballooned to 835 people. An urgency developed to formalize the legal entity into a fiscally sponsored nonprofit organization. WPLC now leads the fight to protect each of the individuals who were charged. While the organization maintains on-the-ground operations in North Dakota, its support for these hundreds of legal cases reaches far beyond state lines. As of June 5, 2018, of the 835 state cases, 664 cases have been concluded, with a majority of them dismissed (333) and acquitted (24). 19 defendants have been convicted on the state level. To her, these victories set a precedent for future movements for Indigenous rights. On May 24, a charge against Water Protector Peji Hota Win (Saige Pourier) was dismissed in court. Two days prior, her two other charges were also dismissed. As an indigenous person we know this system is unjust, so to be able to walk away with this victory is a victory for us all. Challenges of caseload, geography, and bias WPLC sees accessible and free legal representation as a vital need to justice, and it remains resolute in protecting the most vulnerable. Still, in the case of Standing Rock charges, its ability to obtain effective representation for Water Protectors was outmatched by the state. As soon as attorneys began taking on cases in defense of Water Protectors in 2016, geography became a challenge. WPLC knew immediately that the quantity of cases far outstripped the supply of licensed attorneys in the state who could effectively represent the accused. In December 2016, WPLC filed a petition in the North Dakota Supreme Court to revise the pro hac vice statutes, thereby enabling out-of-state attorneys not licensed to practice in North Dakota to represent Water Protectors facing state criminal cases. Last September, judges asked the North Dakota Supreme Court to reverse the special provision that admitted out-of-state attorneys. The judges were denied this request. Despite the ruling in their favor, WPLC has continued their steep climb to obtain justice for Water Protectors in North Dakota. There have also been repeated legislative attempts to change laws that would increase penalties for mass mobilization efforts, such as protests and expressions of dissent. Trumped-up charges and penalties against Water Protectors also have ramifications on future movement building. The stakes are high. Since late 2016, the National Lawyers Guild reports that 58 anti-protest bills have been put forward in 31 U.S. states. In the North Dakota Legislature, a bill was introduced to eliminate any liability for drivers who harm protesters occupying public roads. The bill did not pass, but these efforts point to a systematic effort to further criminalize peaceful dissent and First Amendment rights. The justice system disproportionately targets Native lives. Implicit bias in the courtrooms of North Dakota runs deep, too. To Carter, the most significant challenge was the implicit bias she witnessed against Water Protectors in the criminal justice system, public opinion, and police force in North Dakota. Having witnessed Little Feather navigate the criminal justice system, she thinks the bias they experienced stems in part from the high number of North Dakota residents depending on extractive industries for their livelihood. Given these barriers, WPLC continues to recruit attorneys from across the country to defend Water Protectors. Water Protectors with federal charges face high risk These challenges extend to Water Protectors facing charges on the federal level. On May 30, Little Feather, a member of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, was sentenced to 36 months in federal prison in a non-cooperating plea agreement. Incarcerated since March 9, 2017, he is the first Water Protector to have a federal case conclude with substantial prison time. In this historic movement moment it is critical to maintain solidarity with those who stepped up and are now being targeted as leaders. The legacy of genocide and broken treaties has shown us that when indigenous people stand up to protect the water and the land from the colonization of resources, we will always be met with repression and violence. Even if Water Protectors have a strong basis to fight their cases in court, the looming threat of high penalties discourages people from going to trial. The federal cases have often resulted in non-cooperating pretrial resolution offers, which mitigate the risk of high penalties and save defendants from the cumbersome psychological and financial consequences of sitting through unpredictable trials. According to WPLC, over 90 percent of state criminal cases in the United States are resolved without trial, either with a plea deal or a postponed dismissal agreement. Although WPLC has significant grounds to fight these cases in court, the organization is dedicated to ensuring that Water Protectors with open cases are aware of and can choose from as many positive options as possible. In April, WPLC announced its development of a new strategic plan. It hopes to gather input from Indigenous communities and allies about what future legal organizations serving movements to advance Indigenous sovereignty and rights should look like. In the meantime, WPLC is committed to fighting the 171 ongoing cases on behalf of Water Protectors. Free WordPress Theme created with by WPIon.
