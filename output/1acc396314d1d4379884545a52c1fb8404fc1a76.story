Tensions over the Dakota Access oil pipeline flared again Sunday when North Dakota law enforcement used water cannons to disperse a group of about 400 protesters trying to move past a barricaded bridge toward construction sites for the project. As temperatures in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, dropped into the 20s, police in riot gear sprayed activists with a hose mounted atop an armored vehicle and formed a line to prevent them from advancing up the road, according to the Bismarck Tribune. Protesters also reported being pelted with rubber bullets, tear gas and concussion grenades during the standoff, which lasted until late Sunday night and resumed on Monday morning. A grainy Facebook Live video from the scene shows throngs of people gathered around the Backwater Bridge on Highway 1806, with floodlights shining down on the grass and road below and a haze of smoke and water vapor rising near police vehicles. The clashes began around 6 p.m., when protesters tried to remove burned-out trucks that had been blocking the bridge since authorities and activists faced off there in late October. Police have since set up wire and concrete barriers on the bridge, which is about a mile south of where the pipeline developer plans to drill. Authorities responded after protesters moved one of the trucks blocking the road. At least one person was arrested, the sheriff's department said. One of the protest organizers, Dallas Goldtooth, said protesters started small fires in the area to help warm people who had been sprayed with water. He told the Tribune that some activists tried to remove the burned-out trucks to expose the heavily armed authorities behind them. Another organizer, Tara Houska, told the Tribune that more than 200 people were hit with tear gas, pepper spray or water from the hose. Organizers said the Cannon Ball gym was being used for emergency relief, with medics from the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes treating people who were injured in the standoff. Protesters and police massed at the bridge again Monday morning. The Associated Press reported that the protesters went back to the camp later in the day at the request of Standing Rock Sioux elders after reports of firearms in the crowd. The sheriff's department said that water cannons were brought in to control the crowds and extinguish fires set by protesters. The sheriff's department told the Tribune that the bridge has been closed since October because transportation officials were concerned about its structural integrity. Construction is nearly complete, but a planned segment of the project that crosses under the Missouri River has been a source of contention for months. The Standing Rock Sioux argue that the pipeline cuts within a mile of their reservation and could pollute water and disrupt cultural sites. The tribe has challenged the project in court, and protesters have camped out near the Missouri River site for months. Energy Transfer Partners, the project developer, says the pipeline transports oil more safely than trucks and will not harm sacred lands. Support independent, local journalism in Alaska.
