Liberal Leaders Make Statements From White Supremacy. The Climate Movement Is Indigenous-led 0 By Liz Conor on December 2, 2016 Environment Dr Liz Conor pays tribute to the resistance against the Dakota Access Pipeline, and Indigenous people the world over who are leading the fight for climate action. In 1923, Iroquois chief Deskaheh travelled to Geneva to present the grievances of his Six Nations people. In the decades that followed, growing recognition of shared regimes of oppression in located struggles under the same structure of settler-colonialism (rather than unrelated events) deepened the transnational ties around Indigenous and First Nation as global identifications. In far-flung but linked sites, Indigenous peoples are fighting, yet again, for their very lives and the land that sustains them. Lock the Gate is presently advising an Indigenous coalition in the NT on CSG campaigning. Anti-racist solidarities are increasingly expressed around resource protection and climate change. Over 300 Native American Nations have now converged at the site near Sioux lands at Standing Rock Indian Reservation. The camp is arguably distinct from the blockades of the environment movement, such as the Franklin River blockade in 1982 and the more recent sustained blockades at the Leard State Forest against the Maules Ck Coal mine. Rather their struggle is for water. The resistance by the Oceti Sakowin and other Native American nations is primarily about heritage, water and sovereignty. Greenpeace, the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth. The erasure of Indigenous presence and agency in environmental struggles has been significantly challenged over the last decade. The struggle is presented as a continuum of settler-colonial misappropriation and befouling of resources at Standing Rock. Water Protectors have been attacked by the National Guard with rubber bullets, tear gas, mace canisters and water cannons in freezing temperatures leading to dozens of cases of hypothermia. Razor wire has been laid on the banks of Cantapeta Creek. Expressions of Indigenous pact with the Oceti Sakowin are pouring in from around the world. Australian Aboriginal climate organisations, such as the highly effective SEED (Indigenous youth climate network) and also Palestine artists have pledged support testifying to the global network of dispossessed linking from located sites of resistance. Israa Suliman, a student and writer in Gaza, penned an open letter that accompanied a video featuring a number of Palestinian artists. And they suffered the same fate as your people. Suliman notes that a large security corporation hired by the pipeline company profits from Israeli prisons. Nor does she fail to draw a parallel to Palestinian expulsion, displacement and occupation, pointing to the five million Palestinian refugees in the global diaspora. This resource deprivation is perpetrated by multinational fossil fuel conglomerates against Indigenous peoples who are simultaneously defending their homelands while carrying the can for the rest of us on the front line of the climate movement. We settlers owe them under new-yet-old sets of circumstances. Race formations are morphing into global Indigenous resistance networks. We owe them, yet again.
