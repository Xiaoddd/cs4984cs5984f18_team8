The IIYC inspires youth to take action in their communities within the framework of environmental, social and indigenous justices: The IIYC protects land, water, and treaty rights. We empower youth to act locally to overturn any and all social and spiritual injustices. We encourage all members to become leaders through Non-Violent Direct Actions and we use creative mediums to advance our voices in decisions being made about the future of indigenous lands. We integrate unique cultural practices and ceremonies into all decisions. Through action and ceremony, the IIYC inspires generations of today to progress humanity forward, taking into consideration the implications our society has on those future generations.
