Home Communities Create Shop The Myth of Thanksgiving Let's stop pretending our nation's history with Native Americans is anything but violent. With the stress of school and this godforsaken election, I am so ready to take a break from classes, spend time with my family, eat good food, and remember all that I have to be grateful for. My parents sent me to a progressive school, and while not perfect (no institution is), I learned from a young age what I now know to be an unusually complete overall history of the United States and to think critically about our cultural traditions. The standard story, as is told across elementary schools in the United States, goes something as follows: When the pilgrims came to America in 1620, they didn't know how to properly farm in these foreign conditions. The Native Americans helped to teach them how to plant their crops, and by November -- through their friendship and teamwork -- they had a successful harvest. They then celebrated by throwing a joint feast, during which turkey was served. Americans have celebrated Thanksgiving ever since. Well, not exactly. There is much debate over what actually transpired in the early 1600s between the pilgrims and the Wampanoag Native Americans. Secondly, while there may have been a three-day feast between Wampanoag people and settlers, it was likely different from what you were taught. There were probably around twice as many Native Americans present than pilgrims, and while they likely ate together it was not at a long wooden table. Most historians believe that the real reason for the gathering was that, after a successful harvest, the pilgrims fired weapons into the sky in celebration. The Wampanoag then decided to investigate to make sure that they were not under attack. When they arrived, they found that the pilgrims were celebrating a successful harvest, and they (likely) all shared in a three-day feast. This supposed three-day feast might have been a nice (impromptu) gesture, but it was followed by centuries of oppression. As you read this, there are thousands of people who, rather than getting revved up to eat turkey, are putting their lives on hold to camp out in the cold and protect their sacred right to clean water. Just this past Sunday night, police officers used freezing cold water, tear gas, and rubber bullets against water protectors, injuring over 150. I hope that every teacher who takes the time to teach their young students about Thanksgiving also finds the time to mention the North Dakota Access Pipeline. The sentiment behind Thanksgiving is lovely. But I refuse to use this holiday as an opportunity to erase the darker moments of our national biography. I refuse to pretend that this nation is built on peace and respect towards others, when it very clearly is not. There are a lot of lessons we can take away from this cherished story: those of welcoming refugees to a new land, reaching out to those who are outwardly different than us, and finding the time to be grateful for all we have. If we take these virtues and put them into action, we may no longer need to recite a misleading historical event to conjure them. technical sections detected. technical sections detected.

Here are 20 Bible verses that remind us of what Thanksgiving is all about: 1) 1 Chronicles 16:34 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever. 2) Colossians 3:15-17 And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. 3) Philippians 4:6 Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. 4) Psalm 30:12 That my glory may sing your praise and not be silent. 6) Hebrews 12:28-29 Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe; for our God is a consuming fire. 8) 1 Timothy 4:4-5 For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with gratitude; for it is sanctified by means of the word of God and prayer. 9) Psalm 28:7 The Lord is my strength and my shield; My heart trusts in Him, and I am helped; Therefore my heart exults, And with my song I shall thank Him. 10) Psalm 100:4 Enter His gates with thanksgiving, And His courts with praise.
