Then Neilan, officially took over the lead guitar role despite his age, less than a third the age of the original squirrel, Ric. Enter Bassist Jacob Botelho, another young talent and the oddest band in the Baystate found the perfect strings to tie them together in unique song form. So the band focuses on creating and recording songs that can not be easily classified. Original, unique, at times, surreal and always passionate, the band has emerged as a prolific song making team mixing the dynamic skills of a bona fide prodigy in young Neilan and the freakish overnight musician Ric and the glue of Lopez and Botelho and you have something so magical it is actually truly nuts. Secretive squirrel on drums, Ric and John Mailloux on guitars.
