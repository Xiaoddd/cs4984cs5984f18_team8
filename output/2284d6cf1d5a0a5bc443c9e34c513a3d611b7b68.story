Mr Puigdemont was making his first trip outside Belgium since his international arrest warrant was lifted by the Spanish Authorities. His arrival comes at a crucial time following the formation of a new government in Spain and just days after it emerged that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has plans to visit Catalonia later this year. Current Catalan President Quim Torra, who was a guest at Bute House last month, was originally intended to appear at the Festival. Instead the Festival organisers confirmed that Mr. Puigdemont will discuss the turbulent political developments that have affected the region and the potential emerging democratic deficit in Europe. He is expected to renew his call for dialogue and proportionality amid tensions between Barcelona and Madrid over the ongoing detention of nine Catalan political prisoners. Last month an attempt by Spanish authorities to extradite the former president of Catalonia ended in failure. A key figure in the Catalan independence campaign, Mr. Puigdemont has been under self-imposed exile in Belgium since last October.
