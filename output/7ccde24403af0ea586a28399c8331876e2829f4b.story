We fought you. We took your land. We signed treaties that we broke. We stole minerals from your sacred hills. It is also no secret that President Elect Trump has been an investor in the pipeline and in companies that will benefit from its building. He has said that he supports the project. Among the veterans at Standing Rock Monday was Bill Means, a Vietnam vet who returned from fighting a bloody U.S. war of aggression overseas to take on the U.S. government at Wounded Knee. Bill Means is a founding member of the International Indian Treaty Council and co-founder of the American Indian Movement (AIM). Means is a key adviser to the Standing Rock Tribe on their resistance to the pipeline. I spoke with him shortly after he met with the Standing Rock leaders this week about future strategies for the tribe on its continuing resistance to the pipeline. ---------------------- Q: Bill Means, it is good to speak with you again. I believe you were in Vietnam with Wesley Clark, Sr. Here you have his son asking for forgiveness. Bill Means: I feel a brotherhood to those veterans. I was there in Vietnam representing the United States, but one of the things that was beautiful about coming home from that terrible war was that our people still honored us, not because we fought for America but because we fought for the honor of our people. When I returned from Vietnam my cousin gave me an Indian name, my friend gave me a horse, and I was welcomed back to the community with open arms. I think that helped us in our healing from what they now call post traumatic stress. I feel proud that these young men decided to come to Standing Rock, and stand with the Oceti Sakowin Camp which in itself was a tremendous show of support. I saw at least ten, twelve charter buses just in one area, filled with veterans. Some of them had their wives, or some were women veterans, some were men from different wars. I met a farmer from Iowa, a World War II veteran, who said he had to join the fight against this black snake, this pipeline, because the corporations had taken his land under what they call eminent domain. But it was for a highway, they took some school or churches. But this is one of those times when generations stand up for what they believe. Not very many times in my lifetime have I been part of such a beautiful, non-violent movement. We kind of faced that here. We had a tremendous amount of old AIMsters, people who had experienced Wounded Knee, and also young people that had only heard about it. But clearer heads prevailed. We want to use prayer. But it was hard to hold back the young troops. They were like a bunch of young colts, ready to charge. I think that was a difficult part of this movement back in our day in the 1960s. The idea of using prayer and non-violence as a weapon was kind of mind blowing, even to the police. And so they incited violence, and even used deadly force, including military-type weapons, and dogs on our people. Not unlike ole Bull Connor who stopped people crossing a bridge with dogs. That frontier mentality is still here, that feeling that anybody that supports Indian people or environmental issues must be a criminal. And so they brought their dogs, and they brought their smoke grenades, and they brought their rubber bullets, and they brought their tear gas... Q: . . . and cages Means:. . . So I think this is a very profound lesson for our people, that again we faced these things but together with peoples from all walks of life we attained a small, temporary victory. Means: Well, I think we have to honor the wishes of the Standing Rock people. To take what they learned here at Standing Rock, to take that medicine feeling of camaraderie, of sacredness, of learning things you learn about how Lakota people look at the elements, that protect our people, like water, like the land. Take what you learned and go back to your community, and in some way teach that to your family, to your church, to whomever that you can reach. They may be called back later. But there is legal strategy in place. There are cases to be fought and won in the courts. And so I think, you know, Standing Rock people have borne the burden of this whole action, and the disruption of their communities, which they supported, almost wholeheartedly, with very little dissent. But yet it is time to honor their wishes, they would like to have their community back, from the people. You know the winter is not as big a deal as everybody says, because Lakota people have been surviving this region since time immemorial. The issue is that we all have a home. Also, all these issues are almost in every state. In fact the girl who had her arm almost blown off was part of a pipeline fight centered around Boston, Massachusetts. She was showing the type of solidarity that we need now to expand this movement. The Navajo Nation, they need help. These people all need help. And through our experiences at Standing Rock we have built expertise. We need to take what people have learned and put it into active use.
