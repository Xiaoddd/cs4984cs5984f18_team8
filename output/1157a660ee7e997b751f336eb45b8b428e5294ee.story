According to the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), there have been more than 220 pipeline incidents in 2016. In a letter to FERC Chairman Norman Bay, Congressman Lynch highlighted the serious public safety risks of placing a natural gas pipeline in densely populated areas such as West Roxbury and Weymouth. In the wake of these explosions, it is reckless for FERC to allow Spectra to proceed with the proposed projects in Weymouth and West Roxbury. On November 16, a natural gas pipeline explosion killed one Ameren Illinois employee and injured twelve people in Canton, Illinois. This follows an October gasoline pipeline explosion in Shelby County, Alabama, which killed one pipeline worker and injured five others, igniting two wildfires that burned over 30 acres of land. In April, a natural gas pipeline in Salem, Pennsylvania, operated by Spectra Energy, exploded injuring one person and damaging two homes. Congressman Lynch's letter highlights the dangerous and costly damage that pipeline explosions have inflicted on communities in 2016 alone. Congressman Lynch is calling on FERC and PHMSA to fully investigate these incidents to determine whether further safety measures need to be adopted prior to approving construction of high pressure natural gas lines in West Roxbury and Weymouth.
