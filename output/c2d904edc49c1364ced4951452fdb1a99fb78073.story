Environmental groups big enough to hire lobbyists get a little something, along with the fossil fuel industry and renewable energy companies. It placates everyone likely to show up at a political fundraiser. The trouble is who gets left out. Convicted former Governor Rod Blagojevich set the template. His Jekyll and Hyde policies included signing a good law to reduce mercury pollution from coal smokestacks but he also passed out hundreds of millions in subsidies to coal mining. One major bill he signed included incentives for renewable energy along with large subsidies for two new coal power plants. The trouble with these groups of stakeholders is that rural downstate is usually represented by the fossil fuel industry and their crony politicians. That includes agreeing to bills with coal mining and plant subsidies, supporting new coal plants, utility rate hikes, and nuclear power subsidies. Rod Blagojevich was also endorsed by Sierra Club after massively subsidizing coal mining, downstate coal boilers, and wrecking the Department of Natural Resources. Compromise is not a bad thing. The trouble is that low-income, rural communities and low-income communities of color on the front lines of fossil fuel pollution are so consistently scarified as areas for easy compromise or used as bargaining chips to get a seat at the table. Hundreds of people came out to hearings in towns not known as hotbeds of environmental activism. Efforts against coal pollution are growing too. Local opposition helped stop several proposed coal plants subsidized by federal stimulus funds. President Obama already tried giving billions to clean coal projects and it was the biggest failure of the federal stimulus. Destructive mining practices and toxic coal ash piles are facing strident local opposition. The West Virginia Democratic Presidential primary is a good example. She publicly apologized to industry stooge Joe Manchin and promised to promote coal mining and clean coal. Bernie Sanders stuck to his message about creating a just transition away from coal and won the West Virginia primary. Southern Illinois Congressman Bill Enyart co-chaired the Congressional Coal caucus. State legislators John Bradley and Gary Forby attracted their first serious opponents in years and lost after their outspoken support for fracking. The only people who base their vote on energy issues are the climate movement and people tied to the fossil fuel industry. Republicans are more convincing as puppets of the fossil fuel industry. Politicians who appeal to both sides of the energy debate lose by alienating everyone on all sides. Election season is time to drag specifics out of candidates running for Governor, Attorney General and other state offices. Democrats are often pushed into supporting fossil fuels by trade unions with members in the fossil fuel industry. But they remain politically powerful through their political funds and organization. I hope one day more trade unions will embrace the idea that a worker whose family is harmed by deadly pollution or a climate disaster has had their rights violated just as much as someone harmed in a workplace accident. Climate disasters caused by new fossil fuel projects will hurt the homes, lives and families of union members just as much as everyone else. Until that change in attitude happens, the climate movement will sometimes be on the opposite side of unions who push 19th century energy sources. Most of the more conservative trades have endorsed JB Pritzker for Governor. The political establishment whine about litmus tests and single issue voters. Those complaints exist to protect politicians, not the climate. We need to ask candidates, publicly, if they will oppose new fossil fuel plants and infrastructure. Clean energy jobs must be directed to former coal communities to create a just transition. No one will be exercising a theoretical right to health care or a living wage after a climate disaster destroys their home, workplace, the nearest hospital and the regional food supply. This is the election year the Illinoisans climate movement stops timidly accepting policies that sacrifice parts of our state and worsen the climate crisis. Give Will Reynolds a round of applause.
