A crude oil pipeline in western North Dakota has been shut down following a leak that spilled oil into a creek, state officials reported Tuesday. It occurred as Native Americans, climate activists and other protesters camped about 200 miles away, at the site of the controversial Dakota Access pipeline project over concerns a leak there could contaminate the water supply. The leak that prompted the shutdown was discovered in a six-inch pipeline operated by Belle Fourche Pipeline Co., the North Dakota Department of Health said. An undetermined amount of crude oil was spilled, the state said. This spill apparently has leaked oil into Ash Coulee Creek in Billings County. The federal agency has also issued six warning letters to the pipeline company regarding integrity issues and safety procedures. PHMSA has been notified about the latest incident, an agency spokeswoman said. Belle Fourche Pipeline Co. is a liquids pipeline operator that transports crude oil in the Williston Basin of western North Dakota and eastern Montana, and the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, according to the company's website.
