Dear sadness, What destroys me most is the way we treat each other and the earth. It is unthinking, unfeeling. We are so disconnected from source that we cannot see that we are sealing our own destruction. When we steal from the earth, we steal from ourselves: another drop of liveliness, of vitality and health gone. Newsletter We promise to only send you good things. Ecommerce Software by Shopify.
