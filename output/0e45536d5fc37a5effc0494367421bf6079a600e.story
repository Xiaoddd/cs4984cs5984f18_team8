These questions were answered for me in the most brutal fashion when I returned this past November. In just a few short months, the forests, islands and grazing lands of the proposed dam site were completely eradicated. Beautiful forests with massive cottonwood trees I had walked through had been reduced to clearcuts and slash piles. Machines dredged the river as bulldozers pushed debris and soil into it. When I took to the air, the true scale of the devastation could be seen clearly and extended far beyond the banks of the river. Caterpillar dredging along an island in the Peace River.

The clearcut islands in the river as well as the dredging and other mid river operations are visible. Logging activity on the south shore of the Peace River. November 2015.

When I returned home, I sifted though my images from 2014 to find comparative views from before construction began. It was a more challenging task than I had assumed as virtually all points of reference had been completely obliterated. The fact that this had all happened in just a few months was both awe inspiring and horrifying. Then the reality sunk in that this destruction that had occurred in just a few months and over a few kilometers is to be extended over a decade and will encompass over 100 kilometres of this remarkable river. I imagined what this process would look like as those many kilometers of forests, islands, wildlife habitat and farms I have photographed would be transformed to the same kinds of scenes.

Many bear dens are found throughout the flood zone and on the islands in the Peace. Deer in the flood zone. June 2014. As the east-west valley in the Alberta-B.C. Rockies, it is a major migratory route and critical habitat for a wide range of wildlife. Red wing Blackbird. June 2014. Flood zone. Low lying farms will be flooded. The forests on the islands will all be clearcut and flooded. June 2014. All the islands, forests and low-lying areas will be flooded. The islands in the Peace River are exceptionally critical habitat for both resident and migratory wildlife. June 2014. Photographed from the north shore of the Peace River looking downstream (east). All the lower lying areas in the photo would be flooded, forming the reservoir. June 2014. One day while photographing one of the clearcut islands in the middle of the river, I was visited by representatives of one of the Alberta-based contractors for the project. Despite the fact there were no machines, other people or any industrial activity on the island, I was told I would have to leave. Learn more in our series on the Site C dam.
