For one, the oil and gas giants are very, very wealthy, so just a small Democratic leak from the pipeline adds up quickly. This uncomfortable truth has come to the fore thanks to the growing divestment movement: university endowments, pension funds, foundations, and institutional investors who claim concern about climate change are being challenged to end their catastrophic investments and instead invest in a clean future. Those with great wealth almost invariably have dirty investments. In recent years, the domestic fracking and oil-shale boom has been a prime area for investment by Wall Street tycoons, including the financiers on Team Hillary. If the no-compromise climate platform of Bernie Sanders were to be implemented, these investors would lose billions. Wall Street lost big in 2015 when New York banned fracking, but the fossil fuel industry has hardly been exiled from the state. One of the most contentious fights in New York today is over the construction of the Constitution Pipeline, which is intended to bring fracked gas from Pennsylvania to New York and New England. Furthermore, Hillary Clinton superdelegate Tonio Burgos is a top Williams lobbyist for the pipeline. Another key Hillary Clinton billionaire is Marc Lasry, who gave Chelsea Clinton her first job out of college at his hedge fund. Sometimes you find a corporate lobbyist, like bundlers Ankit Desai of liquid-natural-gas giant Cheniere Energy and Theresa Fariello of ExxonMobil. Sometimes you find a mega-billionaire, like coal and oil-train profiteer Warren Buffett. Founder and chairman of Paloma Partners. President of Avenue Capital Group. President of Evercore Partners.
