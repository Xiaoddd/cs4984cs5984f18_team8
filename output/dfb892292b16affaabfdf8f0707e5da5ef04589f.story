The Massachusetts Nurses Association, the largest union and professional association representing more than 23,000 registered nurses and health professionals in the Commonwealth, has taken a position in strong opposition to the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline, which would traverse sacred land under the Sioux Standing Rock Reservation. This project is being pursued in violation of a U.S. Government treaty with the Sioux nation, while also violating a number of land use and environmental protection statutes and regulations. The MNA will contribute to the Standing Rock Defense Fund, a fund established by a coalition of tribal leaders, environmental, religious and social justice advocacy groups seeking to halt the project. Aside from the health impacts, the MNA is outraged by the decision to locate this pipeline on the Standing Rock reservation, as it represents another example of governmental and private interests seeking to exploit the Native American population and the underprivileged who lack the political clout and financial resources to prevent such unlawful trampling of their rights. Its 23,000 members advance the nursing profession by fostering high standards of nursing practice, promoting the economic and general welfare of nurses in the workplace, projecting a positive and realistic view of nursing, and by lobbying the Legislature and regulatory agencies on health care issues affecting nurses and the public. Learn how the MNA can help make that happen.
