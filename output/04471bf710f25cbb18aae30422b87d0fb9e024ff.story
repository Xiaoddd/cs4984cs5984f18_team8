Protesters also reported being hit with rubber bullets and percussion grenades on a bridge just north of the encampments established by indigenous and environmental activists in opposition to the controversial pipeline. They are being trapped and attacked. A spokesman for the sheriffs department said that law enforcement was spraying water because protesters were lighting fires on and around the bridge. One person was arrested, according to the sheriffs department . One hundred sixty-seven people were injured and seven were taken to the hospital, according to Jade Begay, a spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network. The tribe fears that the pipeline, which is planned to cross under the river less than a mile from the Standing Rock Reservation, will threaten their water source and argue that construction has already disturbed sacred burial grounds. Pipeline construction is almost completed in North Dakota, but the company building it, Energy Transfer Partners, still lacks a final permit to drill under the river. On Tuesday, 15 November, the company went to court seeking to have a judge force the government to allow it to begin drilling immediately. The trucks have been in place for several weeks, and law enforcement has erected a barricade behind them, forcing all traffic to take an approximately 20-mile detour. Begay said that activists did light two bonfires to keep people warm and make soup and tea. Other fires were sparked by law enforcement weapons, she added. The activists successfully moved one of the trucks before law enforcement responded with tear gas, water cannons, and other weapons, Begay said. The violence comes at a difficult time for indigenous activists at the camps, said Archambault. It was always a day of mourning for the day that genocide began on this continent.
