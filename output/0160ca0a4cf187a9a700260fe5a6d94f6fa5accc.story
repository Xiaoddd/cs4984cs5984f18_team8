Police use a water cannon on Standing Rock protesters on Monday November 21, 2016. Witnesses say her arm was severely damaged when an officer pulled the pin on a stun grenade, and held it, then timed the throw so the grenade would explode exactly as it hit her. Witnesses say the police threw the grenade directly at Ms. Wilansky as she was backing away from the police. The grenade explosion caused bone, muscles and arteries to be blown from her arm, according to her father, Wayne Wilansky. Wayne Wilansky said his daughter may need up to 20 surgeries, and if she keeps her arm it will have very minor functionality. Mr. Wilansky says FBI agents, including a representative from the Joint Terrorism Task Force, kept his daughter prisoner inside her hospital room yesterday. Mr. Wilansky says he reached a verbal agreement with the FBI that they will give the Wilansky family access to the clothing to forensically test it themselves. It's going to stay in pathology until it's needed. There's proof. The police have changed the story of how Ms. Wilansky was hurt three times, according to her father. He also said police are intentionally hurting people in an attempt to deter new protesters from joining those already at Standing Rock. The authorities blocked medical help from reaching injured protesters, according to Mr. Wilansky. Despite her injury, Ms. Wilansky has asked that the attention be kept on the people of Standing Rock. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has been fighting to stop the 1,170 mile Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) for seven months. DAPL is planned to go under the Missouri River just a half-mile north of the Standing Rock reservation. The reservation already faces significant issues, including rates of unemployment, poverty, overcrowded housing, premature deaths, and a suicide rate that are all much higher than the national average. One protester who spoke at the vigil had just returned from Standing Rock and said that police were firing directly at protesters who were posing no threat to law enforcement or to property. He also asked for everyone to call their local and federal representatives to say the violence towards protesters at Standing Rock must end. This is not the way we behave. This is not Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr. Wilansky said that Obama needed to intervene to stop the police attacks on protesters. Police officers have lost their hand or been killed by mishandling the grenades. The activist media outlet Unicorn Riot has collected fragments of the different types of grenades that police are firing at Standing Rock protesters.

Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections: For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S., particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century. The comments of our readers are the most vibrant, best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News. Accordingly, we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services. It is, however, important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in. Adapt and overcome. These fossil fuel corporations want to make money with any means. They do not respect anything but nice profits. These greedy people have bribed our governmental agencies to protect their profits as the cost of global warming, as they deny the rights of the indigenous people to control their land. Standing Rock is on the land of the native people. This is not debatable. The government of the United States does not own this land. The United States has been stealing the native people's land and killing them since the Europeans invaded this land. They did not 'discover' it. The people who were here are the ones who own it. They were deprived of their lands for religious reasons. Killing them was just fine. This proclamation by the Pope in the 15th century is the base of all of our laws on the ownership of land in our nation---and it is past time to over rule this doctrine of the Pope. It's terrifying. That's probably the right word if they're deliberately hurting people to scare others away. At the same time I'm alarmed at how easily the media is ignoring this show (in contrast to the southern civil rights movement, which was on the news every day), I'm also concerned, along with many here, about the degree to which law enforcement is militarized in the US. Both developments do not bode well for the future. One thing they have learned is to control the message. The media, today, is highly concentrated in a few hands. We do not have the diversity of mainstream news sources that existed in the 1950', 1960's and 1970's. In sum, the deck is stacked heavily and systematically against the people. Yet, we MUST CONTINUE TO FIGHT against the oppression of the ruling capitalist class. That mindset is the CIA's, the politicians they control, the Deep State. They spread the fear that makes many weak and hysterical. That's how it was done in Germany. We're up to about 1935 and climbing. Fast. Israeli soldiers are deliberately shooting young Palestinian men in the kneecap, to create a generation of cripples. Now we are imitating the worst of Israel, and their worst is very bad indeed. And yes, the comparison of Israel and Germany in the 30s has come to many people's minds. Not the 1940s - not yet. That mindset is the CIA's, the politicians they control, the Deep State. They spread the fear that makes many weak and hysterical. That's how it was done in Germany. We're up to about 1935 and climbing. Fast. Trump is most likely a fascist, but Obomber is allowing fascist, Police State violence against these water protectors. Trump is most likely a fascist, but Obomber is allowing fascist, Police State violence against these water protectors. Absolutely. He quietly resumed the militarization of police a couple of months ago. He should read up on LBJ because he'll leave office about as popular. I am mailing a donation to the standing rock Sioux protesters now. And the glory of all those who have fought and died for basic civil rights in our country will forever be tainted by the legacy of our first African-America n president who sat by and did NOTHING as the civil rights crisis at Standing Rock unfolded before him for months. The recent election of Trump, the orange buffoon, has thrown a wrench in their plans. I predict he will most likely be a good puppet and do what it is they want him to do. However, Trump is kind of a wild card. Don't hold your breath... either way it is going to be a hard row to hoe as the super powerful banking interests own our nation and none of the usual expected leaders(Clinton , Bush, Reid, Gingrich, Ryan, Pelosi, Boxer, McConnell, et al) will do anything that may challenge the wealthy elites who have the real power. Hard times... . There are many reasons why voters repudiated the Democratic party. Obama must take a huge part of that responsibility- -after, of course, Hillary herself. Go to a meeting and just ask they have considered the optionif electric vehicles. If we can cut our daily use of fossil fuels even one quarter it would make projects like DAPL unprofitable. I signed up with Arcadia power. All my energy money goes to wind. In January, I will be putting some of it to a solar panel project in Massachusetts. Folks, if a Texas State council is saying this, you must know it is true. It is not to provide people with needed energy; it is to enrich the capitalist class who would rather see the extinction of the human race than lose money in their investments in fossil fuels. I hope there is a special place in hell reserved for them, and ALL of those in government who protect them and pass laws to enable them to continue their destruction of the planet. The time to stop this pipeline was in court before construction, not when all of the legal right-of-ways have been signed and recorded. Too bad the schools didn't teach honest history 50-60 years ago, and still don't. It has it's shortcomings, but it also has more unvarnished truth than almost any ten HS or college history textbooks put together. Trucks carry 200 barrels of oil. I would prefer that my government let the market prevail, which would soon shut down all of the fossil fuel infrastructure. This is a rare case in which the transparent and unsubsidized market really WOULD create optimum outcomes. I do not trust the market to care about inequality. I would like to nationalize the energy sector completely. Corporations that are now running the government. That is living in fantasy. Nationalizing will just be the same as privatizing, because the privatizers are now running the government. They're still destroying net neutrality in spite of the government allegedly running it. Because I'm not well-to-do and can't pay for premium service. It is wind and solar. No spills, no crashes. We can all read it and weep... . Trucks carry 200 barrels of oil. Would rather have wind , solar, geothermal as in civilized countries. Very sickening. This is why those two countries stand alone... Murdering civilians en masse and using collective punishment is sickening this day and age. He's talking about U.S. police being trained by Israel, which IS happening on an increasing scale. So, it's not bigoted AT ALL to state that FACT. Your argument, is just a call for the government to get more involved and clean up the fuel source used. A lot of the protestors LIVE THERE. A lot of them are farmers. I know farmers in that area who are freaked out about this. If there's no clean water to drink, it doesn't matter what you drive, unless it's a hearse. Oil Lovers (Pump Huggers) are hypocrites if they eat food or drink water. If they want to start that argument, they need to be prepared to take it to its logical conclusion. None of us want oil-fueled transportation. TPTB go to great lengths to limit other alternatives on behalf of the vested interests. Free market my bleeding hemorrhoids. No need to revert to horses. Guess who the terrorists are -and always have been since the Mayflower hit the east coast and were fed and warmed by the Pequot (I think). If they did, they'd show up with more fire power than the police, point their guns at the cops' heads, openly shout death threats, and be totally LEFT ALONE. Because there's one thing cops respect - OTHER RIGHT-WING WHITE ASSHOLES WITH GUNS. It will backfire in their face. FBI and Joint Terrorism Task Force personnel holding hostage an innocent woman in tremendous pain, and then taking evidentiary items from the room. Sounds like plot elements of a movie exposing the evil activities of KGB or Natzi Storm Troopers. But wait, the plot thickens: we're soon to be Ruled by a monster who says water boarding is the least of what his administration intends to utilize. Guess he is waiting until the DAPL ruptures UNDER the Missouri. Because pipelines & oil trains, etc are DISASTERS WAITING TO HAPPEN. Always. But if the original Selma happened today, we'd never know, because the corporate media would cover it just as much as Standing Rock--that is to say, not at all, unless skewed against the protesters. Because that media is owned by the same corporations that fund the politicians, that are building the pipeline, and that are allowed to use OUR police forces and National Guard against us, U.S. citizens, as their private hired goons. The pipeline was moved so that it wouldn't inconvenience and jeopardize whites in Bismarck, to run across UNCEDED indigenous land per the 1851 Ft. Laramie treaty. It's theirs. They are a sovereign nation (while also being U.S. citizens). There is NOTHING legal, much less moral, about any of this on the part of the government, much less the corporations. Carbon from life forms is isotopically different than carbon coming up out of the magma.There are already thousands of miles of leaking pipelines with some 100 leaking under the one percenter's rivers in the U.S. A fundamentalist is anyone who makes a slave of women or children or old people. It certainly isn't the people, so obviously it is being created by the government, local, state and federal; and the former are doing so with the support of the latter. So, We the People aren't the ones instigating this domestic warfare, it is the government. No, an increasing number of us must rise up more and more against all of this trampling on our liberty, freedom, rights and livelihood. I would like to believe that many would remember when an Iranian Basij sniper shot Neda Agha-Soltan on the 20th of June, 2009 during protests of Muhamoud Ahmadinejad. I suspect that the cowardly police shot. threw or launched the flashbang grenade knowing full well that it exploding near Sophia Wilansky's body could cause great harm and even death. This is straight up intimidation, meant to keep all other non-Natives acting in solidarity with the large group of Native water protectors. The last thing that Enbridge wants is for the protests and resistance to grow in popularity and stop the eventual destruction of the water aquifers. It is the capitalist way. God bless America .
