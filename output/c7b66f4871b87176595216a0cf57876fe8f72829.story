Home News in Brief The Week in Photos Viewfinder You Might Have Missed Inside the Battle Over the Dakota Access Pipeline Prayer circles, rubber bullets, and a buffalo stampede at the major protest in rural North Dakota. Author: Antonia Juhasz Publish date: Nov 1, 2016 Oceti Sakowin Camp, the main water protector campsite located just to the North of Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Reservation on Highway 1806, near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, on October 27th, 2016. a youth boldly declares. Visit Website Arrayed against the protectors on this day is a vast phalanx of police from multiple states and agencies, National Guardsmen, and armed private security forces working for Energy Transfer Partners. The equipment, weapons, uniforms, and tactics they deploy immediately bring me back to my 2011 and 2012 reporting trips to Afghanistan. And while it may seem unlikely for such events to unfold in rural North Dakota; the objective is all too familiar: oil. Over the last seven months, thousands of people, including members of over 280 tribes and First Nations, have joined the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline, which passes half a mile from its reservation. A victory for the Tribes came on September 9th, when the Army Corps of Engineers denied permission for the pipeline to pass under the Missouri River while it conducted a more thorough review. Energy Transfer Partners flatly refused. Just four small areas remain for the laying of the pipe: the land immediately to the west of Highway 1806; Highway 1806 itself; under Front Line Camp on the east, which will also serve as a staging ground for the final step; and passage below the Missouri River, a little over a mile away. On October 23rd, a group of hundreds of protectors claiming eminent domain over the land as its rightful owners under the 1851 Laramie Treaty, decided that their bodies would have to act as the final buffer between the pipeline and the water. They established the Front Line Camp directly in its path, blocking Highway 1806 in several locations as well. On almost any other day, in any other year, the site of the protest would simply be a lonely stretch of two-lane highway reaching out across prairie fields barren but for waving yellow strands of grass, some corn, and the occasional bale of hay. Keep going north 50 miles to reach Bismarck; half a mile south to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Reservation. This beauty is under attack. As I detailed in November in an article from North Dakota, in 2006, the onset of a highly unexpected and equally unregulated oil fracking boom from an underground deposit known as the Bakken Formation introduced an economic bounty for some, but also toxic flares, fracking fluid spills, pipeline ruptures, and an economic roller coaster for many more. Nearly 1,800 oil- and gas-related accidents, fires, blowouts, leaks, spills, ruptures, and other problems were reported here in just the 12 months from November 2014 to November 2015. The massive increase in oil production could not stay put for long, and trains and pipelines were increasingly employed to carry the bounty outward to faraway refineries and terminals for overseas export. As with so many locations where oil is produced, few are more harmed here than the Native population. The heart of the Bakken boom lies beneath Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, which is also the site of the majority of its associated harms described above, while its pipelines pass near and through ever more Native land. All of which helped lay the groundwork for a historic moment of resistance. October 27th, 12:40 p.m. Acrid black smoke billows skyward from tires set ablaze, part of a blockade across Highway 1806 devised by the protectors, aimed at keeping the police forces from advancing and taking Front Line Camp. As the day progresses, the constant buzz of a helicopter circling low overhead, combined with the rumbling of a small plane occupying the air above it, is abruptly overtaken by the crushing boom of an exploding concussion grenade, forcing hundreds of bodies to instinctively contract inward as one. With a quiet swoosh, a Taser releases its electrified metal barb into the cheek and hip of a young man; inches away, the liquid flush of pepper spray is felt long before it is seen; a searing and biting sting that forces eyes and throats to immediately lock shut. Rubber bullets smack into flesh; and a burst of police tackle a youth causing skin and bone to whack and tear against pavement. Shouts of fear, pain, anger, and resistance follow, interspaced with periods and areas of a relative calm that is balanced on a pin waiting for the next prick. Clockwise, from top left: Police from multiple states and agencies, National Guardsmen, and armed private security forces working for Energy Transfer Partners gather on Highway 1806 to remove Native American water protectors and their allies from the Front Land Camp and barricades on Highway 1806, on October 27th, 2016. She then points to the west, to a field on the other side of the highway, where construction of the pipeline is actively underway. As we watch, a group of protectors takes to this field. Just as quickly, an armored Humvee and line of police fill the area, pepper spray canisters as large as fire extinguishers and batons at the ready, repelling the protectors with intimidation and arrests. Medics pass out bright orange ear plugs. I later learn from Lyle Jeremy Rubin, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Afghanistan, that the source of the high pitched screeching siren occasionally blasted at us is a Long Range Acoustic Device. The shrill sound, also used to keep pirates at bay and regulate the movements of wildlife, can over-stimulate the heart, resulting in agitation among those targeted. Today, the LRAD is fitted to a massive tan armor-plated International MaxxPro Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle (MRAP) designed to withstand Improvised Explosive Devices in war zones holding court front and center on the highway. A black counter-terrorism vehicle, the Ballistic Engineered Armored Response Counter Attack Truck sits closely at its side. Numerous tan armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (a.k.a. Humvee) are arrayed here, throughout the fields, and on surrounding hill tops, where many remain to this day. Photographs later confirm that the snipers are perched within Humvees, their heads poking out of turrets at the top, rifles pointed and ready. A force flanks to the right, moving into Front Line Camp. They are slow, methodical, and practiced. With tears streaming down her face, she describes the hurt and shame she felt at seeing the exact same equipment used in Iraq deployed on her homeland. The Oklahoma Ponca elder and Tribal Council Member is a figure of calm surrounded by a swirl of chaos. Several people huddle protectively around her, placing their hands on her back and head, using their bodies as shields. Camp-Horinek and the others stand impenetrable as the stream of police engulfs and then passes by them. They are arrested and jailed. A larger prayer circle led by male tribal elders has gathered further south on the highway. When the police line reaches it; they too are arrested. Approximately 4 p.m. A group of about 50 protectors in a large circle on the ground in Front Line Camp, arms intertwined, praying, singing, and holding ground. He is pulled out of the circle, tackled, and arrested. The police then slowly encircle and arrest the remaining group, before continuing their steady forward crawl. Approximately 4:30 p.m. As if out of a mirage, a herd of buffalo appear to the east of the melee, streaming majestic across the hills. The nearby action freezes as one person follows the gaze of another. Shock turns to momentary joy. Whoops, cheers, and ululations fill the air. Two Native horse riders follow the herd, fists raised, only to be chased down by SWAT in ATVs. One horse is so badly injured by police that it is later put down. As they are pushed back along the highway, groups of protectors stop and try to erect further barricades, using hay, logs, and even dismantling and locking themselves under a truck. Over the course of the day, perhaps five to 10 people throw water bottles, some rocks, and even an occasional log at police. Some even fight back. It is a common sentiment. But for most of those with whom I spoke, the worst violence committed on this day was not done by the protectors, nor the police; it took place to the west of the line where the construction equipment dug into the sacred burial ground, moving the pipeline ever forward, with an invading military force to protect it. Approximately 6 p.m. Front Line Camp is gone, and with it the barriers on Highway 1806. One-hundred-and-forty-one people were arrested, the others returning to the two main camps. During the night, three cars are set ablaze further down Highway 1806 in between the camps to the south, and the pipeline construction to the north; a barricade none admit to erecting behind which the Humvees, snipers, and police remain affixed on roadways and hills to this day. Cars sat ablaze the night of October 27th, 2016, on Highway 1806. Humvees, snipers, and police to the north, the Dakota Access Pipeline under construction beyond.

Their commitment to remain through the winter and as long as it takes stays firm as new residents and supporters arrive daily, and new solar panels and wind turbines are erected.
