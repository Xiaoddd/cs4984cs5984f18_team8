Extending over 500 miles, the pipeline will start from Tallapoosa County in Alabama to Osceola County in Florida. Spectra Energy and NextEra Energy are the other two owners for the pipeline which is expected to be operational from 2017. The proposed pipeline awaits approval from federal and other regulatory bodies, which are likely to be secured in early 2016. Construction work for the natural-gas pipeline, which will have a delivery capacity of around 1.1 billion ft3, is expected to start by 2016. It is expected to benefit natural gas-fired power plants, natural gas distribution companies, manufacturing plants and other industrial users once operational. Duke Energy Florida and Florida Power & Light Company are two major customers for the pipeline supply, among others. The firms have signed contracts for 25-year initial terms. The Sabai Trail pipeline is the second interstate natural gas pipeline investment by the firm in eight months, the first being the proposed 550 mile Atlantic Coast Pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina.
