As a result, Indigenous and other land-based peoples face threats to the natural commons on which they live, produce food and sustain community, culture and cosmovision. RELATED: Corporate Conquistadors Rape Indigenous Lands and Bodies In some places, organized Indigenous movements have stood up and fought off extraction and corporate development, winning protection of waters, forests, territories and more. In most places, the resistance has been met with assassination and violent repression by state security forces and corporate-financed hit squads. Two of the fiercest Native battles in the Americas today are closely connected. They are led by the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota and by the Lenca people in Honduras, organized through the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH). Both are hard at work defending their territories and waters from further theft and desecration: At Standing Rock they are struggling against an oil pipeline being laid under their ancestral Missouri River, which they use for ceremony, drinking water and sustaining other life; on Lenca lands they are resisting the damming of their ancestral Gualcarque and other rivers. In both cases, the movements face enormous stakes. So they are challenging the power on top with shared strategies of mass mobilization and direct action. They both have the capacity to inspire the world, as seen by an outpouring of active solidarity with their uprisings from around the globe. Each is enduring tremendous assault. Standing Rock Water Protectors have suffered dog attacks, water cannons in sub-freezing temperatures, rubber bullets and tear gas. Twenty-one-year-old activist Sophia Wilansky risks amputation of her arm after being hit by what witnesses claim was a concussion grenade. Vanessa Dundon may lose permanent sight in one eye after being hit with a tear gas canister. Red Fawn Fallis is in prison, facing a trumped-up federal charge. More than 500 others have been arrested. Gomez himself has survived three assassination attempts and been beaten by soldiers twice since March. The Standing Rock Sioux and the Lenca, moreover, each claim one of the greatest leaders for Native autonomy and territory in their country. Sitting Bull (c. 1831-90) and Lempira (d. 1537) were powerful spiritual and military leaders who fought back conquest by Americans and Spanish, respectively. On the gentle North Dakotan hills -- recently covered with yellow-brown grasses, now buried in white snow -- where thousands of Water Protectors are convened, we talked with Native people about their counterparts in Honduras. All felt their lives, stories and fates reflected in their Honduran counterparts. Nathan (pictured at the top of this article) is from Nebraska, though now Standing Rock is his only home. He is a Native children's advocate and works at the school for the children living in the camp. That would be a blessing. To help those on the front lines turn the tide, we must all stand with Standing Rock. Call banks that have invested in the Dakota Access pipeline and urge them to pull their funds. Look for more ways to lend support here. The best way to turn the tide in Honduras is to cut US military aid to the government, which runs the most dangerous country in the world in which to be an environmental defender. Keep up-to-date here. With so much at stake for humanity and Mother Earth, it's time for us all to follow the lead of those in Standing Rock and Honduras, and stand, resist and act fearlessly.
