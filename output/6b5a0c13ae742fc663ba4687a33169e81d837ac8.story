Most of those, 86 per cent, were on oil pipelines, as opposed to gas. The Ontario-Quebec pipeline run by Trans-Northern Pipelines runs from Montreal to southern Ontario and connects with airports in Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto. There were 23 spills of either refined petroleum products or crude oil in Quebec from 2004 to 2017, the report stated. Incidents also increased in other provinces: In Ontario, there were more incidents in both 2016 and 2017 than in any other year since 2008. As well, in British Columbia there were more in 2017 than any year over the last decade. Alberta also saw more incidents last year than any year since 2012. Trans-Northern flows east to west, pushing roughly 172,900 barrels a day of refined fuel products from Montreal to southern Ontario. It has been the subject of protests that have temporarily shut it down. Despite several NEB safety orders, incidents have increased on the pipeline, and it remains open. There were 23 spills in total. It said technology used by industry only detected 39 per cent of spills and incidents. National Observer asked the NEB about the rise in incidents over the decade, the spike of incidents for Trans-Northern, the incident reporting lag and technology used by industry. The NEB has also moved to implement a new reporting system since 2015 alongside the federal transport regulator. That system has reduced the number of discrepancies between multiple databases, he said. Investigative journalism has never been more important. Subscribe Share this article. He also notes that business loss insurance pays out when there is a spill. As well many of the spill cleanup companies are owned by the oil and gas companies.
