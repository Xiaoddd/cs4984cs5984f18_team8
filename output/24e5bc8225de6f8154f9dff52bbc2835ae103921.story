Enbridge wants to build a new pipeline across northern Minnesota to replace its current Line 3, which is aging, corroding and operating at just over half-capacity due to safety concerns. The new pipeline, which would restore the full flow of oil from Canada, would run through a region of lakes, rivers and wild rice waters. Wild rice is culturally sacred to the Ojibwe. The group of over 400 congregations works on sustainable energy and global warming issues. If the company's proposed route is approved, the new Line 3 would cross treaty lands, but not any reservations. The current Line 3 traverses two reservations. Signatories of the petition include the bishop of the Minneapolis Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (the nation's largest Lutheran synod); the bishop of the Minnesota-Dakotas region of the United Methodist Church; the bishop of the Episcopal Church in Minnesota; and the head of the Minnesota Conference of the United Church of Christ. More than 100 protesters affiliated with the religious leaders' petition congregated Monday in a park near the State Capitol. After a three-year regulatory process, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to decide later this month on the new Line 3's fate. Environmental groups and American Indian bands oppose a new Line 3, saying it will open a new region of water bodies to degradation from potential oil spills, as well as contribute to global warming. Several county governments in northern Minnesota support the pipeline, as does the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce and the state's construction unions. New Line 3 would create over 4,000 construction jobs, Enbridge says. welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.
