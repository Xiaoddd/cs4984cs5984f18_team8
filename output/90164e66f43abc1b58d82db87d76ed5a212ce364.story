Many had held senior national security posts. Their concerns were not limited to national security. Sure enough. Their concerns were recently echoed by members of The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists who updated the Doomsday Clock to the highest threat level since 1953, the year after the United States and the Soviet Union conducted competing hydrogen bomb tests. The security issues are not limited to concern that Trump might launch a nuclear strike in a fit of pique in response to a perceived slight or threat from abroad. Following his inauguration he made this promise at the annual Washington, D.C., prayer breakfast. It must be stopped, and it will be stopped. It may not be pretty for a little while. Our country has experienced the futility of using conventional military force against an enemy that blends in with civilian populations. Trump might well use a future attack to take the suspension of privacy rights and civil liberties even further to advance what is emerging as the defining agenda of his administration. A number of media sources, including The Atlantic, Slate Magazine, and Thom Hartmann, have named it. This is likely only an opening volley in the effort by Trump and his fellow kleptocrats to sweep away rules and regulations protecting the environment, unions, health and safety, religious freedom, human rights, and more. It is already abundantly clear that Trump has no intention of fulfilling his promise to his base to drain the Washington swamp. He revealed his intention to align his domestic and international policy actions with his business interests in his choice of the seven countries from which immigrants were temporarily banned. By contrast, the list of banned countries did not include Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon, and the United Arab Emirates, the home countries of the 19 terrorists involved in the September 11 World Trade Center attack. All are countries in which the Trump family has known business interests. Trump is now seeking to roll back a consumer protection rule that requires financial advisors to work in the best interests of their clients. Egregious in itself, that action is merely a sideshow to his order to strip away Dodd-Frank regulations designed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crash and facilitate a rapid and effective response to the future failure of large financial institutions. His Wall Street cronies stand to reap huge unearned gains, while putting the world at risk of a global financial and economic collapse far worse than 2008. We face a national and global emergency. We must rise above our differences and come together with a sense of shared purpose and calm determination to secure the rights, freedom, and well-being of all. No Paywall. No Ads.
