On the same day the US government granted permission for the Dakota Access pipeline to drill under the Missouri river, a descendant of General George Armstrong Custer had arrived at Standing Rock. The unlikely meeting 140 years after Little Bighorn came at a time of heightened tensions at Standing Rock. As one of his first acts as president, Donald Trump ordered the approval of pipeline construction across Lake Oahe, which the tribe says poses a grave threat to its water supply, is destroying sacred sites and is violating treaty rights.

But the win was short-lived and was followed by further invasions, massacres and oppressive policies that have plagued indigenous people for generations. Alisha Custer said she felt called to Standing Rock in part because she is also Osage and Cherokee and her daughter is Yankton Sioux. But Custer said she also hoped an in-person apology could provide some sort of healing. Kristen Tuske, a 39-year-old Standing Rock member, said the meeting was surreal.
