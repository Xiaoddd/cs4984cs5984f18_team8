Hi, Jeremy. Jeremy Corbyn: Lovely to see you. There was a big swing to Labour, but not quite enough, unfortunately, to give us a Parliamentary majority. And a huge degree of uncertainty by the right and by the Conservatives. Look at each other. You have different backgrounds, languages. Different ethnic communities. JC: The picture of the world is a crucial one. It is about what we do to deal with issues of injustice and inequality and poverty, and above all, hope and opportunity for young people. Hope that they can get to college or university, opportunity they can get a decent job. I want a foreign policy based on human rights, based on respect for international law, based for recognizing the causes of the refugee flows, the causes of the injustice around the world. And indeed, there were some awful events during the election campaign. Before the election started there was an attack on Westminster itself and on Parliament. There was then the dreadful bomb in Manchester. And then there was an attack in London on London Bridge. NK: And you committed kind of political heresy because you talked about some of the root causes. Yet that resonated with people. I was just saying, if you go to war in Iraq and you destabilize the whole country, there are consequences. But we do know that Donald Trump fully intends to take advantage of any crisis to push forward this incredibly regressive, xenophobic agenda, because he tried to exploit the Manchester attacks to say this is about immigrants flowing across our borders. He tried to take advantage of the London Bridge attack to say this is why we need to Muslim ban. People were extremely angry at the language he used toward Sadiq Khan, who is, after all, elected mayor of the city. I was also appalled at the language he used surrounding the Paris Climate Change discussions. I mean, these are serious, serious global issues. And he seemed to think this was an opportunity for promoting polluting industries. NK: Well, he actually said he was going to negotiate a better deal. But having worked, like you have, for a very long time on these issues, the fact that finally India and China, in a formal setting, came onboard with the idea there are limits to emissions, there are limits to pollution, there are limits to what you can do. For the USA having come onboard under Obama, then walking away under Trump, is beyond sad. And we are seeing examples of that. And internationally I think we can see the same thing as well. JC: I think that the image of the USA is too often presented as the image of what Donald Trump has said day-to-day, whereas the reality, look at the number of jobs in renewables in California alone runs into the hundreds of thousands. Look at the growth of renewable energy systems across the USA, the number of states and cities that are serious about protecting their environment and controlling what they can of climate change. NK: I want to talk a little bit about the way some of my friends in the United States are feeling right now, who were very inspired by this election campaign and by your leadership bid within the Labour Party. I have to tell you that people are feeling a little discouraged right now in the United States. I was half asleep watching something on television. And Bernie comes on to say, well done on the campaign, and I was interested in your campaigning ideas. And I said, well, you, actually. They want to do things collectively. And we gained the support and participation of a very large number of people. I wish we had. NK: But you did win the leadership of the Labour Party. You knock on doors and you identify voters. Just think, those people that were campaigning for social justice in Chicago in the 1920s, the best they could do was print their own newspaper if they could afford it, or make a leaflet and take it round and hand it out on bread queues. I grew up in the era when you used to print your own leaflets and go and give them out. You can now send out something on social media, and you can reach potentially millions of people in five minutes. The opportunities are there. William Randolph Hearst would have hated the Internet. NK: It seems to me that you have received just about as bad media treatment, smears from elite media, as is possible to receive. In fact, it seems to have backlashed and contributed to this feeling of loss of faith in many of these elite institutions. After a while, a high degree of media abuse makes you a figure of interest. And the way in which this horrific event has been interpreted, it seems, throughout British society, is as extreme evidence of a failed system that does not value human life, that puts kind of a hierarchy on life. JC: What it exposed was something about modern urban living. This is the borough in London that is the richest in the whole country. Very, very rich borough. And its council gave a rebate to the top taxpayers last year. Gave them a little gift. NK: Money back. Some flats had been bought independently, and they were sub-tenanted or sub-sub-tenanted. Nobody really knew who was in the block. The whole system collapsed. And so the debate has turned full circle on this. But people are frightened. And you know, these questions are just completely heartbreaking. Wars were started in the name of that attack. And here we are in a time of overlapping crisis. Climate change is one of those crises, and inequality is another, and racial injustice is another. JC: Well, climate change and refugees are linked. Climate change and war is linked. Environmental disaster, not necessarily always associated with climate change, is also linked when you have deforestation and you end up destroying your local environment because of it. And so, if you look at the war in Darfur, look at the refugee flows into Libya, partly from the war in Syria, also from human rights abuses across the whole region. Also from people who have been driven off their land in sub-Saharan Africa to make way for often very large corporations buying up land to grow various crops, often rice or fruit, to export somewhere else, leaving the local population unemployed and hungry. There is a connection about the need for supporting the living and development rights of everybody, not just yourself at their expense. JC: There was a gentleman who came to our rally in Hastings, which is south coast seaside resort fishing town. He was aged 91. He joined the Labour Party in 1945, been a party member ever since then. Very active all his life. And he said this was the most hopeful time of his life. And his grandfather had been in the Chartists in the 1850s, which helped bring about some degree of democracy in Britain. We were characterized as an election campaign that was full of young, idealistic people. Yeah, there were a lot of young people there, and many of them with brilliant ideals and brilliant imagination. It was a coming together of large numbers of people. JC: Thank you very much.

This is the borough in London that is the richest in the whole country. Very, very rich borough. And its council gave a rebate to the top taxpayers last year. That tower had several hundred people living in it, some of whom were tenants of the local council, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.
