Learn what's trending across POPSUGAR. Sara Jumping Eagle is a pediatrician, a mother of three, a member of the Great Sioux Nation, and an activist to be reckoned with. On Feb. 27, Donald Trump and the Army Corps of Engineers were slapped with an emergency lawsuit over the contentious North Dakota Access Pipeline, and Jumping Eagle is its lead plaintiff. In late January, Trump issued an executive order to expedite the pipeline, following a hard-won victory by protesters to stop the construction late last year. But Jumping Eagle continues to fight. She is one of more than a dozen Oceti Sakowin, or Great Sioux Nation, tribe members behind this latest legal action, which demands an immediate halt to construction on the pipeline. Jumping Eagle's lead counsel, Bruce Afran, says the lawsuit is two-pronged. The White House has not responded to POPSUGAR's request for comment on the suit. We spoke with Jumping Eagle about why she's persevering, what she wishes more people understood about the threat the Dakota Access Pipeline poses to the Standing Rock Reservation, and her message for Donald Trump. POPSUGAR: Give us the nuts and bolts of this latest legal action. Sara Jumping Eagle: We are pointing out the fact that the United States government and the Army Corps of Engineers are violating the public interest of protecting our communities, which are already at risk. We have huge health disparities. We live in a county that's one of the poorest counties in the nation. If they were going to run a pipeline through Bethlehem or through the Arlington Cemetery, I think people would have a lot to say about that. PS: This filing takes the president directly to task. SJE: The main message would be that our communities have suffered enough. We've borne the brunt of corporate profits for generations now. We've contributed to America. We've given up lands, and part of those negotiations were for our treaty territories. And now, once again, the United States is going to violate those laws, and then label water protectors as being illegal. It's basically a choice of which laws they feel are more important in that moment in time to get what they want, which is to profit off the backs of our communities. SJE: There are so many facets to this case. SJE: This area is a very sacred place. There are generations of people who have held ceremonies there. There are tribal stories passed down generations about the specific place where the Cannonball River and Missouri River meet. Because of the movement of the waters, it causes development of sacred stones in and along the river, and those were used for ceremonies. There are many rock formations that are thought to be grave sites and places of prayer also. That is exactly where they're building this pipeline. If they were going to run a pipeline through Bethlehem or through the Arlington Cemetery, I think people would have a lot to say about that. PS: Key to your argument is the environmental threat posed by a pipeline project of this scale. That still hasn't been cleaned up. We know there was a pipeline buried under the Yellowstone River, and the river shifted, and that led to erosion that exposed the pipeline, and that led to a break in the pipeline. They're dependent on pressure changes that can take up to 15 minutes to get the information to the company, which is based in another state, to then shut it off. By then, there would be thousands of gallons leaked into the Missouri River, which does serve 18 to 20 million people downstream. It would affect generations afterwards; it's just difficult to reconcile. PS: Women have really been the driving force behind this movement. We attended public hearings, and basically the company came to the tribal administration office and just said what their plans were and showed the community the map, and that was in 2014. People told not only of the sacred sites in this area, but also the historic sites. Women have voiced opinions. So it's really an important place for her and her family to protect. PS: This has been such an effort on behalf of your tribe, at great personal cost, and with several setbacks so far. SJE: Because we know what will happen if there is a spill. We're looking at our children's faces. There are places around here where we collect sacred food and plants, and all of that is dependent on the water, so we know how important the water is to this community. We're fighting for our children's future. SJE: Calling your senator, congresspeople, the Army Corps, the Martin County Police, and North Dakota governor to voice opposition to not only the pipeline, but also the injustices that have taken place against free speech, the constitutional right to assemble, and multiple civil rights.
