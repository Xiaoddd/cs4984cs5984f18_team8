Perry met with the president-elect Monday at Trump Tower. If Perry is confirmed, he would lead a 13,000-strong department whose main missions include funding energy research, overseeing the nation's nuclear weapons and regulating energy efficiency. During a debate in 2011, when Perry was running in the Republican primary for president, he famously forgot the name of the Department of Energy. At a primary debate, Perry tried to list three federal agencies he wanted to eliminate. Sorry. Perry sits on the corporate board of Energy Transfer Partners, which is developing the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. The former Texas governor also ran against Trump in the Republican primary and was originally critical of the president-elect. - Updated at 10:06 a.m. Sign up for our daily email.
