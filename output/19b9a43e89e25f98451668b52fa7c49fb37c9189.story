I had only been on the ground in North Dakota for a few hours at that point though, returning once again to cover the protest happening just outside of the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation. My first visit to the main camp, originally known as Oceti Sakowin, was to cover the mobilization of thousands of veterans to assist in the protest by Wesley Clark, Jr. and his cohorts. That trip proved to be the high point of the movement with the camp population swelling to what some estimated to be as high as 20,000 people. On December 4th, 2016, while sitting in the traffic on Highway 1806 just above the camp, I heard a roar erupt as news reached the protesters. The spirit of victory and excitement swept through the Oceti protest camp after the easement was denied by the Army Corps of Engineers during the first week of December 2016. With victory in the air, the pipeline opponents praised what was surely the end of DAPL construction. They believed months of the bitter stand off with law enforcement and private security resulting in the arrest of hundreds had ended. Surely they would no longer have to endure blasts from water cannons in sub-zero weather, or punishing barrages of less-lethal munitions. For the law enforcement officers on the north side of the barricade that was blocking Highway 1806, it seemed that they would no longer have to endure everything from rocks to Molotov cocktails being thrown at them. They would no longer have to listen to the accusations and jeers of angry protesters, or watch vehicles burn in front of them. Finally, they thought, the officers who came in from neighboring states would finally be able to return home to their families. The feeling of victory was gone almost as fast as the good weather though. Almost simultaneously, the inclement weather that North Dakota is known for rolled in, forcing many protesters to flee the camp for their lives. The Oceti protest site braced as a severe winter storm descended on the camp in early December 2016. One of my last memories from that first trip to Oceti Sakowin was searching Army-issue GP Medium tents that collapsed under the intense wind, while the -30 temperatures burned the small amount of skin I had left exposed on my face. It was now called Oceti Oyate due to the tribal leaders who built it leaving a few weeks prior. A President who was a shareholder in Energy Transfer Partners was inaugurated. The easement denial was overturned, and now approved by the Army Corps of Engineers. Finally, an eviction notice had been served to those remaining residents of the camp, and evacuation was not negotiable. I had no idea what I was heading into, but was looking forward to the challenge. North Dakota is no stranger to dealing with floods. Both the Missouri River and the Red River have drained significant amounts of resources from the state and her citizens. Oceti Sakowin was built on a flood plain of the Missouri River, causing significant concern that the contents of the camp would be washed away in rising waters, resulting in an ecological disaster. Although that fear was very convenient for supporters of the pipeline, it was a fact nonetheless. Evacuation was necessary in order to begin the cleanup ahead of the coming floods. The fact that a clean up was mandatory does not necessarily reflect that the protesters were negligent in their maintenance of the camp though. Oceti, for the most part, was extremely organized on my trip during the first week of December. The neighborhoods that Native Americans had established were especially impressive considering the conditions. The camp, as a whole, was at least as clean and organized as combat outposts I saw overseas, complete with porta-potties and trash receptacles. The Oceti protest camp in early December. Notice that cars were parked in rows and no trash was on the ground. That being said, the storm that came in on December 5th, 2016 was bad enough that a lot of people barely made it out. I have no doubt that trash receptacles and porta-potties overflowed when the roads closed. On top of that, the mass exodus of people left only a small contingent to clean up. Yes. But I was curious to see how bad the current condition of the camp actually was. I departed the hotel early on the cold, wet morning of February 22nd. According to law enforcement press releases, the eviction would commence at 1400. Emergency services would be made available to anyone who voluntarily left, to include a hotel room and a bus ticket to anywhere in the lower 48. The light rain turned into heavy, wet snow during my drive south from Mandan, ND. Even though I grew up driving in harsh Midwest winters, I still had trouble keeping control of my four-wheel drive truck. Just outside of Fort Rice, I encountered my first checkpoint. T-barriers, concertina wire, a Humvee, and a police cruiser accompanied by one National Guardsman and one law enforcement officer. After confirming that I was media, I was directed off to the side of the checkpoint to await a law enforcement escort up to the protest site. My first interaction of the day with uniformed personnel proved to be polite, professional, and friendly. So far, so good. Despite the smiles at that first checkpoint, I knew that not all was well. The contractors were almost all prior military combat veterans, many of whom hailed from the special operations community. Certainly I had witnessed the same thing working in a joint environment on combat deployments overseas. Unfortunately, the issues ran deeper than just agitation from long days and unruly water protectors. According to the source, who requested anonymity due to the nature of his work, DAPL wanted TigerSwan contractors to become more aggressive in their duties after becoming fed up with their equipment being vandalized. Both items are commonly considered deadly force, and rightly made law enforcement uncomfortable. The fact that DAPL, a private company, insinuated that they wanted their contractors to perform assault on behalf of them is certainly a violation of common business ethics. The source went on to say that senior leadership from within the PMC was purposefully agitating protesters on Oceti camp radio channels by hurling insults and profanities, in hopes of enticing an altercation. The real issue for TigerSwan was a matter of legality though. Due to an ongoing investigation of Frost Kennels, the company responsible for the unauthorized use of dogs during an altercation with protesters on September 3rd, 2016, legal compliance was a matter of utmost importance for DAPL security. According to the Bismarck Tribune, a spokeswoman for DAPL said the security firms working for the pipeline were all properly licensed. According to documents released by Morton County, TigerSwan is in charge of DAPL intelligence and is the overall supervisor of the other security companies. Providing private security services without a license is a Class B misdemeanor in North Dakota. Shortly after we crossed the Backwater Bridge behind our highway patrol escort, we arrived at another set of t-barriers. There was law enforcement vehicles parked on both sides of the road, with many officers milling about in preparation for the days activities. The black smoke came into view as we moved beyond the t-barriers, curling into the grey sky as we came to a stop behind our escort. He motioned us toward a spot behind the CNN production truck that was parked on the shoulder, giving us a panoramic view of the post-apocalyptic landscape before us. Having not even stepped foot out of the vehicle yet, I was already shocked at what I saw. A view of the Oceti protest camp on the morning of February 22nd. After staring at flames erupting from a nearby teepee for what was probably too long, I exited the truck and followed the waiting patrolman over to meet another uniformed man. He appeared younger than many of the other law enforcement present, and had a smile made for the cameras. The patrolman left to attend to presumably more important duties while I became acquainted with the Captain. Right off the bat, he was friendly yet professional. 1400 time is up though. At that point you have to be out of the camp. He said in his North Dakota accent, before flashing a smile. I was shocked to hear that we would be allowed down into the camp, and pleasantly surprised the Captain made himself so available to the media. He had been in the camp for months, and offered to take me on a tour of what was left. A young Native American girl near the entrance of the camp had me bow to accept a green braided necklace with leaves sprouting from it; this was essentially my hall pass to walk into the camp sans harassment. The view from just off of flag row on the morning of February 22nd. We passed by a group of protesters standing by the guard shack at the entrance, their mood solemn with a touch of disappointment. These were the wind burnt faces of the true believers; their resolve was in the process of shifting from the end of the battle and on to the war ahead. The concern was that the hundred or so water protectors that remained were the most prone to violence. Burning shacks and teepees, and snowmobiles whipping through thick mud surrounded us. I was snapping a few pictures of a burning building on our way to the former location of the sacred fire when I turned and made eye contact with one of the operators of a snowmobile heading our way. Right after I returned to looking through the lens of my camera, he flipped a U-turn and gunned the engine, covering my camera and I in the thick mud. Wet and covered in mud, my current predicament was less than desirable with the freezing temperatures and driving wind trying to break me. A group was screaming something off in the distance, and the familiar sound that emanates from the spinning tires of a vehicle stuck in mud was echoing from multiple places around camp. All of a sudden, I heard the distinct pop of some sort of incendiary device. I quickly turned around just in time to see the shack that had previously been used to dry corn erupting in flames only twenty feet away. The shack that was set ablaze just outside of the former sacred fire gathering area. The structure was used to dry corn. It was explained to me later that these fires were being set to sacred structures so that authorities would not desecrate them during the camp eviction. Standing there in the mud and snow, watching with my own two eyes, I saw no ceremony. No decorum whatsoever. Later that day I would learn from authorities that the estimated twenty fires that were set around camp did more than just bring down buildings. Two kids, a 7-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl, were hospitalized for injuries received from the fires. According to one of officer on site, the 17-year-old girl had burn injuries so grievous that she needed to be airlifted to medical care. Ed continued the tour, moving away from the blazing inferno and up to a fairly new set of plywood structures covered with blue tarps. The Oglala House on the afternoon of February 22nd. They now hail from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in southwest South Dakota. To understand their infamous warrior culture, you must first know that they are descendants of Chief Crazy Horse himself, war hero of the Battle of Little Big Horn. What started as an attempt to confiscate their rifles, turned into a bloodletting after one deaf tribesman refused to give up his rifle on the grounds that he had paid a considerable amount of money for it. I first came to know the modern Oglala Sioux in high school when I volunteered to go build homes on Pine Ridge with Habitat for Humanity. It was an incredible experience where I learned about their age-old traditions and the good people who still faithfully practice them to this day. We had to be in before dark each night, and slept in the basement of a church with steel bars over the windows. In perhaps the most vibrant modern illustration of their continued warrior culture and resistance to their land being taken, a band of armed Sioux took over the south unit of Badlands National Park in the summer of 2002. Now, fifteen years later, it was the Oglala Sioux who once again threatened to make a stand. For them, they were protesting the violation of treaty land, specifically the Treaty of 1851, more so than the pipelines being built. Ed was an interesting guy. A Massachusetts native who now lives in Colorado, he held the strong opinions of someone who identified politically just a little further left than Bernie Sanders. Standing outside the Oglala House in the ever-increasing snowfall, he talked a bit about what it was like to protest as a veteran. Ed, who made it clear he was just as much an activist as he was a journalist, had actually taken part in the most heated actions up at the blockade. He took solace in his military training, and used it as motivation in the face of less-lethal munitions. But I was taking it for the people; I knew I could take it. There were people maybe ninety pounds, on the ground praying. It was about this time that Ed paused, looking off, before taking the conversation in a different direction. It also offered one of the best vantage points of the entire camp. Bullet catcher. When I got out I was listed as an expert sniper. A view of Oceti Oyate protest camp on February 22nd. Between Ed and the angry snowmobiler, it was clear that the demographics of the camp had changed since my last visit. During my first trip to Oceti, I had a pretty clear snapshot of the people who came to stand against DAPL. It was a mix of Native Americans, veterans, hippies, eco-warriors, professional protesters, as well as average citizens who felt called to a cause. There were conservative tribal members who defined a family in very traditional terms sitting side by side with college students from California who held meetings about not assuming gender and proper use of pronouns. It also seemed that there were a variety of reasons for being in camp; some did not care about oil but rather the violation of sacred ground, or the fight for treaty lands. Others still were against drilling for oil in general, or simply against running an oil pipeline under the Missouri River in particular. Some were there as members of the media, or were concerned professional medical personnel. All, almost without exception, were friendly and decent people. The deadline for evacuation was approaching, so I began to say my goodbyes with Ed when another protester joined us. On February 22nd, it seemed that the majority of the one hundred or so people that remained in the final hour before eviction were hard line indigenous peoples or societal outliers that found a community at Oceti with a spattering of activist media present. None were likely to leave voluntarily unless floodwaters seeped in under their tents. My time in the camp was up if I wanted to get out before the eviction deadline though, so I once again made my way through the mud and back up to Highway 1806. Protesters barricaded the north entrance of the camp just minutes prior to the eviction deadline. We would only be able to see a portion of the camp from there, and from a significant distance at that. None of the media present were happy about the move, but with the only other two options being arrest or leaving, we of course complied. After a few people scurried in, and a few more back out, protesters strung concertina wire across the entrance and stacked lumber as a barricade. I again heard the familiar pop of an incendiary device in the guard shack. The same structure that greeted thousands of protesters over the past six months was now engulfed in flames. As I made my final trek away from the camp entrance, a series of fireworks were launched into the sky. The guard shack that sat at the north entrance of the camp moments after it was set on fire. They were giving them until four in the afternoon, a full two hours after the eviction was to take effect, to work out the details. Captain Iverson added that they would take one camera operator, one photographer, and one staff writer up to the line with them. As the captain concluded his presser, I heard the distinctive buzz of a drone drop from the sky and fly over us. Myron is at it again, I thought to myself. I first met Myron Dewey outside of the media tent last December. Despite the TFR, Dewey had continued flying his drones in an attempt to document the protest, pipeline construction, as well as protester interaction with law enforcement and security contractors. By doing so, he risked up to one year of imprisonment and a 100,000-dollar fine. Reports of drones flying dangerously close to security personnel, sometimes right in their face, resulted in a few being shot out of the sky by security contractors. Some have even alleged that drones were being used as weapons against law enforcement aircraft in the area. Either way, shooting a drone out of the air is a serious felony-level offense. To date, no security contractors have been charged for shooting down drones. No one has been charged for flying drones in violation of the TFR either. Outside of a few more structures set on fire, nothing of note happened over the course of those two hours that a negotiation was to take place. We would later be informed that no one showed up to do the ceremonial arrest. The group, some holding flags and others a camera, was not happy to see that law enforcement allowed media from behind the barricade to come up with them. They accused officers of deciding what was newsworthy. Although I was frustrated with where we were positioned, I will admit the authorities were unbiased in who was allowed to come up to the protest line. A water protector walks up and down HIghway 1806 minutes before the eviction deadline, blessing those who wished to receive the sacrament offered. An officer announced that anyone who did not start heading south on the highway towards the reservation would be arrested by order of the Governor of North Dakota. A few insults from the crowd later, and the first arrests were made as the rest scattered a bit further back. Jon Ziegler was among those in the crowd of protesters. He was upset that law enforcement followed through with their promise to make arrests. The afternoon was not without controversy though. Screams of agony from Eric Poemz pierced the air as he was taken to the ground during one of the arrests. Poemz is a self-proclaimed journalist, although his Twitter account says he is a Native activist and full time water protector. Moments later, Poemz was taken to the ground and placed under arrest amid his screams claiming a broken hip. According to a report by CNN, Poemz was evacuated to a Bismarck hospital and medically cleared. He was then taken to the Morton County Correctional Center. Captain Iverson was visibly irritated with yet another drone zooming over his head as he came over once more to update the press pool. With the sun dropping low in the sky, he informed us that they would be wrapping up for the night. It was an anticlimactic end to what all expected to be a newsworthy stand off. Captain Iverson said, giving me the polite yet distinct impression that all media were expected to leave in short order. As I began the walk back to my truck, I overheard a conversation between an ACLU observer and a sheriff from Fargo, North Dakota. The impression was given, once again, that eviction would be a slow process likely to take days to accomplish the removal of the approximately 75 people left in camp. Law enforcement officials prepare for the first steps of the eviction process on February 22nd. I chimed in, asking how morale was for those in uniform. The FBI informed us that we literally rewrote the book on dealing with civil disobedience. Breaking away from the conversation, I snapped a few last pictures while the floodlights came on. A Morton County deputy approached, the first I had seen from the home county, so I assumed he must have just arrived for the night shift. With only his tired eyes to focus on, I saw a man that had been exhausted by this ordeal. He talked in a rushed, agitated way, putting me on the spot regarding how I felt, as a veteran, about a giant American flag draped over some of the GP-medium tents inside the camp. Truth be told, I was somewhat impressed that unlike many protests around the country, this one did not tolerate the burning of American flags. I assumed that the intolerance for that activity was rooted in the fact that more Native Americans serve in the military than any other ethnic group per capita. The deputy had plenty of vitriol for those who had stood opposite him in the protest camp though. He had ample reason to be angry given the actions perpetrated by some protesters that were a far cry from peaceful as they claimed. I attempted to keep the conversation light and upbeat, but realized that he had more in common with the protestors he had so much disdain for than he probably realized. With black smoke still lingering in my rearview mirror, I crossed over Backwater Bridge for the last time on my way back up to Bismarck. I was on a strict deadline to be back home, so the next day I sat in a local Bismarck Starbucks just off of I-94, nursing a coffee while uploading video footage from the day prior. At about 1130 in the morning, I figured the police must be at it again down at the camp by now, probably arresting protesters as the opportunity presented itself. I pulled up one of the live feeds broadcasting from within the camp, and found that a drastically different situation was unfolding. Dozens of Humvees and Bearcats moved on line with hundreds of heavily armed SWAT officers through the main camp. It was a law enforcement clearing operation that was, by my estimation, unprecedented in scale throughout American history. Officers went teepee to teepee, structure to structure, but all I could focus on was my own fear that someone who thought they were out of options would act out violently. Having raided nomad camps in Afghanistan before, I could remember how exposed you feel when approaching something with no hard walls, leaving you completely vulnerable to spray and pray gun fire. Despite how jarring the image of the clearing operation may have looked, as someone with a military background I was admittedly impressed. It was a massive undertaking, and the officers on the ground were conducting themselves impeccably. They were still allowing protesters to leave the camp without being arrested, as long as they were in fact leaving the camp. For those who chose to be arrested, officers approached slowly and without their weapons raised. Each protester that was zip-tied appeared to be treated respectfully; I even saw a peace pipe being handed off in a careful manner after the owner was detained. By 1400 on the 23rd of February, the Oceti Oyate protest camp was cleared and secure. Twenty-three protesters were arrested after refusing to leave; another twenty-three were apprehended after clean up efforts were underway. Miraculously, through eight months of protest that at times became very violent, no one on either side had died. I firmly believe that can be attributed to the overwhelming force that law enforcement entered the camp with on that last day, making anyone with violent intentions think twice. There was significantly less press there that day though. With an operation that size, it was clear that the media was misled the day prior. The author outside of Oceti Oyate, moments before media were cleared out. One of the men I served with in 1st Ranger Battalion, and deployed to war with, was a Navajo protester and leader in the camp actively participating for months. My dad, a good and honest man now wheelchair bound and dying of ALS, worked until his last able day as a sub-contractor for the Dakota Access Pipeline. I believe there were good people on both sides of this issue. I can tell you that I met people who felt moved enough to stand up for something they believed in while enduring some of the most austere terrain on planet earth. I also met people who never lost their desire to serve and protect, even in the face of burning vehicles and a barrage of insults to their character. From what I saw, the vast majority of protesters were non-violent and passionate. I also saw opposing forces that were both negatively impacted by the few in their ranks who stepped over the line.

The FBI informed us that we literally rewrote the book on dealing with civil disobedience. away from the conversation, I snapped a few last pictures while the floodlights came on.
