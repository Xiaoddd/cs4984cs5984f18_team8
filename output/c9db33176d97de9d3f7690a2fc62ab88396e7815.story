One of these camps is in Florida, which has formed to fight against the Sabal Trail Pipeline which endangers watersheds, schools and communities, and living ecosystems. I want to say I got involved in resisting the Sabal Trail Pipeline (STP) back in October of last year. Firster, handed me a flyer about a weekend workshop they were organizing to resist a local pipeline in FL, the STP. Once I went to the workshop I was hooked. I got rid of a lot of my belongings, sold my van, put what I was keeping in storage and by Christmas Day, I had joined Sacred Water Camp. From that point on I lived at the various camps for about 3 months. For me the campaign seemed to start when that first workshop happened. Folks from all over the country came to the workshop, even folks who had been at Standing Rock, it was really successful. It really evolved when Sacred Water Camp became a solid encampment. This gave folks who were traveling some distance a place to stay, do some action, and move on. I see this type of fluidity as very valuable to a movement. Hundreds of people came from all over the country and many of them had been at Standing Rock. Elders and youth were getting involved, protesting, organizing, donating supplies. There have been police stationed at each site where STP crosses under rivers. The State has sent their dogs out in mass during our protests, one in which we had about 300 protesters show up and about 80 police lined the fences, protecting the drill going underneath the Suwannee River. There have been about 30 arrests so far, the most recent was 3 at a protest on June 10th. Other actions have included folks standing directly in front of the trucks that carries water to the drills, multiple lock downs to these trucks, and people locking down inside the pipeline with a 200 pound cement block. The resistance has been strong, but I always feel it can be stronger. There are many ways to support those who put their lives on the line to save the Earth and its inhabitants. A main way is throwing some money their way. Often times folks want to cheer on activists while they are organizing, protesting, and doing direct action, but then folks tend to leave others in the dust during times their support is truly needed. In this case, taking a plea deal with restitution seemed better than being felons for the rest of our lives. Even though the gas has been turned on there are still protests happening, in addition to a memorial service for James Marker, a man who shot up the pipeline with a high powered rifle and was chased and then killed by police. At this point the folks who really need support are the ones who have thrown down and now have to deal with probation and court costs. Some things to keep in mind going forward is that it takes a large amount of bodies in order to get any sort of attention and to make headway, especially folks willing to do direct action. Also there needs to be consistent communication, especially about the various tactics folks wish to use.
