Just a few weeks into office, President Trump gave the Army Corps of Engineers the green light to proceed with construction of the DAPL. Due to the executive order, the Army Corps of Engineers granted easement and failed to provide an environmental impact statement. The fight is now in the courts, and they are asking that the treaties kept to protect our land be respected just as they were by our founding fathers. Since the beginning of this DAPL project we have actively remained protecters of this land and water. We have called local leaders, signed petitions against the funding banks, sent emails, and donated when possible. We have started this campaign in hopes of allowing anyone that stands behind this cause to donate and help us to reach our goal of standing with these Native Leaders. Shall donations exceed the goal, all remaining funds will go to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in an effort to continue the good fight. We will be leaving from Austin, Texas on March 8th and returning on March 12. Please share and forward to any and all who you believe would love to support this cause. Thank you once again.
