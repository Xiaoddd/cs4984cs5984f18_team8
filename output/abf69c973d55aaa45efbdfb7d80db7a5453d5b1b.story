But the poll also finds that support for the pipeline expansion has actually grown in B.C. since November, while opposition has slightly dropped. The support for the project grew by three per cent since the last Insights West poll on the issue was done in November 2017. Opposition declined by one per cent. But it has been suggested that Stewart himself has been actively encouraging public protests and civil disobedience. Activists and First Nations have warned of civil disobedience on the scale of the Clayoquot Sound War in the Woods of the 1990s, which resulted in 900 arrests, and more recent Standing Rock protests over the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota, which ended with the National Guard being brought in to dismantle a protest camp. He wanted some hard data to impress upon his fellow parliamentarians in Ottawa just how serious the situation could get. While Burnaby is expected to be ground zero in anti-pipeline protests, Stewart believes there could be protests elsewhere in B.C. as well, especially among First Nations who are in the pipeline corridor. According to Kinder Morgan Canada (TSX:KML), about 50 agreements have been signed with First Nations along the pipeline corridor. But even within those communities that have signed benefits agreements, there are likely to be small but ardent factions of First Nations who disagree with their leaders. Stewart said he would support pipeline expansions that went to Eastern Canada, but only if it were to supply Canadian refineries. He would not support pipelines intended to export Alberta oil, like the Energy East pipeline proposal. That proposal has since been scrapped by TransCanada Corporation (TSX:TRP), which is now focused on the resurrected Keystone XL pipeline expansion. Linkedin Created with Sketch.
