From Cabbie to Court Judge Politics. Commentary from a Safe Distance Ladder. From Intern to CEO Society. From Underground to Mainstream Lifestyle Wander. Essay by John S. Blake. Then, we used that shape for the outline of our art project every November; the Thanksgiving turkey. My bad. The irony is overwhelming. The hypocrisy, unfathomable. I try to imagine how two generations from now will view our existence. I imagine high school students reading how, during the Thanksgiving festivities nationwide, authorities were using water cannons on indigenous people on indigenous land in order to break yet another treaty. I fathom the single, raised eyebrow on the countenance of a teenager who has a sudden epiphany concerning how full of shit this nation has been. I am forty-six years young. In my lifetime, I once enjoyed summer. I remember how cool we managed to stay because drinking water was so easily accessible. That easy. It was hilarious. My mother wiped tears away and cackled as I shook my head at the absolute absurdity. It was an aroma that signified summer fun and the absence of homework. It meant I survived another school year and managed to get permission to head out with friends to the community pool. Now, the nostalgic perfume filled my drinking glass and closed my throat at the sudden thought of drowning. I smelled bleach in my shower. First, water was being purchased by the gallon. Then, came the individual bottles. Restaurants began offering bottled water (to those who could afford expensive meals). Water. Real, drinkable water; odorless, tasteless, pure, sold cheap. I recall a man flicking a lighter under the gaping mouth of his kitchen faucet, turning the knob slightly, and as if witchcraft, a torch poured downward from where lips should easily ease onto a smooth shapeless stick of welcoming water. Then, there was a clarity problem in Wyoming, Montana, Pennsylvania, and other states. People began to talk about how fracking may be interfering with water supplies, causing dark coloration in drinking water. I too am guilty of living in distorted patriotic faith; our government would never sacrifice its own citizens, simultaneously pandering to corporations. I mean, not over water. I live in Virginia. And by drinkable I do not suggest it tastes enjoyable. This sounds impossible to me; not that I have these dilemmas over a natural resource, but that this is truly a high-class problem should one compare it to what Flint, Michigan, residents are still experiencing since state corruption and corporate greed has signed the death warrant on children who have been diagnosed with lead poisoning there. People are dying from their water. It is two days after Thanksgiving. The leftovers impregnate most of our refrigerators and freezers. We stroll malls and sit in cafes. We move in and out of establishments and grow thirsty. We stop somewhere and grab bottled water. We grab, and pay for, water without confrontation. On the Standing Rock Reservation, people are navigating water cannons and rubber bullets, dogs with bloodstained grimaces and militarized companies who serve billionaires, while our President, while our televised news media, shove their heads in the clouds for the sake of paychecks and allegiances to corporations. We are at this point watching indigenous people being thrown off their land, seeing their sacred burial grounds dug up for an oil pipeline because the original path for the pipeline was argued against by white people who understood the impending risk to their water. So, the path was simply changed, through a reservation, and the indigenous are expected (again) to just move, get out of the way. This is what wealthy white people want. And so it goes. The sun will abandon the water protectors soon. The water cannons will continue through the night. Hypothermia will be suffered. This bio-political move to keep the protest off of news outlets in order to let the Sioux, and their sibling tribes, die there without so much as a whisper from anyone who sees journalistic integrity in the mirror. And every object I purchase for Christmas supports this government. Every teeth-gleamed smile at decorations is me ignoring an atrocity. This will surely make room for a steel trail of black tears straight to Texas. But the truth is, I still find it difficult to swallow the reality: people will kill themselves and anyone in their way for profit. Tomorrow, in D.C., there is a march from the Department of Justice building to the White House. It begins at noon. My hope is that we will give a better history to our great grandchildren than the history our great grandparents had to hand down to us. My hope is for less blood.
