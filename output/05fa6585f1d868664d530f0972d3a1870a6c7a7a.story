VIP The Harvard Gazette Unsafe levels of toxic chemicals found in drinking water of 33 states Similar designs, 100 million years apart Health & Medicine Unsafe levels of toxic chemicals found in drinking water of 33 states Health & Medicine Unsafe levels of toxic chemicals found in drinking water of 33 states A Harvard study has found that the drinking water of millions of Americans contains PFASs, industrial chemicals known to cause cancer and immunodeficiency. The study was published Aug. 9 in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters. PFASs have been used over the past 60 years in industrial and commercial products ranging from food wrappers to clothing to pots and pans. They have been linked with cancer, hormone disruption, high cholesterol, and obesity. Although several major manufacturers have discontinued the use of some PFASs, the chemicals continue to persist in people and wildlife. Drinking water is one of the main routes through which people can be exposed. The researchers looked at concentrations of six types of PFASs in drinking-water supplies, using data from more than 36,000 water samples collected nationwide by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from 2013 to 2015. They also looked at industrial sites that manufacture or use PFASs; at military fire-training sites and civilian airports where firefighting foam containing PFASs is used; and at wastewater-treatment plants. So could the sludge the plants generate, which is frequently used as fertilizer. The study found that PFASs were detectable at the minimum reporting levels required by the EPA in 194 out of 4,864 water supplies in 33 states across the United States. Drinking water from 13 states accounted for 75 percent of the detections: California, New Jersey, North Carolina, Alabama, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, Georgia, Minnesota, Arizona, Massachusetts, and Illinois, in order of frequency of detection. This map is based on data from the EPA. Areas highlighted in blue indicate zip codes where PFASs were detected in one or more water samples from 2013 to 2015 that were at or above the minimum reporting levels required by the EPA. Zip codes that are elevated in PFASs do not represent all drinking water sources in that region. Individuals concerned about their drinking water should consult with their local water suppliers. More detailed maps based on the EPA data are available from the Environmental Working Group. Other Harvard Chan authors of the study included Philippe Grandjean and Courtney Carignan. Funding for the study came from the Smith Family Foundation and a private donor. PFASs and reduced immune response Another Harvard Chan School study, led by Grandjean, adjunct professor of environmental health, published in Environmental Health Perspectives, also suggested negative health impacts of PFAS exposure. That study looked at a group of about 600 adolescents from the Faroe Islands, an island country off the coast of Denmark. Those exposed to PFASs at a young age had lower-than-expected levels of antibodies against diphtheria and tetanus, for which they had been immunized. The findings suggested that PFASs, which are known to interfere with immune function, may be involved in reducing the effectiveness of vaccines in children.
