This project is being pursued in violation of a U.S. Government treaty with the Sioux nation, while also violating a number of land use and environmental protection statutes and regulations. The MNA will contribute to the Standing Rock Defense Fund, a fund established by a coalition of tribal leaders, environmental, religious and social justice advocacy groups seeking to halt the project. The MNA opposition to the Dakota Pipeline project is in keeping with the organization's broader positions regarding the need to stop permitting oil and gas infrastructure and instead move toward more clean, sustainable sources of energy to protect the health of people and the planet. Aside from the health impacts, the MNA is outraged by the decision to locate this pipeline on the Standing Rock reservation, as it represents another example of governmental and private interests seeking to exploit the Native American population and the underprivileged who lack the political clout and financial resources to prevent such unlawful trampling of their rights.
