Putin says Russia will not expel US diplomats in tit-for-tat measure Read more The president-elect has repeatedly spoken approvingly of Putin and called for closer relations with Russia. December 30, 2016 The tweet, like many from Trump that seem calculated to shock and offend, caused a predictable media furore. However, it probably will have done nothing to alleviate the difficult political position in which Trump now finds himself. At one point, he suggested the culprit might have been China, another state or even a 400lb man in his bedroom. On taking office in January, Trump might therefore be expected to simply end the Obama sanctions. And as president, he could do so; presidential orders can simply be repealed by the executive branch. But the situation is not that simple. If Trump did choose to remove the sanctions, he would find himself at odds with his own party. Senior Republicans in Congress responded to the Obama sanctions by identifying Russia as a major geopolitical foe and criticizing the new measures only as a case of too little too late. Some promised a push for further measures in Congress. Trump may therefore choose not to reverse the new sanctions. If so, he will find himself at odds with the man he so constantly praises. On Friday, the Kremlin responded to the moves, including the expulsion of 35 suspected intelligence operatives and the closing of two Russian facilities in the US, with a shrug. Putin, it seems, is willing simply to wait until Trump moves into the Oval Office. Trump will also face pressure from intelligence agencies, which have concluded that Moscow ordered the election cyber-attacks. Goldman also noted an international element to the situation facing Trump. Germany and France will hold elections in 2017. As my colleague just said, these diplomatic compounds were being used for intelligence purposes. In a transition team call on Friday, the incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, did not give details of when that meeting would take place or who would attend. No talks were planned with Moscow, he said. Underlining the challenges awaiting Trump in his own party, most senior Republicans criticized the Obama administration only for acting too slowly. On Friday, it was reported that McCain, a member of the Senate armed services committee, had scheduled a hearing on foreign cyber threats for 5 January, and called senior intelligence officials to testify. Analysts were also concerned not with whether the sanctions should have been imposed at all, but rather whether the White House had acted quickly enough, and whether its eventual response was strong enough. Though the strength, timing and effect of the new sanctions are contested, Trump faces a bipartisan consensus. Please choose your username under which you would like all your comments to show up.
