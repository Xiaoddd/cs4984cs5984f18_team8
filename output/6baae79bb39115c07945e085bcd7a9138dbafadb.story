And while Standing Rock leaders may be pleased with their success, American Indians will be bearing the devastating economic consequences of this decision for years to come. The story of the Dakota Pipeline began two years ago, when a company called Energy Transfer Partners applied to build a 1,100-mile pipeline from Iowa to North Dakota in order to carry 570,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The company went to great lengths to locate the pipeline on almost exclusively private lands. Such negotiations are much easier than those involving public lands, and the many farmers who allowed the pipeline to run across their property were paid handsomely. Only 3 percent of its length would need federal approval, and in those places the pipeline was designed to run next to existing utility lines, meaning that approval would presumably be hard to deny. Even in those cases, the company was careful to tread lightly. It made sure that the route would avoid sites that were even being considered for the National Register of Historic Places. It hired professional archaeologists and coordinated with State Historic Preservation Officers and rerouted the pipeline 140 times in North Dakota alone to avoid proximity to cultural resources like burial grounds or ceremonial sites. The Corps has a legal obligation to consult local tribes that could be affected by construction. And in 2009, President Obama reaffirmed this with a follow-up executive order. The Corps did just that. As court documents show, beginning in the fall of 2014, representatives of the Corps sent multiple letters to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and received no response. They attempted to set up a number of meetings and again were met with no response. When they arrived for one meeting, they were told that the conclave had started earlier than expected and was already over. At the next, discussion of the pipeline was removed from the agenda because the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer did not show up. The following year was also marked by a constant stream of letters from the Corps. Finally, in the spring of 2016, a series of meetings were held between the Corps and the tribe to point out those sites, including one during a visit to the lake itself. The Corps offered a number of concessions and promised that there would be double-walled piping in order to address any concerns about leaks. The Corps, having held 389 meetings with 55 tribes and having met with the Standing Rock Sioux a dozen times, decided to issue easements to permit pipe to be laid. Then, in late spring, the tone of the communications shifted markedly. Archambault demanded that the Army Corps reexamine the route of the entire pipeline for potential effects on cultural and environmental resources. When the Corps responded that it had no jurisdiction over the rest of the project, Archambault ended the consultative process. A group of 200 Native Americans launched a protest on horseback and announced that they would not leave the area near the mouth of the Cannonball River, where pipeline construction was under way, until they received assurance that the pipeline would not go near the reservation. On July 26, the Corps, having held 389 meetings with 55 tribes about the project and having met with the Standing Rock Sioux a dozen times, decided to issue easements to permit pipe to be laid through the Mississippi River, Lake Sakakawea, and Lake Oahe. The next day, the Standing Rock Sioux filed suit, seeking an emergency halt to all construction and claiming they had not been properly consulted. Both concluded that the Corps had followed all the proper procedures of consultation and said there was no compelling reason to halt the project. By this point, though, thousands of protesters had joined the encampment at Standing Rock, including Hollywood near-royalty. The 24-year-old actress Shailene Woodley was arrested for trespassing on private land. Hundreds more protesters were taken into custody after lighting fire to bales of hay. A contingent of anarchists showed up. And then came the usual conflicts between protesters and local law enforcement, with the former claiming they were experiencing police brutality through the use of water cannons and rubber bullets, while the police noted that the protesters were trespassing and endangering local residents. Meanwhile, the national attention brought to the cause turned Standing Rock into a party. Many arrived with little or nothing to support themselves. By this point, the protesters were making news almost every day. It was therefore unsurprising that the Obama administration ultimately stepped in to make that accommodation a reality. The tribe and their supporters celebrated with fireworks. And he should be, because by all rights, Standing Rock should have lost this fight. Energy Transfer Partners and a large coalition of businesses, labor unions, state officials, and private landowners are now left to figure out what went wrong. T he President made his interest in Indian issues known early in his tenure. He hosted a White House Tribal Nations conference during each year of his presidency. He started an indigenous youth initiative (Generation I) and has devoted a considerable amount of time to visiting with Native leaders and dedicating discretionary funds to some of their causes. In 2014, Obama was the first president to go to Standing Rock. These may seem like esoteric questions, but such issues are regularly tested in our courts. Tribal leaders continue to claim that tribes are nations apart, but no legal authority takes seriously the idea that the relationship between any Indian community and Washington is the same as the one between Washington and Paris, for example. American Indians are, after all, American citizens. The problems of Native Americans, it turns out, do not stem from a lack of control over land off the reservations so much as a lack of control on the reservations. But Native leaders continue to invoke treaties that were signed in the 18th and 19th centuries as evidence of their land rights, as though these lands are not part of the United States. The Standing Rock leaders argue that, even though the land being used for the pipeline is not reservation land, it is land that was promised to the tribe in an 1851 treaty. Other protesters, environmental activists, and academics have echoed this claim. In this century, the Court reaffirmed the notion that Indians have no claim to land that sits off of reservations. The Oneida argued that because the acreage had been part of their original reservation laws of tribal sovereignty should apply. Indeed, the problems of Native Americans do not stem from a lack of control over land off the reservations so much as a lack of control on the reservations. Reservations are lands that are held in trust by the federal government. The original goal was to keep Indians contained. Now, it has shifted to preserving these lands for indigenous peoples. But the effect is the same. Their lives are micromanaged by the 9,000-person staff of the Bureau of Indian affairs. One Crow man I spoke to was trying to purchase a few acres of land from his neighbor, another Indian, on which to graze some cattle. Which is, of course, exactly what happened. The result of rampant governmental mismanagement and the lack of property rights has been the kind of poverty that one would only expect to find in the Third World. People live in tents through winters in North Dakota. There are large extended families piled into single-trailer homes. Trash is everywhere. American Indians have higher rates of poverty, unemployment, gang violence, alcohol abuse, rape, and child sexual abuse than any other racial or ethnic group in America. Indeed, one reason for the kind of support that the Standing Rock protesters have received is that these conditions and these statistics are simply shocking to most Americans who are learning of them for the first time. But others are trying to make use of natural resources, since it turns out that the same lands that Indians were forced onto in the 19th century because they were worthless for farming have turned out to be rich in oil, gas, and coal. Indeed, there is much that the Obama administration could have done to help the tribes that actually want to engage in more extraction. Instead they have allowed the Bureau of Land Management to run roughshod over tribes when it comes to controlling their reservations. Because there is no army of protesters whose members want to make sure that American Indians can engage in fracking on their own land, these tribes will never get the kind of support that the Standing Rock tribe has. All of these tribes have expressed support for a bill called the Native American Energy Act, which would allow them more independence when it comes to using their own natural resources. If blocking one means also being able to claim the mantle of support for indigenous rights, well, so much the better. In the state of Washington, the Gateway Pacific Terminal project has pitted one Indian tribe against another. But the impoverished Crow tribe has supported the project because it needs a way to transport coal that it is extracting from the Powder River Basin. But the objections of these Natives have been ignored by the administration. Tribes that would like to see more economic development on their lands are cautiously optimistic about the incoming Trump administration. But in the meantime, President Obama has ushered in a new era of regulatory uncertainty. The next time a private firm wants to undertake any kind of construction project, it will know to keep its economic activity as far away from Indian country as possible. Many companies are already reluctant to do business with tribes because of various legal uncertainties, but now they will be less likely to locate industry in an area where Indians could potentially see jobs or feel any economic boost.

The Iranian threat will not be neutralized until it abandons its support for terror and the repression of its people, and that will not end until the Iranian regime is no more. Honest observers must reluctantly conclude that the adage is wrong. Though it may be commonplace, American political actors who contradict the president in the conduct of their own foreign policy should be judged on the policies they are advocating. In the case of Iran, those who seek to convince the mullahs and their representatives that repressive theocracy and a terroristic foreign policy are dead-ends are advancing the interests not just of the United States but all mankind.

Nothing excites the Resistance more than the prospect of Trump leaving office before the end of his term. What Fire and Fury lacked in journalistic ethics, it made up in receipts. Imitators were sure to follow, especially after Wolff alienated himself from the mainstream media by defending his innuendos about Haley. It was during the first week of September that Resistance Porn became a competitive industry. The opposition began panting soon after. That was the point. The audience for Wolff and Woodward does not want to be surprised. Fear is not a book that will change minds. Nor is it intended to be. The popular fixation with Trump the man, and with the turbulence, mania, frenzy, confusion, silliness, and unpredictability that have surrounded him for decades, serves two functions. No longer are they merely journalists, wonks, pundits, and activists sniping at a most unlikely president. They are politically correct versions of Charles Martel, the last line of defense preventing Trump the barbarian from enacting the policies on which he campaigned and was elected. How closely their sensational claims and inflated self-conceptions track with reality is largely beside the point. The author turned policy disagreements over trade and national security into a psychiatric diagnosis. In what can only be described as a journalistic innovation, the author dispensed with middlemen such as Wolff and Woodward, providing the Times the longest background quote in American history. What President Trump has done to the Resistance is driven it batty. For a very limited time, we are extending a six-week free trial on both our subscription plans.

Stanley Kubrick only reluctantly agreed on the inclusion of the billiard-room scene in Eyes Wide Shut that caps the movie (and in which Sydney Pollack plays a key character). I wrote it. Because his grades were not high enough (except in physics), this son of a Bronx doctor could not get into colleges crammed with returning GIs. The nearest he came to higher education was when he slipped into accessible lectures at Columbia. He told me, when discussing the possibility of a movie about Julius Caesar, that the great classicist Moses Hadas made a particularly strong impression. While others were studying for degrees, solitary Stanley was out shooting photographs (sometimes with a hidden camera) for Look magazine. As a movie director, he often insisted on take after take. Only Peter Sellers and Jack Nicholson had the nerve, and irreplaceable talent, to tell him, ahead of shooting, that they could not do a particular scene more than two or three times. The same method could be applied to writers. Kubrick might recognize what he wanted when it was served up to him, but he could never articulate, ahead of time, even roughly what it was. Picking and choosing was very much his style. Genius puts chance to work. At dinner, I once asked Marcello Mastroianni why he was so willing to play losers or clowns. Orson Welles called movie-making the ultimate model-train set. After they moved in, academics were determined that their subject be a very big deal indeed. Comedy became no laughing matter. It is declared to be, yes, Yiddishkeit, and in particular, the Holocaust. This ground has been tilled before by Geoffrey Cocks, when he argued that the room numbers in the empty Overlook Hotel in The Shining encrypted references to the Final Solution. Abrams would have it that even Barry Lyndon is really all about the outsider seeking, and failing, to make his awkward way in (Gentile) Society. He insinuates that I had less to do with Eyes Wide Shut than I pretend and that Stanley regretted my involvement. No matter. Were Abrams (the author also of a book as hostile to Commentary as this one is to me) able to put aside his waxed wrath, he might have quoted what I reported in my memoir Eyes Wide Open to support his Jewish-intellectual thesis. One day, Stanley asked me what a couple of hospital doctors, walking away with their backs to the camera, would be talking about. He greets her on the gangway in full nautical rig. Ah, but Lolita was published, in Paris, in 1955, six years later. The film of Lolita is unusual for its garrulity. That said, in my view, The Killing, Paths of Glory, Barry Lyndon, and Clockwork Orange were and are sans pareil. So I did. The principal reason for Abrams to doubt my veracity is that my having chosen the name renders irrelevant his subsequent fanciful digression on the deep, deep meanings of the name Ziegler in Jewish lore; hence he wishes to assign the naming to Kubrick. If you choose, you can apply, on line, for screenwriting lessons from Nathan Abrams, who does not have a single cinematic credit to his name.

Respectively headquartered kitty-corner from each other in the brand-new Lincoln Center campus, the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Opera were jointly responsible for setting the tone for opera in America at a time when large-scale productions of the operatic classics could be seen only in a handful of other American cities. At the Met, distinguished singers and conductors, mostly born and trained in Europe, appeared in theatrically conservative big-budget productions of the popular operas of the 19th century, with a sprinkling of pre-romantic and modern works thrown in to leaven the loaf. Between them, the companies represented a feast for culture-consuming New Yorkers, though complaints were already being heard that their new theaters were too big. A half-century later, the feast has turned to famine. In 2011, New York City Opera left Lincoln Center, declaring bankruptcy. It closed its doors forever two years later. He was accused in 2017 of molesting teenage musicians and was dismissed from all of his conducting posts in New York and elsewhere. Today the Met is in dire financial straits that threaten its long-term survival. Waleson draws on her experience as the opera critic of the Wall Street Journal to speculate on the prospects for an art form that has never quite managed to set down firm roots in American culture. The days in which an ambitious community sought successfully to elevate itself into the first rank of world cities by building and manning an opera house are long past, and Mad Scenes and Exit Arias helps us understand why. According to LaGuardia, NYCO existed to perform popular operas at popular prices for a mass audience. In later years, it moved away from that goal, but the slogan stuck. Indeed, no opera company has ever formulated a clearer statement of its institutional mission. Well into the 21st century, City Opera stuck more or less closely to its redefined mission. Under Paul Kellogg, the general and artistic director from 1996 to 2007, it did so with consistent artistic success. That changed when Peter Gelb became its general manager in 2006. Kellogg was frustrated by the chronic acoustic inadequacies of the New York State Theater and sought in vain to move City Opera to a three-theater complex that was to be built (but never was) on the World Trade Center site. He retired soon after Gelb came to the Met. Mortier made a pair of fateful decisions. Then he announced a follow-up season of 20th-century operas that lacked audience appeal. That follow-up season never happened, because Mortier resigned in 2008 and fled New York. He was replaced by George Steel, who had previously served for just three months as general manager of the Dallas Opera. Then he mounted a series of productions of nonstandard repertory that received mixed reviews and flopped at the box office. The truth was that it had none, and when the company went under in 2013, few mourned its passing. In addition, his new productions of the standard-repertory operas on which the Met relied to draw and hold older subscribers were felt by many to be trashily trendy. The Met had particular difficulty managing the reduced circumstances of the 21st century when it came to opera. Its 3,800-seat theater has an 80-foot-deep stage with a proscenium opening that measures 54 feet on each side. As a result, it is all but impossible to mount low-to-medium-budget shows in the Metropolitan Opera House, even as the company finds it is no longer able to fill its increasingly empty house. Two decades ago, the Met earned 90 percent of its potential box-office revenue. Above all, Gelb was swimming against the cultural tide. But according to the National Endowment for the Arts, the percentage of U.S. adults who attend at least one operatic performance each year declined from 3.2 percent in 2002 to 2.1 percent in 2012. This problem, of course, is not limited to opera. It is true that opera in America has had a great and glorious history, but virtually the whole of that history consisted of American productions of 18th- and 19th-century European operas. By contrast, no opera by an American classical composer has ever entered the international major-house repertoire. Indeed, while new American operas are still commissioned and premiered at an impressive rate, few things are so rare as a second production of any of these works. The success of Porgy and Bess, which received its premiere not in an opera house but on Broadway, reminds us that American musical comedy, unlike American opera, is deeply rooted in our national culture, in much the same way that grand opera is no less deeply rooted in the national cultures of Germany and Italy, where it is still genuinely popular (if less so today than a half-century ago). By comparison with Porgy, Carousel, Guys and Dolls, or My Fair Lady, American opera as a homegrown form simply does not exist: It is merely an obscure offshoot of its European counterpart. It is not that grand opera is incapable of appealing to American theatergoers. At its best, no art form is more thrilling or seductive.

Even Kourtney Kardashian of Keeping Up with the Kardashians cries because she sometimes has to work away from her kids. No similar laments come from the father of her children, Scott Disick. Sex matters, it turns out. Men and women are different. The same cannot be said for men. For modern feminism to survive, this reality must be ignored. The denial of differences between the genders is ultimately what leads to so much unhappiness. Certainly, and more men make that choice today than ever before. Charen touches on many of the ways in which feminism has led women to make poor decisions for their lives. She addresses hook-up culture, abortion, and the devaluation of marriage. Charen challenges this idea by considering what we learn from taking in the bigger picture. For all the frequent hand-wringing over why so few women end up becoming CEOs of companies, the reason is obvious. In study after study, we find that women are choosing not to take that position. Sex matters is as much a celebration of womanhood as an explanation of all the ways that women and men differ.
