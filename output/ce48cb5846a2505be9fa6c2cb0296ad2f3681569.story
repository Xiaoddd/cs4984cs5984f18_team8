The Kinder Morgan pipeline was not built after a public outcry. The Kinder Morgan pipeline was not built after a public outcry. It was found by an ordinary citizen who noticed dead vegetation and the powerful smell of gasoline in a rural Upstate community two years ago. The ability of a private oil pipeline company to condemn land for a new project is a particular sore spot with property rights advocates, forest companies, environmentalists and some state legislators. During testimony Wednesday, they questioned why for-profit oil companies have the right to condemn land without showing a public need. Pipeline companies say they prefer not to condemn land. The committee that heard testimony includes state lawmakers, oil pipeline interests and state regulators. A state law approved last spring requires the committee to study whether South Carolina needs tighter controls on pipeline companies and to report its findings to the Legislature. The state has two major oil pipelines running through the foothills near Anderson and Greenville. After Kinder Morgan proposed its new pipeline through South Carolina and Georgia, Palmetto State lawmakers banned oil pipeline companies from condemning land for three years. As early as next summer, the study committee will recommend to lawmakers what should be done. Petroleum pipelines have stirred passions in communities across the country, with many people complaining that the lines are intrusive and a source of pollution. Closer to South Carolina, Colonial has drawn fire recently over two pipeline breaks in Alabama, including one that caused an explosion. That power generally is reserved for governments or entities that need property for a public use, such as a road. She urged the committee to recommend a permanent ban on eminent domain by for-profit companies. Holleman, of the Southern Environmental Law Center, said there is no need for pipeline companies to retain the power of eminent domain for new lines. Research his group has conducted shows that pollution levels actually are increasing in spots. Benzene, a cancer-causing material, for instance, reached 7,850 parts per billion in one place in September. Of the nearly 370,000 gallons that spilled, at least 160,000 gallons still have not been cleaned up from the property in rural Anderson County, he said. Creeks and groundwater are suffering, he said. Holleman criticized the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control for failing to require a more aggressive cleanup plan. His organization has filed formal comments with DHEC to complain about the plan.
