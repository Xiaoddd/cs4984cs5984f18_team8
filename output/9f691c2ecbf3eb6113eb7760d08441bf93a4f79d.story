A group of protesters had blocked a private road used by workers building the Dakota Access pipeline across his North Dakota county, halting the construction work. Eleven protesters were arrested that day. What began as a couple of small protest camps on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation eventually swelled into an international incident. Now the sheriff thinks Nebraska will be next for a similar mega demonstration. With the recent resurrection of the Keystone XL pipeline project by President Donald Trump, the group that led the opposition to the pipeline, Bold Nebraska, has pledged to renew its fight. On its website, the grass-roots group is not only asking pipeline opponents to write letters and attend rallies and court hearings, but also to risk arrest. Thousands of Native Americans and environmentalists poured in to protest there. But Kleeb said her group wants to be ready if the pipeline is eventually approved in the state. To be sure, such actions are probably a long way off. A federal lawsuit filed to block the Keystone XL project might take months to resolve. And TransCanada Corp. must gain approval from the State of Nebraska for its proposed route across the Cornhusker State, a process that will carry into the fall. Additional lawsuits to block the use of eminent domain to obtain right of way easements for the 36-inch pipeline will most assuredly follow. It might take two years to cross all of those hurdles and start construction. Law enforcement and county officials interviewed say there have been some discussions about what might be coming, but they declined to say whether any protest-control training is underway. So far, local pipeline events have been peaceful, said Radcliff, who believes any protests are months away. The issue of protests and preparations has come up before. In 2013, Bold Nebraska denounced TransCanada after it discovered, through a public records request, that the pipeline company had made presentations to Nebraska law enforcement officials about environmental protests and how anti-terrorism laws could be used to jail demonstrators. A TransCanada spokesman, in 2013, said the company was only trying to show law enforcement officials what tactics protesters had used elsewhere. The presentation showed how demonstrators had chained themselves to heavy equipment and built treehouses in the path of the pipeline route to slow construction. Bold Nebraska has erected some structures on the pipeline route that eventually could become flashpoints for protests. The farm, which is on the pipeline route, also was the site of a benefit concert in 2014 by singers Neil Young and Willie Nelson. The pipeline would pass near the reservation, which is just across the Nebraska state line. Nine Poncas died en route, including a young daughter of Chief Standing Bear. But Kleeb emphasized it may not come to that. She expressed confidence that the state will either reject the pipeline route or do what Bold Nebraska has suggested: move the pipeline route to parallel the existing Keystone pipeline that runs through eastern Nebraska, thus avoiding the disruption of new properties. TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said Friday that no one wants to see a repeat of incidents like those in North Dakota. Guard dogs attacked protesters, demonstrators were doused with water in freezing weather and police were spit on and pelted with rocks and debris. Sheriff Kirchmeier said that several other states, including South Dakota, have asked him to relay what he learned from the Standing Rock protests, and said that eventually he expects to talk with those from Nebraska. In North Dakota, both his county and the state declared emergencies so they could utilize emergency funds to buy riot gear and cover the costs of officers who came from other states, including Nebraska. Kirchmeier said some tactical lessons were learned in confronting protesters, but he declined to share them. The sheriff said it also is important to keep lines of communication open with protest leaders so each side knows what to expect. That became difficult at Standing Rock, Kirchmeier said, because the protest got so large, so fast, that several divergent groups emerged. Most wanted to peacefully protest, but a small group wanted to disrupt and do damage. Only 6 percent of the 670 or so people arrested were from North Dakota, he said. The top state for protesters arrested was California.
