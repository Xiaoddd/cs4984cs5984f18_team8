Several are currently fighting charges and have been convicted. On May 31, 2018, HolyElk Lafferty (Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Member), became a convicted water protector convicted of two charges and awaits sentencing; the court date for sentencing is scheduled one year from her conviction. Her charges were Class A Misdemeanor Criminal Trespass and Class B Misdemeanor Engaging in a Riot. Many of the water protectors were born into families who have for generations been taking stands against the United States government, wanting their treaty rights honored. Lafferty is no exception. At the time, her parents were living on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in Porcupine. Before moving to Minnesota in her teens, the family lived between the Pine Ridge and Cheyenne River Reservations, as her father was a Mni Coujou Lakota from Lighting, SD (Cheyenne River Reservation) and her mother was Oglala, Mni Coujou and Sicangu. Currently, Lafferty lives in Minnesota. In 1977, her father was a Youth Representative in a delegation which traveled to Geneva, Switzerland for the United Nations Conference on the Indigenous Nations of the Western Hemisphere. Her father presented on the inadequacies of the forced educational system in America. Following the Custer incident, her mother joined the occupation in Wounded Knee and remained there until the final day of the takeover. Part of the trauma her mother experienced at Wounded Knee was witnessing her uncle Buddy Lamont being shot and killed. According to Lafferty, her parents instilled in her the belief in protecting the people and fighting for their rights guaranteed under the treaties and U.S. constitution. Raised in the traditional Lakota value system, her parents made sure ceremonies were part of her early teachings. For Lafferty, if doing the things her parents taught her and doing right by the people is considered activism then so be it. She feels she is just doing what is required of her as a Lakota woman. Lafferty along with her mother, daughter and niece, initially went to Standing Rock with the same intention as others. There was a spiritual pull which guided her and thousands of water protectors to the large gathering of tribal representatives from around the world. In Sept. 2016, the family went back and decided to make a camp within Oceti Sakowin Camp. She explains her days at the camp as being simple and traditional in nature; beginning and ending each day in prayer. Keeping the basic needs met were the daily chores and each person had a task. The camp was aware of the dangers just outside of the hundreds of tents, but within this tent city was a functioning society of school, kitchens, and other cultural events. We viewed our role there as holding prayerful space because at that time, there was plenty of capable leadership doing other parts of what needed to be done. Soon after, a video was circulated in which Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault asked the water protectors to go home. Lafferty and her family decided to stay and ignore the plea from Archambault. They decided to hold their ground knowing there would be eventual leaks in the oil pipeline which was being built under the Missouri River. They eventually decided to leave on Feb. 23, 2017. This was the day after the forcible eviction was scheduled to take place. According to Lafferty, much of the leadership in the camp had left following the victory declaration by the Standing Rock tribal president. During this time, she claims the entire camp had gone through a restructuring phase in which meetings were held daily. I simply started showing up, doing more and attempting to be accountable to all the people and their needs. It was very hard times but what I loved about it was how every person there was realizing that they were the leaders we had been looking for. During these ending months of the camp, Lafferty was aware of the negativity within the camp and coming in from outside of the dwindling encampment. The movement was ending. That is where I held my focus. Continuing to attend meetings and showing leadership qualities admired throughout the camp, Lafferty was able to receive respect from many as the dangerous events were happening near the camp each day. Lafferty said she did her best to be aware of her surroundings and maintain her relationship with her higher power and use those prayers as guidance in decision making and day-to-day life choices for survival. She claims this time period of survival was an extremely emotional and wrenching experience which has taken over a year for her to process and slowly move past the trauma of Standing Rock. Not all was bad in Standing Rock, according to Lafferty. When persons go to battle together, those emotional, and spiritual bonds, are forever with a person. She has fond memories of the many faces, Native and non-Native, who she met and shared laughs and sorrow with. This love for the environment and the indigenous nations sent to Standing Rock to protect the water led to her arrest and eventual conviction. Lafferty shared her thoughts of the court case. She pleaded not guilty and went to trial. The morning was long and difficult emotionally. They brought three officers to testify for the defense and we had to watch the arrest video, which showed so much excessive force used on all of us. According to Lafferty, the prosecutor was clearly inexperienced, inarticulate, and was not creating a very strong case that was sufficient to convict her of either charge by its own written legal definition. I felt like it was going in a good direction and that all the prayers were working. She was found guilty. I have decided not to appeal. Wanting to move on, she is putting the trial and experience behind her. She is also the Communications Director of Thrive Unltd which is introducing an innovative approach to trauma and healing through the trainings being held in Native American communities across the nation. HolyElk Lafferty will continue to fight for indigenous nations. If there are no further arrests in the year leading up to her sentencing date in 2019, the charges will be removed from her record and the case file will be closed. She has one year and 30 days of jail time hanging over her head and a lifetime of good and bad memories from Standing Rock which will continue to keep her focused. Yes No, Work consumed me.
