Accompanied by music from Casey Koyczan, who also does the Street-Fighter-II-esque voiceover work, the three levels depict Alberta's oil sands, then the prairies of Saskatchewan (where pipelines are currently being built), before finally reaching the Straits of Mackinac, the waterway that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan.
