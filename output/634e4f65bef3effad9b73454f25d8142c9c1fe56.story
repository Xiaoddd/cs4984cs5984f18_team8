Also, in a written update sent to reporters Friday, the company said it has worked with environmental experts and consultants who have determined the leak's risks to humans and wildlife to be low. The update on the gas leak involving Hilcorp's 8-inch undersea pipeline did not provide information about the leak rate, which was pegged last week at between 210,000 and 310,000 cubic feet of gas a day. The leak, discovered Feb. 7 when a Hilcorp helicopter spotted roiling water, is located in the Middle Ground Shoal oil field northwest of Kenai. Based on that number and average household consumption rates made public by Enstar Natural Gas Co., the amount of wasted gas would have been enough to fuel about 370 homes a day in December. Hilcorp has said it can't shut down the gas line, which carries a fuel supply to generate heat, light and power on four offshore platforms in Cook Inlet. The pipeline is about 80 feet below the water, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation has said. On Feb. 10, DEC had sent a letter to Hilcorp seeking information such as options for reducing and assessing the leak's environmental impact. Hilcorp has said it needs to keep the line pressurized. Without a minimum pressure, the line could fill with water, allowing residual crude to escape from what was previously used as a crude oil pipeline. The company has taken steps to reduce the amount of gas flowing through the line, in turn reducing the amount of leaking methane, by reducing a variety of platform operations. The statement was issued by Lori Nelson, external affairs manager at Hilcorp Alaska, who did not return a phone call Friday afternoon. Cook Inletkeeper last week issued a notice of intent to sue to Hilcorp, citing concerns under the Clean Water Act, including over methane that could reduce oxygen levels in the water column, posing a threat to animals. In its statement to reporters, Hilcorp said consultants have conducted preliminary modeling of the amount of methane dissolving in the water column. The consultants are still refining their evaluation, the company said. Bob Shavelson of Cook Inletkeeper said on Friday the company could take steps to address the problem, like hiring an ice-management vessel to maintain ice-free conditions, so a remote-operated vehicle can be sent underwater to begin inspections.
