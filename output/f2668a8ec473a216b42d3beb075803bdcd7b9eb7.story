Winning this battle is as simple as choosing to abstain from the violent corrupt old system and participating in the new and peaceful system that hands the power back to the people. We feel that PIVX is this system. PIVX takes the control the banking elite has over money and gives it back to the people. It is the ultimate weapon in the battle against the money changers and information controllers because PIVX is the only cryptocurrency in existence that allows for completely anonymous storage while simultaneously paying interest. If you'd like to start your own PIVX wallet and be a part of this change and battle for peace and freedom, you can start by clicking here.
