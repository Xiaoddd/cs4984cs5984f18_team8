Subscribe to our email newsletter A groundbreaking ceremony was held in this regard at Inkoo, Finland on the compressor station worksite of the Balticconnector gas pipeline, which is scheduled to be completed by 2020. While 21km of the pipeline will be laid in Finland, 55km of it will be built in Estonia. The remaining 77km of the pipeline will be laid under the Baltic Sea from Inkoo to Paldiski in Estonia. While Baltic Connector is responsible for the Finnish segment of the gas pipeline project, Elering is handling the Estonian portion. The two companies are wholly owned by the Finnish and the Estonian governments. It is also anticipated to boost regional security of supply by diversifying gas sources. We are looking forward to the completion of the pipeline. The Balticconnector gas pipeline project will see construction of pipelines, stations, and systems to link the existing gas networks in Finland and Estonia.
