The wealthy backers of the pipeline already admitted that construction crews dug up tribal artifacts and waited 10 days to notify the state. The commission has since responded to the firm's attempt to avoid accountability. A December 16 memo, first reported by the Associated Press, notes that Dakota Access has repeatedly told the public that it has fully complied with applicable laws. In November, Julie Fedorchak, the chair of the commission, accused Dakota Access of violating two provisions of its construction order. The firm adjusted the pipeline route, but did not file any certifications with the state, and resumed construction on the adjusted route without securing approval, she said. According to Fedorchak, the artifacts that were disturbed were cairns. Those are stone formations or stone features that tribes use to mark important places, including burial grounds and sacred sites. In early September, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe notified a federal judge of similar stone features at another construction site. But a request for an injunction to protect the area was denied and the land was bulldozed by Dakota Access over the Labor Day holiday weekend. The 1,172-mile pipeline, which crosses four states, is nearly complete but a key portion near Standing Rock is on hold pending the outcome of an environmental review by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The process could take several months although the landscape could change after Republican president-elect Donald Trump comes on board. transition team.
