Advertisement Tribes' Request for More Say in Dakota Access Pipeline Study Denied BLAKE NICHOLSON, Associated Press Created: April 18, 2018 12:03 PM BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) - A judge has rejected the request by two American Indian tribes to be more involved in a court-ordered environmental review of the Dakota Access oil pipeline. But he also ordered the Army Corps of Engineers and developer Energy Transfer Partners to do additional study and planning. The Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux maintain that they're being left out of the process. They asked Boasberg to order they be given more involvement. Some of the work has been completed, and Boasberg says that makes part of the issue moot. Some is ongoing, and Boasberg says the tribes can continue their argument that it's flawed when the work is completed and presented to him.
