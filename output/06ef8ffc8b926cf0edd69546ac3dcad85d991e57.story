Activists demand that CNN and the rest of the mainstream media end the white-out on the events at Standing Rock. The militarized police force has been attacking peaceful, unarmed water protectors with rubber bullets, tear gas, and spraying water in sub-freezing temperatures. We demand accurate coverage of these atrocious events. Standing Rock is to 2016 what Selma was to 1965, and it should be on the evening news.
