Lakota man locked down to construction equipment at direct action against Dakota Access Pipeline, By Desiree Kane, CC BY 3.0 Resistance to colonial oppression has long been a way of life for Lakota and Dakota peoples living at Standing Rock. Their interactions have been defined to a large extent by conflict over land and resources, and through resistance to systematic efforts aimed at the destruction of their cultures and sense of identity through government policies such as allotment, termination, and relocation, along with their forced assimilation in boarding schools and the repression of Native spirituality and religion. The details of this historical context forms the foundation of the conflict over the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, and has become a flashpoint in a twenty-first replay of manifest destiny. The intensifying struggle over land and resources provided an impetus for conflict, which disrupted Native ways of life and the natural balance necessary to sustain their communities. The antagonism was exacerbated by the California gold rush that by the 1850s had intensified to the point that the US government was compelled to act. The solution, influenced by the military strength of the Native nations of the plains, was the negotiation of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851. The discovery of gold in Colorado in 1859 and Montana in 1861 accelerated the influx onto these lands and the establishment of the Bozeman trail--a further contravention of the 1851 treaty. The violation of the Ft. With the fervor of exterminationist rhetoric rising to a fevered pitch, along with the massacres of Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Blackfeet people at Sand Creek, and the Washita and Marias rivers, Native peoples of the Northern Plains had little choice but to fight. Many settlers, however, were not happy to be deprived of such valuable land, including the Black Hills, which the Lakota called Paha Sapa and considered sacred. The 1868 treaty was soon broken by the activities of miners, settlers, and soldiers following the established pattern. These conflagrations culminated in battle of the Greasy Grass (Little Big Horn) of 1876 with the routing of the Seventh Cavalry and the death of General Custer, alongside over 250 of his troops. This victory was short-lived, however, with the Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho enduring the full wrath of the US military in the following years. While Sitting Bull led his group of Lakota to Canada seeking refuge from persecution, reservation life had become dreadful. Sitting Bull and his followers remained in Canada for four years before returning to his home community at Standing Rock. With the Native nations of the plains mostly confined to reservations and made dependent upon the government for rations, the situation was bleak. Into this void, created of such trauma and suffering, emerged the messianic ghost dance movement. The murder of Sitting Bull, and then, two weeks later, the infamous Wounded Knee Massacre of Dec. 29, 1890 directly resulted from the exaggeration of fears evoked by this ceremonial practice. For in our contemporary moment, as a new administration comes into office and the approval of the pipeline seems imminent, courageous people remain at Standing Rock in remembrance of this other American past, continuing to defend the lands reserved by treaty, the right to clean water; both for them and for us, as they say mni wiconi, water is life.
