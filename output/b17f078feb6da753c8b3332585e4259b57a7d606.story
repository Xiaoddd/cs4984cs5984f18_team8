If the project is approved by the PUC, the application would go to the state Site Review Committee for secondary approval, which Shore estimated would take another year. All told, Shore said once both state regulatory bodies approve the project, construction of the 16-inch pipeline would take roughly two to three years. Liberty also failed to inspect Class II leaks, leaks recognized as non-hazardous at time of detection, requiring scheduled repair within six months or end of the calendar year, in a timely fashion, among several violations related to operation. The group considers itself New Hampshire's environmental justice network. The March 2016 consent decrees signed by Liberty accepts responsibility for violations that included; not having emergency power generators operational for at least a full year and overfilling 30,000-gallon propane containers at its Manchester and Nashua facilities, among six total violations. The state Site Review Committee is the regulatory arm responsible for factoring in Liberty's operating violations when considering the Granite Bridge proposal. Shore said since the fines were handed down, Liberty Utilities has launched increased training and inspections in order to better comply with state and federal regulations. Keeping our employees, customers and the public safe is our highest priority. Shore said Liberty Utilities remains confident the prior operational violations would not be the sole determining factor on whether or not the state Site Review Committee gives final approval when the Granite Bridge application arrives. The issues that were identified by the PUC Safety Division as part of the annual auditing of our documentation and paperwork in no way impacted the safety of our customers or the public. To infer otherwise is incorrect and misleading. We conduct many different forms of surveying and leak detection on our distribution system, these include mobile surveys, frost surveys, inspections of cast-iron and bare steel pipe and odor detection. He added this would reduce the likelihood a third party damages the pipeline while excavating. Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you. Digital access or digital and print delivery.
