Too many spills will be hidden. The people of ND and taxpaying citizens ceretainly have been forgotten and republican special interests are running rampant. How do u hid spills that harm land, kill wildlife, why would you give that much freedom to anyone. Stay off my land I want it as pure as possible. Our family land was homesteaded and I believe it is up to us to Protect it. It has provided three generations a living. I do not want a oil pit dump that be can be hidden. Trying to find it to read language. Seems like the next logical step. How can Rep. Streyle justify this bill other than he is choosing money over common sense environmental concerns. Spill reporting points to problem areas, and shows trends as to areas (operation types, equipment types and companies) that should be watched closer and inspected more often. My concerns could be partially addressed by increasing mandatory fines per gallon spilled above and beyond the cleanup costs of course. Bad actors and poor operators need incentives to comply with best management operation and safety practices and this bill weakens much of those incentives. 2) Passing laws which benefit your campaign donors, but have the potential to hurt your constituents is immoral and unethical. Roscoe you are a cheap floozie. Leave a comment Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.
