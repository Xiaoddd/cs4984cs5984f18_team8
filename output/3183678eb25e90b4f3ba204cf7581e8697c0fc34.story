Help us fight back. Mar 16, 2017 By Cook Inletkeeper In a preview of what could happen with offshore drilling in the Arctic Ocean, an underwater natural gas pipeline has been leaking in Alaska since December, and no repair is expected until late April, at the earliest. The lack of urgency to stop this leak by the federal and state governments and by industry is remarkable. Sea ice makes conditions too dangerous for divers to reach the pipeline, which was built in Cook Inlet south of Anchorage in 1965. The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the Alaska Department of Environmental Protection have not made the owner, Hillcorp Alaska, shut it down even though the federal agency found that the leak poses risks to public safety and the environment. The pipeline supplies natural gas to multiple oil-drilling platforms in Cook Inlet. The Hilcorp Liberty project is in the portion of the Arctic Ocean currently available for leasing. To ensure safety, the federal government has imposed limits on boating and aviation in the area of the Cook Inlet leak. Escaping methane could kill marine life by displacing oxygen in the water, posing a threat to Cook Inlet beluga whales, which were listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 2008. Some parts of the inlet, including the area of the leak, have been designated as critical habitat for the whales. Sea otters, some humpback whales, threatened eiders and an endangered population of Steller sea lions also call the inlet home.
