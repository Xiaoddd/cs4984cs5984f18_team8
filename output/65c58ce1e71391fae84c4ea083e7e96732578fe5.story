In too many schools, sex education (if there is any) can be boiled down to three words: Don't have it. Withholding the info and skills needed to make healthy decisions around sex and relationships can be downright dangerous. We know that abstinence-only programs don't keep people from having sex, and they don't lower pregnancy or STD rates. Some extreme lawmakers want to keep people from getting the high-quality sex education they deserve.
