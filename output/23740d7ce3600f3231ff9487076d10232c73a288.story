But the draft priority list takes aim at almost every Obama-era federal lands management initiative, from landscape-level planning to livestock grazing, and is sure to be criticized by Democrats and conservation groups. Priorities in detail The draft priority work list clarifies the Trump administration's stark, if not surprising, departure from the Obama administration's public lands management policies. President Trump has already called on federal land managers to remove obstacles to new energy development. And Zinke last month ended the moratorium on new coal leasing, revoked the department's policy on offsetting development impacts on natural resources, and ordered a review of all its rules on climate change, mitigation and energy development (E&E News PM, March 29). Climate change is not addressed in the draft priorities list. The priority list does not address a number of Obama administration priorities. For example, it does not directly mention the issue of the greater sage grouse and the role that federal grouse conservation plans will play in preserving the imperiled bird and its dwindling habitat. But renewable energy is listed in the draft priority work plan. The Obama administration viewed the expanded use of solar, wind and geothermal power as a key strategy for addressing climate change. Protecting the 'Southern Border' The draft documents do not specifically address President Trump's controversial proposal to build a massive new border wall along the United States' southern boundary with Mexico. Most observers agree that building the wall and protecting the environment will be difficult. A large and impenetrable wall, for example, could cause problems for migrating species like jaguars, which the Fish and Wildlife Service first listed as endangered in 1997. Zinke told members of the Public Lands Council last month that the Department of Homeland Security will issue an Endangered Species Act waiver on jaguars, which are found primarily in northern Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. The Key Messages document also addresses public lands management objectives set by Republican leaders in Congress. Not much to slow Florence flooding POLITICS Climate caucus's GOP ranks could plummet.
