The Defund Dakota Access Pipeline movement, removing funds from major bank lenders is taking hold. He is visiting Australia to present talks on Indigenous movements for climate justice. By Rachael Hocking Source: NITV News 21 Feb 2017 - 4:29 PM UPDATED 21 Feb 2017 - 4:31 PM Tweet Two weeks ago, the final permit was granted to tunnel under Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri River. But the fight is far from over. The water protectors maintain that the pipeline would desecrate sacred sites and potentially pollute their water, and are gearing up for the legal battles that will ensue. Speaking to NITV, Professor Whyte explained why one of the biggest reasons for Indigenous peoples opposing the pipeline is difficult to articulate. Professor Whyte believes some people find it difficult to fully understand that Native Peoples truly do have a different way of life. NITV: You talk about the fight against the pipeline in relation to climate change and colonialism. KPW: Colonialism is essentially climate change. So at one level, when one society colonises another they force that society to live under different environmental conditions, often times climate conditions, than it was living in before. We were displaced and colonised to make way for the industries that would bring us climate change. We know now today, through numerous scientific reports, that its Indigenous people widely who will be harmed the most from the climate change impacts. MORE ON THIS STORY North Dakota pipeline protest: the largest gathering of Native Americans in more than 100 years Thousands of people from across the United States and Canada have set up camp in North Dakota in recent weeks to block the construction of a pipeline that would run through Standing Rock Indian Reservation. With Standing Rock, the US acknowledges that there are treaties in place, but over time have neglected those treaties to such a degree, that it no longer makes sense from a US perspective or a settler perspective to honour those treaty areas. In that sense, one of the big issues in the US regarding treaty rights is the interpretation of what the treaty means. Treaty rights are not the only way in which native people fight for our rights, for our freedom, for our wellbeing, but for tribes that they have them, they are one way that we can attempt to protect ourselves. Jon Don Ilone Reed, a member of South Dakota's Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, protesting near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in southern North Dakota. KPW: I think that the Standing Rock Tribe is going to do a great job engaging the court system. What I really hope happens is that when we get the full-on force of re-building, that people again come out.
