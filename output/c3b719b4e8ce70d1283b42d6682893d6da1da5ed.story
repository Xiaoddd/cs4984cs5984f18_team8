As we wait with bated breath to see how the situation plays out and figure out how we can support from afar, join us Tuesday to write to four folks who continue to be locked up for protecting sacred land and water. Rattler is a Water Protector who is currently being held pre-trial on federal felony charges produced through a grand jury indictment. Please support Rattler as he fights these charges brought against him by the federal government. Rattler would love to receive your letters and cards of support. Krow was assaulted and arrested on February 4, 2017, by a Bureau of Indian Affairs officer while supporting the struggle against the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota. She is charged with violation of felony probation and is being held at Morton County Correctional Center. The probation is from previous charges stemming from an environmental protest in Wisconsin against mining in the Penokee Hills in 2013, for which she served nine months in jail. He was initially ineligible for bond and his current conditions of release set by the court are unable to be met at this time. His brutal arrest is not the only time Morton County Sheriffs enacted such violence on Water Protectors. We have received reports of continued mistreatment while in custody including lack of medical services and hygiene access for weeks at a time. These charges are in addition to an earlier charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Fallis has pleaded not guilty to federal charges in connection to an incident at a Dakota Access Pipeline protest. Fallis remains in federal custody and her trial date is scheduled for March 7. If convicted of discharging the firearm, Fallis faces a minimum of 10 years in prison.
