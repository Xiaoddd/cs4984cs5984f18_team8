Boreal forest and taiga cover much of the watershed and form the habitat of wildlife including muskox, moose and caribou. The community relies on harvesting wildlife and fish to supply most of its needs. The economy includes limited but increasing tourism, infrastructure development and self-government administration. Three eco-zones are represented in the watershed: the Taiga plains in the west, the Taiga shield to the southeast including the Camsell River drainage area, and the Southern Arctic eco-zone on the north-eastern rim of the lake. Within these eco-zones, lands can be further classified into nine eco-regions and a total of 22 eco-districts. Each of these smaller areas has a distinct combination of landforms, permafrost, soils, climate and biological communities that give them a unique character. The largely unpolluted waters of the biosphere reserve, its healthy fisheries and the presence of wildlife in strong numbers throughout the watershed together produce an ecosystem with a very high degree of ecological integrity. Species such as grizzly bear (Ursos arctos), barren ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus), moose (Alces alces andersoni) and muskox (Ovibos moschatus) are present in large numbers.
