They want to remain in the large Oceti Sakowin encampment at the confluence of the Cannon Ball and Missouri rivers just down the road from the front line camp along Highway 1806, where protestors have blocked work on the pipeline since spring. Standing Rock Pipeline Protestors Vow to Defy Eviction Order and Remain Camped on Public Land With snow falling and accumulating in North Dakota on Monday, Governor Jack Dalrymple used the Corps statement and the weather to draw the line in the snow and demand that the protesters disperse. He said he was directing state agencies, emergency service officials, and nongovernmental organizations to reduce threats to public safety by not guaranteeing the provision of emergency and other governmental and nongovernmental services in the evacuation area, unless otherwise approved on a case by case basis by the Morton County Sheriff or Superintendent of the Highway Patrol. The governor claimed authority to do this under Article V, Section 1 of the North Dakota Constitution and his authority to issue executive orders to minimize or avert the effects of a disaster or emergency pursuant to Chapter 37-17.1 of the North Dakota Century Code. N.D.C.C. where he has the authority to direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or threatened area within the state if the governor deems this action necessary for the preservation of life or other disaster or emergency mitigation, response, or recovery. We will see what happens Dec. 5. As I reported the other day, a historic confrontation in the war for human rights and social justice on the magnitude of Bloody Sunday in Selma is looming at the confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri rivers in North Dakota on Dec. 5, and the whole world really is watching this time, live on Facebook. Kirchmeier, Morton County Sued for Excessive Force in Protests Meanwhile, a National Lawyers Guild group has filed a class action lawsuit against Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier, Morton County and other law enforcement agencies for bringing excessive force against Dakota Access Pipeline protesters earlier this month, according to an article just out from the Bismark Tribune. The Water Protector Legal Collective filed suit Monday in U.S. District Court in Bismarck seeking an immediate injunction to prevent Kirchmeier and other agencies from using impact munitions, such as rubber bullets, lead-filled beanbags, water and sound cannons, directed energy devices, water hoses, explosive tear gas grenades and other chemical agents against the protesters. The group wants the injunction while the court decides whether to issue a temporary restraining order against police, arguing the police actions and munitions fall outside legal parameters. The complaint lists nine individuals who were injured Nov. 20, when protesters and police clashed at the barricaded Backwater Bridge near the protest encampment and says they sustained facial burns, broken bones, genital injury, lost consciousness, wounds and that one may be blind from impact to her eye. It is only a matter of luck that no one has been killed. We stand with those so horribly effected by this invasion into their land. Comments are closed.
