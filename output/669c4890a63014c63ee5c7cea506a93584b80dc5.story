Over 2,000 veterans have pledged their support, with the step coming as law enforcement authorities increase their efforts to crack down on the protest. Hundreds have been arriving at a protest camp on Friday, according to Reuters. They're spraying people, even old women, and other elders of the tribe with tear gas and pepper spray, and all of this is just unconstitutional. A number of veterans have already arrived at the protest camp, including Purple Heart recipient Chris Turley. Others charted their progress on social media. Gabbard, a lifelong environmental activist, said she wanted to highlight how the proposed pipeline project would affect the supply of drinking water to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other local people. Other groups of veterans launched solidarity protests around the country, including in Austin, Texas. Critics of the pipeline say it will cut through indigenous land, including sacred burial sites, as well as threaten the local environment and drinking water. Demonstrators have clashed with police, with water cannon and rubber bullets being deployed against protesters, whom the authorities have accused of rioting. In West Fargo, North Dakota, representatives of the North Dakota Veterans Coordinating Council held a press conference denouncing those who have taken part in the campaign. The veterans who are coming here are coming here because of the police abusing the citizens. It's Morton County Sheriff. They're on our side. That's ridiculous. He's trying to discredit the veterans that are coming here. You have me, who is an agitator. I believe in direct action against machinery. Then you have the Veterans for Peace guys who are very passive and want to be organized and are a part of the whole tribal system and meet with all these groups. On Thursday, US President-elect Donald Trump said that he supports the completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.
