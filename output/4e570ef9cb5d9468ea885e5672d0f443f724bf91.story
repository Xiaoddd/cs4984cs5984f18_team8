Closely resembles traditional natural fibre rope however is rot resistance light weight so it floats, less prone to abrasion than the more commonly used hempex making this the perfect choice for traditional ship rigging. Ford recognized the utility of the hemp plant. He constructed a car of resin stiffened hemp fiber, and even ran the car on ethanol made from hemp. -- The Power of RAW Cannabis. Gerald Celente on the Alex Jones show appeals to Americans to restore the country and to stop the ruling elites from destroying and dismantling it,he was in Germany and seen the once great old Berlin and asks how the Germans let a two bit cartoon freak like Hitler destroy there country,Gerald says he was in south America contemplating leaving the dying USA but decided to go back to the country his grandparents came too and stay and fight the NWO corruption,tears roll down his face at the end. At 7:30mins Gerald says you can meet him at Kingston,New York where he has bought 4 historic buildings on the 4 corners of John Street and Crown Street,Kingston,New York. Gerald says the politicians,billionaires and ruling elites are in the process of crashing the American economy and when things turn bad with food shortages,protests and riots the elites will fly out of the country and watch it colapse. Some use gaze bandage. I typically don't welcome spammers, but in your case I felt some pressure, to let one drop on your load of - hemp. I will only comment on technical claims, as I strongly belief politics and religion should not be discussed on forums. (at least not this one) Any claim made can be true in certain circumstances. However the current situation is that natural fibers are not as strong, nor as cheap as glass fiber. Technological advances are made, so I could be wrong in a couple of years time. So far I have built skis and a 6 meter boat from flax. Availability is also an issue. Although nonwovens are quite readily available, wovens and multiaxials are more difficult, also due to the nature of the fiber. (processing issues) From a green point of view, what is interesting is the ability to reduce the CO2 footprint: grow the material where you need it (little transport), and relatively little energy consumption during processing. On hemp: The hemp used for the fibers, hardly contains any THC. To get high from technical hemp, you should smoke at least 500 lbs in one time. THC slows down cell growth, thereby slowing down cancer. It is also a pain killer, and one that also fights pain from reumatic joints.

I wouldn't worry about a couple of points. Medical use is terrific, if it helps or give relief, I don't care if people blow a couple of scoobs over the weekend. I've worked in places with a drug culture, aint too pretty, useless workers, lazy & forgetful. It would be great to see some more use of some natural fibers. In rope at least there's some places different plants grow higher & you get longer more useful fiber from them, more important in rope making. Jeff.

When tetraethyl lead was discovered as an additive, he discontinued the use of ethanol, because the new product was cheaper and vastly superior. Ethanol uses more energy to be manufactured than it releases in an engine. The current skunk is about 10 times stronger than the stuff they smoked in the 70's. Probably still kills your brain, but at a much slower rate. And when it helps you survive rheumatic atrosis, you might take that for granted. If it helps you live those last 15 years or so in comfort... Do not understand me wrong: I do not like drugs at all, but in specific circumstances, why not. Once the doctor gave me pills for an injury I had, and it made me live in a bad LSD trip for about 10 days. Not nice. In that respect I would have prefered something more natural. Anyhow, back to the topic: In many cases glass or other manmades are not neccesary. For instance in serving trays, interiors, etc. Natural fibers also make a composite product more easy to recycle (at least you can burn it in energy plants, without nasty residues from glass or carbon leaving behind) In car interiors natural fibers (non wovens)already made their way, for a huge TECHNICAL advantage: the sound dampening is huge, compared to alternatives. And that is where it is all about: cost and performance. As long as these are not up to par with what is used today, the market will be very small. Does anyone know of any studies or documents which compare the strength of bio-fibres to carbon-fibres. I've heard that hemp can have a higher tensile strength but has poor impact resistance. Talking to a top Naval architect in NZ last year he didn't think at the time bio-fibres were at a point where they could compete with glass fibres. If it costs more than canvas, I would not buy it. I just recently built a boat from recycled corrugated cardboard, with a cotton fabric covering bonded with Tight-bond glue. It a composite hull made from all natural fibers and non-toxic adhesive. worked well. Need metalurgical advice.
