The first Lillian Milton knew about it was when she arrived at the local council offices to settle her tax bill. She was shocked - at that point she had not even been connected to the sewer system. I had to get cash money - 880 some dollars that I had to pay them to get my place back. Many of her friends and neighbours in Jackson Village, one of three black communities in Plantersville, South Carolina, face losing their homes in a similar way if they don't pay the tax for a sewer they say they didn't want and don't need. Last week 20 homes were put up for auction. Most residents are the direct descendants of West African slaves, who bought land on the former rice plantation, or were deeded it by the government, after emancipation in 1865. Property ownership had special meaning for these former slaves, known as Gullah Geechee, and the land has been proudly passed down through the generations, as a safe haven to raise families and farm. But America's seemingly insatiable appetite for coastal living and the money that can be made from buying up cheap former plantation land is a potential threat. Because they come to take your land. With its neat brick-built bungalows, set back from the road in their own plots of land, and protected from the roar of Highway 701 by a dense forest, Jackson Village feels secure and cushioned against change. But few residents here have deeds to their homes. The freed slaves who originally bought the land were mistrustful of the legal system, or excluded from it, and did not leave written wills. The land is held in common. Ben Grate estimates that more than a million people, spread out across America, have a share of land in Plantersville, whether they know it or not. So although they are living on prime real estate, much sought after for holiday homes, golf courses or country clubs, they cannot simply sell up for a fat profit. The residents can also have their home seized and sold off if they don't pay their taxes. Residents who have their homes taken in this way have a year to redeem them, as Milton did. But like others I spoke to she does not think it is fair that they have to pay for a sewer system they were forced to connect to even if their septic tanks were working well. There is also indignation that the tax was not part of the deal when the system was first proposed 10 years ago. But some of the Gullah Geechee suspected an ulterior motive. Historically, the installation of a public sewer has often been the first step towards opening up an area for suburban development. Some of the white landowners in Plantersville, who live in the old plantation owners' homes, the entrances of which can be seen as you drive through the forest to Jackson Village, also opposed the scheme, as they suspected it was being pushed by land speculators. In 2008, Tee Miller, the then director of rural development in South Carolina for the US Department of Agriculture, came down on their side. In a letter to the head of the Georgetown County and Sewer District, he expressed concern that the black residents did not realise that they would now have to pay a monthly tax to cover the loan repayments. The Rev Ben Grate says the Gullah residents are the victims of racial discrimination, because Plantersville's white residents did not have to hook up to the system. He doesn't accept that the black residents' septic tanks were in worse condition, as the authorities argue, and after seeing his home and 19 others put up for auction last week, he sees this as a fight for the future of his people. We would be back into slavery. We feel that the same thing happened to the slaves when they were coming over. It also had the backing of church leaders and county councillors, as well as the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which said residents badly needed access to good sanitation. In July, a number of Plantersville residents took part in a protest march on the state capitol building in Columbia. Earlier, about 200 had signed a petition against the sewer. But some of those who had initially held out against the tax have now scraped together the cash to pay it. Ben Grate, however, is in no mood to cave in and is now attempting to draw the Gullah Geechee's plight to the attention of state governor Nikki Hayley. The Milton family is standing with him.
