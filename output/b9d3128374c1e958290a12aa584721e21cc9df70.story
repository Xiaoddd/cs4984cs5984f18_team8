The 1.2-billion-barrel find is the largest onshore discovery of conventional oil in more than 30 years. It was made in just the past few days by Spanish oil giant Repsol and their U.S. partners Armstrong Energy. They estimate that they could get the oil out of the ground and begin production as soon as 2021, producing as much as 120,000 barrels of oil per day. Currently, the entire state produces about 490,000 barrels per day. They own the project area, so there are no environmental restrictions keeping them from getting it out of the ground and to market. Repsol has been actively exploring in Alaska since 2008 and has an additional presence in the Gulf of Mexico. The North Slope find comes less than six months after Caelus Energy and private-equity giant Apollo Global Management announced a massive Alaska oil discovery in the waters of Smith Bay. The state has had to impose a hiring freeze and limit employee travel. Alaska relies on taxes from oil revenue for a vast majority of their state revenue. Things have gotten so bad that the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System is barely being used these days.
