The Oceti Sakowin camp has now been renamed All Nations camp and includes members from many tribes and many walks of life. Posts via social media caused confusion and concern due to a number of factors including announcements by Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault, the Army Corps of Engineers possibly raising water levels near the encampments and the sacred fire near the entrance of the Oceti Sakowin camp being extinguished. Announcements by officials of influence were mainly due to harsh winter conditions that would surely cause strain on the local community and were met with confusion and misunderstandings that outsiders were not welcome. A polar vortex is expected to affect the local weather conditions for the next week keeping temperatures well below zero degrees, making safety the largest concern. Directly addressing misconceptions currently being shared via social media, Iron Eyes stated that water levels are not rising and that the sacred fire was put out as a result to mark a new beginning. The All Nations camp is primarily focused on ensuring those remaining are warm, safe, and have a place to stay during the cold winter conditions and continued to inform people that if they are to make their way to camps that they are to be self-sufficient.

Camp organizers have to give detailed reports & presentations to tribal council. There are meeting minutes & video recordings. President William Kindle of RST personally bailed out a Rosebud elder who got arrested at the front lines. Question. loretta nulk 2 years ago Only the young have to strength to stay on. 2 years ago IF PEOPLE CAN REMAIN SAFELY, that should be the main objective. Human life, that is the bottom line. A persons health. Remember, water is LIFE. So in that mindset WE CARE FOR LIVES. Each person needs to think this way. Help support Native News Online by clicking on our sponsors' advertisements.
