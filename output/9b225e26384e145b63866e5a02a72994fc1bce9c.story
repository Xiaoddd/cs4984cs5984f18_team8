Ten were arrested and up to 50 remaining demonstrators must leave Thursday, Burgum said. Remnants of the camp went up in flames Wednesday as protesters set fire to the wooden housing as part of a departure ceremony. About 20 fires were set and two people, a 7-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl, suffered burns. Authorities said they were taken to a Bismarck hospital but didn't elaborate on their conditions. The encampment is on federal land between the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and the pipeline route that the Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners is constructing. The pipeline is almost complete, the stumbling block being a controversial section that runs under North Dakota's Lake Oahe. The tribe claims the pipeline threatens its drinking water and cultural sites. Legal efforts to block or further delay completion of the pipeline, led by the tribe and environmental groups, have been turned aside by the courts. The protesters stayed on the federal land for six months. Hundreds of officers from several states were on hand to handle arrests, according to NBC News. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers set the Wednesday deadline, citing the threat of spring flooding. About 150 people marched arm-in-arm out of the camp, singing and playing drums as they walked down a highway. One man carried an American flag hung upside-down. Authorities sent buses to take protesters to the North Dakota capital of Bismarck, where they were offered fresh clothing, bus fare home and food and hotel vouchers. Some of the remaining protesters were focused on moving off federal land and away from the flood plain into other camps, said Phyllis Young, one of the camp leaders. New camps are popping up on private land, including one the Cheyenne River Sioux set up about a mile from the main camp. Charles Whalen, 50, an alcohol and drug counselor from Mille Lacs, Minn., said he and a group of about 20 people were not going to leave on their own and were willing to get arrested to prove their point. A massive effort to clean up the camp has been underway for weeks, first by protesters themselves and now with help from the Army Corps in removing debris. Some vehicles and pedestrians were having trouble getting through the muck created by recent rain and snow, and cleanup efforts were suspended in part because camp officials did not want heavy equipment making the conditions worse.
