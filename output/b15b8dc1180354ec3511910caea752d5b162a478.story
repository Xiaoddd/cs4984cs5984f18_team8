The group gathered to intentionally disrupt work on the petroleum pipeline, picking a spot on Highway 52, just south of the Ancaster Fairgrounds where there is heavy equipment, said group spokesperson Jaydene Lavallie. The group, which she described as a mix of environmental and Indigenous rights protesters, gathered at the site around 6:30 a.m. to peacefully protest and block construction work for the day. Lavallie said they have had brief conversation with Enbridge security. Hamilton police showed up shortly before 9 a.m. Around 10 a.m. the group moved to block a second work site nearby on Book Road. Enbridge spokesperson Jesse Semko said the company recognizes the rights of people to lawfully and peacefully express their views. Enbridge has been criticized by some for what they say is inadequate Indigenous consultation. Earlier this year two Haudenosaunee men were ordered to pay Enbridge's legal fees after the company sought an injunction when the men set up live traps and blocked access to Line 10. Part of the reason for choosing now to protest is to stand in solidarity with one of those Haudenosaunee men, Todd Williams, Lavallie said. Williams had refused a deal that would see the fee dropped in exchange for a promise to stay off the property for two years. The case wrapped up in court this week, with Enbridge dropping the costs in exchange for the injunction being enforced to keep Williams from interfering with worksites for two years. Williams said he's thankful for the support, which also included fundraising for lawyer fees. While he couldn't attend the protest, he says his desire is still to see Indigenous environmental and archeological interests upheld. They have duty to consult, but Indigenous communities have been totally excluded, he claimed.
