Driving down from the high plains to the camp on the river banks, the view is vast and moving. People on horseback canter by and thousands of colourful flags flutter in the prairie wind. There are sturdy wooden buildings now, Mongolian yurts, and wall tents with wood stoves and even a geodesic dome where meetings and spiritual instruction take place. The Standing Rock Sioux nation, whose territory is all around here, are leading this action and their elders set the tone. Newcomers are welcome but they have to take an orientation course where they learn about non-violence, the ways of the Sioux, and the sacred camp fires around the grounds that must be respected, never photographed or allowed to go out. One of those was going on as we wandered the camp, mostly trying to keep warm in the blowing snow and icy winds. A ring of people stood in open ground and two instructors, from Hawaii and Alaska, showed them how to avoid violent confrontation during protest actions while still holding their ground and standing firm for their beliefs. It's helpful advice. More than 500 demonstrators have been arrested since the camp began last summer. Among them are celebrities, journalists and many Native American activists. North Dakota newspapers have reported the local court system is being strained beyond its capacity by all the trials and arraignments, which usually seem to end in a dismissal or reduction of charges. There have been ugly confrontations and both sides blame each other. In the early days of the protest, last September, there were reports of vandalism and deliberately set fires, but lately much of the violence seems to have come from the authorities. In late November, a group of protesters trying to cross a bridge blockaded by police just outside the camp faced water cannon and tear gas. It was a freezing cold night and 17 people were treated in hospital, some for hypothermia. The Sioux are a proud, enduring people whose territory once covered vast tracts of the Midwest. In the 19th century, they and other tribes signed treaties with the US government - some after protracted wars - but today many feel those agreements haven't been honoured by Washington. If there's one hope that people cling to around the camp fires and at the barricades here, it's that the outgoing Obama administration blocks the project once and for all.
