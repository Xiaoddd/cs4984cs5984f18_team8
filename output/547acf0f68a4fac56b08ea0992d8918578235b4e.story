She is now undergoing multiple emergency surgeries in an attempt to save the limb. What I saw was peaceful water protectors attacked in sub-freezing temperatures by water cannons, getting shot in the head by rubber bullets, getting hit with what I think are concussion grenades from which we had some serious injuries. SPONSORED The family of Sophia Wilansky, who is from New York City, provided new details Tuesday about the serious injuries to her arm. Both her radial and ulnar artery were completely destroyed. Her radius was shattered and a large piece of it is missing. Her medial nerve is missing a large section as well. The Sunday night incident began on a bridge where vehicles formed a blockade to separate water protector encampments and construction areas guarded by police. It was an intentional act of throwing it directly at her. But Linda Black Elk said that the department is not telling the truth. Water protectors have already endured dog attacks, military-style checkpoints, invasive strip searches, national guard deployments, and mass arrests and surveillance. Militarized crackdowns have been waged in collaboration with the national guard and police departments from across the country, prompting a United Nations investigation into human rights abuses inflicted by North Dakota law enforcement. They say they aim to stave off climate change, keep drinking water safe from dangerous spills and defend the health and well-being of future generations. Other indigenous organizers told AlterNet that the police attack felt like an act of war. Charon Asetoyer, the executive director of the Native American Women's Health Education Resource Center in Lake Andes, South Dakota on the Yankton Sioux Reservation, has repeatedly mobilized to Standing Rock. Still, Rivas said the roughly 5,000 people remaining at Standing Rock are determined to stick it out. People are still singing, still dancing and still finding a home in the camp. I expect the camp to only grow bigger, especially in next few weeks. That in itself will inspire a lot of people to stay there.
