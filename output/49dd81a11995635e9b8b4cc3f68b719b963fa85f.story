At heart is the Plains All American Pipeline which has been protested several times in Norman, Oklahoma.The law is designed to harshly penalize protesters. It clearly denies first amendment rights. This year alone anti-protest legislation was introduced in over 20 states. That list includes the Absentee Shawnee, Citizen Potawatomi, Kickapoo, Sac and Fox, and Chickasaw nations. Some tribal members have pointed out that Plains All American failed to consult their tribal councils, which they note is a violation of federal law. A June 3 press release states that sacred tobacco has been planted along the trail of the proposed pipeline. This is a case of environmental racism. Beyond that, resource extraction is rape of the earth. As an indigenous woman, I feel a strong connection to the earth. The Absentee Shawnee tribe mailed a letter to all tribal members outlining how the tribe would be impacted. The underground water tables contain, as a result of the fracking, highly caustic chemicals. used in fracking. Many of the federally recognized tribes feel the pipeline is illegal due to the tribes never being properly consulted. The Nations recognize that the location of the pipeline falls within economically depressed communities that often lack financial options ito even protest the pipeline. By contrast, when police stand down, protests tend to persist, but with lower rates of arrest and a lower incidence of violence. The individual worker and local citizens should manage the means of production for their local area. It is when local workers unite then progressive and even socialist values begin to appear in our communities. Clearly the original citizens of this area, the American Indians do not want the Plains All American Pipeline in their native area. When our right wing legislators begin to take away our first amendment right to protest, something is very wrong with the fabric of democracy we hold so dear. It is important now than before to unite and work together for our socialist beliefs. Stand up and resist, the time is now.
