A flange is the section connecting two sections of pipeline. Oil flow was immediately cut off and the spill was contained on-site. Contaminated snow and soil were removed. The leak was on a line operated by a connecting shipper on the Dakota Access pipeline, said Vicki Granado, spokeswoman for Texas-based Dakota Access developer Energy Transfer Partners. A leak of half a barrel, or 20 gallons (75 liters), occurred 5 March in rural Mercer County, data from the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration show. Contaminated soil was removed, and no waterways were affected. There were no reported injuries to people or wildlife. The administration is part of the Department of Transportation. The online report says an above-ground valve failed due to a manufacturing defect, causing the leak. Upstream and downstream valves were closed to isolate the leak. Later, all other such valves in the Dakota Access system were inspected and found to be OK. The federal database shows no leaks along the pipeline in Iowa or Illinois. ETP plans to begin commercial operations 1 June. The pipeline leaked 84 gallons of oil in South Dakota on 4 April. Its policy is to not issue news releases on spills unless there is a threat to public health or water. Tribal leaders and attorneys say the leaks bolster their demands for further environmental review of the pipeline.
