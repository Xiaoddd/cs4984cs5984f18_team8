
Introduction
The Dakota Access Pipeline, also known as DAPL, is a $3.8 Billion construction program that began in July 2014. It’s a 1,172-mile-long (1,886 km) underground oil pipeline project that starts in the Bakken shale oil fields in northwest North Dakota, passes through South Dakota and Iowa, and ends in Illinois at the oil tank farm near Patoka. The ambition for this project is to transport 450,000 barrels of crude oil from Dakota to Illinois. The DAPL project is the result of an extensive process that involved review and approval by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and regulators in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois. #NoDAPL is a Twitter hashtag from 2014 referring to the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. Some of the discussion is archived at https://www.nodaplarchive.com/. Indigenous activities led the movement, which continued into 2018 since activists were still doing time for their actions to stop the pipeline.
Detail on Affected Area
The affected area included North Dakota in the early stage of planning. The pipeline passed through disputed Sioux land, which was promised to the tribe in the 1851 Fort Laramie treaty but was later taken away. The project also was designed to cross the Missouri river, which is the main source of drinking water for the Sioux people. Large-scale protests at Lake Oahe were held against possible water pollution and destruction of sacred tribal sites. According to a report from The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), since 2010 there are more than 3300 incidents reported about oil and gas pipeline leaks and ruptures. In fact, even a tiny spill could damage and destroy the local environment and water supply. Furthermore, based on original Dakota Access Pipeline design.

Opponent Response
The opponents against the Dakota Access Pipeline projects include local aboriginal Sioux, environment protectors, and veterans. At the beginning of the protest, the scale of opponents was quite small. With the development proceeding, many celebrities and public figures, like actress Shailene Woodley, traveled to North Dakota and supported the protest in public. Much more people started focusing and following this event from social media such as Facebook and Twitter. To provide support for the opponents, on April 1, 2016, Standing Rock's Historic Preservation Officer founded and built a Sacred Stone Camp as a spiritual resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline. Protesters set up teepees and tent camps and threatened to block the highway to slow construction progress. Meanwhile, protesters also sued the Army Corps of Engineers, claiming that they violated the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). They requested the government reconsider the cultural significance of federally-permitted sites and implications for the waterways.
Federal Government/President Response
The federal government has asked the company to "voluntarily suspend" construction near the area until further research is done on the area. Kelcy Warren, chairman and CEO of Energy Transfer partners, responded to a request from the federal government, calling concerns about pipeline impacts on water supplies "unfounded". State historic preservation offices couldn't find sacred items on the route. Warren wrote that the company would meet officials in Washington "to understand their positions and reaffirm our commitment to getting Dakota access to the pipeline into operation." In December 2016, under President Barack Obama’s administration, the Corps of Engineers refused to provide an easement to build a pipeline under the Missouri River. On January 24, 2017, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that overturned Obama's legislation and advanced the pipeline under "terms and conditions that remain to be negotiated," speeding up environmental reviews of what Trump has called an "extremely burdensome, lengthy, and horrible approval process." The number of protesters decreased after Trump approved the construction of the pipeline. National Guard and law enforcement officers evicted the remaining people on February 23, 2017. The pipeline was completed in April and the first oil was delivered on May 14, 2017.
