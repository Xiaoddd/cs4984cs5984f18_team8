It is because they not only have fought for the need to drive this regime from power as the solution , but explained , in an ongoing way , why this is necessary , as most difficult as this may be , and why it is also possible . Through their website and television appearances , I have learned a great deal about a subject that I thought that I had known quite a bit about only to realize that in this day and age it has slipped through to the fore in a different manner . It looks different but is essentially the same in content . The ugliness of the hatred could have been mistaken for simple white supremacist banter that suddenly has the reins of power in the White House , as true as that most definitely is , but Refuse Fascism has raised the alarm that this is not just that but something much more sinister , the rise to fascism . Refuse Fascism has put forward the plan and realization that we all have to act and act outside of the normal institutional framework if we are to have a chance at driving them out and preventing the consolidation of fascism . More than anything it has approached this whole problem from a scientifically correct position , and that is that it is helping us all to realize we should , correctly , be operating from the vantage point of all of humanity . Because that is what is at stake . All of humanity . Please join with me and others as part of this contingent as we demonstrate our determination to defend science against this fascist regime that has truth , scientific inquiry , and critical thinking in its crosshairs .
