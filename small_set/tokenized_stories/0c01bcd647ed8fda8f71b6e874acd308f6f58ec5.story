But the electoral trends that put Donald J. Trump within striking distance of victory were clear long before Mr. Comey sent his letter . They were clear before WikiLeaks published hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee . They were even clear back in early July , before Mr. Comey excoriated Mrs. Clinton for using a private email server . It was clear from the start that Mrs. Clinton was struggling to reassemble the Obama coalition . In 2016 , the Obama coalition crumbled and so did the Midwestern Firewall . The Obama Coalition Falters The countryside of Iowa or the industrial belt along Lake Erie is not the sort of place that people envision when they think of the Obama coalition . Yet it was an important component of his victory . He would have won even if the electorate had been as old and as white as it had been in 2004 . Largely overlooked , his key support often came in the places where you would least expect it . He did better than John Kerry and Al Gore among white voters across the Northern United States , despite exit poll results to the contrary . He excelled in a nearly continuous swath from the Pacific Coast of Oregon and Washington to the Red River Valley in Minnesota , along the Great Lakes to the coast of Maine . In these places , Mr. Obama often ran as strong or stronger than any Democrat in history . In 2016 , Mr. Trump made huge gains among white working-class voters . It was often in the places where Democrats had seemed resilient or even strong , like Scranton , Pa. , and eastern Iowa . Image It was a decisive break from recent trends . White voters without college degrees , for the first time , deviated from the national trend and swung decidedly toward the Republicans . No bastion of white , working-class Democratic strength was immune to the trend . She was thought to be fairly strong among the older white working-class voters who were skeptical of Mr. Obama from the start . His gains among younger working-class whites were especially important in the Upper Midwest . Young white working-class voters represent a larger share of the vote there than anywhere else in the country . The Clinton team knew what was wrong from the start , according to a Clinton campaign staffer and other Democrats . The campaign looked back to respondents who were contacted in 2012 , and found a large number of white working-class voters who had backed Mr. Obama were now supporting Mr. Trump . The same story was obvious in public polls of registered voters . Most of this data is only beginning to become available . The same appears to be true in Florida . Nationally , there is no relationship between the decline in Democratic strength and the change in turnout . Mr. Trump made gains in white working-class areas , whether turnout surged or dropped . The exit polls also show all of the signs that Mr. Trump was winning over Obama voters . It strongly suggests that Mr. Trump won over large numbers of white , working-class voters who supported Mr. Obama four years earlier . The Obama-Trump Vote The notion that Mr. Trump could win over so many people who voted for Mr. Obama and who still approved of his performance is hard to understand for people with ideologically consistent views on a traditional liberal-conservative spectrum . But the two had the same winning pitch to white working-class voters . Mr. Obama and his campaign team portrayed Mr. Romney as a plutocrat who dismantled companies and outsourced jobs . The implication was that he would leave middle-class jobs prey to globalization and corporations . There was one place where Mr. Romney was able to effectively argue that he could protect the industrial economy and the people who worked in it : coal country . There he made big gains after the Obama administration pushed climate-change policies that would reduce the production and use of coal . In retrospect , the scale of the Democratic collapse in coal country was a harbinger of just how far the Democrats would fall in their old strongholds once they forfeited the mantle of working-class interests . She , too , would leave workers vulnerable to the forces of globalization and big business , he said . The various allegations against Mrs. It was a far more appealing message than old Republican messages about abortion , same-sex marriage and the social safety net . There was no relationship between the change in Democratic support and the change in turnout , or the change in turnout and Democratic strength . But the Democrats did have a turnout problem in November . It was a black turnout problem . The conclusive data is available in the Southern states where voters indicate their race on their voter registration forms , and they point toward a considerable decline in black turnout . In Georgia , the black share of the electorate fell to 27.6 percent from 29.9 percent , and in Louisiana it fell to 28.5 percent from 30.1 percent , according to the completed state turnout data . In all of these states , the black share of the electorate is still poised to be higher than it was in 2004 . Young black voters appear to be a key driver of the decline . They registered at a lower rate than they did ahead of the 2012 and 2008 presidential elections , causing the black share of registered voters to dip . And those who were registered turned out at a far lower rate than black registrants did four years ago . The data is not so authoritative elsewhere in the country , but it tells a similar story . Turnout dropped by 8 percent in the majority black wards of Philadelphia , while rising everywhere else in the city . The turnout in Detroit fell by 14 percent . Turnout fell in other industrial centers with a large black population , like Milwaukee and Flint , Mich. . It should be noted that the decline in black turnout appears very consistent across the country , regardless of whether states put in new laws that might reduce turnout , like those cutting early voting or requiring a photo ID . It seems so . If black turnout had matched 2012 levels , Mrs. Clinton would have almost certainly scratched out wins in Wisconsin , Michigan and Pennsylvania . Florida and North Carolina would have been extremely close . Mr. Obama would have easily won both his elections with this level of black turnout and support . These demographic shifts have benefited Democrats over the last decade , but most of these gains have come in noncompetitive states . This year , the exit polls again exaggerated the importance of well-educated and Hispanic voters . But the preliminary Upshot analysis of voting returns , census and pre-election polling data suggests that Mrs. Clinton was stronger among well-educated white and nonwhite voters than the exit polls imply . It is important to emphasize that these estimates are preliminary . They will change over the next few years with more data from the Census Bureau and additional polling . The Upshot estimates suggest that Mrs. Clinton really might have become the first Democrat to win white voters with a college degree -LRB- although it is very possible that Mr. Obama did so in 2008 as well -RRB- . There was a similar pattern by income . These gains helped her win huge margins in the most well-educated and prosperous liberal bastions of the new economy , like Manhattan , Silicon Valley , Washington , Seattle , Chicago and Boston . There , Mrs. Clinton ran up huge margins in traditionally liberal enclaves and stamped out nearly every last wealthy precinct that supported the Republicans . You could drive a full 30 miles through the leafy suburbs northwest of Boston before reaching a town where Mr. Trump hit 20 percent of the vote . Every old-money Republican enclave of western Connecticut , like Darien and Greenwich , voted for Mrs. Clinton , in some cases swinging 30 points in her direction . Every precinct of Winnetka and Glencoe , Ill. , went to Mrs. Clinton as well . Her gains were nearly as impressive in affluent Republican suburbs , like those edging west of Kansas City , Mo. , and Houston ; north of Atlanta , Dallas and Columbus , Ohio ; or south of Charlotte , N.C. , and Los Angeles in Orange County . A similar divide may have helped obscure whether Mrs. Clinton improved among Hispanic voters , a question addressed in depth by Harry Enten at FiveThirtyEight . The pre-election polls generally showed Mrs. Clinton poised to make good on that possibility . Our estimates suggest that Mrs. Clinton did about the same as Mr. Obama among Hispanic voters over all . The estimates hint at a potential explanation for the results in some heavily Hispanic areas : Mrs. Clinton may have faltered among Hispanic voters without a high school degree , while making gains among those with some college education or better . She won the popular vote . But it did not do nearly enough good in the decisive battleground states . The Upshot provides news , analysis and graphics about politics , policy and everyday life .
