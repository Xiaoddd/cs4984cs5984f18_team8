A celebration erupted at the main protest camp in Cannon Ball , North Dakota , where the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and others have been protesting the 1,172-mile -LRB- 1,885-km -RRB- Dakota Access Pipeline for months . The line , owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP , had been complete except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe , a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River . That stretch required an easement from federal authorities , which delayed a decision on the permit twice in an effort to consult further with the tribe . Jo-Ellen Darcy , the Army 's Assistant Secretary for Civil Works , said in a statement the decision was based on a need to explore alternate routes for the pipeline , although it remains unclear what those alternatives will be . They have n't been following the law all along . In a statement , Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II thanked activists for their support in the protest effort . Protest organizers had for months argued that crossing the Missouri River adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation presented a danger to their water source . Protests grew over the months , with hundreds of veterans flocking to the camp in recent days to stand against what they say are aggressive tactics from law enforcement . Activists at the camp were seen hugging each other and letting out Native American war cries on Sunday , but many remained wary , knowing that the incoming administration of Donald Trump has voiced support for the line . Supporters of the line as well as opponents pointed out the Sunday decision does not resolve the issue . It is unclear what the new pipeline route will be and any route would still likely need to cross the Missouri River , probably upstream of Lake Oahe and closer to the state capital of Bismarck . Many pipelines travel under U.S. waterways already , and pipe is considered a safer way to transport crude oil than rail . Energy Transfer has said in the past they did not intend to reroute the line . Even if the easement had been granted , it would have been months before the line was completed . It is unclear whether Trump 's incoming administration may consider taking up Energy Transfer 's request yet again , and approving it . Trump 's transition team last week said he was supportive of the line , in addition to other pipeline development . A number of states and municipalities in the country have made it more difficult to build pipelines in recent years . A spokesperson for Energy Transfer Partners could not immediately be reached for comment . hope they follow through here with this . They have n't been following the law all along . want to thank everyone who played a role in advocating for this cause . organizers had for months argued that crossing the Missouri River adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation presented a danger to their water source . not a 100 percent victory . Transfer has said in the past they did not intend to reroute the line .
