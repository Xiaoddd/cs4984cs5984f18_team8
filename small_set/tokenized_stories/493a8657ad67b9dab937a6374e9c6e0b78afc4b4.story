While the U.S. government has never officially apologized for the genocide it committed upon tribal nations , these courageous veterans accepted responsibility for the actions and asked the tribe for forgiveness . And within that conscience we must first confess our sins to you because many of us , me particularly , are from the units that have hurt you over the many years . We came , we fought you , we took your land , we signed treaties that we broke , we stole minerals from your sacred hills , we blasted the faces of our presidents onto your sacred mountain . Then we took still more land , then we took your children and then tried to take your language and tried to eliminate your language that God gave you and that the Creator gave you . Leksi Leonard Crow Dog on behalf of the tribes in attendance accepted the apology and in turn asked for forgiveness for any hurt that might have been caused from the defeat of the U.S. 7th Cavalry by the Great Sioux Nation on June 25 , 1876 . The Tribal Historic Preservation Officer for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , Jon Eagle Sr. , posted a stunning summary of the monumental occasion . These gestures of peace , love , and forgiveness are the start to healing the brutality of the past .
