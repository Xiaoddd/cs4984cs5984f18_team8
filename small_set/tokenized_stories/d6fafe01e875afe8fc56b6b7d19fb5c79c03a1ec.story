This is nothing new from this Administration , since over the last four months the Administration has demonstrated by its action and inaction that it intended to delay a decision in this matter until President Obama is out of office . For more than three years now , Dakota Access Pipeline has done nothing but play by the rules . The Army Corps of Engineers agrees , and has said so publicly and in federal court filings . In spite of consistently stating at every turn that the permit for the crossing of the Missouri River at Lake Oahe granted in July 2016 , comported with all legal requirements , including the use of an environmental assessment , rather than an environmental impact statement , the Army Corps now seeks to engage in additional review and analysis of alternative locations for the pipeline . As stated all along , ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe . Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way .
