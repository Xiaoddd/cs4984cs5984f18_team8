Now , a group of advisors to President-elect Donald Trump on Native American issues wants to free those resources from what they call a suffocating federal bureaucracy that holds title to 56 million acres of tribal lands , two chairmen of the coalition told Reuters in exclusive interviews . The group proposes to put those lands into private ownership - a politically explosive idea that could upend more than century of policy designed to preserve Indian tribes on U.S.-owned reservations , which are governed by tribal leaders as sovereign nations . The tribes have rights to use the land , but they do not own it . They can drill it and reap the profits , but only under regulations that are far more burdensome than those applied to private property . It could deeply divide Native American leaders , who hold a range of opinions on the proper balance between development and conservation . The proposed path to deregulated drilling - privatizing reservations - could prove even more divisive . Many Native Americans view such efforts as a violation of tribal self-determination and culture . Reservations governed by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs are intended in part to keep Native American lands off the private real estate market , preventing sales to non-Indians . An official at the Bureau of Indian Affairs did not respond to a request for comment . The legal underpinnings for reservations date to treaties made between 1778 and 1871 to end wars between indigenous Indians and European settlers . Tribal governments decide how land and resources are allotted among tribe members . On Sunday , amid rising opposition , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday said it had denied a permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline project , citing a need to explore alternate routes . The Trump transition team has expressed support for the pipeline , however , and his administration could revisit the decision once it takes office in January . Tribes and their members could potentially reap vast wealth from more easily tapping resources beneath reservations . In 2008 , the Bureau of Indian Affairs testified before Congress that reservations contained about 20 percent of untapped oil and gas reserves in the U.S. Deregulation could also benefit private oil drillers including Devon Energy Corp , Occidental Petroleum , BP and others that have sought to develop leases on reservations through deals with tribal governments . Those companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment . A man from the Lakota Sioux tribe with a Native American tattoo on his neck poses for a photograph during a protest against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation , near Cannon Ball , North Dakota , U.S. November 16 , 2016 . At least three of four chair-level members have links to the oil industry . Mullin received about eight percent of his campaign funding over the years from energy companies , while co-chair Sharon Clahchischilliage - a Republican New Mexico State Representative and Navajo tribe member - received about 15 percent from energy firms , according to campaign finance disclosures reviewed by Reuters . ETP did not immediately respond to a request for comment . The fourth co-chair , Eddie Tullis , a former chairman of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians in Alabama , is involved in casino gaming , a major industry on reservations . Clahchischilliage and Tullis did not respond to requests for comment . BUREAUCRATIC THICKET Several tribes , including the Crow Nation in Montana and the Southern Ute in Colorado , have entered into mining and drilling deals that generate much-needed revenue for tribe members and finance health , education and infrastructure projects on their reservations . As U.S. oil and gas drilling boomed over the past decade , tribes struggled to capitalize . A 2015 report from the Government Accountability Office found that poor management by the Bureau of Indian Affairs hindered energy development and resulted in lost revenue for tribes . Over the next decade , some 2.5 million acres of land were removed from tribal control , and 12,000 Native Americans lost their tribal affiliation . Mullin and Swimmer said the coalition does not want to repeat past mistakes and will work to preserve tribal control of reservations . Mullin said the finalized proposal could result in Congressional legislation as early as next year . Washburn said he doubted such a bill could pass , but Gabe Galanda , a Seattle-based lawyer specializing in Indian law , said it could be possible with Republican control of the White House and the U.S. House and Senate . Legal challenges to such a law could also face less favorable treatment from a U.S. Supreme Court with a conservative majority , he said . Trump will soon have the chance to nominate a Supreme Court justice to replace Antonin Scalia , a conservative member who died earlier this year .
