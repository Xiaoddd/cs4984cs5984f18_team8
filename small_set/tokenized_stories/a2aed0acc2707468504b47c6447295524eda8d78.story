The financial relationship runs both ways . The 1,170-mile pipeline has caused uproar among Native American tribes as it runs close to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota . A protest camp , set up over fears the pipeline will poison water and destroy cultural heritage , has been the scene of repeated clashes between protesters and Energy Transfer Partners security staff . A court challenge has allowed the project to go ahead but the federal government , which initially approved the project , is now reassessing its decision following an outcry by tribes and has placed a temporary halt to construction on federal land . He vowed that Energy Transfer Partners will press ahead with the project . Warren has been an enthusiastic backer of Republican politicians , contributing the maximum allowable amount to the campaigns of the House speaker , Paul Ryan , and Fred Upson , chairman of the energy and commerce committee . Dakota Access has sparked the most vociferous protests , however , with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe escalating its grievances to the UN and , most recently , the US justice department . On Tuesday , the tribe requested that the US attorney general , Loretta Lynch , investigate alleged strip searches , dog attacks and pepper-spraying by police and security personnel against Native American protesters . Energy Transfer Partners refused to comment on the donations . No billionaire owner , no shareholders . Just independent , investigative reporting that fights for the truth , whatever the cost .
