Jose Torres , 26 , and Kayla Norton , 25 , cried today in a Douglas County court as they were sentenced to 20 years and 15 years in prison , respectively . In July 2015 , Torres and Norton , who have three children together , were part of a group of Confederate flag supporters called Respect the Flag . For two days that summer , the group rode around in pickup trucks threatening black families and calling them racial slurs across two counties in the Atlanta suburbs . The group targeted black families shortly after the Charleston , South Carolina , church massacre because its members were upset that the state responded to the brutal slayings by removing the Confederate battle flag from various sites .
