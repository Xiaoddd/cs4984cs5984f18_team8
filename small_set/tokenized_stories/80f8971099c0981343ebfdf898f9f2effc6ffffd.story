Today there are over 500 Native American tribes in the United States , each with a distinct culture , way of life and history . Even today , Native Americans face large challenges to cope with the disadvantages history has left them and ongoing cases of discrimination . These people would come to be called Native Americans , numbering over 50 million , and settling from the top of North America to the bottom of South America . By the time Christopher Columbus reached the Caribbean in 1492 , historians estimate that there were 10 million indigenous peoples living in U.S. territory . But by 1900 , the number had reduced to less than 300,000 . Disease was a major killer , followed by malnutrition . Colonists in search of gold staged violent ambushes on tribal villages , fueling animosity with Natives . Several wars broke out between tribes and American settlers which led to large death tolls , land dispossession , oppression and blatant racism . Native Americans gained uniform voting rights in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 . Determined to find a direct route from Europe to Asia , Christopher Columbus stumbled on the Americas in 1492 . Ultimately , while Columbus is remembered as a daring adventurer , he was also a perpetrator of atrocities and his legacy is viewed as the starting point that sparked hundreds of years of exploration and exploitation of the Americas . Unlike the Europeans and Asians , whose lifestyle had a long history of sharing close quarters with domesticated animals , Native Americans were not immune to pathogens spread by domesticated cows , pigs , sheep , goats , and horses . As a result , millions were killed by measles , influenza , whooping cough , diphtheria , typhus , bubonic plague , cholera , scarlet fever and syphilis . Spreading disease was not always intentional on the part of the colonists . In 1763 , a particularly serious uprising threatened British garrisons in Pennsylvania . Consequently , settlers spread smallpox to the Native Americans by distributing blankets previously owned by contagious patients . U.S. History of Atrocities After the American Revolution , many Native American lives were already lost to disease and displacement . Between 1830 and 1838 , federal officials working on behalf of white cotton growers forced nearly 100,000 Indians out of their homeland . As the United States expanded westward , violent conflicts over territory multiplied . In particular , the 1848 California gold rush caused 300,000 people to migrate to San Francisco from the East Coast and South America . Historians believe that California was once the most densely and diversely populated area for Native Americans in U.S. territory ; however , the gold rush had massive implications for Native American livelihoods . Toxic chemicals and gravel ruined traditional Native hunting and agricultural practices , resulting in starvation for many Natives . Further , in 1850 , the California state government passed the Act for the Government and Protection of Indians that addressed the punishment and protection of Native Americans , and helped to facilitate the removal of their culture and land . It also legalized slavery and was referenced for the buying and selling of Native children . In the process of arresting Sitting Bull , federal officials actually ended up killing him , causing a massive rebellion that led to the deaths of over 150 Natives in Pine Ridge . At the turn of century , the Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. federal government has the right to overturn all Cherokee laws in the precedent-setting decision Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock . The report went on to influence policy initiatives which improved healthcare , education , and land rights for Native Americans . This was a step forward for the protection of a minority who was still without voting rights . In 1978 , Congress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act which protects Native American children and the custody of their parents . Controversy has surrounded cases where state officials forcibly removed children from Native American families . In Maine , the Maine Truth and Reconciliation Committee , for example , seeks to uncover and acknowledge the truth about what happened to Wabanaki children and families involved with the Maine child welfare system . These forcible removals are still happening today . South Dakota continues to remove children at a rate higher than the vast majority of other states in the country . Conclusion For hundreds of years a mixture of colonial conflict , disease , specific atrocities and policies of discrimination has devastated the Native American population . In the course of this time , it is estimated that over nine million Natives died from violent conflict or disease . For too long this history has been under-recognized and too little discussed .
