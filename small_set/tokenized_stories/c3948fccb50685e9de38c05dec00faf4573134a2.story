Notice in all these sources , Sitting Bull is referred to as a redskin along with other racial slurs , such as a redskinned devil . This because he resisted assimilation and the theft of the Black Hills . For those who arent aware this was one of the causes of colonial violence that caused the Dakota conflict to happen . The process of genocide associated with the redskins slur aside from -LRB- hunting for Native scalps -RRB- and mocking deaths of wounded knee victims , as well as execution of Natives such as the case with Dakota 38 , also included starving Natives to death . In sources I posted red devils and redskins are used in the same context , therefore sharing the same Negative connotations . If you claim you want to honor Natives , start by treating us as people . That means acknowledging chiefs by names and not associating them with racial slurs that were used to dehumanize and undermine their efforts to defend land and traditional culture . Learn the history of the genocide this country was built upon , and the ways those systems of power are still maintained today . Western Reserve chronicle . -LRB- Warren , Ohio -RRB- , 11 May 1870 . Chronicling America : Historic American Newspapers . Lib . of Congress . Be mindful of the ways that the descendants , relatives of Sitting Bull have been treated over at Standing Rock and the ways descendants of settlers in ND , SD , Minnesota are still demonizing Oceti Sakowin . Acknowledging that history is important in addressing the ongoing acts of colonialism against Indigenous peoples , such as the Dakota Access . While we want to bring honor and remembrance to our ancestors we also must bring honor to our relatives today living in the spirit of resistance .
