This is nothing new from this Administration , since over the last four months the Administration has demonstrated by its action and inaction that it intended to delay a decision in this matter until President Obama is out of office . For more than three years now , Dakota Access Pipeline has done nothing but play by the rules . The Army Corps of Engineers agrees , and has said so publicly and in federal court filings . As stated all along , ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe . Original Story : The US Army Corps of Engineers has denied the final permit of the Dakota Access Pipeline . Instead , the Corps will be undertaking an environmental impact statement to look at possible alternative routes . We wholeheartedly support the decision of the administration and commend with the utmost gratitude the courage it took on the part of President Obama , the Army Corps , the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior to take steps to correct the course of history and to do the right thing . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and all of Indian Country will be forever grateful to the Obama Administration for this historic decision . We want to thank everyone who played a role in advocating for this cause . We thank the tribal youth who initiated this movement . We thank the millions of people around the globe who expressed support for our cause . We thank the thousands of people who came to the camps to support us , and the tens of thousands who donated time , talent , and money to our efforts to stand against this pipeline in the name of protecting our water . We especially thank all of the other tribal nations and jurisdictions who stood in solidarity with us , and we stand ready to stand with you if and when your people are in need . With this decision we look forward to being able to return home and spend the winter with our families and loved ones , many of whom have sacrificed as well . We look forward to celebrating in wopila , in thanks , in the coming days . We hope that Kelcey Warren , Governor Dalrymple , and the incoming Trump administration respect this decision and understand the complex process that led us to this point . When it comes to infrastructure development in Indian Country and with respect to treaty lands , we must strive to work together to reach decisions that reflect the multifaceted considerations of tribes . Treaties are paramount law and must be respected , and we welcome dialogue on how to continue to honor that moving forward . We are not opposed to energy independence , economic development , or national security concerns but we must ensure that these decisions are made with the considerations of our Indigenous peoples . To our local law enforcement , I hope that we can work together to heal our relationship as we all work to protect the lives and safety of our people . I recognize the extreme stress that the situation caused and look forward to a future that reflects more mutual understanding and respect . Again , we are deeply appreciative that the Obama Administration took the time and effort to genuinely consider the broad spectrum of tribal concerns . However , it was becoming increasingly clear he was punting this issue down the road . Roads , bridges , transmission lines , pipelines , wind farms and water lines will be very difficult , if not impossible , to build when criminal behavior is rewarded this way . In my conversation with Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy today , she was unable to give any legal reasons for the decision and could not answer any questions about rerouting the pipeline . I feel badly for the Corps of Engineers because of the diligent work it did on this project , only to have their Commander-in-Chief throw them under the bus . The pipeline still remains in limbo . The incoming administration already stated its support for the project and the courts have already stated twice that it appeared the Corps followed the required process in considering the permit . For the next month and a half , nothing about this project will change . For the immediate future , the safety of residents , protesters , law enforcement , and workers remains my top priority as it should for everyone involved . Additionally , our federal delegation and governor have been working together in a bipartisan effort to push for more federal resources for law enforcement who have worked day and night through weekends and holidays to support the safety of our communities . It does nothing to resolve the issue , and worst of all it prolongs the serious problems faced by North Dakota law enforcement as they try to maintain public safety . Instead , it passes the decision off to the next administration , which has already indicated it will approve the easement , and in the meantime perpetuates a difficult situation for North Dakotans . By staying on the site , the protesters subject residents in the area to additional weeks of disruption and hardship . That will make our nation vulnerable and less secure .
