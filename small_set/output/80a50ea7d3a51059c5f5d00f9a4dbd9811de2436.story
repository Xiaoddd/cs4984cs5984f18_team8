His administration is responsible for putting dozens of schools and homes in the path of a dangerous, explosive pipeline. Citizens delivered a Notice of Probable Violation and Summons to Governor Wolf. The action happened prior to a State Senate hearing on the Mariner East 2 pipeline, which was called after massive sinkholes emerged as a result of pipeline construction. Residents testifying and attending the hearing took the opportunity to remind Governor Wolf that while a growing, bipartisan group of local, state, and federal officials is calling for a halt to the pipeline, the approval and continued construction of Mariner East 2 is his responsibility. The 350-mile pipeline is being constructed in order to carry highly volatile liquids, most of which will be exported to Europe to make plastics.
