In April 2016 she started the Sacred Stone Camp, the first occupation to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline. Westword sat down with her to get her perspective on the NoDAPL movement, renewable energy, and the future of life on Earth. It was not only 300 tribal nations; it was the Sami from Norway and Sweden, the Mongolians from China and Russia, Aboriginals from Australia, many African nations, aboriginals from India, the Maori from New Zealand. But as far as American history goes, this was the largest tribal gathering ever. This is the first time we stood among our enemies as allies. And then when everybody came in, when we went up to 15,000 people and you came over the hill and you saw all the teepees, the Chippewa lodges, it was overwhelming. I remember the first time I came over the hill and I saw all the people, I pulled off to the side of the road and cried because it was so like a dream. And as you drove into the camp, no matter where you went, you could hear people singing, and each in their own language. You could hear prayer ceremonies going on. You could hear hip-hop music. You could hear country-Western. Everyone who came and stood that ground became family with each other. This is their home now. Prophecy. I always talk about this woman from South Carolina. I asked.

Depends on what the results are. They have done four tests; all four have sprung a leak, including this morning. We told them it was going to happen. The steel is substandard. Production of crude oil in North Dakota and in the U.S. peaked in 2014. Three-fourths have been shut down, and that is a tremendous amount of oil that is not flowing. We are not doing pipeline by pipeline. We are doing a unified front everywhere. So right now we have Sacred Stone people in Texas, Louisiana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Utah, Oregon, Washington and California. And we just met with all the groups in western Canada and eastern Canada. We entered into an alliance with Amazon tribes and then Nicaragua, El Salvador and Mexico.
