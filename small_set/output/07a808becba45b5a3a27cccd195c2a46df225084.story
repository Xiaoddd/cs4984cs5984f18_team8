The demonstration took place beginning at 4:20 p.m. outside of TD Bank on Chapel Street downtown. As several people streamed onto Chapel with homemade signs, they made way for a sort of human contraption: four protesters, accented with pink heart-shaped signs, who had chained themselves together. joked Tuhus, who remained relatively mum as a customer then opened the door on her back, stepping over her arm-pipe to get back onto the street. On the other side of Chapel Street, police had begun to gather, watching the protesters from the New Haven Green and the corner of College and Chapel streets. They crossed the street and looked on from the intersection of College and Chapel closest to the bank, waiting to see if the protesters would get up. Another held out his phone, as if taking a photo or video. An officer approached the door and removed the chain, allowing the protesters to stay until further notice. As police spoke to each other, members of the group explained that they hoped to accomplish two goals: to get the bank to divest from the pipeline, and to encourage current customers to join credit unions if it refuses to do so. As they chanted and spoke, an officer stopped the flow of traffic on College Street and got use a microphone to offer three warnings to protesters in English and Spanish. Move, he said, or get arrested. A police van had by then moved onto College Street, its doors opened. The four did not move. As an officer issued the third warning, protesters began shouting over them, several lifting flags representing Native American tribes as they chanted. One, Edgar Sandoval, moved in closer to the protesters as if to protect them. He eyed officers who were preparing to move in. A final warning was issued. Ushering free-standing protesters away, the officers moved the four to the College Street side of the bank, where they placed them on the ground and began to ask for identification. Lt. Herb Sharp, the top patrol supervisor at the New Haven police department, directed the operation, turning a flurry of activity into an orderly police ballet. While four officers collected information from the group, a cadre of others formed a semi-circle around them, ordering reporters to stay at a distance. The bulk of protesters outside of the bank continued to chant, lining the sidewalk as a few tried to glimpse at the cohort that had been arrested. McEvoy motioned to Attorney Patricia Kane, whom Sharp let though. Back with the four protesters, police maintained their semi-circle as Sharp spoke quietly to each of them about options, arrests, potential charges. Sharp charged the quartet with disorderly conduct and interfering with an officer, both misdemeanors. After 20 minutes and a court summons, the four were free to go. Meanwhile, other protesters remained at the bank until close to 6 p.m. Police kept a block of Chapel Street closed across from the Green, forcing CT Transit buses to alter their route in jammed rush-hour traffic. Revived Project The Dakota Access Pipeline is an underground oil pipeline backed by Dakota Access, LLC that will run, if completed, from North Dakota to southern Illinois. That path includes stretches beneath the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, as well as clean water sources and burial grounds around the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. For a map of conflicts across its 1,172 miles, click here. The company building the pipeline says that it is thoroughly monitored and shipping crude underground is far safer than doing so by rail, trucks, or in ships. Protesters and environmentalists have disagreed, citing concerns of contaminated drinking water and disrupting historic burial grounds. New Haveners became involved in protests months later, in mid-October of last year. By then, protests had erupted on the national level to put pressure on the outgoing Obama administration to stop construction of the pipeline. That ended temporarily on Dec. 4 of last year, the outgoing Obama administration announced that it would not grant the final easement to the pipeline. Then in late January, just four days after his inauguration, President Donald Trump reinstated construction of both the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, adding a directive to halt environmental reviews that the Obama administration had ordered. On Monday Feb. 13, a judge backed that directive, ruling against Native American tribes. Post a Comment Commenting has closed for this entry Comments posted by: WestHavenBIcyclist on February 14, 2017 10:54pm My wife and i were in town and visited the protest. Glad to see intentional civil disobedience happening, and encouraged to see the correct and measured response from police. This is what should have happened the other week. Civil Disobedience And under a corporate corrupt government that allows the destruction of our water, resources, and Native rights, the correct place to be for just citizens is in the streets and willing to symbolically break laws. That is the right approach. This is first amendment in action. Our family grew too uncomfortable with the actions of corporate banks, and left Bank of America for Sikorsky Credit Union. I hope the protesters took TD Bank customers out of their comfort zone a little and raised awareness of how we vote with our banking dollars. There was certainly nothing threatening or aggressive about the protest. And I thank the protesters for their work and their voice. You are teaching our children how to stand up for what is right. This is a long term investment in creating a culture that cares for creation. Your work has meaning at our family dinner table. Bless you. Otherwise, it is a gross waste of human effort. While the arrest was first class, the protesters were not. We enjoy freedom of speech in this country but it is bastardized and denigrated by these actions. The lawyer is there, the press is there, all to feed the publicity hounds demonstrating for their cause. We taxpayers, pay for the disruption to society by self serving people hawing a cause. The amount of money spent diverting police resources, interrupting bank business, delay of time to bank customers, and rerouting of traffic should be estimated. These people should be required to pay that amount of money along with court costs. They have the right to protest, but they should be required to pay for it. Sooner of later they are going to run afoul of a person having a bad day and someone is going to get hurt. There are a lot of people with personal problems and short tempers. Playing footsies with the New Haven Police is an entirely different thing that chaining a civilian who may have a short temper and a gun in a bank. It is not a question of if, just when it will happen. posted by: jim1 on February 15, 2017 8:38am Nice article, nice people, and Wendy was there passing out gloves and hats. The fight to protect our environment continues and so will these NV protests. We expect many more to join us as spring approaches. Downtown traffic was a mess for over an hour Chapel St. wesbound was blocked off at both Church St. and Temple St. , and College St. was blocked off southbound towards Chapel St making it a traffic nightmare. They should have been put in the cell block and let them wait their turn at being processed, just like every other law breaker, instead of giving them a quick summons. Enough is enough stop pandering these people. posted by: Hamdenresident on February 15, 2017 9:24am I am fully supportive of the goals of the demonstrators but they need to know that they caused a very dangerous delay, which could have been fatal, as I tried to get my husband through the center of New Haven to the Emergency Room at Yale New Haven Hospital. There has to be a way of expressing these important opinions without jeopardizing the lives of others. posted by: the1king on February 15, 2017 9:48am enough already. Do these people have a job. I am so tired of these protest. they are taking police resources away. The organizations that do these protests should be sent a bill. posted by: alphabravocharlie on February 15, 2017 10:39am Lugo should have been arrested, again. Chaining a door shut is reckless endangerment and unlawful restraint. That is absurd. They do not have a right to lock people in a bank. You are trying to obscure that fact with racist commentary. I did not see any black faces on those people who chained themselves to that door. You raise a smokescreen using slavery and abortion rights, because your argument is baseless. If they (the protesters) keep doing stupid, illegal and confrontational things somebody is eventually going to get hurt for no good reason. posted by: Noteworthy on February 15, 2017 3:08pm RealMom - The rights of protesters only extend to the point where they directly infringe on the rights of others. The right to protest, to voice your opinion, freedom of speech is all great. Do it often. These people do not have the right to chain doors, block entrances, block traffic and hamper the free flow of ingress, egress and movement of others to go about their daily lives. Trying to tie this protest with civil rights, the right to vote - is not on parity in either foundation or importance. And yes, they should be held financially liable for the extra cost burden their protest is causing the City of New Haven taxpayers. Just add up all the manpower it took to make the arrests, crowd control, traffic patrol etc. - add up the hours and hourly billing rate. posted by: Realmom21 on February 15, 2017 3:09pm Peter that is the whole point this isnt about race this is about atrocities that have been corrected thru or are route to being corrected thru civil disobedience. perhaps you forget that it was illegal for a black person to sit in the front of a bus or to obstruct traffic walking abreast across a bridge or to sit in at a lunch counter. Or for women to to do many common sense things like own accounts property etc. it was thru civil disobedience that those wrongs were corrected just because something is legal today doesnt make it right in the long run. wait how much municipal and state aid was used to walk a child into a school because she was entitled to go to school but only after civil disobedience that included on the oppressors end locking, blocking school doors. I do agree with the posters who object to such a massive police presence for actions that are clearly non-violent. The gentleness with which we four white folks were treated also stands in marked contrast to how people of color and indigenous folks are often treated by law enforcement. Every employee, potential employee and director, as well as every customer, supplier or other person in a business relationship with TD must be treated with dignity and respect. We are all responsible for treating others with dignity and respect. TD continues to ignore multiple such reports. posted by: alphabravocharlie on February 15, 2017 3:59pm Real mom 21- lynching was never legal in this country. posted by: THREEFIFTHS on February 15, 2017 4:49pm posted by: alphabravocharlie on February 15, 2017 2:59pm Real mom 21- lynching was never legal in this country. Then explain this. Col. Wm. This law continues in force to-day in some of the oldest states of the Union, where courts of justice have long been established, whose laws are executed by white Americans. It flourishes most largely in the states which foster the convict lease system, and is brought to bear mainly, against the Negro. The court summons here for the four who locked down is that responsibility. Fair and appropriate for a minor symbolic act. No oppression has ever been defeated in our nation without breaking of laws. In the spirit of Dr. King, we should all strive to understand the reasons for these actions and support appropriate reactions from the state. But insulting these patriots, calling for vigilante justice, and chilling free speech with outlandish charges, canines, pepper spray, and exaggerated Facebook posts. My wife and I had a very pleasant conversation with Mr. Clement yesterday. These people are trying to keep Long Wharf from going permanently underwater. Think of THAT traffic tie-up.
