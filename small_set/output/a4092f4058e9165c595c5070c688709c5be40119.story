January 2017 Spartacist League: Land Surveyor Socialists Native Americans march at Oceti Sakowin camp north of Standing Rock Reservation, 9 September 2016, to protest Dakota Access Pipeline. According to DAPL owners and the Spartacist League, this is not Indian land. On the other hand, the centrist Spartacist League (SL), in a knee-jerk reaction to the environmentalists, ends up echoing the line of some of the most retrograde, chauvinist sectors of the bourgeoisie. They entirely disappear the blatant environmental racism, and argue that the native people have no legal right to control what happens on the pipeline route. Certainly pipelines in themselves are not inherently bad or good, but this is a subterfuge in order to refuse to oppose the DAPL route at Standing Rock. As Marxists, we defend the oppressed native peoples against this racist capitalist attack. Contrary to the straw-man argument of the SL, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is specifically opposing pipeline river crossing next to their reservation (as one can readily verify from its court suit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and various tribal statements). So say Energy Transfer Partners and the Spartacist League. But the land north of the reservation was stolen from the Standing Rock Sioux. The SL agrees. Pipelines are indeed safer than rail transport of oil, but even so there were 1,739 significant pipeline incidents from 2010 to 2015. In fact, Sunoco Logistics, which is slated to operate the DAPL, has the worst spill record of any company in the U.S., with 200 incidents since 2010. Will Indian families be removed, as the government has done with other victims of environmental disasters, like at Love Canal in Niagara Falls, New York in the 1970s. Map by Carl Sack, cartographer at the University of Wisconsin, showing the lands crossed by the Dakota Access Pipeline which were guaranteed to the Sioux in the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty and then removed in the 1868 treaty. The area between the Cannonball River and Cedar Creek is sparsely populated, inhabited only by a few hundred people (2 per square mile). Then there are the treaties. The Spartacist line reflects the mentality of land surveyors for the bourgeoisie. As a point of reference, if the SL has difficulty visualizing it, that is less than the distance between Washington Square and Union Square in Lower Manhattan. Because the crossing point is half a mile north of the present boundary of the Standing Rock Reservation, it concludes (and the SL land surveyors concur) that the tribe has no legal right to block it. Note existing natural gas pipeline in the same location (shown by solid blue line), thus potentially increasing environmental risk in case of an explosion. Click on map to enlarge. (Map source: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) The potential for a serious environmental incident at this point is dismissed with a wave of the hand by these lawyers and unlicensed surveyors. Consider that a natural gas pipeline (the Northern Border line) and an overhead high-tension power line cross Lake Oahe at precisely the same point. When the pipeline was slated to cross the Missouri ten miles north of the state capital, Bismarck, concerns about possible water contamination got the route changed. But it has had consequences. So with tens of thousands of Syrian refugees being held in inhuman conditions in internment camps, the ICL raises these specious arguments to refuse to demand they be let in. Internationalist Group at November 3 Los Angeles protest in solidarity with Standing Rock Sioux. But of course.
