frida ghitis : the scientific community that i became part of in my 20s is even more rarefied .
in addition to this , with the celebrity that has come with my books , and the isolation imposed by my illness , i feel as though my ivory tower is getting taller .
so the recent apparent rejection of the elites in both america and britain is surely aimed at me , as much as anyone .
whatever matters now , far more than the choices made by these two electorates , is how the elites react .
