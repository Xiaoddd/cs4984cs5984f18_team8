153 years ago , my great-great-grandmother nape hote win -lrb- mary big moccasin -rrb- survived the bloodiest conflict between the sioux nations and the u.s. army ever on north dakota soil .
an estimated 300 to 400 of our people were killed in the inyan ska -lrb- whitestone -rrb- massacre , far more than at wounded knee .
but very few know the story .
