eight of us decided to take advantage of our proximity to construction of the dakota access pipeline and spent saturday , with protesters at mississippi stand , where catholic workers and others had already been disrupting pipeline construction for several weeks .
nearly 350 miles of the planned pipeline stretches diagonally across iowa before crossing under the mississippi river in keokuk and into central illinois .
many came in solidarity with those at standing rock or for their own kids , grandkids and future generations .
