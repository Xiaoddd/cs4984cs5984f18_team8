the water protector legal collective filed suit monday in bismarck seeking an immediate injunction to prevent kirchmeier and other agencies from using impact munitions such as rubber bullets , lead-filled beanbags , water and sound cannons .
the group wants the injunction in place while the court decides whether to issue a temporary restraining order against police , arguing the police actions and munitions used fall outside legal parameters .
