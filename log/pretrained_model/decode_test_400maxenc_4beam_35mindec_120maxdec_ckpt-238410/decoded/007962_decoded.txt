the privatisation of water is a contemporary enclosure of the commons , a continuation of a process of converting everything into property that began centuries ago with land enclosures .
for some , the privatisation of water is a new way of living and governing , a way of people relating to each other and the natural world .
some talk of a commons of humankind , whereas for others commons are part and parcel of local territorial communities .
