crystal water camp for the purpose of teaching how to identify .
for the past six months we have documented and reported hundreds of violations including spills of diesel fluids in ft. drum creek .
until now we have only been able to report what we can see from the road and public areas while the pipeline goes miles into forests and wetlands and places we can not see .
if our goal is not met for the drone the funds will be used to keep crystal water camp running and will be put to great use .
