north dakota governor jack dalrymple said it was ` probably not feasible ' to reroute the pipeline - which was originally intended to run north of the city of bismarck , around 50 miles from the sioux tribe 's land .
the pipeline will allow half a million barrels of oil to flow from north dakota to illinois each day .
