the nevada siege of cliven bundy is a living diorama of so much awful history between the first americans and those who took everything from them .
the authorities have brought water cannons , tear gas , helicopters and dogs against what has become one of the largest gatherings of tribes , from all nations , in a century .
the indian view is much more than p.c. revisionism , if you believe in the rule of law .
