the yaqui tribe , which has endured a long history of repression , has also a history of resistance .
like other indigenous communities in mexico , several members of the yaqui tribe have lost their lives fighting against invasive private companies .
just two years ago , before the conflict over the agua prieta pipeline , the yaquis protested against a large-scale aqueduct that would have diverted what was left of their sacred river to the city of hermosillo .
