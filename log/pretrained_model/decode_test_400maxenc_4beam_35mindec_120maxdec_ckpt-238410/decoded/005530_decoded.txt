more than 100 opponents marched in wintry conditions thursdayfrom the polk county courthouse through downtown des moines streets to rally in opposition to an underground oil pipeline project being built to link the bakken oil fields in north dakota with a shipping hub in illinois by passing in a diagonal 346-mile line through 18 iowa counties .
likewise , bill hanigan , a des moines attorney representing landowners in six counties , said iub officials ignored relevant evidence refuting the service and public use aspects of a project that was transporting oil for a private business from the bakken oil fields in north dakota to a shipping terminal in illinois with no direct benefits to iowans .
