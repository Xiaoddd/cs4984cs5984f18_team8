officers in north dakota and south dakota have pulled over and searched at least four veterans on their way to the camps at standing rock in recent days .
the charges against two veterans , who said they use medical cannabis to treat post-traumatic stress disorder , come days after a veterans service organization announced it would be returning to standing rock to provide support .
news of the charges adds to growing concerns that law enforcement is aggressively monitoring , arresting and prosecuting people affiliated with the anti-pipeline movement .
