the story of the dakota pipeline began two years ago , when a company called energy transfer partners applied to build a 1,100-mile pipeline from iowa to north dakota in order to carry 570,000 barrels of crude oil per day .
the company went to great lengths to locate the pipeline on almost exclusively private lands .
only 3 percent of its length would need federal approval , and in those places the pipeline was designed to run next to existing utility lines .
