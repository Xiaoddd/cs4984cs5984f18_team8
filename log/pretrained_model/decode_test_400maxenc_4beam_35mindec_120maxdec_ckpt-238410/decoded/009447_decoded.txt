the army corps of engineers has ordered that the oceti camp near the standing rock sioux reservation be closed at 2 p.m. local time on wednesday .
they also burned wooden structures central to the camp 's function , so that government engineers could not touch what they made and found sacred .
the numbers at the camp have dwindled since last december , when the weather turned mean and the tribe awaited the army corps ' next steps .
