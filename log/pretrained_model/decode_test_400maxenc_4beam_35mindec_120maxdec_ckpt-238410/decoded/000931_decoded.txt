this is a big piece but only one piece of the puzzle here .
pipelines might be safer and more efficient than other overland transportation options .
in fact , from its beginnings in 1961 to early 2017 , the existing trans mountain pipeline had 56 reportable spills , at least 21 of which exceeded 100 barrels .
the trans mountain pipeline would mean increasing the number and size of ships entering and moving across b.c. coastal waters .
