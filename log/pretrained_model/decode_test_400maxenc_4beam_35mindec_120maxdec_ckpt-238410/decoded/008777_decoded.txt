barack obama was going to be my president .
he wanted them to experience this moment with me , because you were the first candidate in my lifetime that actually made me excited to vote .
i felt like you were going to be a legendary president and i wanted my children to be part of that .
even though my politics might fall far to the left of yours , i have not agreed with you on everything .
