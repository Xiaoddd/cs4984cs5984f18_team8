the u. s. army corps of engineers has set a deadline of dec. 5 for the eviction of the oceti sakowin camp for people protesting the dakota access pipeline from corps-owned land .
the order comes three days after the corps told the standing rock tribe it would close the corps-managed land north of the cannonball river on dec. 5 .
however , the state does not have plans to remove people from the site .
