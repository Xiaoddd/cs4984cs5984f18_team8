several dams are scheduled to be removed in 2020 , but a proposed pipeline has raised fears that construction and leaks could threaten a revitalized river .
for millenniums , the klamath , modoc and yahooskin band of snake indians fished salmon from the lake and the river .
after dams were built on the river starting in 1912 , the salmon were blocked .
the pacific connector gas pipeline would run 229 miles from malin to coos bay , ore. , crossing underneath the klamath river near the city of klamath falls .
