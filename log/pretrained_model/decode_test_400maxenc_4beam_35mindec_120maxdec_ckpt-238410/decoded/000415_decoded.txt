indigenous youth , we claim our inherent indigenous responsibility given to us by our creator as , keepers of the earth .
we carry the message of indigenous knowledge from our ancestors that clearly states , water is life .
as the 7th generation indigenous youth , that does not mean we will needlessly risk our lives as we have the highest respect for grandfather winter .
