by default , your stylesheet will be loaded after the theme stylesheets , which means that your rules can take precedence and override the theme css rules .
just write here what you want to change , you do n't need to copy all your theme 's stylesheet content .
as you walk through camp , the snow and ice crunch under your feet , and your eyes and nostrils begin to freeze .
it blows and bellows so powerfully that you can actually feel the sound down deep in your core .
