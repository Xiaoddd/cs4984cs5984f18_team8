about 30 people holding signs and banners gathered on a dirt road leading to the construction site , blocking workers and work vehicles from driving down the road for about half an hour .
the workers , all of whom were brought in from out of state , were attempting to bore hole drill under the santa fe river to create a path for the pipeline .
it is believed that other vehicles and equipment were also unable to access the site due to the blockade .
