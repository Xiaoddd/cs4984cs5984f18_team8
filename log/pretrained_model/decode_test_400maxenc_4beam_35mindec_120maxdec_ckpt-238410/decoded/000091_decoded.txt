the pipeline , which has been projected to transport at least 470,000 barrels of oil per day over 1,100 miles from the bakken oil field to an existing hub in illinois for delivery to refineries on the gulf coast , was rerouted in 2014 from bismarck to the south , taking it through unceded treaty lands of the sioux .
pipeline construction over this altered route desecrated sacred ancestral sites , and , until last sunday , was slated to cross the missouri river at the lake oahe reservoir , which would have threatened the safety of the drinking water of the standing rock sioux and millions of people downstream .
