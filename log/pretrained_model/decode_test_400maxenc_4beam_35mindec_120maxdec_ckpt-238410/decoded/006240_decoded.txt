the tribe , which says the pipeline threatens its water supply and sacred sites , said tuesday it would continue to fight the project 's completion .
the area also has a large native american community that has actively opposed the pipeline , and one member of the council , debora sawant , is an enrolled member of the blackfeet nation tribe in montana .
critics say the figure is far higher and note that wells fargo provides several other services for energy partners .
