trauma-informed care and mental health first aid play a role in healing .
it is important to understand that many people have experienced trauma in the past that play a role in their beliefs .
native americans have experienced not only trauma , but circumstances that also hinder the healing that is needed for recovery .
so , as we move forward in developing programming and care , we must also remember to make decisions that will benefit all peoples instead of pushing others , like the american indians and alaskan natives , out by not understanding what they and their ancestry have experienced .
