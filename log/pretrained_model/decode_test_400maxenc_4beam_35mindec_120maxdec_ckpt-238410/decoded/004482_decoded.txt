activists have set up a tipi in front of the headquarters to protest the pipelines , which cut through land , threaten indigenous rights and human rights .
this protest is the latest in a growing international movement to stand up for indigenous and human rights and take climate action against pipeline companies like energy transfer partners , kinder morgan , enbridge and transcanada , along with the banks that fund them .
energy transfer partners sued groups like greenpeace international in the united states for nearly a billion dollars for supporting the indigenous-led movement opposing the dakota access pipeline .
