the standing rock sioux nation , whose territory is all around here , are leading this action and their elders set the tone .
newcomers are welcome but they have to take an orientation course where they learn about non-violence , the ways of the sioux , and the sacred camp fires around the grounds that must be respected , never photographed or allowed to go out .
one of those was going on as we wandered the camp , mostly trying to keep warm in the blowing snow and icy winds .
