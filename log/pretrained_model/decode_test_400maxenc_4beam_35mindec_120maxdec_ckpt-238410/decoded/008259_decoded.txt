frida ghitis : i believe with all my being in protecting the environment and human rights efforts .
places like standing rock are ground zero for our collective present and future generations .
places like standing rock are americans struggling for their rights , safety , integrity and future of their land .
any donations towards this song will go to relief efforts at standing rock and towards recording a proper studio version .
