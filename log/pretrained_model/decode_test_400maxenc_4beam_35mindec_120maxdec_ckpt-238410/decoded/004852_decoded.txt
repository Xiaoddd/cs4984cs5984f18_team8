saquib ejaz hussain , project manager of esia study from emc pakistan , said the route of the tapi project would be finalised once the esia study report was duly submitted to the governments of afghanistan and pakistan later this year .
he said the project envisaged laying of a 56-inch diameter pipeline one-meter below into the ground from turkmenistan to fazilka near pakistan-india border .
as compared to balochistan , he said , punjab will witness major activity due to scattered nature of the province .
