new federal rules in effect friday mark the first time in 45 years that federal officials have updated labor rules to prevent black lung disease , which is caused by inhaling toxic coal dust and silica in mines .
by the time the rules are fully in effect in 2016 , workers should be exposed to 25 percent less coal dust , saving lives .
just this week , pro-coal interests made this point in hearings on epa climate regulations for carbon emissions .
