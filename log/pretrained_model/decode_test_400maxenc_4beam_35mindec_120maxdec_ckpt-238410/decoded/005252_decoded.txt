authorities cleared a protest camp where opponents of the dakota access oil pipeline had gathered for the better part of a year .
the encampment has stood since august on u.s. army corps of engineers property at the edge of the standing rock sioux reservation near cannon ball , north dakota , about 40 miles south of bismarck , the state capital .
dubbed the oceti sakowin camp , the site became a focal point for u.s. environmental activists and native americans expressing indigenous rights .
