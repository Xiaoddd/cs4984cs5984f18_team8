more than 1.4 million activists have joined you in signing our petition urging the senate to reject devos , an extreme right-wing bigot who has no relevant experience as an educator and did not attend or send her children to public school .
the pushback from credo members has been unanimous .
but , our resistance is not done .
we have to do everything we can to keep the u.s. department of education out of her unqualified hands .
she also has an appalling record on civil rights .
