construction trucks set the first cement blocks in a line , forming the second barricade on highway 1806 .
weeks earlier and under emergency orders issued by former governor jack dalrymple , the north dakota national guard manned the first barricade , more of a checkpoint for passing cars .
tensions brewed at the frontline that day .
at their line sat military humvees , a tan armored vehicle equipped with a sound cannon .
activists smudged each other with burning sweetgrass and sage .
