in 1966 , my father held senate hearings to investigate violent attacks by growers against pickers in the produce fields surrounding delano , california .
my father only reluctantly attended the hearings .
while he was sympathetic with the farmworkers ' plight , he already had a full plate of issues ranging from the vietnam war , rioting cities to starvation in the delta and education on indian reservations .
