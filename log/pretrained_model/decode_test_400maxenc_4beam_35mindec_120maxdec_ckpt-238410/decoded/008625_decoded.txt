i recall one day around this time of year in 1987 loading barley with a three inch ogre poked under the sheet in order to stop the load failing the moisture content test and loose the small tenant farmer the export premium price , him shovelling to foot and me under the sheet inside the box .
sheer bloody luxury compare to just as shit up plus pissed wet through and bathed in barley whiskers evry bit as good as best quality itching powder from ' t joke shop .
