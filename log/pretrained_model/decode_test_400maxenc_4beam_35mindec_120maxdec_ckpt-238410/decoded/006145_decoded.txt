2016 european model simulation of progression of arctic air will plunge into the northern half of the lower 48 in five to seven days , dispensing some of the most frigid air since 2014 or 2015 in some areas .
computer models are unanimous in predicting that such a cold wave will be as intense as the january 2014 event because it is happening earlier in the winter and less snow is on the ground in north america .
it is not clear whether extremely cold air will reach the southeastern united states .
