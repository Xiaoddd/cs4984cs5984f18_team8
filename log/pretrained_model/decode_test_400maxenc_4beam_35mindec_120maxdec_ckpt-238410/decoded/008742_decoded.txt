ragip grajcevci , a former guerrilla fighter for the kosovo liberation army , kla , lost an eye and a finger during the war in 1999 .
only a fragment of it remains , perched on the lip of the state-owned sibovc mine .
coal often spontaneously combusts in the mine below , sending dust and smoke billowing through gardens and homes .
the noise of the constant digging grates on the nerves , according to families still living there .
