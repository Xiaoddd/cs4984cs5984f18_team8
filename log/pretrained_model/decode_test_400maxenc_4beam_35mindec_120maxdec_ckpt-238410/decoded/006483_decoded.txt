the third annual candlelight vigil honoring the tolowa dee-ni ' -lrb- people -rrb- killed at yan ' - daa-kivt -lrb- yontocket -rrb- in the 19th century attempted to move past the pain by acknowledging the massacre .
the vigil offered a time to reflect on the more than 450 tolowa killed in 1853 by white settlers pushing into the area , but it 's also a time to give thanks to the surviving ancestors who kept the tolowa people in existence .
