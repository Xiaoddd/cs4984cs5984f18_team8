donald trump is expected to go forward with plans to sign an executive order approving the dakota access pipeline and the keystone xl pipeline , two controversial and highly protested pipelines that threaten the ecosystem in which they exist .
along with the recommendation of the army corp of engineers , the pipeline was urged to build elsewhere , in order to avoid trampling sacred native lands of the standing rock sioux tribe , as well as tunneling under a major waterway .
this is especially infuriating when you consider the long-known fact that private citizen trump was financially invested in the success of the dakota access pipeline .
