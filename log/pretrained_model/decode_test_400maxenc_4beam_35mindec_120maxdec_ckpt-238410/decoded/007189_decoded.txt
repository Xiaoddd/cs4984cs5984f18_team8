the aclu has worked to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the united states .
for the past few months , i have watched from afar as para-militarized police forces from nine states have targeted peaceful protesters at standing rock with tear gas , freezing water , rubber bullets , concussion grenades , and other life-threatening crowd control weapons .
they and their supporters have every right to protest this , and the way they were treated really bothered me .
so when i heard that military veterans were planning to go to standing rock for the weekend .
