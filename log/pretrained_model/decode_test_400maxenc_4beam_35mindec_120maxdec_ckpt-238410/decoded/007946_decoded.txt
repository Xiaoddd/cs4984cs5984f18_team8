authorities in jerusalem were on high alert as israel banned men under the age of 50 from the shrine that usually draws tens of thousands of muslim worshipers for friday prayers .
israeli police spokesman micky rosenfeld said the ban was introduced after some palestinians barricaded themselves inside the al-aqsa mosque at the holy site .
the rally is set for 6 pm outside the israeli consulate on spring street .
