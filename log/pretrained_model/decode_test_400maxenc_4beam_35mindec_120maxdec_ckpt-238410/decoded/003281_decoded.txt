simon fraser university : the state of our environment , such as clean air and water , has more impact on our health than access to healthcare services .
the tmx project does not take into account the potential health and related economic costs due to the very real chance of an oil spill , air pollution , and climate change .
therefore phabc is asking the b.c. government to reverse its decision on the tmx until it has conducted a proper health impact assessment .
