the u.s. army corps of engineers said on sunday it turned down a permit for a controversial pipeline project running through north dakota .
the line , owned by texas-based energy transfer partners lp , had been complete except for a segment planned to run under lake oahe , a reservoir formed by a dam on the missouri river .
that stretch required an easement from federal authorities , which delayed a decision on the permit twice , in an effort to consult further with the tribe .
