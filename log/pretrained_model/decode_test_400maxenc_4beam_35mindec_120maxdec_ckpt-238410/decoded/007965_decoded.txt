the army corps of engineers announced it was halting construction on the dakota access pipeline and considering alternate routes , something protesters had sought for months .
that remained the only contested portion of the 1,172-mile pipeline , which is nearly completed .
today , the army corps of engineers denied dakota access an easement to cross the missouri river .
the decision means construction will likely not be completed during obama 's remaining weeks in office .
