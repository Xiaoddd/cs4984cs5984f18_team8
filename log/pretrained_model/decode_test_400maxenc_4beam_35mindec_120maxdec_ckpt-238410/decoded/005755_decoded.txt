tracy robinson , a hunter and fisherwoman living in the heiltsuk first nation community of bella bella , british columbia , was preparing to go out on to the ocean , when the news reached her : an american tugboat and oil barge transiting canadian waters had driven into a reef in nearby seaforth channel .
fearing the worst , robinson and her partner jumped into their boat and rushed to the scene .
earlier that night the tugboat nathan e stewart , heading south after delivering fuel to alaska , missed its turn into the rocks off athlone island .
