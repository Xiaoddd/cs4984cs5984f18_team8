the total amount of oil spilled is still not clear , though compared to the estimated 94 - 184 million gallons in the bp oil spill off the louisiana coast .
the oil slick has now grown to at least 430 square kilometers -lrb- 165 sq mi -rrb- , forcing beaches and port facilities to close while government workers and local fishermen work to contain and clean up the spill .
more than 2,000 firefighters were mobilized to tackle the spectacular blaze .
