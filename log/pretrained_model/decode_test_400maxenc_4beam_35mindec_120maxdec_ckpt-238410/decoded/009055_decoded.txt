april 25 , 2017 over the past two months , we have been working closely with mass design group to define the scope of the mni wiconi health clinic .
the clinic was gifted a 3 acre parcel of land by the standing rock medic healer council .
they have been building clinics and hospitals around the world for partners in health and have been using architecture to make the invisible structures of violence in our society visible so that we can move with more equity and healing .
