congress passed the flood control act of 1944 , commonly known now as pick-sloan .
the army corps of engineers and board of reclamation were assigned responsibility to enact pick-sloan .
even for those living right on the missouri river , the name pick-sloan is obscure but no legislation changed the nature of the missouri more .
