the spill , first reported on march 31 , stems from a pipeline operated by state-owned oil firm pertamina in east kalimantan province .
a report released april 4 by the ministry of environment and forestry said the slick was spreading out from balikpapan bay and into the strait of makassar .
pertamina , which for days had denied responsibility for the disaster , finally admitted on april 4 that one of its pipes used for transporting crude oil was the source .
