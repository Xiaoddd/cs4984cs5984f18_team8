the electrification project is a way to bring greenhouse gas emission benefits to a corridor that will eventually be served by high-speed rail .
using old diesel engines , caltrain currently provides more than 60,000 daily trips between san jose and san francisco .
electrification would not only reduce emissions immediately but allow caltrain to add more trains and boost service along this very busy corridor .
