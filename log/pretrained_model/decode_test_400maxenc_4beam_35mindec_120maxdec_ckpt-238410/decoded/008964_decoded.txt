the camp gained increased attention starting in august after its population had grown and authorities made their first arrests .
at its height , the camp included thousands of people , but the numbers had dwindled during the winter and as the fight over the pipeline moved into the courts .
most protesters left peacefully wednesday , when authorities closed the camp , but some stayed overnight in defiance of the government order .
only one person resisted arrest ; otherwise there were no major incidents .
