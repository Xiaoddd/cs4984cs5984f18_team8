a group of 31 environmental organizations sent joint letter to the white house asking president obama to halt construction of the dakota access pipeline , a 1,168-mile oil pipeline that would connect bakken oil to refineries in illinois .
but there are several problems with the route , which have raised the ire of environmentalists , local communities , and native tribes .
dakota access moves through the ancestral land of the standing rock sioux tribe , and the tribe has mounted an energetic protest against the project .
