the first thing to remember whenever dealing with any agents of the court is to remain humble .
if we are called to do battle with them , then we go armed with the truth , but i do n't see it that way .
let 's hope that it is quick and painless for them so we can both get back to our own business .
if absolute power corrupts absolutely , then remembering that is prudent for keeping composure and staying humble .
