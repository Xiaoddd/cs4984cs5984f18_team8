the u.s. army corps of engineers on tuesday refused to extend the wednesday 2 pm gmt deadline for the few hundred remaining water protectors to vacate the oceti sakowin camp .
the activists say they are surrounded by law enforcement with reports of an increased presence of federal bureau of indian affairs vehicles .
in return , they have faced dog attacks , water cannons in subzero temperatures , and tear gas , in addition to arrest and trumped up charges .
but tensions have escalated since newly-elected president donald trump issued an executive order last month calling for the completion of the controversial pipeline .
