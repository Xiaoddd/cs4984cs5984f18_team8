the doctors i have been in contact with , who are saying that the water protectors feel the movement is not over , but my friends who are there , are saying there is still a lot of medical needs there .
i will also be buying blankets and warm clothes as hypothermia has become a real issue .
no , the war is n't over but we are ready .
