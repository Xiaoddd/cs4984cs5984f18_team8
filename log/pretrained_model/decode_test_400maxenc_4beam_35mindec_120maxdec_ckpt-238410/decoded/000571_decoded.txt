the standing rock sioux tribe 's new water intake plant is located 40 miles south of fort yates .
construction of the facility began because the river channel is deeper further south , not because of the dakota access pipeline project .
smaller water intake systems will still service fort yates , but having the main plant further south means any spill will have to travel much further to reach the tribe 's water source .
