feb 19 i started studying russian in high school .
i thought it was cool it was even offered , and everybody else was studying spanish or french .
and that russia was already reeling from the collapse and us-influenced rapid deregulation and privatization .
but any conversation was quick to turn to anecdotes about bread lines , selling american blue jeans .
