citibank is a key investor in the dakota access pipeline , part of a sickly web of extractivist industry stretching across the entire midwest .
we took this small and simple action to send a greeting to our friends , but also to our enemies .
to all dapl-financiers , you may read this as a warning : disinvest in the pipeline now , or it will remain open season on your offices , homes , and projects .
