the u.s. government seized hundreds of thousands of acres of prime native american tribal land as part of an aggressive plan to build several dams along the missouri river basin .
as part of that program , known as the pick-sloan plan , hundreds of indian families from various tribes were forcibly relocated and their way of life completely destroyed .
the staggering poverty that resulted from the program lives on across the dakotas today .
