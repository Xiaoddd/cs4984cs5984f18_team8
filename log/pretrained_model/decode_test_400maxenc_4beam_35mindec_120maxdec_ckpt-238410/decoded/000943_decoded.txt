the new york department of appeals upheld a state agency 's right to review applications for renewal of federal licenses to operate two indian point nuclear power plants for another 20 years .
twenty million people live within a 50-mile radius of indian point , which lies along the east bank of the hudson river , about 30 miles north of new york city .
environmental concerns have dogged the indian point facility since the first plant , now decommissioned , opened in 1962 .
