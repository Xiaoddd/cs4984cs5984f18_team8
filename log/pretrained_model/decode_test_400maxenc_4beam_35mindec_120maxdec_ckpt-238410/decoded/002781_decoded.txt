experts say the recent decision to stop the pipeline could be reversed by the trump administration or the next congress .
on sunday , in a stunning surprise , the army corps of engineers denied energy transfer partners , the dallas-based company building the pipeline , the easement permit it needs to complete construction under the missouri river .
then the company would no longer need an easement from the corps to comply with the clean water act and could thus complete the pipeline .
