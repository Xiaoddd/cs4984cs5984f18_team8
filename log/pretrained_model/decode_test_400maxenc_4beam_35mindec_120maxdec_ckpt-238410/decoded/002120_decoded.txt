prime minister justin trudeau , a leader on efforts to address climate change , is sticking up for pipelines .
in a move that put him at odds with many voters in his liberal party , mr. trudeau said that the government would buy the trans mountain pipeline , which links edmonton to suburban vancouver , from its american owners for 4.5 billion canadian dollars .
nationalism and using public money to help a private business venture were the points of contention .
