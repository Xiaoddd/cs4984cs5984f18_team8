the army corps of engineers issued a permit in july to build the line under lake oahe in north dakota .
it also took all the necessary steps to issue the easement that the company also needs .
the pipeline from north dakota to illinois is nearly complete , and the lake oahu easement is the last major approval it needs .
but the victory may be short-lived .
