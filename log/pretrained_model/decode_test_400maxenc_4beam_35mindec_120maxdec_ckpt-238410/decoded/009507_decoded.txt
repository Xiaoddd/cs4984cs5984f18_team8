the cheyenne river and the standing rock sioux tribes have sued to stop construction on the final stretch of the dakota access pipeline .
the last piece of the pipeline is to pass under a reservoir on the missouri river , which marks the eastern border of both tribes ' reservations .
the company building the pipeline , texas-based energy transfer partners , has insisted the water supply will be safe .
