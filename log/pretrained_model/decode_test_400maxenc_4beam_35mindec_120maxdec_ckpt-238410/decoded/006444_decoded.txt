the roll call lasted for many , many hours while the children stood wet and freezing and night came .
all of the children died of being exposed that day .
so in the freezing cold they marched them back to the area in front of the barracks where they had been living and had a roll call .
then they marched them back to the area in the water as if they were washing them , and then made them put on these wet clothes again .
