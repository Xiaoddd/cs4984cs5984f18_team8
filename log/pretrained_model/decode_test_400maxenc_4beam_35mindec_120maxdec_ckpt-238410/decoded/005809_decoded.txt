today 's poem the new verse news presents politically progressive poetry on current events and topical issues .
in my heart , i could wear a headdress , i could smell the burnt leaves wafting like spirits around my skull , like voices turned to ashes swirling and sticking to my tongue .
with every breath , the timeline of existence shrinks backward one step .
