the recent announcement of the clearing of protesters came a day after thanksgiving , a holiday related to the oppression of native communities in america .
the truth behind thanksgiving is that in 1637 , over 700 men , women , and children were massacred by the english and dutch colonists .
violence against peaceful protests is usually condemned by the u.s. government when it is taking place in a foreign nation .
