the army granted energy transfer partners formal permission wednesday to lay pipe under a north dakota reservoir , clearing the way for completion of the 1,200-mile pipeline .
workers had already drilled entry and exit holes for the segment , and oil had been put in the pipeline leading up to lake oahe in anticipation of finishing the project .
the last piece of the pipeline would pass under the lake on the missouri river , which marks the eastern border of both reservations .
