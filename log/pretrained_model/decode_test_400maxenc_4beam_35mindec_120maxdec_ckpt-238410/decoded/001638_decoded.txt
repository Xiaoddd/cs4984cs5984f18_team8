stover , 54 , likes living out here in the country on u.s. highway 51 , between the tiny villages of vernon and patoka .
his closest neighbor is the tank farm , a sprawling complex of enormous white steel tanks that are nearly 4 stories tall .
each can hold upwards of a quarter of a million gallons of crude oil .
