the backwater bridge has been the line of scrimmage between protesters and police .
about three quarters of a mile north of the main protest camp , the small concrete span carries north dakota highway 1806 over a narrow creek .
the highway is the shortest route to bismarck , about 41 miles to the north , but it remains closed to all traffic .
