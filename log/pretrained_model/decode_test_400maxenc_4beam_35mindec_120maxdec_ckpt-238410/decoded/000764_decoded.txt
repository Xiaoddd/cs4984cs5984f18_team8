on december 2nd brenda , who has served 20 years in the military , walked across the back water bridge near the oceti sakowin camp , and explained to north dakota law enforcement and national guard , that water protectors are just like those who served in the military : people who are protecting their families , human rights , and the land .
we never knew that this was going happen in hunkpapa lakota territory , and it happened for a reason because i believe that this was a place that our ancestors , sitting bull , black elk , spoke about .
