the 1,172-mile dakota access pipeline could begin transporting oil as early as monday .
the pipeline was originally projected to be in service by october 2016 , but because of legal disputes about water safety , native american lands and eminent domain , the project has been delayed until now .
at least 22 of these crossings , highlighted in blue , have to be drilled deep under large bodies of water .
