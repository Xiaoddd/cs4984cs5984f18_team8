pipeline guards are assaulting the native sioux tribe and their allies with attack dogs and pepper spray .
the dapl was supposed to route near bismarck , but was rejected because of its proximity to municipal water sources .
without that capital , quite simply , there is no pipeline .
stop the money , stop a pipeline .
