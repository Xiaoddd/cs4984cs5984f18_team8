` this painting shows the black narin -lrb- snake -rrb- -rrb- is helping to save their land and water and the people .
it represents the pipeline killing bininj -lrb- indigenous -rrb- people , and the land out there .
in my painting ngaliod are fighting that black narin to stop it before it goes more further and kills everything .
