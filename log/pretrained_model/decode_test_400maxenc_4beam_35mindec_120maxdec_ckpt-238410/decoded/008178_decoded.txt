the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled on saturday that the tribes had not met the requirements for the order to be issued .
the decision to seek an emergency order comes after both native american tribes lost a legal bid last week to stop construction on the last link , which runs under lake oahe in north dakota .
