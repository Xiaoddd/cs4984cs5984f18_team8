politicians are a vastly greater threat to national security than any hacker ever could be .
this is nuts , or because it was the right thing to do .
if you want national security , fire every politician who is willing to sell the american people down the river to prop up the u.s. dollar instead of doing the right thing and getting us out of this neoliberal nightmare .
stop electing people who see government transparency as a terrifying threat that will cost them elections instead of something they should be giving the american people themselves voluntarily .
thank you in advance , love special agent caitlin johnstone , director of non-psychotic solutions .
