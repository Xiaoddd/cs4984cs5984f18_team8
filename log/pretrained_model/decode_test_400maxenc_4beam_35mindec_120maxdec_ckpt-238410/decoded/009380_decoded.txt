bill mckibben has called germany the greenest industrial nation on earth .
there is good reason for painting germany as the poster child of the possible .
in 1945 , just two generations ago , germany was more or less a country of rubble , its population decimated by a genocidal war and its territory controlled by four increasingly discordant occupying forces .
even in the ecological wreck of soviet east germany , environmentalism became a surprisingly active sphere of political participation .
