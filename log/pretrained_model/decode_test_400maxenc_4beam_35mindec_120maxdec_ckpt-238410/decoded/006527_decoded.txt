the 1960s-vintage line 3 , one of six enbridge pipelines that ferry canadian oil across minnesota , runs at only 51 percent capacity due to safety concerns .
as proposed , a new line 3 would divert from enbridge 's existing pipeline corridor at clearbrook , minn. , jutting south to park rapids before heading east to superior , wis. .
enbridge maintains it does n't have enough pipeline capacity to meet oil shippers .
