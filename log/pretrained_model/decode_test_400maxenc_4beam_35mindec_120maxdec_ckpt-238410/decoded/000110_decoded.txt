the life we live today is as it is because of what our ancestors learned , the perspectives that have developed and accumulated over thousands of years .
if we started from scratch , with no language , no rules , no thoughts or ideas about the world provided for us , and began life as a blank slate with no external input on what to be today .
consider how much civilization has changed in the past 100 years alone and how that has changed who we are .
now , with mercury meeting saturn , it is a good time to consider how limited we are .
