jan hasselman , attorney for the standing rock sioux tribe in north dakota , said tuesday the tribe would push back with a lawsuit defending the decision by the u.s. army corps of engineers to undertake a full environmental-impact review that includes looking at alternative routes for the pipeline through four states .
the tribe has opposed the pipeline out of concern a spill could pollute drinking water in the missouri river and threaten native american cultural sites .
