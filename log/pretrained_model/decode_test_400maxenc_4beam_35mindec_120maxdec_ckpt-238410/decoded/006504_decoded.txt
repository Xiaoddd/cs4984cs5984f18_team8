sharon wong posted a great series of tweets that helped me manage my phone anxiety .
but sometimes , when you really need to , you can break those barriers down .
this week , with encouragement from some great people on the internet , i pushed against my anxiety and make some calls .
each call only takes a minute or so , but you might want to block off more time for your first call , so you can prepare your words & nerves .
