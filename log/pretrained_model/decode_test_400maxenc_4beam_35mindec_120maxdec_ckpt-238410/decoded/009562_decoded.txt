judge james boasberg last summer ordered army corps of engineers to further study the pipeline 's impact on tribal interests .
the route of the pipeline would pass under the missouri river , which flows into lake oahe - the lake is the primary water source for more than 10,000 sioux .
kiwis were among those who protested the pipeline in 2016 , as security forces fired rubber bullets and tear gas at them .
