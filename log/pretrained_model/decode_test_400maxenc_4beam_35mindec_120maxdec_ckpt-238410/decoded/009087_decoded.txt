a federal judge on monday refused to stop construction on the last stretch of the dakota access pipeline , which is progressing much faster than expected .
the development was prompted by pro-energy president donald trump , who pushed the army to advance construction .
however , company lawyer david debold on monday suggested it could be ready for oil in as little as 30 days .
