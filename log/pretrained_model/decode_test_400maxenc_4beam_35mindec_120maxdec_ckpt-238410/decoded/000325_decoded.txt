a photograph that can only be called heartbreaking in its happiness , unbearable in its ordinariness .
it shows an eight-year-old serge with his sister and their romanian-jewish parents walking along a promenade in nice , in 1943 , still feeling confident , even at that late date , that they are safe in their new french home .
within a few months , the hysterical hyperventilators have come to seem more prescient in their fear of incipient autocratic fanaticism than the reassuring pooh-poohers .
