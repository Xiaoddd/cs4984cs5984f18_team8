authorities do n't know what caused the fire on the phillips 66 pipeline in paradis , but a crew of six workers was cleaning it at the time .
the pipeline was carrying a highly volatile byproduct of natural gas , which was burning cleanly and very hotly over a 30 - to 40-foot area .
sixty homes were evacuated and highways were being diverted around the area in paradis , which is about 30 miles west of new orleans .
