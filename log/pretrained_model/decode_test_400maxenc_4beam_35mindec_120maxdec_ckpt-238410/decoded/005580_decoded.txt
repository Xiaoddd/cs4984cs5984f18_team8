the disheartened impressions i previously had of students and america turned 180 degrees after seeing people flock to the standing rock indian reservation and north dakota .
for most of my life , as i am in my fourth decade of existence -lrb- 41 yrs -rrb- .
i have experienced racism because people see my dark skin complexion before my irish side , or elite college experience , or phd .
standing rock , as a pivotal moment , epitomizes the struggle and opens the door for a truer historical understanding .
