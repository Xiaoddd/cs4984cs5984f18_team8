sheriff brian gootkin announced his decision to not send deputies to north dakota .
i have been in protest situations in my career and fully understand that in many cases law enforcement is placed in the middle of two emotional opposing interests and we have to attempt to balance our role as peace officer and law enforcement .
many of you emailed and called the office to voice your concerns .
