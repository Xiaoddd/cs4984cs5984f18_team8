oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt , whose confirmation hearing for head of the epa is scheduled for friday , was ordered by oklahoma county district judge aletia haynes timmons to fulfill public records requests for more than 3,000 emails by the center for media and democracy .
the cmd has sought access to the emails for the last two years based on concerns about the handling of energy issues in oklahoma .
during his nomination hearing , pruitt suggested senators file public records requests after declining to provide the emails as part of his hearing .
