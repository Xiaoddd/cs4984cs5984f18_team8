at the camp we were at , oceti sakowin , it was requested that you do not take photos unless you have media credentials .
during our time there , we learned a great deal , particularly on how to be the best ally we can be .
also , please develop contacts at the camp first to ensure you are getting the right supplies for the water protectors .
