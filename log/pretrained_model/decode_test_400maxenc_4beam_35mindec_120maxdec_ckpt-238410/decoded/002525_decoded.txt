the time has come for the dead , that they should be judged and to give the reward to your servants the prophets , as well as your holy people , and all who fear your name , from the least to the greatest .
now the time has come , and the time of the dead , that fear thy name , small and great , and the time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth .
