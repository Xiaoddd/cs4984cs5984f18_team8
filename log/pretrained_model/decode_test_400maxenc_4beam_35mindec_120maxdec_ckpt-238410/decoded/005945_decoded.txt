fbi has a long history of investigating peaceful protest groups and other non-violent activists .
during the struggle for black civil rights in the 1950s and 1960s , the agency under the direction of j. edgar hoover launched the notorious cointelpro campaign in which leftist , civil rights , black power , anti-war , feminist and other groups were targeted , often illegally , in an effort to monitor , infiltrate , discredit and destroy them .
cointelpro operations ranged from inciting deadly violence to attempting to persuade civil rights icon rev. martin luther king jr. to commit suicide .
