the us army corps of engineers announced sunday they had denied an easement to build the pipeline under a section of the missouri river that the standing rock sioux tribe had said would threaten water sources and desecrate sacred ground .
officials will instead conduct environmental impact reviews to determine alternate paths .
the decision was a huge victory for the local indigenous people , as well as the thousands of supporters who had traveled to a camp on the reservation to protest against the pipeline 's construction .
