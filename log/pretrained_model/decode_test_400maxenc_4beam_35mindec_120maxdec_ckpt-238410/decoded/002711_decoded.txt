the four cardinal points are defined by red in the south , standing for summer and fowls and poultry ; green lies to the east and represents spring , wood and the dragon ; white is placed in the west and represents autumn and the tiger .
yellow , on the other hand , is in the east and relates to spring .
in the chinese tradition , colours are thus to be taken as being part of a latticework of equivalents based on five fundamental elements .
