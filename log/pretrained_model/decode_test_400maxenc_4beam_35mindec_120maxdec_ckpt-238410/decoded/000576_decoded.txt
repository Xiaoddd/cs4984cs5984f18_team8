a true obscenity taht we have not seen since third reich trials against german resistancefighters during ww2 .
they can not show videos or play soundrecordings of the grave violations by the police , taht have injured and wounded hundreds of people .
this makes defense against the fascists in bismarck absolutely impossible .
they will be on trial this monday , before a court that is completely bought and biased .
the standing rock waterprotectors need all our support to enable them to have any defense at all against the unlawful illegal arrests .
