since the time of the violent attack , the police erected numerous concrete barricades to prevent people from accessing or crossing the bridge .
due to the attack , a tribal elder was put in critical condition , with another woman left permanently blind in one eye after being shot in the face with a tear gas canister .
the already spotty internet availability has also been cut by law enforcement repeatedly during similar clashes .
