the leak from the belle fourche pipeline , approximately two and a half hours from the dapl protest site , started at the beginning of the month or earlier .
electronic monitoring systems failed to detect the leak .
the oil spread approximately six miles down the creek before the spill was stopped .
anti-dapl protesters have suggested a similar scenario could occur with the dakota access pipeline .
