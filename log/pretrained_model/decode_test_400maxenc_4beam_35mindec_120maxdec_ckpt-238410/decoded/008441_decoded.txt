the full pipeline should be operational within three months , the developer of the long-delayed project said thursday .
workers had already drilled entry and exit holes for the crossing , and oil had been put in the pipeline leading up to the lake in anticipation of finishing the project .
work was stalled for months due to opposition by the standing rock sioux and cheyenne river sioux , as well as a prolonged court battle between the developer and the army corps of engineers .
