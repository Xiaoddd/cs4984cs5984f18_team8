a previously proposed route for the 1,172-mile pipeline had it crossing the missouri river north of bismarck , north dakota , according to a document filed as part of the permitting process .
the eventual route was decided on , and is currently in construction , moved the water crossing of the crude oil pipeline south of the north dakota capital , to just upstream of the standing rock sioux tribe 's reservation .
the corps rejected the bismarck route to protect wells that serve the municipal water supply .
