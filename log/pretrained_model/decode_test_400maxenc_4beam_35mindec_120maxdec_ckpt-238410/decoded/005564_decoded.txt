indonesia has had a long history of conflict over control of its massive areas of tropical forests that are spread across the many thousands of islands that make up the archipelagic nation .
declaration under former dutch colonial rule of state ownership of all forests was rarely accepted by the millions of people who lived in them and who had managed them sustainably for centuries .
the islands now known as indonesia have long been home to thousands of distinct ethnic groups with their own languages .
