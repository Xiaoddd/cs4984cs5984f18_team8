the military , police , private dapl workers , security and investors have encroached upon and attacked inhabitants on and near standing rock dakota territory .
we are collectives of indigenous and non-indigenous water protectors calling upon homies and accomplices to do whatever it takes to chop the head off of this black snake .
public opinion and the privileged liberal myth of voting with your dollar are not going to win the day .
we are here to protect our communities , not please the mainstream media .
