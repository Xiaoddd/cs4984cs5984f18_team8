jun 8 , 2011 the truth lies buried at fort laramie driving my vw bug along interstate 70 in early january 1973 , i was crossing the wide missouri and on to denver to report for work as a historian with the national park service .
with both a degree and employment in hand , and aware that the academic job market for historians had crashed , i felt extremely lucky .
