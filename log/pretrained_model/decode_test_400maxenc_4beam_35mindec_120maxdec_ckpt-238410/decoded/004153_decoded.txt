the mass of people arrested on january 20th were swept up in a police kettle which lasted for hours , and ended in the police sexually assaulting and raping arrestees as a sadistic form of group punishment .

if the state succeeds , most of the defendants face literally a life sentence , and the state will be given a dangerous new precedent for future repression .
