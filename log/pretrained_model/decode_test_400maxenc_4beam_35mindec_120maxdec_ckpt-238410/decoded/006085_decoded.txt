the u.s. army corps of engineers has decided to deny permission for companies seeking to build the now infamous dakota access pipeline in north dakota .
this section of the 1,172-mile pipeline would have run within a half mile of the standing rock sioux reservation .
it would have also crossed beneath the nearby missouri river .
