the destructive pipeline project is looking to cut straight through the sacred lands of the standing rock sioux reservation , a place that is home to more than 8,000 members of the sioux tribe .
to the tribes , the pipeline not only represents a trespassing into their home , but it has the potential to ruin their precious water supply , a fact that they are simply not willing to take lying down .
every day , people are gathering on the reservation to meet with officials face and let them know they are not okay with the project .
