in the horrific stories of degradation , is a small story of victory , of how 40 to 50 native people stood against more than 250 police on a bridge on county road 134 in rural north dakota .
word-of-mouth announcements went out to the oceti sakowin camp that there was going to be a police raid of the front-line camp that had been set up in the way of the pipeline .
if they were stopped at this bridge from the east , they could only come from the north .
