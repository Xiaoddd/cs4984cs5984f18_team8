police officers and national guards standing around casually eating pizza and joking with each other .
it felt good to hear that , i felt connected to them even though they were outside of the bus we were on because we are all one heart , one mind and one prayer .
as we were looking out that 2 national guard officers were taking selfies with a view of the men in the cage behind them .
