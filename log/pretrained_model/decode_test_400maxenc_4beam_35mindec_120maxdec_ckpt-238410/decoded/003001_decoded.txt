we have created the indigenous reporting fund , which will prioritize support for indigenous journalists .
the fund will support in-depth reporting and complement the regular news and opinion articles we publish , but it will not not be the only indigenous content you will read in ricochet .
instead , it will beef up that content and ensure we are investing the necessary resources in telling the stories no one else is telling .
