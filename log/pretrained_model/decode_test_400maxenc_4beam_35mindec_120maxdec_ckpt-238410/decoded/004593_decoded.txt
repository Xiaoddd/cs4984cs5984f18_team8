gladly , most of us in the general population are not sociopaths with an unquenchable urge to destroy anything that gets in our way .
we believe there is a better way to organize our world than between those who have nothing .
instead of blindly following the edicts coming down from our corporate masters and their lobbyist run governments and condoning the workplace autocracy that leaves us penniless and voiceless we need to fight like free warriors never willing to sell out on our principles .
