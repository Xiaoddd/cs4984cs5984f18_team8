the u.s. army corps of engineers is set to take effect at 2 p.m. local time .
part of the camp sits on a floodplain , they say , which could create dangerous conditions as the weather warms and the snow melts .
floodwaters could also wash trash and debris from the camp into nearby rivers .
many of the remaining protesters are expected to leave wednesday on their own accord .
