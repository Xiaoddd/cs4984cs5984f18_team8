mike hudema climate and energy campaigner , greenpeace it was the most beautiful action i 've been a part of , ever .
for over 36 hours , myself and six other climbers hung from the ironworkers memorial bridge in coast salish territories -lrb- vancouver -rrb- putting our bodies in the way of a massive tar sands tanker and preventing it from passing through .
above us flew seven flags , each designed by an indigenous artist from some of the main nations that have led the fight against the disastrous trans mountain pipeline and tanker expansion project .
each one of those flags is a symbol of resistance and hope .
