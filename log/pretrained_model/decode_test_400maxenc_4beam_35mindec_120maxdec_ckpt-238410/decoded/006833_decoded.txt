north dakota governor jack dalrymple gave an executive order , effective immediately , to evacuate the camp , under threat of arrest .
just let that sink in for a minute ... this order is so thick with gross hypocrisy , it is hard to even know where to start .
this could very well lead to tribal leaders coming under attack for not actively leading people to comply with this order .
