thousands of indigenous people and their allies have converged on the standing rock sioux tribe in their opposition to the dakota access pipeline -lrb- dapl -rrb- .
they spend their days building infrastructure at the camp , chopping wood , sorting donations , praying and singing at the main fire , and putting their bodies on the line between the land and an energy company determined to drill through it .
some people come for the weekend , others have quit their jobs and made resisting this pipeline their full time work .
