riley ortega , a 15-year-old hopi , created the perseverance for preservation run .
young ortega said a long run to standing rock seemed like the best way to raise awareness and to honor the original runners who started the no dapl movement when they ran 2,000 miles to the white house .
riley also wanted to honor his late uncle , dennis poolhaca , who was a marathon runner .
