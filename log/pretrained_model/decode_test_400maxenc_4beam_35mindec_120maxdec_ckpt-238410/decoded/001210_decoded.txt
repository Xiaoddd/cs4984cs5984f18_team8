they added a religious freedom component to their case last week by arguing that clean water is necessary to practice the sioux religion and that the mere presence of the pipeline renders the water impure .
energy transfer partners received final approval from the army last week to lay pipe under the reservoir and to complete the 1,200-mile pipeline .
the full pipeline system could be operational within three months .
