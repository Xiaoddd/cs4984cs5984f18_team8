the wednesday afternoon deadline for protesters of the dakota access oil pipeline to empty their largest encampment passed with far more uncertainty than unrest .
in the hours after the deadline , the authorities made 10 arrests but said they would not fully empty the camp on wednesday night .
roughly 25 to 50 demonstrators were believed to remain in the mandatory evacuation zone .
