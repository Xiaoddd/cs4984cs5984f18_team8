the comstock township planning commission voted unanimously late thursday to deny a special exception use permit for an enbridge dredge pad located in comstock commerce park .
commissioners said enbridge did not show the burden of proof it needed to with regard to potential health concerns their activity could cause .
the planning commission currently has eight commissioners , but the decision on the comstock commerce park site was made by a six-member vote because commissioners dan balkema and ron sportel own property .
