the only time lethal force is acceptable for cops is if the perp does indeed have a weapon on him or her .
we live in a country where white militias can walk around with guns and even point guns at cops and did n't get shot .
ca n't say the same about tamir rice and his toy gun .
not get shot , while unarmed black children and native american protesters are at risk of being killed .
