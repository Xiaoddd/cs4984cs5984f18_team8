from yes magazine i have returned from standing rock with my mind blown , my heart broken and my spirit troubled with foreboding of a deepening tragedy .
volunteering as a legal observer with the water protector legal collective i witnessed several confrontations between water protectors -lrb- wp -rrb- and law enforcement : national guard , sheriffs and private security -lrb- le -rrb- .
