this is the very definition of hypocrisy , and it absolutely has no place in this country .
the events taking place at standing rock are crimes against humanity , and the people there need our help .
on december 6th , i plan to travel to bismarck , north dakota on my own dime so i can help get supplies that are desperately needed to the camps .
thanks for your time , and i hope you 'll support me and the standing sioux tribe .
