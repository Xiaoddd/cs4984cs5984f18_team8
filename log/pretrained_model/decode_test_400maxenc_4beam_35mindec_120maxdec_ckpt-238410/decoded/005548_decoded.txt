the women 's march was the most uplifting , inspiring moment during a time of such turmoil .
the blocking of funding to the epa & usda temporarily is not unheard of .
hope is not lost .
for those hoping this administration will be better than it seems , maybe that will happen .
until we know , we have forgotten how much of a difference each one of us can make .
