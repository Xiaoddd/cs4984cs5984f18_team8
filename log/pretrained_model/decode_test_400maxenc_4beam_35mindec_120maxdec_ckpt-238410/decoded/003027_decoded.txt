december 4th is when i go to standing rock ok so many of you know me and my passion for my heritage and for veterans in general .
the couple of examples show the misunderstanding of the right that the sioux nation , in the standing rock protest have to clean water , and the preservation of ancestors who are buried in sacred ground where this greedy corporation want to build .
the massacre at wounded knee creek when miscommunication and misunderstanding of the ghost dance lead to over 200 dead lakota .
