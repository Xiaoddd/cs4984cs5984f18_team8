mike casca , deputy communications director for bernie sanders , apparently got a chuckle out of ted cruz today while taking the tweet into the senate .
senate is currently debating the repeal of obamacare .
since senators love their visual aids , it makes sense that bernie sanders brought one along with him to work today .
