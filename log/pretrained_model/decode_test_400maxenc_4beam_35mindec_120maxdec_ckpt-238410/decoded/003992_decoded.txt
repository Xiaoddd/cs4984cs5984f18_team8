matt musselwhite , a carpenter , arrived at the camps just a few days ago with the components for several tiny houses in tow , along with several other sorely-needed items .
musselwhite , along with a volunteer teamster trucker , spent three days traveling from oregon to north dakota in a 5-ton flatbed truck .
one of the houses will soon become home to mni wiconi , the first baby born at the encampment since the protests began back in april .
