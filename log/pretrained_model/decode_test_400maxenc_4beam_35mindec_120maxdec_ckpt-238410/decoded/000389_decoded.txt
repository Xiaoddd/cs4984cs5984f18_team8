one of two tribes who say the pipeline threatens their water supply on thursday filed a legal challenge asking a court to block construction while an earlier lawsuit against the pipeline proceeds .
the army said tuesday , feb. 7 , that it will allow the four-state pipeline to cross under a missouri river reservoir in north dakota until the tribes ' legal claims are resolved .
those claims include that pipe under the tribes ' source of water would desecrate the water they need for religious practices .
