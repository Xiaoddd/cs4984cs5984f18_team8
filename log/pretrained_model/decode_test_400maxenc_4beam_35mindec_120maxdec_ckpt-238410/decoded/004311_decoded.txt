about 20 protesters had participated in blocking construction thursday morning in response to the state 's decision to appeal a judge 's ruling against the pipeline .
groups opposed to the pipeline had hoped the ruling would put a halt to the pipeline 's construction .
the late april ruling also required the pipeline company to develop emergency evacuation and response plans for areas near the pipeline .
the proposed 162-mile pipeline pipeline would run from st. james to lake charles , with portions crossing the ecologically-sensitive atchafalaya river basin .
