on sunday , i and many other peaceful water protectors were attacked at the oceti sakowin camp in standing rock , nd .
the prayers were meant for both sides .
a camp-mate of mine was shot by one of the bullets and had his arm broken .
the police were not there to arrest us that night - i believe only one person was arrested - they were there to hurt us and still having difficulty coming to terms with what we experienced .
