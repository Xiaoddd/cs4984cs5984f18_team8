South Dakota lawmakers are considering a bill to widen law enforcement abilities to react to similar protests that may occur in the state . South Dakota lawmakers are considering a bill to widen law enforcement abilities to react to similar protests that may occur in the state . Gov. Dennis Daugaard wants temporary powers to stop people from assembling in South Dakota , in places that would be designated as public safety zones by the governor . The governor wants a new criminal charge called aggravated criminal trespass to be created for people who defy orders to stay out of public safety zones , and the authority for judges to put offenders in jail for up to a year for first offenses , and in prison for two years for second or subsequent offenses . One part of the proposed law would punish protesters who block highways . It specifically allows prohibiting people from standing outside vehicles on a highway in a public safety zone . Clearly , showdown time must be coming . The law , if the Legislature passes it , would automatically be repealed July 1 , 2020 . The project at issue is the TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline . The law is intended to cover construction of Keystone XL . Last month President Donald Trump invited TransCanada to resubmit its federal application to pierce the Canada-U.S. border . Within two days TransCanada did . That set a 60-day clock running for a decision . The state Public Utilities Commission has already granted permission and set conditions for construction and operation of Keystone XL through western and south-central South Dakota . The senators Wednesday heard arguments and allegations from the perspectives of tribal members who supported the North Dakota protest against the Dakota Access pipeline . And they heard how extremely limited law enforcement is in the extremely rural counties where the Keystone XL pipeline would be laid in South Dakota . But it comes within a few miles of Bridger along the Cheyenne River , at the southwestern corner of the Cheyenne River reservation . The Cheyenne River is one of the main tributaries of the Missouri River . The Cheyenne flows the width of western South Dakota , from the Black Hills into the Oahe reservoir upstream of Pierre . Much like the North Dakota crossing for Dakota Access upstream from a drinking water system for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , the Keystone XL crossing on the Cheyenne River would be upstream from public water systems that rely on the Missouri River . Keystone XL would cross other small waterways throughout western and southern South Dakota . It would cross several major highways that are essential to east-west traffic , such as S.D. 34 , U.S. 14 , U.S. 18 , U.S. 212 , U.S. 85 and Interstate 90 . The legislation already is stirring hard feelings that could last generations . A return to ugly times waits just ahead . Click any reaction to login .
