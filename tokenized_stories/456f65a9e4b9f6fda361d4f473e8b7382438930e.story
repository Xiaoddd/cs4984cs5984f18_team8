On December5 , former vice president Al Gore met with Donald and Ivanka Trump in an effort to convince the president-elect that he should not gut federal policies and agreements dealing with climate change . Three days later , actor Leonardo Di Caprio also paid the Trump duo a visit , urging them to help build a green , climate-friendly economy with lots of jobs . The two men could not have had less impact on greenhouse warming if they had flown up to Alaska together and asked the glaciers to please stop melting . In a conversation with Gore on December 6 , the climate-hawk governor of California , Jerry Brown , urged optimism . Trump of course ignored these entreaties , instead demanding from the Energy Department the names of all personnel who have been involved in efforts to reduce carbon emissions . Forget Trump . If saving civilization from an untimely heat death actually did depend on whether or not the U.S. president can be convinced to take appropriate action , then we would have already beendoomed long before 2016 . Policy steps taken by current and past presidents , as well as campaign promises made by Hillary Clinton , all fell far , far short of cutting emissions as much as is needed to avert disaster . Arguing for that in an invigorating December 1 Portland Rising Tide essay , Arnold Shrodernoted that the opening for building a bigger , more radical , more effective movement may be wider now than it was before November 8 . This is true in many respects . The fact that so much of the political establishment , even on the right , is averse to Trump likely creates unique opportunities ... Cities large and small across the country have declared similar intentions . The need for quick , urgent action is not a hard case to make . Despite allowing the global temperature to rise by two and a half to three and a half degrees , the Paris agreement declaresthat itseventual goal isto hold the rise to a degree and a half . Achieving the 1.5-degree goal will require eliminating all greenhouse emissions within the next 15 years , and sooner in the case of heavy emitters like the United States . Now they will be free to push hard , out there across America , for the immediate , steep drop in the use of fossil fuels and other greenhouse-gas sources that is so essential . But they will also have to be publicly candid about a hard consequence of such deep cuts : that they will require America and other high-emissions nations get by onfar less energy from all sources . Well , suppose we overthrow this regime soon and get serious about climate . Building wind , solar , biomass , and geothermal infrastructure will be essential to sustaining civilization , but a rapid buildup will require huge energy inputs . And we will have to be rapidly abandoning fossil fuels at the same time we are constructing renewable energy infrastructure . The concurrence of those two crash campaigns will leave far less net energy to be consumed for doing everything else we need to do . The primary limitation we will face in building renewable energy capacity is its higher requirement for energy input per unit of energy generated . That leaves much less net energy to be used by society at large . Second , we will obtain less and less energy per unit of energy invested as time goes on . Furthermore , some of the wind and solar energy generated , maybe much of it , will have to be stored using batteries , hydrogen , compressed air , or other means . It will then have to be reconverted either to electricity or liquid fuels and transmitted from often remote regions to places where people and businesses are concentrated . All of those processes will severely shrink the net energy available to society , because much energy is expended during both conversion and transmission . Finally , all production of wind , solar , geothermal , and biomass energy has an ecological impact on the landscapes where it occurs . The bottom line : we will have to redesign our economy and society to get by with a permanently lower input of energy and other resources . A new nation conceived ... Slashing energy consumption will be a hard sell in America unless a majority of the country understands clearly the dreadful consequences of not doing it . On this point , some international comparisons might be useful . For example , consider scenarios in which we reduce the net energy available to run American society -LRB- total energy , from all sources -RRB- by 50 , 75 , or 85 percent . We then can ask which countries today have similar per-capita consumption of energy . There are four countries that consume about half -LRB- 45 to 55 percent -RRB- as much energy per capita as America does : France , Japan , Slovakia , and Slovenia . So clearly , a well-functioning society with good quality of life can easily run on that kind of energy input . But unfortunately , any realistic examination of our predicament tells us that we are going to have to cut energy use by a lot more than half . All but Mexico have better scores for income inequality than the United States . If it turns out that we will have to go further and get by on about 85 percent less energy per capita , our present-day examples are Armenia , Botswana , Costa Rica , Cuba , Ecuador , Egypt , Georgia , Jamaica , Jordan , and Panama . Lower living standards for sure , but wide variation in quality of life . The main problem making some of these countries , and some of those listed above , less-than-desirable places to live is not that they are energy deprived . This is not to say that by going on a strict energy diet , the United States would come to resemble present-day France or Bosnia or Ecuador or any other country . Done right , the scale back would force us to stop expending energy on all kinds of wasteful , socially harmful , or ecologically destructive activities . We would ensure that everyone has sufficient access to the shrinking energy pie , along with a good livelihood and good quality of life . No more soft pedaling Up to this point , the mainstream climate movement has been highly allergic to talking about energy reductions of 75 percent or more , let alone the economic transformation that would entail . We can let Washington decide between those first two choices for us , or we can choose the third . This article was originally published by GreenSocialThought.org .
