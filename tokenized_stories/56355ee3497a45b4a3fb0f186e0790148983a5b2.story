Six reasons 2016 was n't just a giant dumpster fire Michael Stewart December 20 , 2016 Indigenous Rights Environment Political Action Breaking : 2016 sucked . Not in the usual way life sucks , like the way a bowl of rice pudding sucks , a milquetoast , flavourless gruel that masquerades as a dessert while quietly eroding your ability to enjoy even the simplest of life 's pleasures . No , 2016 sucked like cancer . It was a canvas of pimples and boils in the care of an overzealous teenager . We sat helpless as he attacked every pustule with increased ferocity and relentlessness , each one bigger and more putrid than the last . Then someone elected him president . A recap : The attacks in Paris . Brussels . Lahore . Istanbul . Nice . Istanbul . The hate-crime shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando . Brexit . Fentanyl . Aleppo . Aleppo . Aleppo . David Bowie , Prince , Leonard Cohen , Muhammed Ali , Gene Wilder , Alan Rickman . Donald Trump 's nomination as Republican presidential candidate . Donald Trump 's election campaign . Donald Trump actually getting fucking elected and then Donald Trump as president-elect picking white supremacists and climate change deniers for his cabinet . That 's not even the Coles Notes version . That 's the I 'm - still-in-triage version . But you know all that . 2016 has already become a euphemism for calamity . Just kidding , I 'm a freelancer . I do n't have work parties . It 's 2016 . But it does n't have to be that way . The shocking thing is maybe it 's not as bad as all that . Just because the whole world is soaked in kerosene does n't mean we have to start giving away matches . It 's true : we have a lot of work to do to repair the catastrophe and heartache 2016 has left in its wake , but here are six stories that remind us that we still have a fighting chance . This is not nothing . Take these victories and hold them close . They were hard fought and hard won . They belong to us , now . So grapple them to your hearts with hoops of steel , so they can light the way for 2017 . A national inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls . Like many of the victories on this list , this was n't a definitive win . There are areas of serious concern , like its limited scope and its failure to hold law enforcement agencies to account for their criminal neglect or systemic failures . But make no mistake : this inquiry was not bequeathed to us by a benevolent and tearful Justin Trudeau . It is the direct result of work by women who are at once the most marginalized in Canada and the most fearless and relentless . The Native Women 's Association of Canada fought for 11 years to make this happen , much of that against a Stephen Harper government that was outright hostile to the idea of bringing justice to the families of the missing and murdered . They put it on the national radar and they made it an election issue -- and it helped change governments . Stand in awe of this work because , now , we have a national inquiry . In November 2015 , several people without homes and their allies took up occupation of the federal courthouse lawns in Victoria , B.C. Camping in parks is legal in Victoria thanks to a B.C. Supreme Court case in 2008 , so the city rewrote its bylaws permitting police to evict campers at 7 a.m. Super InTentCity , as its founders named it , exploited a loophole by camping on the courthouse grounds -- which , as provincial property , are not subject to Victoria 's bylaws . Still , Christy Clark 's Liberal government requested an injunction to remove the campers , but , incredibly , the B.C. Supreme Court ruled in favour of the tent city in April . Justice Christopher Hinkson 's ruling lauded the leadership of the camp , its sense of community and its access to health and social services . While the province would secure its second request for an injunction in July , it was n't before SiTC won 140 units of permanent social housing for the city 's homeless population . Super inTentCity is an incredible story of perseverance , organization and community . On October 22 , about 60 land protectors occupied the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric dam construction site in Labrador after someone cut off the lock to the gates . It was an escalation of ongoing protests and a blockade in opposition of a plan to flood traditional Innu and Inuit territory and risk methylmercury exposure to local communities . Reports of violent arrests -- as well as a court-ordered subpoena of journalist Justin Brake , the only reporter covering the occupation -- brought the action to national attention . After an emergency 13-hour meeting , the government of Newfoundland and Labrador and leaders of the Nunatsiavut Government , NunatuKavut Community Council and the Innu Nation reached an agreement . Nalcor , the corporation behind the dam , had to wait for Indigenous leaders ' approval before going ahead with the project . The agreement compels Nalcor to return water levels to normal after initial flooding to allow independent environmental and health assessments to move forward . The victory is cautious -- and the land protectors remain suspicious of the provincial government 's sincerity , but one of the smallest corners of the country stood up against colonialism -- and colonialism blinked . Yes , Trudeau 's Cabinet approved the inevitably disastrous Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain expansion pipeline that virtually the entire province of B.C. -LRB- along with every climate change scientist with a pulse -RRB- , but he also confirmed that Enbridge 's Northern Gateway pipeline was finally taken off life support . This defeat has to be celebrated . One , because climate activists fought it successfully in a political context much more unforgiving than our current one . And , more importantly , it reminds us that Northern Gateway , too , was once approved by Cabinet -- but it did n't help . As the incredible coalition of local governments , scientists , concerned Canadians , environmental groups rallies around the Kinder Morgan betrayal -- led , as always , by the Coast Salish and B.C. Interior First Nations -- Northern Gateway should stand tall as a reminder that even as the forces of government and industry gather around a carbon-busting fossil fuel project , we can still win . Black Lives Matter - TO had already been in the news early on in 2016 when it set up a tent city in front of the Toronto Police headquarters following the decision not to lay charges in the police shooting death of Andrew Loku . Their occupation won a coroner 's inquest -- but it was July when BLMTO gave Canada a lesson in the power of civil disobedience . Shut . It . BLMTO has been invited as the guest of honour to the parade and they took the invitation as seriously as one is able . They halted the parade until Toronto Pride agreed to their list of demands . The most contentious was the demand that Pride no longer allow police floats and booths in community events and spaces , but it also included demands for Black queer youth funding and the return of the South Asian stage . A shellshocked Pride TO executive director Mathieu Chantelois arrived after 30 minutes and agreed to every one of the demands , signing his name with an gorgeous , flamboyant black fountain plume pen . This incredible act of courage and defiance , demanding that Pride honour its political traditions and consider the voices it had been unconsciously working to marginalize would have been worth it just to see the -LRB- literally -RRB- white seething rage that emerged from the Canadian media . But while Pride appears to be walking back on its agreement with BLMTO , particularly the issue of uniformed police as Pride participants -- concerns that had been lingering behind an increasingly corporatized and sanitized event exploded all over the country in a celebration of queer Blackness . Beautiful . I know you 're leery about this one , and you have good cause . Donald Trump will almost certainly try to reverse this decision and it 's hard to think that a big part of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decision to reject DAPL is the giant middle finger it sends to the incoming administration . No one knows the fleeting nature of this victory better than the land and water defenders who withstood police brutality , sub-zero temperatures and a swarm of idiotic white liberals . The Standing Rock Sioux taught America what treaty rights and traditional territories actually mean . It showed a generation of environmental activists that the only way to stop climate change is to put your body between a capitalist and his money . And it showed that courage , strength and community , with the right strategy , can still stand up to the immense wealth and power of industry , backed by state violence and mainstream media spin -- and win . It 's a lesson and a beacon for 2017 : no one knows how to fight capitalism better than Indigenous people , because they 've been doing it for centuries . When settlers get out of the way and let them lead , good things happen . After 2016 's shit picnic , it 's worth a shot . Please chip in to keep stories like these coming .
