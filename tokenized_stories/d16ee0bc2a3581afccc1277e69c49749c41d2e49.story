Scientists say the world has edged closer to apocalypse in the past year amid a darkening security landscape and comments by Donald Trump . The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists -LRB- BPA -RRB- moved the minute hand of the symbolic Doomsday Clock from three minutes to two-and-a-half minutes to midnight . It is the second closest it has been . In a report , the BPA said President Trump 's statements on climate change , expanding the US nuclear arsenal and the questioning of intelligence agencies had contributed to the heightened global risk . The minute hand on the Doomsday Clock is a metaphor for how vulnerable to catastrophe the world is deemed to be . The symbolic device was created by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1947 . The BPA was founded at the University of Chicago in 1945 by a group of scientists who helped develop the first atomic weapons . Today , the group includes physicists and environmental scientists from around the world , who decide whether to adjust the clock in consultation with the group 's Board of Sponsors - which includes 15 Nobel laureates . For the last two years , the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock has stayed set at three minutes before the hour . But the BPA says the danger of global disaster is even greater in 2017 , and so has moved the hand forward 30 seconds . Other influencing factors listed in the BPA report include doubts over the future of the Iran nuclear deal , threats to cyber security and the rise of fake news . The board 's decision to move the clock less than a full minute - something it has never before done - is because Mr Trump has only recently taken office and many of his cabinet nominations are not installed in government . When it was created in 1947 , the clock 's hand stood at seven minutes to midnight . Since then it has changed 22 times , ranging from two minutes to midnight in 1953 to 17 minutes before midnight in 1991 .

That was the closest it had been more than 20 years . It was last at three minutes to in 1984 when US-Soviet relations reached their lowest point .
