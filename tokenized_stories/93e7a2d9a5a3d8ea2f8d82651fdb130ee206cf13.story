The Gray Wolf -LRB- Canis lupus ; also spelled Grey Wolf , see spelling differences ; also known as Timber Wolf or Wolf -RRB- is a mammal in the order Carnivora . The Gray Wolf shares a common ancestry with the domestic dog -LRB- Canis lupus familiaris -RRB- , as evidenced by DNA sequencing and genetic drift studies . Gray wolves were once abundant and distributed over much of North America , Eurasia , and the Middle East . Today , for a variety of human-related reasons , including widespread habitat destruction and excessive hunting , wolves inhabit only a very limited portion of their former range . Though listed as a species of least concern for extinction worldwide , for some regions including the Continental United States , the species is listed as endangered or threatened . Currently , there are 615 First Nation communities , which represent more than 50 nations or cultural groups and 50 Aboriginal languages . Canada - First Nations - Questions children ask ... Children 's section - we answer your most frequently-asked questions about Aboriginal peoples . Can First Nations people from different groups in Canada understand one another Some of the 53 languages have common roots , so speakers of these languages can communicate fairly well . Other languages are completely , totally different . For instance , Haida and Mi ` kmaq speakers would certainly have to speak English to understand one another . No . Slightly more than half of all First Nations people in Canada live in towns and cities . Pow-wows today are celebrations of Aboriginal culture , especially dance and music . They are open to anyone who wants to enjoy learning about and experiencing Aboriginal cultures . Elders are greatly respected for their patience and understanding , their life experiences , and their knowledge of traditional culture and language . Aboriginal people prepared for the harsh winter season by storing much food and supplies and moving their camps to more sheltered places . They also wore many layers of warmer clothing , a technique now widely used as the most efficient way to keep both warm and dry in cold weather . A partial list would include the famous leaders Chief Crowfoot -LRB- Blackfoot , Alberta -RRB- and Joseph Brant -LRB- Mohawk , Ontario -RRB- as well as television actor Jay Silverheels -LRB- Mohawk , Ontario -RRB- , but there are many , many others . Some of them do , but only for special ceremonies or for competition dancing at pow-wows . Aboriginal people today dress the same as everyone else . They play traditional Inuit games , as well as most of the same things you probably do for fun . Many bands today prefer to be called First Nations . Yes . It describes land set aside by the federal government for Band use . First Nations and Inuit stopped living in traditional dwellings such as tipis , longhouses -LRB- First Nations -RRB- and igloos -LRB- Inuit -RRB- many , many years ago . Today , Aboriginal people live in the same kind of houses as everyone else in whatever part of Canada they live in . Yes and no . On hunting trips the igloo has mostly been replaced by modern , lightweight tents , although good survival training still teaches how to build one for use in an emergency . Some of the men still do , and of course many women do as well , but modern hairstyles are far more common . Canada 's Gateway to Aboriginal Heritage ... We encourage students and teachers to look through our main Mi ` kmaq language and culture pages for in-depth information about the tribe , but here are our answers to the questions we are most often asked by children , with Micmac pictures and links we consider suitable for all ages . It 's pronounced MICK-mack in English . In their own language , Mi ` kmaq people pronounce it MEE-gmakh , with a raspy final consonant . The apostrophe is a vowel marker showing that the i is a long vowel . Not all Mi ` kmaq people use the same spelling system . Any of those three spellings is acceptable . Sometimes , especially in history books , you will see the word spelled another way : Miikmaq , Mikmaq , Mi ` gmaq , Migmaq , Miigmaq , or Migmac . These are less accepted spellings but they all refer to the same tribe . Mi ` kmaq is the plural form and Mi ` kmaw is the singular form . So when Micmac people are speaking their own language , they use Mi ` kmaw to describe one person or object , and Mi ` kmaq to describe more than one . This makes sense to French speakers , but in English , we do n't have endings for our adjectives . The Mi ` kmaq Nation was a member of the Wabanaki Confederacy that controlled northern New England and the Canadian Maritimes . They also settled in locations in Quebec , Newfoundland , and Maine . Today , most Mi ` kmaq people live on the Canadian side of the border , but the Aroostook Micmacs live in northeastern Maine . Each Micmac Indian community lives on its own reserve or reservation . Reserves are land that belongs to the tribe and is legally under their control . The Micmac Indians in the United States call their community a tribe . In Canada , they call themselves bands or First Nations . Each Micmac tribe or First Nation has its own government , laws , police , and services , just like a small country , Some Mi ` kmaq nations have also formed coalitions to address common problems . The leader of a Micmac tribe is called the chief -- saqamaw or sakmaw in the Mikmaq language . In the past , Micmac chiefs were chosen by tribal councilmembers . Often they picked one of the last chief 's sons or nephews . Today chiefs are elected in most Micmac nations , just like governors or mayors . Most Micmacs speak English , but many of them also speak the Mi ` kmaq language , Mi ` kmawi ` simk . Mi ` kmaq is a song-like language with complicated verbs . You can listen to a Mi ` kmaq woman talk in her language here and read a Mi ` kmaw picture glossary here . Their website has lots of information about Maliseet and Micmac culture , both in the past and today . They do the same things all children do -- play with each other , go to school and help around the house . Many Mi ` kmaq children like to go hunting and fishing with their fathers . In the past , Indian kids had more chores and less time to play , just like early colonial children . But they did have dolls and toys to play with . Here are some pictures of Micmac games for children . Teenagers and adults played a stick-and-ball game similar to hockey . Like many Native Americans , Mi ` kmaq mothers traditionally carried their babies in cradleboards on their backs -- a custom which many American parents have adopted now . Micmac men were hunters and fishermen , and they sometimes went to war to protect their families . Micmac women took care of the children , built their family 's house , and gathered plants to eat and herbs to use for medicine . Both genders took part in storytelling , artwork and music , and religious festivals . In the past , the chief was always a man , but today a Micmac woman can be chief too . The Micmacs did n't live in tepees . They lived in small villages of wigwams , which are houses made of wood and birchbark . One Micmac family lived in each wigwam . Here are some pictures of wigwams like the ones Mi ` kmaq Indians used . Today , Native Americans only build a wigwam for fun or to connect with their heritage , not for shelter . Most Micmacs live in modern houses and apartment buildings , just like you . Mi ` kmaq women wore hide tunics and long skirts . Mi ` kmaq men wore breechcloths with leggings . Men did n't have to wear shirts in the Micmac culture , but when it was cold out , they wore warm robes . Mi ` kmaq people also wore moccasins on their feet . Later , the Micmacs adapted European costume such as blouses and jackets , decorating them with fancy beadwork . Here are some pictures of Mi ` kmaq clothing and some photographs and links about Native American regalia in general . Traditionally , the Micmacs did n't wear long feather headdresses . Micmac women often wore a distinctive peaked -LRB- pointed -RRB- hat , and both men and women wore beaded headbands with feathers sticking up from them . The Micmacs did n't usually paint their faces , but sometimes men painted them red if they were going into battle . Most Mi ` kmaq people wore their hair long and loose . In the 1800 's , some Micmac chiefs began wearing an impressive feathered headdress like the Sioux , and it became popular for Micmac women to braid their hair . Today , some people still wear traditional Micmac clothing like moccasins or a beaded cap , but they wear modern clothes like jeans instead of breechcloths ... and they only wear feathers in their hair on special occasions like a dance . Yes -- the Micmac Indian tribe was well-known for their birchbark canoes . Here 's a picture of a Mi ` kmaq canoe . The upward curve in the middle of the canoe is a distinctive Micmac style . Canoeing is still popular within the Mi ` kmaq nation , though few people handcraft their own canoe from birch bark anymore . Over land , the Micmac tribe used dogs as pack animals . Micmac people used snowshoes and sleds to help them travel in the winter . Today , of course , Micmac people also use cars ... and non-native people also use canoes . The Micmac tribe was semi-nomadic . That means they did n't do much farming and moved around a lot as they collected food for their families . The Mikmaqs were good at fishing and hunting large game like caribou and moose . Micmac men also went to sea to harpoon seals , walrus , and even whales . Other foods in the Micmac diet included berries , squash , and maple syrup made from tree sap . Mi ` kmaq hunters and warriors used bows and arrows , bone spears , and heavy wooden clubs . Mi ` kmaq fishermen used pronged fishing spears , hooks , and nets . Micmac artists are famous for their porcupine quillwork . Some colonists even called them the Porcupine Indians because they were so skilled at this art . The Micmacs also did beadwork and basketweaving . Like other eastern American Indians , Micmacs also crafted wampum out of white and purple shell beads . Wampum beads were traded as a kind of currency , but they were more culturally important as an art material . The designs and pictures on wampum belts often told a story or represented a person 's family . The Micmac were great traders , carrying goods between northern tribes like the Innu and Cree and New England tribes like the Abenaki and Pennacook . They were also fierce warriors , fighting with the powerful Iroquois and the Beothuk of Newfoundland . But their most important neighbors were the Maliseets , Passamaquoddies , Abenakis , and Penobscots . These five tribes formed an alliance called the Wabanaki Confederacy . Before this alliance , the Micmacs were not always friends with these other tribes . Sometimes they even fought wars . But once they joined the Confederacy , the Wabanaki tribes never fought each other again , and are still allies today . There are lots of traditional Mi ` kmaq legends and fairy tales . Storytelling is very important to the Mi ` kmaq culture . Here is one legend about Glooscap -LRB- Gluskabe -RRB- , the culture hero of the Wabanaki tribes , and another about Rabbit and the Moon . Anna Mae Pictou Aquash , the famous American Indian activist , was Mi ` kmaq from Nova Scotia . She worked for Native American rights and an important figure in the American Indian Movement -LRB- AIM -RRB- . In 1975 she was assassinated and the crime is still unsolved . Anna Mae is still an important figure for many Native Americans in the United States and Canada today . You can read more about her life and death here . In Canada , natives and non-natives have many conflicts about Indian land rights . The Micmac and Maliseet tribes of New Brunswick have been at the center of this controversy . When the Micmac and other Indian tribes signed treaties with the Canadian government , they gave up ownership of most of their original land . However , in exchange , the government agreed that the Micmacs would have special fishing , hunting , and logging rights . These special rights make white fishermen , hunters , and loggers very angry . They think it is unfair that they do n't have the same rights that the Micmacs do , even though the Micmacs legally paid the government for those rights . Some white people in New Brunswick got so angry that they destroyed Mi ` kmaq and Maliseet fishing equipment and burned a sacred site . Eventually the situation calmed down , but there is still a lot of tension between the Micmac Indians and their white neighbors in New Brunswick . Here 's an article about this situation that is written for younger readers . Religions are too complicated and culturally sensitive to describe appropriately in only a few simple sentences , and we strongly want to avoid misleading anybody .

These languages fall into 11 separate families . Three of the families consist of only a single language , for which the term isolate is used . Of the remaining eight families , some are groupings of languages as closely related as those comprising the Romance , Germanic or Slavic families of Indo-European , while others are more ramified groupings on the order of Indo-European as a whole . In a few cases the Aboriginal language families of Canada and the rest of North America have been found to be distantly related , although many more proposals of relationship have been advanced than have actually been proven . In the light of present knowledge the majority of Aboriginal language families in North America appear to be as independent from one another as Indo-European is from Uralic , Sino-Tibetan or Japanese . North America is unquestionably one of the most complex linguistic regions in the world . Many of the Aboriginal languages of Canada are spoken in several more or less mutually intelligible dialects , particularly when the language is distributed over a large area . Such dialects grade into one another to form chains whose members may approach mutual unintelligibility at the geographic extremes , but the chains themselves are regarded as single languages for purposes of classification . Cree and OJIBWA are two of the 10 Algonquian family languages spoken in Canada ; some of these and still others are spoken in the US . In the late 20th century the majority of native people , particularly younger persons , did not speak an Aboriginal language . A few of the remaining languages have at least reasonable chances of surviving in the near future , but the majority are endangered , and at least seven were approaching extinction in the mid-1990s , with only a handful of elderly speakers of these still living at the time . Undoubtedly , the number of Aboriginal languages once spoken in Canada considerably exceeded the present number . Nicola -LRB- see NICOLA-SIMILKAMEEN -RRB- and TSETSAUT -LRB- Athapaskan -RRB- , Pentlatch -LRB- Salishan -RRB- -LRB- see INTERIOR SALISH -RRB- , and SENECA and Tuscarora -LRB- Iroquoian -RRB- -LRB- see IROQUOIS -RRB- were all spoken in Canada in relatively recent times but are now extinct there ; some of these are still spoken by small numbers of elderly persons in the US . Other languages that disappeared during the early stages of European contact include : BEOTHUK -LRB- isolate -RRB- , HURON , St. Lawrence Iroquoian , NEUTRAL , and PETUN -LRB- all Iroquoian -RRB- . Geographic Distribution of Canadian Aboriginal Language Families Not one of Canada 's Aboriginal language families falls exclusively within Canada , and most straddle the US-Canadian border . Eskimo-Aleut extends not only into Alaska , but also into Siberia on the west and Greenland on the east . Within Canada , the Aboriginal language families concentrate in the West . Except for Eskimo-Aleut , whose Inuit Inupiaq branch stretches across the entire Canadian Arctic , only two language families , Algonquian and Iroquoian , are found east of Lake Winnipeg , and only Iroquoian is found exclusively beyond this point . Siouan -LRB- see SIOUX -RRB- , Algonquian and Athapaskan are present in the prairies , although the latter two belong primarily to the Boreal Forest -LRB- Subarctic -RRB- area ; and Athapaskan and Tlingit -LRB- see INLAND TLINGIT -RRB- are spoken in a number of communities in the BC interior . Along the West Coast and its inland waterways are found large numbers of Salishan , TSIMSHIAN , Wakashan -LRB- see NOOTKA -RRB- and HAIDA communities . The isolate Kutenai -LRB- see KOOTENAY -RRB- is located in southeastern BC near the lake and river of that name -LRB- Kootenay -RRB- . Eight of the 11 families are found in BC alone . This concentration of families has suggested to students of Aboriginal history that the West is a linguistically old area and the most likely staging area for successive migrations of speakers to the south and east , a view which accords quite well with archaeological and ethnological findings . By contrast , central and eastern Canada are dominated by the Algonquian family and particularly by the two languages Cree and Ojibwa . This situation suggests more recent language spreads relative to the West . Classification of Canada 's Aboriginal Languages Linguistic classification involves both the question of the internal relationships among members of the same family and the question of the external links between families in still larger groupings , termed stocks or superstocks , depending on how comprehensive they are . The membership within families of all of the 50 Aboriginal languages is well established , higher-order groupings far less so . The high-water mark of Aboriginal language classification for North America was achieved by Edward SAPIR in a famous paper published in the Encyclopaedia Britannica in 1929 , a paper which set the directions of Aboriginal language research for decades afterwards and which still provokes lively debate . In this classification , the numerous families of North America were first grouped into 12 middle-level stocks considered reasonably assured , and then - far more speculatively - into six far-reaching superstocks , considered possible though unproven . All but one of the Canadian Aboriginal families were subsumed under four superstock headings : Algonkin Wakashan -LRB- Algonquian , Kutenai , Wakashan , Salishan , plus three families in the US -RRB- ; Na-Dene -LRB- Athapaskan , Haida and Tlingit -RRB- ; Penutian -LRB- centered in California and Oregon , with Tsimshian the sole Canadian member -RRB- ; Hokan-Siouan -LRB- numerous families in the western US and some in Mexico , with the Siouan and Iroquoian families spilling over into Canada -RRB- . One family , Eskimo-Aleut , was regarded then , as it is today , as constituting a separate stock . In recent decades there has been a steady retreat among the majority of linguists from this and other massively integrative classificatory schemes , back at least to the middle-level stocks . In some cases , additional middle - and lower-level links have been proposed , even as the higher-order links have come undone through continuing research . Thus , Eyak , a language isolate in Alaska , has been joined to Athapaskan during the same period that saw the dismantling of the Na-Dene superstock as a whole ; and the link between Siouan and Iroquoian , while problematic , is on firmer footing today than it was in 1929 , although little remains of Sapir 's Hokan-Siouan superstock , in which both families were originally placed . It was often found that the formal elements expressed in the familiar European languages by separate words or word endings were , in many Aboriginal languages , combined in chains of prefixes or suffixes surrounding basic roots . Certainly there are families such as Eskimo-Aleut , Iroquoian and Algonquian where the term polysynthesis fairly characterizes the verb , but such general typological labels leave a spurious impression of structural uniformity for the whole continent and obscure differences sometimes found even among languages of the same family . In addition , virtually every grammatical category known from the languages of the Old World -LRB- systems of person , case , number , gender , tense , mode , aspect , voice -RRB- is found among the languages of North America , and there are some unusual categories that have been the focus of considerable interest in Aboriginal language research : verb stems that denote categories of shape and motion , sets of demonstratives that indicate whether an object mentioned by the speaker is visible to him , verb modes that indicate whether what the speaker is saying can be verified from immediate experience , even different sets of numerals to count different classes of objects . One particular line of research which has developed around the so-called world view problem has attempted to determine if , and how , such categories influence habitual thought patterns and modes of perception among speakers . Aboriginal languages also exhibit great diversity in their sound systems . In some families , such as Iroquoian and Eskimo Aleut , the inventory of basic sounds is fairly limited ; in others , particularly those located in the Plateau and on the West Coast , the inventories of basic sounds , especially in consonant series , are quite large . The census resulted in different figures for the categories Mother Tongue -LRB- the language first learned at home and still understood -RRB- , Home Language -LRB- the language spoken most often at home -RRB- , and Knowledge of Languages -LRB- the language -LRB- s -RRB- spoken well enough to use in a conversation -RRB- . The present figures , rounded off , are from the third category . While the figures are indicative of relative numbers of speakers , they can not be taken as absolute , since a number of Aboriginal reserves were incompletely enumerated . The figure for Iroquoian speakers , for instance , is too low , since other sources indicate between 1000-2000 speakers in Canada for Mohawk alone . Languages known to be extinct are not listed . Wiyok and Yurok may not form a separate subgroup as the term Ritwan implies . Link with Beothuk now discounted . No relationship yet found between Haida and Tlingit .

Language is a vital tool for the transmission of values , spiritual and traditional beliefs , and the entire histories of a people from generation to generation . First Nations languages Across Canada , there are eleven Indigenous language families comprised of at least 59 individual languages . The largest language family is Algonquian , which covers a vast geographical range from the Atlantic Provinces to the central-eastern sections of British Columbia . Three of these language families -LRB- Haida , Ktunaxa , and Tlingit -RRB- have only one language and are considered language isolates . Furthermore , a single language can contain many dialects and linguistic variations within a small geographical area . For example , Halkomelem has Upriver , Downriver , and Vancouver Island dialects . For a list of Aboriginal languages currently spoken in Canada , as well as their distribution , visit the Atlas of Canada here . The diversity of these languages is remarkable , even within a single language family . Halkomelem , spoken by the Coast Salish of the lower Fraser River and southern Vancouver Island , is as different from Okanagan as Finnish and Hungarian . Linguists have found that many First Nations languages are typologically unique , using structures and systems remarkably different from the more commonly studied Indo-European languages . As First Nations traditionally preserved and transmitted their culture and history through the oral tradition , no First Nations language in Canada had a writing system prior to European contact . Starting in the mid-19th century , European missionaries created writing systems for the Cree and Ojibwe peoples in an effort to teach them about Christianity . Over time , these writing systems were developed and consolidated to encompass more languages . Currently , the Algonquian , Athapaskan , and Eskimo-Aleut language families use variants of the Canadian Aboriginal Syllabic writing system . Some First Nations languages use the International Phonetic Alphabet -LRB- IPA -RRB- .5 Others have their own systems . Many Salish nations in British Columbia , for example , have their own practical orthographies that are based on Roman characters . First Nations Languages map of B.C. Click to enlarge . Reproduced courtesy of the Museum of Anthropology , University of B.C. , Vancouver . British Columbia is the most linguistically diverse region in Canada . Of the eleven Indigenous language families in Canada , eight are found in B.C , including the three language isolates : Haida , Tlingit , and Ktunaxa . The Inuit , living in the area above the tree line stretching from the Western Arctic to northern Quebec and Labrador , all speak mutually comprehensible dialects of a single language . This language is most commonly known as Inuktitut , the dialect spoken by Inuit peoples in the Eastern Arctic . To learn some Inuktitut , visit Tusaalanga Inuktitut . Michif evolved as a result of the fusion of European and Aboriginal cultures . Another language that developed during the fur trade is Chinook . Chinook was most commonly spoken in British Columbia and along the Northwest Pacific Coast . Chinook is not as linguistically complex as other languages and is therefore considered a jargon . While Chinook is for the most part no longer spoken , Chinook continues to be researched and studied via dictionaries . Many Chinook words are have entered the English vernacular of the Pacific Coast . Some common Chinook words still used today are potlatch and tyee . Language loss Despite the amazing diversity of Aboriginal languages across Canada , many languages are declining in use or are endangered due to the tragic history of assimilation policies carried out by the Canadian government . In an attempt to assimilate First Nations cultures into English society , the government discouraged and suppressed thousands of years of linguistic diversity and knowledge . One devastating assimilation strategy was the residential school system . Speaking First Nations languages at school was strictly forbidden , and students who disobeyed these rules often faced severe physical or emotional punishment . Cut off from their families , many students lost the ability to speak their First Nations languages and subsequently , were unable to pass on these skills to their children . Furthermore , even after the residential school system ended , many adult survivors were too traumatized and ashamed to speak or re-learn their language again . Some others discouraged their children from learning their ancestral language , believing that fluency in English or French would make their lives easier . As a result , generations of Aboriginal peoples are still experiencing the repercussions of language loss . As these speakers age and pass on , languages become increasingly endangered . For Aboriginal peoples living in urban areas , they face greater obstacles learning and speaking their languages because they are isolated from their communities and may lack cultural support . Language revitalization Despite this history of language loss , Aboriginal Canadians are working together to revitalize their ancestral languages by preserving the knowledge of elders and teaching a new generation of speakers . One program is the Pre-School Language Nest , a pre-school system modelled after a family home environment where children learn through natural language immersion . In British Columbia , the Ministry of Education has recognized the rights of First Nations to develop and educate their children in their traditional languages . Sixteen school districts in the province are approved to teach fourteen different First Nations languages for the B.C. Kindergarten to Grade 12 curriculum . In academia , linguists and anthropologists are recording as many mother-tongue speakers of Aboriginal languages as they can . For some people who have forgotten their language , listening to these recordings can trigger their memory and help them regain their language skills . These initiatives have bridged academic research with on-the-ground language revitalization . For example , the Squamish Nation has combined language curriculum development sessions with a Squamish speaking group for elders . Having a place where elders can be surrounded by other fluent Squamish speakers has become just as much a reason for the meetings as the curriculum development . Post-secondary institutions are also increasingly offering Aboriginal language courses to students . Furthermore , some students are finding innovative and groundbreaking ways to revitalize Aboriginal languages through their academic studies . In June 2009 , Fred Metallic , a York University Ph.D. candidate , became the first university student to write a doctoral dissertation in an Aboriginal language without an English or French translation . Over the years , the federal government and Aboriginal peoples have made significant efforts to heal and reconcile the legacy of discrimination and assimilation . For Aboriginal peoples , speaking their traditional languages is not only an expression of identity , it is also an assertion of empowerment . Mary Lou Fox , Ojibwe elder By Alice Huang .

I have Mi ` kmaq Nova Scotia - Mr. Five elderly women and a man stare ahead of them , silently searching for a word they may not have heard since they were children , when nearly everyone on this small reserve could speak the language . Ms. Noah frets the cover of an English-Delaware dictionary , which might hold a clue . But if the word for beet is n't in the book and she ca n't tease it out of the minds of the three women most likely to know , one more piece of the language could be gone forever . Alma Burgoon is 80 ; Retta Huff , 86 ; and her cousin Mattie Huff , 90 . Ms. Burgoon is still looking for the word . Suddenly there 's chuckling around the folding table as someone remembers : maxkeetkweek . The women laugh to hear such a strange-sounding word , but behind the laughter is the serious business of breathing new life into a language , word by word . Europeans gave this language the name Delaware -LRB- or Munsee Delaware -RRB- , but its advocates today are taking back the name Lunaape -LRB- or Lenape -RRB- . Its once-large territory has been reduced to a rump at Munsee-Delaware Nation -- also known as Moraviantown -- a reserve near London , Ont. , with a population of about 200 . During the 20th century , teaching Lunaape to children fell out of favour . Like dozens of First Nations languages across the country , Lunaape is in danger of disappearing within a matter of years . Canada 's indigenous languages are in a state of crisis . Those who , like Ms. Noah , would save them ca n't afford to wait . Unless the knowledge is transferred to a new generation , dozens of traditional tongues will breathe their last . By Statistics Canada 's count there are around 50 indigenous languages spoken in Canada -LRB- other organizations reach higher figures by counting certain dialects as separate languages -RRB- , and 222,210 people reported them as a mother tongue in the 2006 census . Only a handful of these languages -- principally Inuktitut , Ojibway and various dialects of Cree -- can be expected to survive without active intervention , according to linguistics experts . There is no specific point at which a language officially becomes endangered . Just finding out exactly how many speakers there are left of a language can present a challenge . If it dips below 100 speakers , Canadian censuses will -LRB- with some exceptions -RRB- lump it into a category with other tongues rather than publishing an individual number . Another source of data is U.S.-based Christian organization SIL International , which collects information on languages worldwide . British Columbia figures prominently , as the home of Bella Coola -LRB- 20 speakers left by last count in 2002 -RRB- , Haida -LRB- 55 -RRB- , Kutenai -LRB- 12 -RRB- , Sechelt -LRB- 40 -RRB- and seven others . Native languages have declined because of economic and social pressure to speak English and French . Language activists also blame assimilationist education policies ; children sent to residential schools were often punished for speaking the languages they had learned at home . Today , the 80-year-old serves as one of Ms. Noah 's teachers of Lunaape . As the community 's lone full-time language worker , Ms. Noah is on a quest to become fluent in the language before its few , frail speakers are gone . That 's my dream ... Because if I become fluent , I can make someone else fluent . Things could n't get worse . They 're going to get better . This kind of emergency rescue effort is typical of what 's going on across the country with languages on the brink of extinction . Revitalization efforts rely on modest funds . In 2005 , Amos Key Jr. co-authored a report , Towards a New Beginning , that urged the Department of Canadian Heritage to act quickly to reverse the death march of indigenous languages . One of the most dramatic options is school immersion programs like the one in place near Brantford , Ont. , on the Six Nations reserve . With a resident population of 11,297 and an 18,000-hectare territory , Six Nations of the Grand River is the largest Indian reserve in the country . The north-south roads are named after the nationalities that make up the Six Nations : Oneida , Tuscarora , Seneca , Onondaga , Mohawk and Cayuga . Yet English is the language of everyday interactions here . The 100 or so remaining fluent speakers of Cayuga represent a minority who speak a language surviving in critical but stable condition . It certainly does n't sound that way in the halls of I.L. Thomas Elementary School , a modern-looking school in the shape of a tortoise shell . More than a third of the school 's 308 kindergarten to Grade 8 students are enrolled in half - or full-day Cayuga immersion . He calmly scolds a fidgety pupil in Cayuga -- wittily , judging by the giggles of the 16 students in his class , who range from Grades 4 to 6 . Most of these students have been learning Cayuga , and nothing but Cayuga , since kindergarten . In addition to class work , the language is worked into a broader curriculum about traditional culture . Partway through the day , pupils rearrange the chairs to set up for social dances . They take turns reciting the opening declarations in rehearsed , but fluid , Cayuga . Principal Kathryn Hill concedes that some parents are wary of putting children in a system that wo n't expose them to instruction in English until Grade 7 . And she recognizes the challenge of having them continue on with the language after the immersion is over , and they are again surrounded by English . Should a full language revival prove unworkable in some communities , experts like Prof. Poser suggest there are other ways of bringing about a linguistic comeback . In the absence of formal programs , however , much language revitalization depends on grassroots efforts by advocates like Ms. Noah in Moraviantown , or Mr. Key at Six Nations . At 55 , Amos Key Jr. , director of the First Nations languages program at Six Nations ' Woodland Cultural Centre , is one of the youngest native speakers of Cayuga . Right now Mr. Key is working with York University to establish an M.A. and PhD program in indigenous thought , which will allow students to submit work in native languages . For Ms. Noah , who spends a couple days each week rounding up most of what 's left of her community 's Lunaape speakers so she can practise the language , reviving Lunaape is n't simply a matter of remembering vocabulary and syntax ; it is a mission to restore traditional culture , and thus identity . Without it , she says , Moraviantown will continue to struggle with problems like drug addiction and high secondary school dropout rates . Convincing the elders to take part took some doing at first because their generation was discouraged from speaking Lunaape . Now attitudes are changing . I think it 's kind of an honour to me that I can speak the language . They do n't want to talk about it . Ms. Noah will only be satisfied if her grandchildren speak the language every day , just as her grandparents did . Her vision for the future of the Delaware Nation is not so different from Alma Burgoon 's childhood memories -- the same memories that must be plumbed for information if Lunaape is to survive . I realize in those aread that you expressed , yes there is a huge asian population many who do not know english . But when an 50 year old man and women need to make a living to support their family after running away from their homeland for many untold reasons , I do n't think they have the luxary on attending school to learn english . So instead of spewing hate just move to the states and enjoy all the english you can hear COMMENT : I take hope from the example of modern Hebrew - a language that was revived after being lost for hundreds of years . COMMENT : It 's a sad day when Canada can spend millions of dollars to build a Human Rights Museum and yet our Native People live in poverty .
