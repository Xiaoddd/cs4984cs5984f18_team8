Trump has already withdrawn the United States from the Paris climate change agreement , rescinded the Clean Power Plan , reversed a moratorium on leasing federal lands for coal mining and proposed deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency . On Tuesday , the EPA announced new plans to roll back an Obama administration policy that environmentalists say will remove drinking water safeguards for one in three Americans and threaten thousands of streams that flow into large rivers and lakes , as well as wetland areas that filter pollutants and absorb floodwaters . AMY GOODMAN : Now The Intercept has revealed the person that President Trump has tapped to head the EPA agency in charge of water safety is a former lobbyist with deep ties to a fossil fuel advocacy group that promotes the Dakota Access pipeline and offshore drilling . This includes studying the toxic effects of fracking on groundwater safety , the downstream consequences of industrial pollutants , and the environmental impacts of oil spills . For more , we go to San Francisco . LEE FANG : Amy and Nermeen , thank you so much for having me . The latest political appointee in the Trump administration , as you mentioned , is Dennis Lee Forsgren . And this is a potentially problematic political appointee , because this person comes directly from a fossil fuel lobbying firm , HBW Resources , that is kind of infamous for cloak-and-dagger tactics . They were very prominent in the fight over the Keystone XL pipeline and , more recently , on the Dakota Access pipeline . They operate a kind of fake consumer group . This is the Consumer Energy Alliance , purportedly , you know , an organization that represents mom-and-pop energy users . But , in fact , this is an organization fully controlled by these fossil fuel lobbyists , funded by large oil and gas companies , oil refineries , that goes out and kind of misrepresents itself to influence the public debate around these oil and gas issues . Another example is the fight over Arctic drilling . You know , when Shell Oil was pushing to drill in a very sensitive area of the environment near Alaska , there was a letter-writing campaign to kind of convince regulators to give them approval . And HBW and CEA helped facilitate a lot of these letters . One of these letters supposedly came from an onion farmer group . But we looked at these letters , and they were essentially copied and pasted from language provided by these lobbyists . They kind of specialize in these type of astroturf or fake grassroots strategies . And on the Dakota Access pipeline , you know , these same lobbyists were involved in setting up events and going up to Standing Rock and being quoted in the media . NERMEEN SHAIKH : Well , I want to read a statement by Consumer Energy Alliance President David Holt in October 2016 during the protests by waterkeepers against the Dakota Access pipeline . LEE FANG : Right . And , you know , the quote that you just read is kind of a typical strategy . They place advertisements , they write letters to the editor , they hold rallies and kind of organize opposition to actual social movements and to grassroots groups . So , you know , they control this fake consumer group . They go out , and they use these kind of aggressive tactics to diminish the work of social movements . LEE FANG : Well , the Waters of the United States rule is a major achievement by the Obama administration . It extends Clean Water Act protections . You know , this law originally applied only to large bodies of water like the Chesapeake Bay . But the regulation in 2015 extended these protections to wetlands and streams , bodies of water that feed into larger bodies like the Chesapeake Bay . And this has been bitterly opposed by lobbyists . We see big agribusiness and industrial polluters lobbying very aggressively against this rule . You know , back when there was the debt ceiling fight , the government shutdown fight , lobbyists attempted to attach budget riders to repeal this rule , and they were unsuccessful . The Office of Water in the EPA will be managing that process . And , you know , the EPA , under the Trump administration , is a perfect example of industry capture . You know , the legal affairs office is now staffed by Trump administration appointees from the utility industry . We see a coal lobbyist as the number two appointee . Just this week we saw another oil and gas lobbyist from the American Petroleum Institute appointed to another legal affairs office of the EPA . So , as the EPA moves to repeal these environmental safeguards , you literally have oil and gas lobbyists , who have spent the last , you know , three to four years fighting this regulation , now in charge of repealing it . LEE FANG : No , he does not . And the EPA has been pushing through a lot of deputy roles that do not require Senate confirmation .
