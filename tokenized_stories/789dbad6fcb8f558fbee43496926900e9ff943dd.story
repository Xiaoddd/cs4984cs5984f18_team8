Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of CREDO activists who stood with our indigenous and climate movement allies in North Dakota , we temporarily blocked construction of the Dakota Access pipeline , but our fight to stop the pipeline once and for all is not yet over . But we have the collective financial power as consumers and account holders to stop the pipeline . We must call on these banks to divest from this massive project immediately before Trump can approve the construction of the pipeline . Tell the 17 DAPL banks : Stop financing the Dakota Access Pipeline . As of Jan. 1 , ETP has effectively failed to meet its contractual obligations to deliver oil through the Dakota Access pipeline . Coupled with declining global oil prices , massive public pressure on the banks financing construction of the pipeline could create a public relations nightmare that persuades the banks to end their investments in the pipeline . By staying invested in these projects , these 17 banks are tacitly waging a coordinated campaign to destroy sacred Native lands and silence peaceful protest . This could be our last shot at stopping the Dakota Access pipeline before Donald Trump takes office on January 20 . We stood with the water protectors and our allies in the climate justice movement to put a halt to the pipeline once before , and we must stand with them again to shut this project down for good . Tell the 17 DAPL banks : Stop financing the Dakota Access pipeline . Thanks for all you do .
