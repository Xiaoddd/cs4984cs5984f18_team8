Mercury meets with Saturn in Sagittarius today . Our perception of the world depends largely on how much and how little we know . What we each think and believe depends largely on the information society has handed to us . We are all shaped by the people around us , and whatever location and culture we are born into in the world . If you were born in another place and time , your life , your thoughts , your beliefs all would be very different . Imagine if we were not given the information , the learning , the perspectives that have developed and accumulated over thousands of years . If we started from scratch , with no language , no beliefs , no rules , no thoughts or ideas about the world provided for us , and began life as a blank slate with no external input on what to think about reality , our lives would be closer to that of wild monkeys than who we know ourselves to be today . Consider how much civilization has changed in the past 100 years alone and how that has changed who we are . The life we live today is as it is because of what our ancestors learned , believed and taught to each generation , building over time throughout history . Yesterday , I talked about the importance of expanding our worldview , and to expose ourselves to more information so our perceptions of reality grows . Now , with Mercury meeting Saturn , it is a good time to consider how limited we are . Take facebook for example . The information provided to you is largely passive . As you scroll down the page , you see things other people have posted . It is not information you are actively curious about seeking . It is merely random information others have chosen to provide to you . They have all kinds of reasons for deciding how information is displayed to you - mostly to benefit their bottom line of course . Well , yesterday I read that Facebook will be implementing censorship algorithms so that the Chinese government will allow facebook to expand in China . In other words , Facebook , a corporation , is agreeing to censor people from sharing information so that it can go into China to make money advertising . But what struck me as most interesting is that I did not see any articles listed on google news , which draws on mainstream news sites , about the pipeline whatsoever , unless I did a search . The story was basically buried by other news , as if it is not very important . These are the types of things that Jupiter in Libra is bringing our attention to , truth , justice , fairness , equality , balance , particularly in the media . On a personal level , this is a time to ask yourself how your own limited perspective , is holding you back from experiencing the greater potential of your own life . Putting in the effort to seek more information that matters will open you up to a whole other reality . Intentionally choosing what you want to focus on today is rewarding .
