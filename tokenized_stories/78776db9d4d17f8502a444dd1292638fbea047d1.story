CAROLINE GRUESKIN Bismarck Tribune Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save A Dakota Access Pipeline protester accused of endangering a police plane with his drone was found innocent of all charges on Thursday . At the conclusion of a one-day bench trial , Judge Allan Schmalenberger determined that Aaron Shawn Turgeon , also known as Prolific the Rapper , did not put the pilot of the surveillance plane or the protesters below at substantial risk of bodily injury under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life . Turgeon was charged with felony and misdemeanor reckless endangerment and physical obstruction of a government function . Morton County Assistant State 's Attorneys Gabrielle Goter and Brian Grosinger argued that Turgeon endangered the pilot and crowd of people protesting at a construction site on Morton County Road 135 by flying his drone on Sep. 6 . They also alleged he did not cooperate with law enforcement . North Dakota Highway Patrol Sgt. Shannon Henke testified that the drone could have fallen from the sky and injured a protester . He also said he saw Turgeon 's drone shoot up around the same time a fixed-wing aircraft flown by a highway patrolman came into view . Concerned that the drone could crash into the plane , he walked from the road into the main protest area to tell Turgeon to take down the 3-pound Phantom 4 drone . He said that a pilot several years ago was injured when a duck flew through the window . He approached Turgeon , who pulled down the drone , and then Henke tried to seize the drone as evidence . He told Turgeon that regulations do not permit him to fly the drone under 500 feet over a crowd , cell phone footage provided by the defense showed . Henke later conceded he was wrong , and that is not the rule . The charges and report were submitted to the FAA in support of a request for a no-fly zone over Cannon Ball , which took effect shortly after . Turgeon , who was represented by Erica Shively and Doug Parr , testified that he was flying the drone to film the protest . He said he was conscious of the plane 's position and made sure to stay out of its way . He only elevated the drone once he saw the plane was turning away , he testified . Protesters held up their fists when the drone went by , indicating they wanted to be filmed , he said . Turgeon testified that the drone always stayed under 400 feet , which is the default setting on the device . The plane stayed above 500 feet , according to pilot and Trooper Dennis Gallagher . The defendant was also charged with not obeying law enforcement . But cell phone video indicated Henke never gave a direct order for Turgeon to meet him at the road or provide registration . He asked for Turgeon 's name at the road , which he did not give . The judge determined the defendant was cooperative by meeting the trooper at the road and was not required to give his name or the drone , as he was not under arrest . Myron Dewey , who frequently flew a drone for his page Digital Smoke Signals and attended the trial , said filming with drones was a valuable tool during the demonstrations , allowing the activists to record their own protests , as well as the movements and responses of law enforcement . This can be removed when origin is fixed . Trigger the set to pull in again .
