Past that , a woman sat on top of a 50ft pole . The platform on which she sat was about the size of a bathtub . Her final three days in the trees were spent without food . Photograph : Garrett MacLean for the Guardian There are others , too , who remain in the forest and are still blocking construction by putting their lives on the line and refusing to move . On the far side of the mountain sits a man in a perch dangling from a tree . A bald gash of clearcut , about as wide as a truck is long , runs through the forest , up the mountain , and stops just at the tree from which he hangs . A handful of folks have also taken to the trees in a place called Little Teel Crossing , and just this Monday , a woman named Fern MacDougal made her new home in another aerial blockade on Peters Mountain . A mother and daughter team , nicknamed Red and Minor respectively , came down from the trees after more than 30 days , on property that has been in their family for more than seven generations . Facebook Twitter Pinterest Red and Minor , mother and daughter pipeline protesters , stand in front of Bottom Creek . But they also say this is about more than just a pipeline , built by Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC . It is , they say , also about the erosion of democracy and the natural world by money and the hunger for it . They see this pipeline as one more physical manifestation of the loss of personal agency in the face of an impersonal and uncaring government . The Appalachian plateau makes you believe it . Facebook Twitter Pinterest At dusk , the Appalachian Mountains extend into the distance . Red works as a forklift driver and Minor is a bookkeeper for a small business . Both of their employers bent the rules so they could take to the trees and keep their jobs . Red spent 33 consecutive days suspended on a 4x8 sheet of plywood between an oak and a maple , and Minor 34 hanging from a single oak . Both list the steps they and others have taken to fight it : the comment periods unheeded , the independent environmental and archeological studies snubbed , the court challenges lost , the demonstrations ignored , the politicians petitioned and rebuffed . None of these actions worked . And so they say they have to resort to non-violent civil disobedience to overcome what they see as a rigged system . The two Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioners who voted to approve the pipeline were appointed by Donald Trump , who has taken millions from energy companies , including NextEra donating a quarter-million dollars to his inauguration . Activists also note the dozens of spills already happening each year ; what they see as the arrogance of clearcutting trees before all permits along the route are secured . And while pipeline construction is said to bring economic benefit to the state , a common refrain among residents remains that license plates of pipeline trucks read Utah and Texas and Oklahoma . They add that this is all happening on land stolen from Native Americans during the European-American genocide of the race in the first place . Facebook Twitter Pinterest Friends and supporters gathered at the Mountain Mama festival to raise funds to help Red pay the fines levied again her for her tree sit protest . The water was cool and sweet and clean . Photograph : Garrett MacLean for the Guardian Tree sits are often most closely associated with the environmental activism of the 1980s and 1990s opposing the clearcutting of old-growth forest in the American west . Activists often try to make the process of extraction as difficult as possible . If any of the wires had been disturbed , she could have come crashing to the ground and died . There are two reasons protesters like her often use nicknames and wear a balaclava to hide their faces . Crucial to the tree sits are the support camps that surround them . On Peters Mountain there are two , one on each side of the state line , populated by a roving cast of supporters , mostly women , who by now almost live in semi-permanent camps in the Jefferson and Washington national forest . On the Virginia side the hike in from the road takes at least an hour each way over gnarly terrain , a path activists blazed parallel to a public road , now closed by the US Forest Service police . There was a strange standoff between the support camp and the police across the boundary just a few yards away . The police antagonized the supporters with bright lights and generators and near daily pounds through the camp to count heads and tents and ask questions . One night , three supporters crossed the line and attempted to resupply Nutty and were all arrested . Facebook Twitter Pinterest Throughout the night , law enforcement officers run generators and shine spotlights directly into the support camp of the monopod protester . He was echoed by a man calling himself Ink atop the trees at Little Teel Crossing , south-east of where Deckard hangs . He had been up in the trees a week , and police have only just set up their blockade . He will not get any more food aside from what he has with him until he touches ground . Along with the others now in the air , he stocked for a long , drawn out fight and has a long way to go . Photograph : Garrett MacLean for the Guardian Yet activists say they have already come so far . At the West Virginia Mine Wars Museum , board member Wilma Steele explained the story of the largest armed insurrection in the US since the civil war , an early fight for unionization where scores of workers were killed by private security guards supported by the US government , which ultimately bombed its own citizens . It all happened just under 100 years ago in the very region where people now sit in the trees . The miners were largely defeated in their immediate goals , but laid the groundwork for one of the largest unionization movements in the world . They are steeped in their history and know something needs to be done . This is their future . This is their world .
