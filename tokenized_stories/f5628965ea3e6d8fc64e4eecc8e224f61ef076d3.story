The thousands descending on the National Mall , on the first Earth Day under a regime that has taken a sharp knife to government science budgets , study stars and butterflies , barrier reefs and hedgehog reproduction , viruses and bird flight patterns . Most days , they make and test their hypotheses in laboratories or perhaps in the Arctic Circle or the Australian Outback , in an anti-gravity chamber or a deciduous forest . But on this rainy April Saturday , they have come together in Washington , D.C , to make a point that feels more urgent than ever : Science matters , and we ignore its findings at our peril . Michael Mann -LRB- shown above -RRB- , a climatologist and geophysicist , has pioneered computational models based on patterns of the past 600 years of climate changes . And he was one of the lead authors of the 2001 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report , which helped establish the scientific consensus about the global phenomenon . He should know . Mann is one of the favorite targets of climate deniers , as evidenced most recently by a hearing of the House Committee on Science , Space and Technology at which he was the only witness representing the mainstream view that climate change is the result of human activity . Mary Droser at Lincoln Park in Washington , D.C. , on Friday April 21 , 2017 . Having studied the rise and fall of past species can make our current crisis particularly scary . Still , she considers herself an optimist . David Guggenheim in Washington , D.C. , on Friday , April 21 , 2017 . Since 1970 , the Caribbean has lost about 50 percent of its reefs . For the past 17 years , Guggenheim has been working in Cuba , which has some of the healthiest coral reefs left in the Caribbean . The problem is the voice of science is not being heard .

Theorists used to speculate that morality emerged in adolescence . But Killen and her team showed that a sense of right and wrong begins to form in children who are as young as 3 , 4 , and 5 . Asked to divide supplies between two schools that have unequal resources , for instance , children will often choose to give a larger share to that the one with less . Killen is marching to stand up for continued support for basic science . Jessica Ware at the National Mall in Washington , D.C. , on Friday April 21 , 2017 .

Her work focuses on dragonflies , which were the first creatures to fly on earth and are also among the fastest of the animals responding to climate change . She is marching , in part , to highlight the importance of evolution . Vandermeer and his wife , Ivette Perfecto , have worked together for 37 years , using ecological principles to improve agriculture . For much of that time , they have focused on coffee production in Puerto Rico . They have also established a coffee plantation in Chiapas , Mexico , where they research interactions among pests and their natural enemies . Agriculture is a major cause of both climate change and species extinctions . But Vandermeer and Perfecto have been studying more sustainable ways of growing , focusing on natural systems that control pests without pesticides . For Perfecto , the march is about more than science . Robin Wall Kimmerer , outside her hotel in Rockville , Md. , on Friday April 21 , 2017 . A member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation , Kimmerer has also worked to integrate indigenous knowledge with Western science . She combined the two in an effort to restore the sweetgrass plant , which had been disappearing from its native habitats throughout the Northeast several years ago . She is marching in part to bring such indigenous views into the mainstream of science .
