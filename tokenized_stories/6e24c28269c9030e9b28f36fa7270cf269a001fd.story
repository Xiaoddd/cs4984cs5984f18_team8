Officials tried to block vital supplies from reaching protesters at Dakota Access Pipeline Monday , December 05 , 2016 by : Vicki Batts Tags : DAPL . Government officials had warned of a possible physical blockade to deny the entry of much-needed supplies , but reports indicate that they have since backed down from that game plan . Fortunately , officials seem to have realized that this initial plan was rather extreme and inhumane . Now , instead of creating a physical barrier to deny the activists what they need to survive the harsh North Dakota winter , it appears that law enforcement will be levying hefty fines against anyone caught delivering supplies to the water protectors .

Cecily Fong , a spokeswoman for the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services , says that the fines should , at the very least , serve as a hindrance . Fong notes that the fines will , ideally , effectively block the delivery of supplies , without the need for a physical barrier . The evacuation order was ostensibly issued because of harsh winter conditions that were expected in North Dakota . Wind gusts of up to 45 mph and snow were predicted to follow shortly after the notice was given . Interestingly enough , the freezing conditions did not prevent law enforcement from using water cannons against the protestors on November 21st , just the week before the executive order was issued . A spokesperson for the governor has said that Dalrymple had no intention of blocking the delivery of food and other supplies to protestors . Since the protests began , law enforcement and the water protectors have been butting heads . Activists have reported that excessive force is being used by the government , and lawsuits have even been filed . According to the water protectors , no orders to disperse or other warnings were given before the weaponry was launched . However , law enforcement says that orders to disperse were indeed given . Herr says that law enforcement officers were justified in using the water cannons , given the threat being posed by the protestors .
