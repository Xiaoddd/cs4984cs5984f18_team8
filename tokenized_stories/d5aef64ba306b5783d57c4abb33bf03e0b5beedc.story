But North Dakota lawmakers are now planning to radically constrict the right of DAPL opponents , including veterans , to demonstrate against the project . And there is a fifth bill that could put demonstrators in physical danger . Doing so can result in a misdemeanor charge . None of the bills mention Standing Rock explicitly , but each of the proposed penalties would impact protesters who have gathered en masse along the pipeline route , part of which includes private farm land . Members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their allies , who have already been prosecuted for their participation in DAPL protests , will have an even larger target on their backs should the legislation pass . More than 550 people are awaiting trial for Standing Rock protests that happened last year .
