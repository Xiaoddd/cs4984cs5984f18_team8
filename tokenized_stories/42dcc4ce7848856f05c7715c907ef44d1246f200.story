Barack Obama has ordered an inquiry into covert Russian intervention in the campaign , which the CIA says was designed to secure a victory for Donald Trump . But whether or not Russian intervention made a significant difference to the outcome , a Tillerson appointment would represent a significant gain for Moscow . He must be confirmed by the Senate . While the other leading candidates for the job held largely traditional and adversarial views on Russia , the outgoing chief executive of Exxon Mobil has a history of close business ties to Putin , who bestowed the Order of Friendship on Tillerson in 2013 . Tillerson is also friends with the head of Rosneft , Igor Sechin , a former interpreter who worked as chief of staff for Putin when he was deputy mayor in St Petersburg in the mid-1990s . Sechin , sometimes described as the second-most-powerful man in Russia , is now under US sanctions . The 2011 Exxon-Rosneft agreement was frozen when sanctions were imposed on Russia in 2014 , following the annexation of Crimea and covert military intervention in eastern Ukraine . In June , two years after sanctions were imposed and in an apparent show of support for Sechin , Tillerson reportedly turned up at a St Petersburg economic summit . He would most likely have to divest himself of stock by the time he entered the office on the seventh floor of the state department . It might be harder to divorce his judgments entirely from the oil company where he spent his career . Exxon Mobil is bigger economically than many countries . It has its own foreign policy and its own contracted security forces . As a state , it has much in common with the one run by Putin and Sechin . Running the state department would not be like running Exxon Mobil , however . For a start , Tillerson would have to audition in front of a sceptical Senate . Even before Trump announced his decision on Tuesday , leading Democrats were painting Tillerson as a Moscow stooge . He would face aggressive questioning from Republican foreign policy hawks , led by John McCain . Even if Tillerson would not take over the state department with a free hand to rewrite policy . That is a change that would be undoubtedly be welcomed by Putin , whose vision of foreign policy centres on spheres of interest controlled by global powers , run by strongmen like himself . Australian chosen by Trump once called president-elect a ` marketer of fantasy ' Read more Andrei Kozyrev , a former Russian foreign minister , argued that the Kremlin should be careful what it wishes for .
