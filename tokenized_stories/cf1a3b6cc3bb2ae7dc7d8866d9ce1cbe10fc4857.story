With Treetop Protest , 61-Year-Old Red Terry Leads Fight Against Mountain Valley Pipeline By Michael Sainato In Virginia and West Virginia , residents and activists are battling natural gas companies over a natural gas pipeline currently being constructed . The Mountain Valley Pipeline will extend 303 miles from northwestern West Virginia to southern Virginia , with a recently proposed 70 mile extension into North Carolina . The project is being funded and operated by Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC , owned by EQT Midstream Partners , LP ; NextEra US Gas Assets , LLC ; Con Edison Transmission , Inc. ; WGL Midstream ; and RGC Midstream , LLC . The Federal Energy Reserve Commission approved the pipeline in October 2017 with a 2-1 vote , with two seats on the commission vacant . The only dissenting vote was cast by Cheryl LaFleur , who cited environmental concerns and skepticism over the pipeline 's necessity as influential factors on her vote against its approval . In February , a federal court denied a request to delay the pipeline 's construction filed by Appalachian Voices and five other conservation organizations . Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC is currently clearing forest along the Appalachian Trail and in Jefferson National Forest for the pipeline construction . According to FERC , Mountain Valley Pipeline has until May 31 to complete tree cutting . Pipeline opponents claim the pipeline 's construction will negatively impact the scenery and pose various environmental risks in the Appalachian region . The trail took a 22 mile detour just to get on top of Peters Mountain and get the iconic view across West Virginia . Johnson noted that pipeline surveyors visited the property on his family farm , and he has dealt with them since surveying began in early 2015 . On his Facebook account , Johnson has posted several photos of sediment barriers set up by Mountain Valley Pipeline being breached to prevent erosion , just one of the several risks to water quality in the area posed by the pipeline . Johnson also expressed concern for Bentley 's coral root , a plant listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature , only found in a few areas of Virginia and West Virginia , as one of the species at risk from the pipeline 's construction . The Mountain Valley Pipeline has sued several hundred landowners in West Virginia and Virginia to invoke eminent domain to allow it to cut trees and run the pipeline through their properties . Some landowners and pipeline opponents have resorted to conducting tree sit-ins , building treehouses in trees on their own property to prevent the Mountain Valley Pipeline from clearing their land . She cried all day . Nobody should have the right to eminent domain for something that is not going to help people . Neighbors , friends , family and activists have helped assist Red in her tree sit-in . Despite her continued protest , she said that Mountain Valley Pipeline cut down several trees on her property and have pressured her to come down , including allegedly blackmailing her sister with artifacts found on her property in exchange for Red leaving the tree . Last Thursday , police formally pressed charges against Red Terry and her daughter ; trespassing , obstruction of justice and interfering with property rights . The charges have now created a stand-off , as Red and her daughter will be arrested as soon as they descend from their trees . But their fight has become a rallying call among other pipeline opponents in the area . On Peters Mountain , along the West Virginia and Virginia border , activists and local residents have organized other tree sit-ins , including setting up a monopod tower to try to block an access road to the pipeline construction . The identity of this tree sitter is being kept anonymous to prevent legal action against them . The U.S. Department of Agricultural Forest Service shut down the road and the area around the monopod from the public , only permitting Mountain Valley Pipeline services access . The monopod organizers have accused the U.S. Forest Service of preventing supplies , water and food from being brought to the protesters . The U.S. Forest Service did not respond to a request for comment . On March 20 , Monroe County Circuit Court Judge Robert Irons denied an injunction filed by the Mountain Valley Pipeline against protesters to have them removed , permitting the tree sit-ins to continue . Pipeline opponents have pointed out the powerful political influence the Mountain Valley Pipeline companies have on elected officials in West Virginia and Virginia . The companies invested in Mountain Valley Pipeline have significantly backed both Republicans and Democrats . Opposition to the pipeline has started to draw some support from elected officials . On April 16 , 11 Virginia House delegates , including Lee Carter , a Democratic Socialist who unseated one of the state 's top Republicans in a November 2017 election , signed onto a letter of support for peaceful protesters against the Mountain Valley Pipeline . As elected officials begin to support efforts to stop the Mountain Valley Pipeline , conservation organizations are still pursuing litigation to halt construction . There are currently four separate cases in litigation being represented by attorneys for Appalachian Mountain Advocates and other conservation organizations . One challenging the state of Virginia 's clean water act 401 certification of the pipeline and one challenging the the actions of the U.S. Forest Service to grant a right of way through Jefferson National Forest are scheduled to be heard on May 8 .

The scorecard shows that 140 House members voted against chemical safeguards every time , while 149 members consistently voted for chemical safety protections . However , the action fund praised the lawmakers that bucked their party to vote for chemical safety , including Reps. voted for funding chemical reviews and against a farm bill that included pesticide safety loopholes . Florida Reps. A Preview of the People , Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule , two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Updated and reissued every five years , these guidelines are the nation 's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations . supply . These nominees will be well-known in their fields , and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers , academics and practitioners . part of the process is happening in real time . what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors . Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff , and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally . Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries . And here 's the first place you 'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition : rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected , USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first , soliciting public comments in the process . In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts , it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance . And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious . After the committee is announced in early 2019 , it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report . all appearances , the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs . though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable , plant-based diets have been all but stymied , there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle . Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance , including the meat industry , dairy industry , and sugar-sweetened beverage associations , as well as formula companies , which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers . -LRB- This may be happening in real-time , too . Exposure can be caused by contact , ingestion or inhalation . Short-term health effects can range from skin irritation and numbness to fever and headaches . Long-term exposure can lead to cancer , liver failure and sperm damage . is traditionally called blue-green algae is actually a class of microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria . Cyanobacteria can be toxic and can also produce various types of cyanotoxins that have different hazards . With their small , developing bodies , children are especially endangered by algae exposure . was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption . But it probably wo n't be the last , especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year . Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets . If you believe your pet may have been exposed , be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy , seizures , diarrhea or vomiting . And as climate change gets worse , the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks , creating a toxic feedback loop . The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish . Communities that struggle with regular , serious toxic algae outbreaks , like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie , can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation . The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth . The women were all non-smokers , had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies . Macrophages , which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body , protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles , such as bacteria and pollution particles . The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants . That 's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA 's Office of Inspector General -LRB- OIG -RRB- , the agency 's internal watchdog . EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement , and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was required to respond to the April 2017 petition within 90 days , but nearly 17 months have passed with no finding . more than 97,000 giraffes remain in the wild , and the species is gravely imperiled by habitat loss , civil unrest , hunting for meat and the international trade in bone carvings , skins and trophies .

But so , under this definition , are multi-thousand-acre corporate entities using automated machinery to grow genetically engineered corn . Size of the farm is not a factor ; neither is the style of agriculture . A family farm may not even have a family that owns or works the land . issue with such a broad definition of family farming is primarily in the discourse . Aid is divvied up by revenue among family farmers , with additional programs going to some specialized farmers , like young or beginning farmers , organic farmers , and sustainable farmers .
