The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America -LRB- PhRMA -RRB- engaged in the customary DC practices of big campaign contributions , lobbying and actually writing passages of the Medicare Part D legislation . They were able to get Congress to prohibit Medicare from negotiating a lower price for the cost of drugs . This meant that seniors were subject to excessive co-pays , because their chosen private insurance providers for Part D were not getting government-negotiated discounts . Insurance companies were also given permission to leave many drugs off their formularies -LRB- lists of covered drugs -RRB- and to price medications by tiers . One report found that Part D pays 80 percent more for medicines than the VHA and 73 percent more than Medicaid . Now , they are back -LRB- not that they ever really went away -RRB- to push another bill that will enrich their bottom line while increasing consumer prices . The bill is bipartisan , but it enjoys backing from pharmaceutical groups and has seen more than 1,455 lobbyists , according to Kaiser Health News . Sen. Elizabeth Warren -LRB- D-Massachusetts -RRB- , however , has a less sanguine perspective on the 21st Century Cures Act . Covers up bribery : Currently , drug companies have to disclose the buckets of money , gifts , giveaways , and free trips they give doctors and hospitals as kickbacks to use certain drugs . Now that donor is collecting on his investment . The Cures bill creates a special deal so people can sell these treatments without meeting the FDA gold standards for protecting patient safety , undermining the integrity of the FDA and the safety of untold numbers of desperate patients . One of the big cash giveaways in the bill involves extending patent life to delay the availability of lower-priced generic drugs . The consequences of this legislation are sobering : More than ever , Big Pharma is in the business of being more interested in enhancing profits than in improving public health .
