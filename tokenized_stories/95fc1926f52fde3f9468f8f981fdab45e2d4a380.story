Plans have come and , sometimes , gone . Story continues below Get Rid of Ads Provincial governments that should be good neighbours and political allies seem like anything but these days . In its view , B.C. is violating Canadian law in obstructing a federally approved plan . Details on its perspective , and calls to action for Albertans , are on its Keep Canada Working web page . The pipeline itself is a big piece but only one piece of the puzzle here . Pipelines might be safer and more efficient than other overland transportation options . That does not mean that an expanded pipeline running through an active earthquake zone would not leak . In fact , from its beginnings in 1961 to early 2017 , the existing Trans Mountain pipeline had 56 reportable spills , at least 21 of which exceeded 100 barrels . The heightened risks accompanying an expanded pipeline would not end at the pipeline terminus . Beyond the pipeline are the ships that would transport diluted bitumen from Burnaby to be refined elsewhere before becoming available to consumers . Expanding the Trans Mountain pipeline would mean increasing the number and size of ships entering and moving across B.C. coastal waters . Those factors make transit tricky , potential damage extensive and unpredictable , and a post-spill cleanup of bitumen all but impossible . Those jobs are based in the energy sector across Canada , with only a portion of them in Alberta . These sectors are especially vulnerable to damage caused by leaks or spills . That explains why First Nations and other communities alongside river and ocean waters are so opposed to this project . In B.C. , fishing involves more than commercial fisheries . It is connected as well to tourism , recreation and Indigenous cultures . Good jobs are important for all people , working in all places and sectors . Furthermore , not all people are workers . People are more than their jobs , and there is more at stake here than jobs . Even if First Nations whose territories would be crossed by the expanded pipeline have signed onto the project , that does not mean that other Nations do not have a legitimate say in decision-making . Indigenous opposition to this proposal involves leaders of several First Nations whose territories , cultural practices and well-being are threatened by this project . Granted , a number of First Nations support the project , but leaders of other Nations that would face particularly high risks have laid out their case against it . Their response involves both government-to-government action and social activism . In my scholarship on critical consumption that recognizes the costs and dangers of unbridled consumerism , I recognize social movements as sources of important learning for citizens , whether activists or spectators . As another Indigenous scholar , Roxanne Ornelas , points out , Canada was a late signatory to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . Harms reconciliation efforts Premier Notley can downplay or disregard social activism but , in identifying the governments involved in this issue , any analysis needs to include First Nations governments . Overlooking their role flies in the face of reconciliation between Indigenous and settler peoples , supposedly a top priority for all levels of government and all Canadians . The Alberta government has gone so far as to intervene in opposition to the court case launched by seven First Nations , as well as environmental organizations and some B.C. municipalities . In her statements , Notley routinely ignores the fact that she is opposing those First Nations governments . This article was originally published at The Conversation .
