champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in 2011 . Last year a big American oil company felt bad because it was getting picked on by anti-fracking activists who were hurling insults on Twitter . The oil company wanted to do something , anything , to stop those misguided fracktivists who were only propagating long disproven fracking propaganda . But first the oil company had to figure out how to work this Twitter thing . They noticed that some tweets spread virally , get retweeted all over the place . While other tweets saying pretty much the same thing just fall flat . But that was kind of a bad idea . Before engaging with its Twitter enemies the big oil company was smart enough to reach out to IBM for advice . Some questions do n't require supercomputers to answer . Welch 's team suggested to the oil company that it not get too hasty about defending itself on Twitter . Instead , have Watson analyze the problem . then surely it can figure out how to cope with those anti-fracking dopes .

Leave it to IBM to use artificial intelligence to reverse-engineer authenticity . Welch explains that the supercomputer has become adept at parsing Twitter , thanks to a project begun five years ago . Bad handwriting aside , these patient records are a challenge for normal brains to make sense of because of all the jargon and abbreviations . Maternal great-grandmother . The supercomputer teases out meaning and significance by looking at the context in which words are placed . IBM previously helped the Florida State Police scour Twitter to identify new nicknames for illegal drugs . Part of the challenge was that new names cycled in and out of usage so quickly that their half-life on Twitter was just a week . To teach Watson how to identify drug tweets out of the millions of non-drug tweets , IBM starts by feeding Watson tweets that definitely contain drug names . The computer looks at the words used with those names , in tandem with those names , and catalogs them . Eventually IBM could hook up Watson to one of the commercially available feeds that enable the supercomputer to drink from the Twitter firehose in its entirety . Watson scans for words common to drug tweets , then looks to see if the words are arranged in ways common to drug tweets . When it finds tweets meeting those criteria , voila , it deduces that the unfamiliar new word sitting where a drug nickname usually goes must be a new drug nickname . Rather , the idea behind the drug tweets program was to show that Watson can monitor and take note of minute changes in the Twitter language commonly used by people tweeting about a particular interest group . In order to talk to the anti-frackers over Twitter , the oil company needed to understand what language they were speaking . Welch says that when his team set out to monitor the Twitter rantings of anti-fracking groups , they knew that they wanted to find the most creative and inspirational tweets . To that end , IBM gave Watson a dictionary of keywords to start with , things like fracking , tarsands , poison , water , pollution , evil , shale , gas , fracked . Then they fed Watson 40 million retweets to ponder . They use retweets because an original tweet must have contained something resonant if it inspired someone else to retweet it . Watson filtered out all the retweets that contained one of the keywords , then it catalogued all the other words appearing in those retweets . It logged how often those words are used and in what contexts and patterns . A word found to resonate more with re-tweeters earns a higher ringscore . A tweet composed of high-ringscore words by definition is one that gets retweeted more widely than one with low-ringscore words . The former of course . Sometimes the duration of a high-ringscore word is far shorter . Movie premiers and trailers get a lot of exposure on Twitter . A client asked IBM to look at tweets surrounding the premier of Godzilla . And Watson can help the company craft its tweets , reflecting its own point of view , using high ringscore words most likely to resonate with the anti-fracking crowd . But if your company has tens of thousands of dollars a month to spare , you can try it out yourself . Welch says that Watson now provides the oil company client with an early warning of new attacks launched by anti-fracking forces . Like the time when chefs in San Francisco started a Twitter thread about how beef from Pennsylvania was tainted because the cattle grazing near drilling sites targeting the Marcellus shale had been drinking water polluted by fracking flowback water . IBM says the company quickly funded a UC Berkeley professor to do a study debunking the assertion , and the controversy quickly died out . It turned out to be a campaign that had been coordinated on Facebook , then executed on Twitter . The rest of us will just have to try to be as clever as we can be with our tweets . Observation changes the observed . Too much observation , whether noticeable by users or not , could drive people away from Twitter to new , less public , forums . Alternatively , think of how much better Twitter might be if users were a little more creative and eloquent in their tweets . To that end , Welch shared a bit of Twitter wisdom we should all remember . Since joining Forbes in 1999 I 've written more than 100 magazine stories , including features on the likes of T.

Movie premiers and trailers get a lot of exposure on Twitter . A client asked IBM to look at tweets surrounding the premier of Godzilla . & a ; ldquo ; In looking at Godzilla tweets , they found & a ; lsquo ; dope as shit & a ; rsquo ; was the number on positive-sentiment phrase .

The oil company now employs Watson & a ; rsquo ; s Twitter editor not just for tweets sent out via its own corporate account , but also from accounts that are not obviously associated with the oil company . Unfortunately IBM so far hasn & a ; rsquo ; t been willing to share any specific before-and-after tweets improved by the editor . Like the time when chefs in San Francisco started a Twitter thread about how beef from Pennsylvania was tainted because the cattle grazing near drilling sites targeting the Marcellus shale had been drinking water polluted by fracking flowback water . The company started seeing lots of similar anti-oil tweets coming in , but they couldn & a ; rsquo ; t tell where the campaign came from because there were no signs on Twitter that it had been coordinated . course , IBM would be happy to share Watson & a ; rsquo ; s Twitter editor with any clients who can afford it . The rest of us will just have to try to be as clever as we can be with our tweets . It & a ; rsquo ; s inevitable that Twitterati will change the way they tweet if they know that Big Blue and its supercomputer are watching and dissecting their every tweet .
