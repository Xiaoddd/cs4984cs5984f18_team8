Spring comes a little earlier here than in South Dakota and Montana . The 2ft deep snow drifts that had blanketed the farmland melted a month ago , revealing acres of harvested corn stubble that is now being readied for replanting . The pipeline would also come within 600ft of their farmhouse . Their land had become something of a hub for resistance against the XL during the second term of the Obama administration . In recent summers crop artists had cut anti-XL artworks into the outlying corn fields , and in 2014 Neil Young and Willie Nelson headlined a protest concert on the field the XL is set to cross . It may have taken years , but the former president eventually paid attention .

Photograph : Laurence Mathieu-Leger for the Guardian As Art says , the state of Nebraska , and more precisely its Public Service Commission , stands as the last major obstacle to TransCanada and the new president from getting shovels in the ground . Public hearings are set for August , and Tanderup and a coalition of other resistant landowners are preparing to lobby hard . Pipeline map The suggested route has already been moved once , back in 2012 , to avoid the fragile ecosystem of the Nebraska Sandhills . But the new route still crosses the massive underground aquifer , and the Tanderups maintain their sandy , porous soil means their land should still be considered part of the Sandhills region . At present , around 90 landowners along the proposed route are holding out against the Canadian company as eminent domain will not be enforceable unless the plan is approved . They plan to sue if it is . But fear is coupled with frustration under this new administration . The president had already formalised this requirement by executive order . Along the route , countless local business owners and politicians have touted these claims as the dominant factor guiding their support for the construction . You may be able to prolong it . They will have to bulldoze me over before they can come on my property . Art Tanderup But the reality is different . There will be an additional 26,000 jobs created indirectly by the project . Pivotally , almost all of these positions are temporary , projected to last two years at most . Estimates suggest just 50 permanent jobs will be created by the construction . TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said the company agreed with the state department projections . A meeting memo , seen by the Guardian in the town of Baker , Montana , showed TransCanada did not provide firm estimates to town officials over the number of local people who would be offered work by the pipeline . It also shows that , despite continuing legal battles and ongoing route proposals in Nebraska , TransCanada have briefed officials they could start construction on a number of pump stations along the route in 2018 , with a view to pipeline construction between 2019 and 2020 . Starlings chirp from trees that are already budding in spring . Lutheran and Baptist churches tower over many buildings here , rivaled mostly by the football posts that stand on immaculately kept high school playing fields . The pork has been slow-roasting since 3 am , and a large crowd queues up to fill their plates . A decade ago the first Keystone pipeline passed close to this area , and Priefert recalls fondly how it led to jobs in a town where the population has declined by half since the Rock Island railroad closed up . The line , forever enshrined by the eponymous folk spiritual later performed by Johnny Cash and Lonnie Donegan , had kept a regional headquarters here until the 1970s . She knows from experience that the expected boom here will be not permanent and expresses a general unease over the Trump presidency , despite voting for him in 2016 . Nonetheless , she backs the project to the hilt , citing it as clear example of a promise the president has actually managed to deliver in his first 100 days . The image is something of an anticlimax . The village , named after former railroad president Dudley M Steele upon foundation in 1873 , has a population of just 56 people and is eerily quiet . The only local business , the Salty Dog Saloon , already does fantastic trade , drawing travelling bikers , passing construction workers and locals from the surrounding area , to sample the home cooked burgers and blues that booms from the jukebox . Then she checks herself . Facebook Twitter Pinterest The TransCanada pump station in Steele City , Nebraska , where the Keystone XL pipeline is set to meet with the existing Keystone pipeline . For those whose futures are vested in the prospective construction , the battle lines are already being drawn , and many are preparing for another long , exhausting fight . About a quarter-mile up the road is the TransCanada pump station where the XL is set to link with the existing Keystone . It hums quietly on top of a hill where it is surrounded by wind turbines that emit red flashing lights as darkness rolls in . Around this time last year the pipeline had leaked further up its route in South Dakota , spilling nearly 17,000 gallons of oil . It was discovered , not by leak detection technology , but by a passerby who spotted oil seeping to the surface . This article was amended on 4 May 2017 to correct the timing of the leak of almost 17,000 gallons of oil to make clear this was in 2016 .
