Hydraulic fracturing , also known as fracking , stimulates gas production by injecting wells with high volumes of chemical-laced water in order to free-up pockets of natural gas below . The process is controversial with critics saying it could poison water supplies , while the natural-gas industry says it 's been used safely for decades . While New York State has yet to decide whether to allow fracking , economically struggling Binghamton has passed a drilling ban which prohibits any exploration or extraction of natural gas in the city for the next two years . The Marcellus Shale Gas Feld extends through parts of New York State , Pennsylvania , Ohio and West Virginia and could hold up to 500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas . Augusta is the first county in the commonwealth to pass a zoning ordinance that completely prohibits fracking on its lands . The board voted six to one to pass the ordinance after a public hearing in which several county citizens voiced impassioned pleas for the board to enact the ban . Many of the 35 or so people at the meeting stood up and cheered the board 's decision . Although the new Augusta County ordinance does not prohibit traditional methods of gas drilling , just drilling by the fracking method , it still goes a long way in the protection of drinking water and the headwaters in the county , Davis said .
