The move was announced as hundreds of veterans descended on the site in support of the protesters . Authorities also asked protesters not to remove barriers on the bridge , which they have said was damaged in the late October conflict that led to several people being hurt , including a serious arm injury . Protesters also are not supposed to walk , ride or fly drones north of the bridge , Laney said . The bridge blockade is something that Standing Rock Sioux tribal chairman Dave Archambault has been asking to be removed , the Bismarck Tribune reports , and something he said he would to talk to Gov. Jack Dalrymple about when they meet in person . The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and others say the pipeline north of the reservation could pollute drinking water and threatens sacred sites and want changes made to its route . The pipeline is largely complete except for a short segment that is planned to pass beneath a Missouri River reservoir , and Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners says it is unwilling to reroute the project . There could be as many as a few thousands veterans Sunday on the Standing Rock Sioux reservation near the encampment , according to protest organizers . They are expected to gather near the protests , then go to the main camp for a few days . All Rights Reserved . This material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .
