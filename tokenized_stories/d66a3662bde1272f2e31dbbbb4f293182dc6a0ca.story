This map only show the spills that have been reported since 2005 WIRED Hurricane Ivan would not die . After traveling across the Atlantic Ocean , it stewed for more than a week in the Caribbean , fluctuating between a Category 3 and 5 storm while battering Jamaica , Cuba , and other vulnerable islands . And as it approached the US Gulf Coast , it stirred up a massive mud slide on the sea floor . The mudslide created leaks in 25 undersea oil wells , snarled the pipelines leading from the wells to a nearby oil platform , and brought the platform down on top of all of it . Also , twelve years later , the mess is still leaking . Since the storm , its oil slick stretches over eight square miles on an average day . Every year thousands of oil and chemical spills occur in waters around the country , but unless you live in a highly impacted area like Louisiana , you probably only hear about a handful of them . It makes sense that not every greasy pelican is national news . But as a group , they probably should be . Oil is toxic . Oil spills , however small , have a cumulative environmental impact . But the regulations in place to prevent them are limited , and in some cases , absurd . For instance , the US Coast Guard basically relies on oil companies to use the honor system when reporting leaks . And since oil leaks happen not only because oil technology is often either too old or too new , but also because of human error , that 's what we call a real conflict of interest . Size Does n't Matter Oil leaks have been around longer than humans have been drilling . In Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of California , petroleum naturally seeps up through the seafloor . But natural oil seeps are slow , and old . But the majority of ocean life never developed the appetite for oil . Or much defense against it . Air breathing animals like dolphins and turtles suck in oil if they surface in a slick , and when even small amounts of oil end up in their lungs , they suffer fatal pneumonia-esque health issues . Plants and algae ca n't photosynthesize under a grungy film . And even a few molecules of oil can kill fish larvae . Human physiology is n't a fan either . MacDonald and his students have turned the collapsed Taylor Energy site into something of a lab , because it reliably leaks between 84 and 1,470 gallons per day . Except , Size Definitely Matters Each red dot above represents an oil spill reported to the National Response Center between 2005 and today . They 're concentrated in the Gulf , but you can zoom out to see spills in other areas , are click on a spill to see when someone reported it . Even a few thousand gallons of spilled oil is consequential . Even more consequential are more than 30,000 of those so-called small spills each year . Which is probably the bare minimum spill estimate , says Manthos of SkyTruth . Really , it 's hard to know if this figure is complete , and even harder to calculate the volume of oil being leaked . Some new oil equipment is smart enough to know when , and measure how much , it leaks . But those sensors can malfunction . Plus most oil infrastructure is way older . Most of the time oil companies , activists , and the US Coast Guard are all doing some version of educated guessing . Their biggest clues comes from the size and color of an oil slick . Neither of which are great . Color gives a clues about an oil spill 's thickness . The volumes that oil companies and others do calculate and report get compiled in a National Response Center database . And if you ask an oil lobbyist , it all totals to about one million gallons per year . And those oil company-provided numbers are what the US Coast Guard relies on to levy fines against those that spill . Which is a problem , because oil companies have a financial incentive to lowball the spill estimates , because the fines levied against them often triple if they cross that major spill threshold . At SkyTruth , Manthos uses satellite imagery and remote sensing data to get a much more definitive picture of spill size and color than you can get from sticking your head out of a helicopter door . And does not account for the many spills that go unnoticed somewhere along the 2.4 million miles of oil pipe in the United States . Not for lack of trying . And oil companies do n't need to be accurate . The Coast Guard 's self-defense on these enforcement matters is n't too convincing . She would not comment more specifically . Aging Infrastructure and Poor Regulation American oil infrastructure is old . On this map , each dot represents a still-standing platform or rig . The lighter the dot , the older the construction . The oldest date back to the 1960s . You can click on a rig to see the installation date . But the government does not require the industry to do sweeping upgrades of its aging , leaky equipment . The infrastructure issues are a mixture of growing pains and poor maintenance . There 's new stuff , like Deep Water Horizons : under-tested , in deep water , under high pressure , and far from land . But that new stuff is , as you can now guess , rare . Many more leaks come from rust bucket rigs that are chronically broken and patched , instead of rebuilt , says Eustis . These rigs are usually close to shore , have changed hands a few times , and are now operated by the subcontractor of a subcontractor of a subcontractor of a subsidiary of a major oil company . And the older they are , the more they leak . Many are n't even operational anymore . According to Henderson , about 36,000 abandoned wells dot the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico , sites where the oil companies either drilled and did n't find anything below the sediment , or sapped a reserve to the point where it made more sense to move resources on to other , juicier wells . But that does n't mean that these wells are exhausted : in many cases small -LRB- or not so small -RRB- amounts of oil are still hanging out in the reservoir or the pipes connected to it . Or sitting in the path of some future hurricane . An issue of this magnitude clearly is n't down to a few shady companies . All they look at now is financial ability . So whether you 're a reputable and responsible oil company , a petrol-curious dude who came into some cash , or the most notorious oil spiller in the galaxy , your chances of expanding your oil empire are equal . Having few incentives other than financial ones breeds a poor safety culture . She attributes the situation in part to the cowboy mythos of American oil exploration . As far as they 're concerned , they do n't need help outside their own bootstraps , so they sure as heck do n't need the National Academy of Sciences or government regulation to tell them how to do their jobs . But to be fair , a sizable portion of the blame for that problem falls at the feet of their managers pushing for more and more oil flowing at faster and faster rates . And those managers are responding to the demands of , well , capitalism 's appetite for oil . Leaky Past , Leakier Future Ah , capitalism . Despite environmental concerns , the world , and especially the United States , is still slurping up a lot of oil . And President-elect Trump 's position on offshore oil drilling and preserving the jobs of oil workers makes that unlikely to change in the next four years . But Weaver does n't necessarily see a future where every tract of land off US coasts is suddenly fair game . Like the Taylor Energy site , with barely a decade of leaks behind it , and many more to come . All rights reserved . Your California Privacy Rights . Ad Choices .
