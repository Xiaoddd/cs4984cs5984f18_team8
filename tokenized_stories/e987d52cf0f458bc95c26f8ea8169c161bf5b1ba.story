Deputy Assistant FBI Director Peter Strzok speaks during a joint committee hearing of the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees Photo : AFP Peter Strzok has been accused by Republicans of being biased against Donald Trump , and seeking to prevent his election victory . Mr Trump has pointed to the text exchanges as evidence of bias in the special counsel 's Russia probe . Mr Strzok served on the Russia probe and the Hillary Clinton email inquiry . His lawyer Aitan Goelman said in a statement FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich ordered the firing on Friday . He said the sacking overruled a decision by the head of FBI employee discipline , who determined that Mr Strzok should only face a demotion and a 60-day suspension . A spokesperson for the FBI told the BBC that they could not immediately comment on Mr Strzok 's firing . Mr Trump took to Twitter on Monday to ask when the inquiry into Russia 's alleged meddling in the 2016 election , which is being led by ex-FBI director Robert Mueller , will end . Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally . The list of bad players in the FBI & DOJ gets longer & longer . It is a total Hoax . During the election , Mrs Clinton was investigated by the FBI over her use of a private email server to handle sensitive government documents during her time as secretary of state . Mr Strzok exchanged text messages that disparaged Mr Trump with FBI lawyer Lisa Page , with whom he was having an affair . No he wo n't . It is not clear whether these texts were sent from work phones . Mr Rosenstein also noted that the FBI had rules against checking a person 's politics during the hiring process . Mr Strzok is the third high-profile FBI employee who had been involved in the Russia and Clinton investigations to be fired since Mr Trump took office . FBI Director James Comey was fired by Mr Trump , who later said he had been thinking of the Russia inquiry when he made his decision . His deputy Andrew McCabe was removed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions after an inspector general determined that he had made unauthorised leaks to the press about the Clinton investigation .
