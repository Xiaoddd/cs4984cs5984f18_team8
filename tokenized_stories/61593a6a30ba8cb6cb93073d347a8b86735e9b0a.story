Transgender Americans fear for safety after Trump win : ` We are traumatized ' Read more Later , Sarah Huckabee Sanders , the White House press secretary , was not able to say if the thousands of currently serving transgender people would be thrown out of the military . Huckabee Sanders denied that Trump was breaking his campaign promise to protect the LGBTQ community . Unusually , the new press secretary threatened to end the briefing if questions on the topic continued . The next question was about cabinet morale , but then a reporter returned to the issue of transgender people in the military . The briefing ended two minutes later . There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honorably . Several studies had already found that reversing the ban was unlikely to have a negative impact on the military . A 2016 study by the Rand Corporation estimated there are up to 6,630 trans people on active duty and up to 4,160 in the select reserve . There are roughly 1.4 million active-duty US service members . The delay was negotiated after the chiefs of the army , navy , air force and marine corps requested more time to prepare for the recruitment of transgender service members . Reports have suggested the joint chiefs asked for an additional six months , while others wanted another two years . But there was no public indication that the joint chiefs were seeking an outright ban . As a candidate , Trump cast himself as a supporter of LGBT rights and indicated he would uphold certain Obama-era policies designed to protect transgender people . Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth , who lost both her legs on duty in Iraq , also chastised Trump . Earlier this month , the House of Representatives voted down a measure that would have restricted funding for trans members of the military . Although the measure passed a House committee on a party line vote , it failed on the House floor on a 209-214 vote . Twenty-four Republicans banded together with Democrats to kill the proposal .
