This is primitive camping . We are further south along the pipeline and we have an infinite amount of room between four -LRB- 4 -RRB- campsites . The fourth camp , -LRB- yet unnamed -RRB- will be in Dunnellon for the people who wish to support opposition to the compressor station . Plans are still pending while the infrastructure of that camp is being developed . Time is running short . Levy County is one of the few places left with pipe still above ground . We need many protectors to help record and document violations and to file reports . Come and join us if you want to learn more about this process and build resistance with respect and community . Workshops are filling up . Remember , it 's everyone 's responsibility to protect Florida and our environmental resources . These camps will be the first indigenous led camps in the state . The grassroots activists and Water Protectors of Stop Sabal Trail were the original online organizers working to stop the Sabal Trail Pipeline and are joining the camps to form an environmental protector alliance sanctioned by the Seminole Tribe of North Florida . The already existing Crystal Water Camp that was located at Ft. Drum , Florida will be moving to one of these locations . Experienced activists , water protectors , trainers , campers and families are welcome . The campers will adhere to peace and creative non-violence . No weapons , drugs , alchohol , violence or pets -LRB- except service animals -RRB- at any of the locations . These will not be direct action camps . No signage , markings or public identification by participants will be permitted for security reasons . In Levy County , Sabal Trail Transmission is installing a portion of a 516 mile , fracked gas -LRB- methane -RRB- pipeline . Violations have been duly noted and documented at the work sites by activists as the crews are rapidly installing this pipeline with no oversight . Today a concerned resident who has been carefully documenting the violations being done by the Sabal Trail Transmission employee 's , Price Gregory workers and crews from affiliated companies had her modem melt down while sending her documentation to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -LRB- FERC -RRB- , Department of Environmental Protection -LRB- DEP -RRB- and other agencies . Whilst preparing my latest DEP violations report I sit back and watched as someone took over controls on my laptop . Spybot alerted me but nothing i did gave me back contol . Not paranoid . Complete shut down and modem disabled . Phone also disabled . Guess someone wants to silence her . In addition , members of Stop Sabal Trail in Levy County have had issues with full voice mail inboxes on their phones , scrambling of audio once calls are connected and repeated disconnections when dialing specific phone numbers . White surveillance trucks have also been observed near the residences of activists , parked not very far from their front gates or several hundred feet from their properties . Wherever this is noted , there are active Sabal Trail Transmission construction sites nearby . All rights reserved . Ethereal theme . Theme images by Galeries . Powered by Blogger .
