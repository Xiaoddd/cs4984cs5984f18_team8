From Kinder Morgan to Dakota Access , new pipelines across North America are trampling Indigenous rights , threatening to poison the drinking water of millions , and rendering our climate commitments worthless . If we come together as one unstoppable force , we can put the brakes on construction , challenge pipeline funding , and stop new pipelines in the courts and on the land . Add your name to join the resistance . Sign the pledge . Join the resistance . I do not consent to pipelines that will poison the water , trample Indigenous sovereignty and stand in the way of climate action . I pledge to do my part by signing this petition to ensure we stop these pipelines and keep the water , air , and climate safe for this generation and the next .
