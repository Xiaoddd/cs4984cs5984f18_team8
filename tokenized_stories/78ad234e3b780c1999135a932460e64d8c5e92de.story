On these hallowed grounds , history tends to repeat itself . In 1890 , police murdered Sitting Bull on the Standing Rock reservation out of suspicion that he was preparing to lead the Ghost Dance movement in an uprising . Two weeks later the United States Cavalry massacred more than three hundred Lakota at Wounded Knee . Over 126 years later , the characters and details of the stories that animate this landscape have changed , but the Cowboys and Indians remain locked in the same grim dance . For many , it is contentious and even laughable to suggest that colonialism endures in the present . In the American popular imagination , colonialism ended either when the 13 colonies declared independence from Britain in 1776 , or when John Wayne and the 6th Cavalry blasted away Geronimo and the Apaches in Stagecoach . Colonialism , according to these narratives , is history . The eviction of Oceti Sakowin suggests otherwise . That is almost three times the national average . Schools are failing . Healthcare is inadequate . Many depend on unsafe wells for water . Roads are often unpaved . Housing is in short supply , substandard and overcrowded . If the people of Standing Rock did not take-in their beloved family and friends , there would be mass homelessness . The pipeline will pour even more wealth into his pockets . Meanwhile , Standing Rock will remain in poverty on the margins . The most expensive piece of infrastructure in their community will not be the schools , homes or hospitals they desperately need . Instead it will be a pipeline that they have vehemently opposed . This is how the first people of this land live in the forgotten Bantustans of the American West . This system , an essential foundation of the United States , is rooted in the theft of indigenous land and the ongoing disavowal of indigenous sovereignty . Indigenous presence must be confined , erased and then forgotten , so that the United States may continue to live upon and profit mightily from lands taken from indigenous people . The erasure of indigenous people explains why Dakota Access was rerouted from upstream of Bismarck south to Standing Rock . It explains why pipelines can be hammered through Native communities without regard to their treaties and indigenous , constitutional and human rights . It explains why a multi-billion dollar pipe can be drilled through Standing Rock before long-needed basic infrastructure is built . It explains how , after months of unprecedented protests and visibility , Trump can claim that he received no complaints about the pipeline . It explains how Oceti Sakowin can be wiped off the map . It is impossible to describe the totality of this picture of land theft , containment , poverty , oppression , policing and extraction as anything other than colonialism . They have lit a fire on the prairie in the heart of America as a symbol of their resistance , a movement that stands for something that is undoubtedly right : water that sustains life , and land that gave birth to people . In its ashes there is the potential for a more just future for this land , this water , and all the nations and people who share it .
