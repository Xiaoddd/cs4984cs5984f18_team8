The struggle of indigenous peoples is added to on both sides of the border , and in Cuetzalan , in the Sierra Norte of Puebla , with the presence of representatives of indigenous peoples from New Mexico and Dakota , who all ratify the defense of their lands and territories . Others have promised that they will express their solidarity with protests throughout the country . However , last month Trump decided to revive the decree with which is approved the construction of this work that they consider predatory to the environment and destructive to its ancient habitat . This nation currently has 28,000 members . Now , they denounce that United States immigration police have unleashed a war against them , therefore they warned that they would mobilize against the border wall they want to construct . The Yaqui Tribe shares territory in the state of Sonora in Mexico and in Arizona , in the United States . Bring down the wall by constructing resistance with workers , indigenous peoples and women on both sides of the border . From Standing Rock to the Sierra Norte of Puebla : indigenous peoples join together in defense of territory The campesino , indigenous and mestizo peoples of the Northeast Sierra of Puebla have demonstrated , once again , their capacity for organization and self-determination . As is now the custom in this region , every other month , and now on February 18 , hundreds of people came from 173 towns and 16 municipalities to gather together in the 18th Assembly in Defense of Territory to reaffirm the power to decide on their lives and the destiny of their territories . According to what the web page Hijos de la Tierra has reported , those installations are destined to favor mining megaprojects , fracking and hydroelectric dams in la region . The municipal presidency of Cuetzalan and representatives of the Federal Electricity Commission -LRB- CFE , its initials in Spanish -RRB- were invited to the meeting so that they could provide information about the motive and objectives of the electric project that they want to develop at that place . They did not attend however and therefore the assembly decided to continue stopping the construction work and to maintain the encampment installed since the month of November . II . account .
