Instead of getting rich , Jensen , 56 , has been left with a huge mess -- his acreage in Tioga fouled by the largest oil spill on U.S. soil in history . Tuesday . Before it was plugged , the leak spewed 20,600 barrels of crude oil -- enough oil to fill three Olympic-size swimming pools . San Antonio-based Tesoro Logistics , which owns the 20-year-old North Dakota pipeline , said Tuesday that it will repair and replace a 200-foot section of the tube . Jensen is all for analysis , but he 's also looking to be made whole . It took nearly two weeks for officials to tell the public about the massive rupture that occurred in a remote area of Tioga . Officials claim no water was contaminated or wildlife hurt . But environmentalists are skeptical and say it 's an example of a boom industry operating too cozily with state regulators . He also said that any grain within a half mile of the spill would not be sold for consumption . The North Dakota Health Department said that while companies must notify the state of any spills , the state does n't have to release that information to the public . That 's not unusual in major oil-producing states . But the public is often told about spills , particularly if oil gets into a waterway or otherwise threatens the environment . The pipeline , which stretches 35 miles , was built by BP in 1993 and bought by Tesoro in 2001 . Cristina Corbin and The Associated Press contributed to this report . All rights reserved .
