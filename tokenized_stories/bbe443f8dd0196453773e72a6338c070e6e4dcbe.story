It is no longer accepting RSVPs . Police used tear gas , rubber bullets , pepper spray , sound grenades , and sprayed them with water cannons in subfreezing conditions . Hundreds of people were injured and one woman may have her arm amputated . In response a coalition of groups at Standing Rock are calling for a week of action starting on November 25th that will culminate in a Global Day of Action on December 1st . The main targets are financiers of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the police departments that have been brought in from across the Midwest to brutalize water protectors . In Vancouver Scotiabank , Royalbank and Toronto Dominion are all guilty of supporting DAPL . The financial footing of the Dakota Access Pipeline is in jeopardy if they do not complete the project by January 1st . If this deadline is missed , a majority of the stakeholders with contracts to ship oil through the pipeline will be able to renegotiate or cancel their contracts . This could be devastating to Energy Transfer Partners and the other pipeline companies behind DAPL . With its vulnerabilities exposed , our solidarity efforts are needed now more than ever .
