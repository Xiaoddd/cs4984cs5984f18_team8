Beverly and Ernie Fischer , shown with granddaughter Jalia , have lost more than a dozen bison as a result of the Dakota Access pipeline protests . Or her dead buffalo . An enrolled tribal member , Mrs. Fischer and her husband , Ernie , are convinced that at least 13 of their bison have been butchered , barbecued and eaten by some of the hundreds of activists trespassing through the livestock pastures of Cannonball Ranch since the protests erupted in August . In one day , the Fischers had three buffalo drop dead after hundreds of protesters on Highway 1806 panicked the herd in a clash with Morton County law enforcement . The perpetrators have not been caught , and a number of activists have decried the livestock deaths . With as many as 2,500 people living in different camps with different philosophies , however , the locals are convinced that some of the more belligerent protesters are responsible . For ranchers like the Fischers , catching those responsible for harming their livestock is almost impossible . They live about 43 miles from the Cannonball Ranch , where their herd of more than 600 bison graze over a vast expanse of 8,700 leased acres . Even those activists who mean no harm are causing stress for the bison , not to mention the Fischers . For whatever reason , the protesters have also made it their mission to help the buffalo escape by cutting the pasture fences . We have reports of them catching bison . Already a herd of 30 bison , mainly calves and older animals , is missing . Their business has taken a significant hit . Last year , the Fischers had the most successful buffalo sale in the nation , but neither of them expects to repeat that success in light of the protests . She anticipates that most of the bison cows that had been bred will have lost their calves . That means no calf crop for me next year . The Obama administration announced Monday that it would delay a decision on whether to release the final permit for the pipeline , which has been completed in North Dakota except for 1,100 feet at Lake Oahe . That means more weeks or months of uncertainty for the Fischers and other locals waiting for the situation to play out . I make my home here on the reservation . Click here for reprint permission .
