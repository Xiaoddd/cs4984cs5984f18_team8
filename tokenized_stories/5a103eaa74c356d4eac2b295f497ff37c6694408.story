The Ramapough-Lenape people have inhabited the New York region going back well before Europeans arrived . However , thanks , in part , to a campaign launched by a young Donald Trump , the Ramapough have never been granted federal tribal recognition . Even a minor spill could contaminate the water supply of the most densely populated area of the country . Water contamination is not the only hazard posed by this project . There is also the issue of oversight . The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration employs just 208 inspectors , who together with 345 state inspectors are charged with overseeing more than 2.7 million miles of pipeline . The Pilgrim Pipeline will pass through 30 New Jersey towns and 25 New York municipalities will be overseen by one inspector every 20.000 miles . Despite concerns raised by environmentalists , Pilgrim Pipeline Holdings offers a different version of the facts . Seemingly oblivious of pipeline-related disasters like the 2013 Pegasus spill in Alabama or 2010 Enbridge spill in Michigan , the company describes its planned infrastructure buildup as a boon for East Coast communities along its path . The State of New York thinks otherwise . As the company proceeds through the permitting process , Pilgrim Pipeline Holdings will have to respond to these potential threats . From 1967 to 1971 , Ford Motor Company dumped industrial waste in the woods of Upper Ringwood , where many Ramapough families live . The site was declared safe by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1994 only to be re-listed as a Superfund site in 2006 . Local residents have experienced above-average rates of lung and cervical cancer , as well as asthma , miscarriages and skin conditions , which they attribute to the pollution . Currently , New York University is researching the lasting health impacts of the waste dump with the help of members of the Ramapough Nation . At the Sept. 23 event , Science for the People , which takes its name from a now-defunct publication where Stephen Jay Gould and other notable scientists cut their political teeth throughout the 70s , promoted the idea that scientists can be an allies to and advocates for human rights movements . An early issue of Science for the People . The march is part of a budding resurgence in environmental activism brought on by recent hurricanes that have highlighted the threat posed by climate change . Pilgrim Pipeline Holdings is currently awaiting permits from New York and New Jersey and has not set a construction deadline . Having survived centuries of colonization , extermination and racism by their white neighbors , the Ramapough could have something to teach a new generation of activists fighting for the environment .
