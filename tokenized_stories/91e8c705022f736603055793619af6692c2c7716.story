All rights reserved . News of the leak came out this week thanks to regulatory filings obtained by the Ohio chapter of environmental group , the Sierra Club . According to the paperwork , on 13 April 2017 , 7.6 million litres -LRB- 2 million gallons -RRB- of drilling fluids were detected spilling into a wetland next to the Tuscarawas River in Stark County by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency . On 14 April 2017 , another 190,000 litres -LRB- 50,000 gallons -RRB- of drilling fluids were detecting , spilling into a wetland in Richland County in the Mifflin Township . Drilling fluids themselves are n't necessarily toxic or dangerous - you can think of them like a type of mud-based lubricant used to assist in the drilling of boreholes . Once it 's completed , the Rover Pipeline will cross some particularly important waterways in its 1,147-km -LRB- 713-mile -RRB- length - including the Maumee , Sandusky , and Portage rivers , all of which feed into Lake Erie . The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the Rover Pipeline 's construction in February , and when it 's finished , it will transport an estimated 92 billion litres -LRB- 3.25 billion cubic feet -RRB- of natural gas from the US 's eastern shale to the market each day . To be fair , pipelines have n't had the best environmental track record lately . In December last year , as the Standing Rock protests continued over the Dakota Access Pipeline , a nearby pipeline spilled 176,000 gallons of oil into a creek just 2.5 hours away . Worse , no one knows how long the pipeline was leaking before a local property owner noticed the spill . That incident was n't associated with Energy Transfer Partners , but it 's just another sign that companies need to do a better job of monitoring and regulating these pipelines if they 're going to conitnue to build them . Let 's hope the affected Ohio waterways can be cleaned up quickly , and that these notices from the Environmental Protection Agency are enough to keep Energy Transfer Partners vigilant throughout the rest of construction . 5 days ago Politics & Society Semi-Automatic Rifles Really Are More Deadly , New Study Clearly Shows Numbers do n't lie . 6 days ago Politics & Society To Save Ourselves It 's Time to Rethink Our Economic System , Warn Scientists The market is killing the planet . 4 hours ago PHYSICS Single Hydrogen Atoms Could Form Eerie ` Ghost Bonds ' With Nothing , New Study Shows It should n't be possible . 15 hours ago SPACE SpaceX Has Announced The First Tourist to Go to The Moon - And Take Other People With Him Such a wild project . 15 hours ago NATURE Potentially Deadly Threats Are Now Lurking in Post-Hurricane Flood Waters Hurricane Florence is n't over yet .
