Prime Minister Justin Trudeau later approved the plan . The Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain project will increase the capacity of a 53-year-old pipeline to 890,000 barrels a day from 300,000 and expand the tanker port . In recent weeks , there have been several large protests against the project , particularly in Vancouver , British Columbia . Environmental groups began condemning the decision as Mr. Trudeau was making his announcement late Tuesday afternoon , but the prime minister said that the pipeline expansion did not contradict his pledges to improve environmental protection and mitigate climate change . He said that spending much of his childhood with his grandparents in British Columbia and then studying and working in Vancouver as a teacher helped inform his decision on the pipeline . But while Mr. Trudeau said the government welcomed people expressing contrary views , their opposition would not change what he characterized as a decision based on science . A number of factors underlie opposition to the Kinder Morgan project . Some people in British Columbia fear that the increase in tanker traffic to the port in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby will inevitably lead to a major oil spill . And , like the protests that led the Obama administration to block the Keystone XL pipeline project from Canada , many people see blocking Kinder Morgan as a way to limit development of the oil sands , which they view as a particularly dirty energy source . Environmental groups said they would move to stop the project through a variety of means . an environmental group previously known as ForestEthics . After a meeting on Monday with cabinet ministers in Ottawa about the pipeline , Chief Maureen Thomas of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation , the indigenous community directly across from the tanker port in British Columbia , said in an interview that her community would mount a legal challenge if the project was approved . Court challenges by indigenous communities have previously stalled the Enbridge Northern Gateway , a pipeline plan to link the oil sands to the northern coast of British Columbia . On Tuesday , Mr. Trudeau said the government had told its energy board to reject that proposal . Rona Ambrose , the interim leader of the Conservative Party , criticized Mr. Trudeau for rejecting that pipeline . But she was also pessimistic about the prospects for the Kinder Morgan project in the face of legal challenges .
