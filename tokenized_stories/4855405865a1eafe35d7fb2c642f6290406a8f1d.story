The council 's Rules , Elections , Intergovernmental Relations and Neighborhoods Committee unanimously endorsed a proposal this week to take Columbus Day off the city calendar and put in its place a new Indigenous Peoples Day . The disagreement between those two camps played out during a lengthy Wednesday night hearing . No one in the room spoke against the creation of Indigenous Peoples Day . Replacing Columbus Day , he said , would provide a public acknowledgment that Christopher Columbus ' arrival in the 15th century set in motion the subjugation , enslavement and genocide of indigenous peoples across the Western Hemisphere . Buscaino has offered a counter-proposal to rename Columbus Day in the city 's administrative code as Immigrant Heritage Day . He argued that O'Farrell 's proposal would needlessly divide Angelenos at a time when inclusiveness is needed . Council President Herb Wesson , who heads the rules committee , spent much of this week 's meeting trying to find a solution where neither side would feel left out . He eventually acknowledged such a goal was not possible . Los Angeles provides its employees with 12 paid holidays a year , and the most recently added is Cesar Chavez Day , established in 2002 . That year , city lawmakers considered replacing Columbus Day , which has been a federal holiday since the Great Depression , with Cesar Chavez Day . The council soon faced a backlash from Italian Americans , who called the proposal racist , and both holidays were allowed to coexist . If O'Farrell 's proposal is approved by the council later this year , it would go into effect no later than 2019 . Columbus Day would remain a national holiday . Several U.S. cities , including Seattle , Portland , Albuquerque and Denver , have already replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples Day . Los Angeles has been discussing the idea for nearly two years . Buscaino suggested that Indigenous Peoples Day could be held in August or September . She said she prefers Buscaino 's alternative proposal . The panel also asked city officials to look into the possibility of creating a city holiday that would commemorate immigrants , diversity or possibly the concept of America . Councilman Marqueece Harris-Dawson , who serves on the committee , pointed out that an Immigrant Heritage Day would exclude two groups : African Americans and Native Americans . He and Wesson worried aloud that backers of President Trump would use the replacement of Columbus Day in Los Angeles to publicly sow divisions between different groups . O'Farrell , for his part , compared his proposal to the recent removal of statues in parts of the South that recognize the Confederacy . Backers of O'Farrell 's proposal said Columbus ' activities in the Caribbean , including his enslavement of Native Americans , should not be sanitized . Passage of O'Farrell 's proposal , he said , would allow the city 's indigenous people to stand proud .
