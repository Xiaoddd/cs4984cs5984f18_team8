Petition Closed Remove Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier , of the Morton County Sheriff 's Office This petition had 113,620 supporters Felina Laverdure started this petition to Morton County Sheriff 's Office and 1 other I am one of a group of Native American activists and allies who have been protesting an oil pipeline that is set to cross the Missouri River a mile away from the Standing Rock reservation , and threatens to poison our water . For months , we have been peacefully working to stop construction on what we see as a threat to the safety of all people , yet we have been met with only violence and mistreatment by law enforcement for doing what we believe is right . The county sheriff is not doing his job , which is to protect all people in Morton County . Sign my petition asking Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem to conduct an ethics investigation into Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier and remove him from office . Under his leadership , Morton County police have failed to protect peaceful North Dakotans from vicious dog attacks , unleashed by a private security company . Sheriff Kirchmeier has displayed bias on Facebook and in media interviews , and has withheld information from North Dakotan residents in order to further the agenda of the Dakota Access LLC . In addition , activists are being constantly surveilled and questioned , then met with road blocks as they try to reach the camps . Please join me in asking for the immediate removal of Sheriff Kirchmeier . As citizens of this country we have the right to participate in peaceful protest without being met by a militarized and biased police force more interested in protecting corporate interests than the people of North Dakota .
