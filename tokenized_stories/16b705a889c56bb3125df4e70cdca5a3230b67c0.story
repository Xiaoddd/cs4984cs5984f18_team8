December 4th is when I go to Standing Rock Ok so many of you know me and my passion for my heritage and for Veterans in general . Custer at that time , with his greed , tried to drive the rightful nations from their land for gold . The massacre at Wounded Knee Creek when miscommunication and misunderstanding of the Ghost Dance lead to over 200 dead Lakota . These couple of examples show the misunderstanding of the right that the Sioux nation , in the Standing Rock protest have to clean water , their way of life , and the preservation of ancestors who are buried in sacred ground where this greedy corporation want to build . Make no mistake , I understand oil line will be built , but when a culture is lost or pushed aside , those memories and evidence of the past may be forever lost due to the greed of an industry . Will be leaving the 4th . I will be trying to post live updates when I get there about what 's going on . If you felt like you have been wanting help , now is your chance . The sheriff was suspended and now they really calling in the National Guard but they may not be effective against other veterans since we are all brothers and sisters .
