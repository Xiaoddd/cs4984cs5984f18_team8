By Eric Holthaus Xiuhtezcatl Martinez , pictured in the foothills of north Boulder , Colorado , on Aug. 11 , is one of the young plaintiffs in the climate case . The path was cleared by a federal district court judge in Oregon who wrote an opinion preliminarily finding that a stable climate is a fundamental constitutional right . In the groundbreaking decision , announced on Thursday , U.S. District Court Judge Ann Aiken ruled in favor of a group of 21 children and young adults in their suit against the federal government . The case , Juliana v. United States , will now go to trial starting sometime in 2017 and could prove to be a major civil rights suit , eventually finding its way to the U.S. Supreme Court . The young plaintiffs , who range in age from 9 to 20 , allege that climate change violates their constitutional rights to life , liberty , and property by causing direct harm and destroying so-called public trust assets such as coastlines . The case argues that climate change is worsened by the aggregated actions of the federal government in permitting fossil fuel development , subsidizing the fossil fuel industry , and many other such actions . Further , the children and their lawyers say these government actions are willfully prioritizing short-term profit , convenience , and the concerns of current generations over those of future generations . The plaintiffs state that the government and these companies have continued to prioritize these short-term gains for more than five decades with full knowledge of the extreme dangers they posed . Lead plaintiff Kelsey Juliana , who lives in Oregon , alleges that algae blooms harm the water she needs to drink and that low water levels caused by drought kill the wild salmon she needs to eat . Martinez , who lives in Colorado , alleges increased wildfires and extreme flooding jeopardize his personal safety . Other plaintiffs are from farming families , suffer from asthma , and have had their homes overrun by raw sewage during the recent floods in Louisiana . The suit claims that by failing to protect these children from human-caused climate-related harm , the government violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment . It goes on to say that these harms , and others , are caused in part by climate change and are preventable if the government acts to hasten the transition to a zero-carbon economy . In her decision , drawing on the recent Supreme Court decision of Obergefell v Hodges that guaranteed the right to same-sex marriage , Judge Aiken wrote : I have no doubt that the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society . Just as marriage is the foundation of the family , a stable climate system is quite literally the foundation of society , without which there would be neither civilization nor progress . According to other legal experts I consulted , she might be right . President-elect Donald Trump does not believe climate change is real , and the information we currently have about how he would address the global crisis suggests his actions would be both woefully inadequate and possibly devastating . Of course , the suit will not have an immediate effect on policy . The trial and appeals process could take years , even in the best-case scenario . Another climate law expert I spoke with , Michael Blumm at Lewis and Clark Law School , said he expected lawyers for the Trump administration to attempt to drag the process out as long as possible . The suit is currently against President Barack Obama , as well as several parts of the executive branch , like the Department of Transportation . Trump will automatically become a named defendant when he assumes the presidency on Jan. 20 , Olson told CNN . Advertisement Should the case reach the Supreme Court under the Trump administration , Olson told me that she is confident her side would prevail . The case has not yet gone to trial , so the speculation on a Supreme Court ruling is premature , Blumm said . As I wrote last year , the plot of this lawsuit is like something out of a Disney movie : A group of committed kids from across the country and a charismatic lawyer are fighting for the future of the planet against Big Oil and the president of the United States . The lead attorney for the government in this case , Sean Duffy , referred a request for comment to the Department of Justice , which has yet to respond . The kids are encouraging Obama to come to the settlement table and talk about preliminary relief before Trump assumes office . This country also has among the greatest capacity for quickly marshaling resources to solve the problem . This development has likely eliminated the small remaining window for global climate action to keep warming this century to less than 2 degrees Celsius , as agreed upon in the 2015 Paris accord , which went into force on Nov. 4 of this year . Top Comment This is stupid More ... Join In If the Paris accord does not last , global emissions , which have been roughly flat since 2013 , could go back up . Separately , a new study out this week considered how a resumption of business-as-usual increases in emissions might affect the climate . The new research found that a worst-case scenario of warming may induce an unimaginable level of impacts by the end of the century , including a temperature rise of between 4 and more than 7 degrees Celsius , more than the currently accepted 3.5 to 4.5 degrees . It would effectively be the apocalypse . The lawsuit offers a path forward for fighting this outcome . Follow him on Twitter . All rights reserved . example .
