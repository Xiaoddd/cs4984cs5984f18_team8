We want to draw attention to the struggle against this pipeline and in doing so develop a -LRB- further -RRB- praxis in which the global financial capital faces a social movement beyond borders : protest at the location of accountability as a resonance to the resistance in the directly affected area . Since months resistance has been taken place against the construction of the pipeline because it endangers the enviroment and drinking water supply . Furthermore a continuing of the construction would destroy even more sacred sites of the Sioux . Neither legal mandatory enviromental impact assessments nor treaties with the Native Americans were taken into regard during the planning and construction of the pipeline . But near the city the risk of a possible leck in the pipeline for the drinking water supply was estimated as too high . In the Sacred Stone Camp more than 20.000 people were living in collective self-organizing structures . Already early in the beginning US veterans participated , 4.000 of them were asking the Native Americans for forgiveness for the past and current atrocities in a ceremony . Furthermore political activists from climate and envirmonental protection initiatives , the civil right movement , anarchists , internationalists joined in together along with people just politicizing in this process . So the movement of water-protectors formed and has been resisting since with all means . All of this contributes to a greater capacity of acting in future conflicts . Obama stopped the construction after the situation escalated when the police attacked unarmed water-protectors with rubber bullets , tasers and teargas . Four days after his inauguration Trump signed an ordinance to continue . The Sacred Stone Camp was evicted . But the resistance has been continuing , a new camp was established in Washington . Today we demand the Deutsche Bank to cancel the DAPL investment . Anyways other inverstors are happily ready to take the shares . And assuming the realeased money will be reinvested more socially or ecologically would be just naive . However , attempted greenwashing of Deutsche Bank due to the fact they cancelled DAPL funding would be too ridiculous . That is why we targeted Deutsche Bank for our action today . In solidarity with our allies in the local struggles we want to undermine the legitimation of funding here as more and more people stop to look away . We need this period of the expansion of consciousness to developthe strength to attack the capitalist system as a whole as soon as possible . from 1st to 7th of April offers the frame to express the global connection of our local struggles . But it also forces us to create a global basis for the financial needs of anti-repression . -LRB- donation-options there -RRB- . More than 700 friends were arrested only in Standing Rock resistance . We have understood that we need to overcome our own demarcations because out of new constellations new balance of power will evolve . Having these things in mind we chose this form of action today . More initiatives of this kind will be undertaken in the future . We refer to the counteractions at the G20 Summit in Hamburg in the beginning of July where friends from all over the world will visualize their rejection of the global system of rule together in diverse ways .
