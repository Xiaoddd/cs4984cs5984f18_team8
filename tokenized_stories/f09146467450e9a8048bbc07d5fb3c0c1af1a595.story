By Dennis J Bernstein In at least a temporary victory for the Standing Rock protesters , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers blocked plans for running the Dakota Access Pipeline across Lake Oahe and began to examine alternative routes , although it is unclear how the incoming Trump administration will proceed . The 1,200 miles Dakota Access Pipeline , owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP , is largely complete , except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe , a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River , the longest river in North America . In a statement , Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II said the tribe welcomed the decision as very good news , but he also sounded a note of concern regarding what might happen after Jan. 20 . Treaties are paramount law and must be respected , and we welcome dialogue on how to continue to honor that moving forward . Meanwhile , veterans from all branches of the United States Armed Forces have been arriving for days at Standing Rock to join in the anti-pipelin protest . They came in waves of buses , cars , trailers and even planes , to offer their support to the tribes in its many months-long resistance to protect its drinking water and sacred sites . Activists carry the American Indian Movement flag at a protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline . Seatte , WA ; September 16 , 2016 . Gonzalez himself is a Vietnam veteran who was awarded the Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts . Dennis Bernstein : Thanks for joining us from Standing Rock , Matt Howard . Tell us why you traveled there with thousands of other vets . Matt Howard : Thanks for having me . Both in the ways the police departments are militarized , but also the way the corporations are utilizing their own kind of private military , to push their extractive industries . The Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- under construction -RRB- near Campbell , South Dakota . July 1 , 2016 . And the entire state of North Dakota , in conjunction with what seems like could be federal agencies at times , and then obviously the Energy Transfer partners . I think that what feels really powerful , to me , is that this is potentially the first time that veterans and military members have stood on the right side of this kind of struggle , and are standing on the side of indigenous communities . DB : Tell us a little bit about how this plan came together . And in the middle of the circles , one indigenous veteran , one Native American veteran after another , talked about their experiences , in terms of going to foreign countries , Vietnam , Iraq , Afghanistan , and fighting for all the people , in sort of appealing in that context . And there is something about the way that Standing Rock is almost being treated as an occupied country , similar to Iraq , similar to Afghanistan . Security forces protecting the Dakota Access pipeline construction spray protesters with pepper spray . Spotlights everywhere , concertina wire over on the line , barricades , helicopters and planes buzzing overhead all night long , all day long . The idea that people were put in these little outdoor cages , and had their alleged crimes written right on their bodies is pretty profound . MH : Absolutely . We had heard reports of people actually getting gear that looked like it was coming to supply the camp was literally being confiscated , which is obviously entirely illegal . DB : It sounds like a blockade . MH : Right , exactly . I believe I saw something recently that the ACLU is already on that . Activists gather in Seattle to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline , September 2016 . -LRB- John Duffy Flickr -RRB- DB : And help us , before we say goodbye , help us put a human face on this . I know we were there just before the snow storm hit , and people were incredibly focused and engaged , in preparing for a very difficult winter . MH : Yeah , I think so , for the most part . There are definitely folks that have the kind of three season tents , or worse , that were not prepared for a snowstorm , but fortunately there are a lot of communal sleeping tents , that were set up for people . Fortunately , this snow storm has let up . Despite that , we definitely encourage anybody who is planning on coming out to not just come here prepared but come here to leave things . Fracking EFFECTS crucial sources of water every where it takes place . Bill Bodden December 6 , 2016 at 6:43 pm As a veteran I met some admirable people during my service and others I would have disowned if they were relatives , so I never bought this sloppy talk , as one Congressperson put it after the illegal war on Iraq was under way , about everyone in uniform being a hero , but I believe these vets who stood with the Native Americans at Standing Rock are among the best who ever served in our military . Unfortunately , at this time most Americans are in consumer mode for the season and will learn very little of the many lessons this vigil at Standing Rocks has revealed . Hopefully , some will get some appreciation of one of the more obvious : You can fight city hall . This is a lesson we will probably have to recall many times during the Trump presidency . Akech December 6 , 2016 at 8:32 pm Having drinkable water , clean air to breathe and a small piece of non-polluted land to raise some chicken , goats , sheep and grow some edible vegetables should be every American and every citizen of the world national interest . However , what is happening to the Native Americans at Standing Rock is a clear indication that only a few groups of Americans have the unfettered rights to access every piece of land mass they set their eyes on , allowing them to do whatever they desire . They are even ready and willing to use brutal force if anyone dares to stand in the way . There are banks financing this project . Remember this victory as it will soon be quickly forgotten in the corporate establishment mass media . We need just this sort of mobilization when Paul Ryan and his Ayn Rand disciples go after Social Security and the last remnants of progressive taxation , and to raise the minimum wage to a family supporting living wage . Many more battles are looming . The millions of us struggling to get by have just witnessed the power of us all and an example of the driving motor force of history . John December 6 , 2016 at 11:20 am Unfortunately , this is not the end . Energy Transfer Partners , the greedy genocidalists building the pipeline , have stated that they will go ahead without a permit and just consider the fine a business cost . Comments are closed .
