She attended a conference about the water in which the internationally known speaker , Dr. Masaru Emoto said , the very least we should do every day , is to speak to the water : Water , we love you . We thank you . We respect you . So she did this . Every day on their drive to drop Mashkoonce -LRB- Little Elk -RRB- to school , they passed a body of water . And every day they said these words to the water as they drove by . They made games by saying it in different voices and then would say it as fast as they could . So , Dorene asked her daughter 's language teacher to write it in Ojibwemowin . Dorene had the words taped to the car visor as they learned the words . So she thought about it and came up with the tune . They sang this song to the water every morning on their drive to school . It is sung like a lullaby and we do n't use shakers or drums . Doreen and her grandson , Mashkoonce , give permission for everyone to share this song ... sing it to the water every day .
