Theirs was the first jury trial related to the nine-month-long pipeline protests . Benjamin Schapiro , 30 , of Ohio , and Steven Voliva , 62 , of Washington , were arrested on September 27 and charged with blocking a highway in Morton County . On Tuesday , a jury found them guilty of two class-B misdemeanors , the Bismarck Tribune reported . The evidence at the trial consisted of the testimony by three law enforcement officers who were present on North Dakota Highway 6 on that day , the Tribune reported . Voliva is a part-Yupik retired artist , and Shapiro is a teacher and farmer . Both said they were protesting the potential environmental consequences of the pipeline . Court-appointed attorneys for the two men opposed the court-awarded fees , saying they did not track their hours and that their clients were indigent . After months of protests , on December 4 the Army Corps of Engineers reversed the decision to grant a construction easement to Dakota Access LLC , a subsidiary of Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners . Between August and December , local and state law enforcement officers arrested nearly 600 people in connection to the protests . A trial of 10 protesters had to be postponed on Monday , after a judge in Mandan , North Dakota learned that some of the evidence was not provided to defense attorneys . All rights reserved .
