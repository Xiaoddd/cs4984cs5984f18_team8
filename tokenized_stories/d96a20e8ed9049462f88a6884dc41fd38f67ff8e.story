The deployment of 17 WSP -LRB- Wisconsin State Patrol -RRB- personnel syncs with a government-imposed deadline for protests to end . Similar to a blockade of food , water , and supplies months ago , this new eviction is framed as a safety precaution . Following eviction orders , 150 protesters marched out arm-in-arm . According to Wisconsin State Journal , ceremonial fires were lit shortly before arrests began . Numerous sources have reported about 10 water protectors arrested for not leaving . Officials claim the 17 WSP personnel volunteered for a nine-day stint at the reservation . Currently , personnel are arriving as arrests , raids , and surveillance continues . Last time , Wisconsin law enforcement pulled out after mass outrage back home . That force coalesced over 40 officers from various departments , including WSP . Upon returning , however , Wisconsin EMAC -LRB- Emergency Management Assistance Compact -RRB- produced a telling after-action report . Nevertheless , Wisconsin sought to learn from Standing Rock for similar future actions . The Fifth Column News covered these recommendations , among which included training officers in videography . In the most recent DAPL -LRB- Dakota Access Pipeline -RRB- raids , officers are doing just that . According to Wisconsin State Journal , the officers sent to Standing Rock were all volunteers . New blazes were then lit by officers , which many incorrectly believed were tipis . Although no clashes occurred , officers did sport Trump 2016 stickers on some vehicles which made protesters uneasy . Officers then left for the opposite hills , setting up entrenched positions until raiding the camp days ago .
