As far as California is from Standing Rock , many of the issues Native peoples face in each place are parallel . Historical dispossession still affects Indigenous peoples ; sacred sites are being destroyed ; clean water is a precious and sometimes endangered resource ; and tribes remain resilient and resistant in the face of these challenges . This sparked our proposal to mount a quick-turnaround -LRB- by museum standards -RRB- mini-exhibition , Standing Rock : Art and Solidarity , which opens Saturday , May 20 . As a cultural history institution , the Autry is not the best venue to detail the probability of a pipeline leaking or the economics of oil . We can also place these news events in the context of much deeper histories . And we can offer visitors the opportunity to stand in the presence of artworks and artifacts that convey the energy of the movement and the profound questions it raises . Indigenous people from around North America and around the world , joined by non-Native allies , traveled to rural North Dakota or otherwise supported the water protectors . Intertribal solidarity is nothing new , but at this scale it may be unprecedented . Photo : courtesy Cannupa Hanska Luger . The environmental movement , which has too often ignored or disparaged Native perspectives , recognized Native leadership in a new way . Of course , part of that attention sprang from the violent responses of security and law enforcement . While the violence was shocking to many non-Native observers , many Native people I have spoken with were outraged , but not surprised . As most of us know in general terms , American history holds a long trail of violence against Native peoples . Looking at those histories more closely , it is remarkable how often that violence accompanied natural resource extraction . West enumerates the violence that followed the California gold strike of 1848 -LRB- which led to out-and-out genocide -RRB- , the Colorado strike of 1859 -LRB- which led to wars on the Cheyenne and Arapaho peoples , including the Sand Creek Massacre -RRB- , the Arizona strike of 1863 -LRB- leading to wars on Apache groups -RRB- , and the two strikes , in Montana and South Dakota , that led to wars with Lakota peoples in 1868 and 1876 -LRB- including the Battle of Little Bighorn -RRB- . Even Cherokee removal and the Trail of Tears were preceded by a gold rush in Georgia in 1829 . Southwest Museum of the American Indian Collection , Autry Museum . We must not oversimplify things , and a museum display may run some risk of doing so . Many Native people in fact favor energy extraction as a means of developing economic and political sovereignty . The Mandan-Hidatsa-Arikara Nation has taken part in the Bakken boom ; others from Oklahoma to Montana have pursued oil , gas , coal , and other fossil fuels over the past century .
