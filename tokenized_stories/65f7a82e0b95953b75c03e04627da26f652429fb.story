The group contends that the Chippewa Tribe should have a say in the pipeline 's right of way because of the potential harm to tribal members ' right to fish , hunt and gather wild rice in ceded , off-reservation territory . The group has suggested building the pipeline south of Interstate 94 to avoid wild rice lakes . Judge Eric Lipman , who is reviewing the pipeline project for the state Public Utilities Commission , ruled Tuesday that an 1855 treaty ceding Chippewa lands in Minnesota to the U.S. government does not bar later acquisition of a route . At a hearing earlier this month in St. Paul , Honor the Earth attorney Frank Bibeau and co-counsel Peter Erlinder of the International Humanitarian Law Institute had argued for a treaty-derived role in pipeline siting decisions . Enbridge attorney Christine Brusven countered that there is no precedent for such a step , which would affect large energy projects across northern Minnesota . In an e-mailed statement , Enbridge spokeswoman Lorraine Little said the company is reviewing the order , and will continue the regulatory process with a goal of gaining approval and beginning construction early next year . This likely is n't the end of the legal battle , although Bibeau and Erlinder said Wednesday that they have not decided the next step . The attorneys said the legal issue could land in state court , federal court or tribal court . LaDuke and Bibeau are members of the White Earth Band . Most treaty rights battles have been decided in federal court . In Minnesota 's most famous case , the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed in 1999 that the Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa and seven other Chippewa bands retained hunting , fishing and gathering rights under an 1837 treaty on lands and lakes ceded by the tribes in central Minnesota . Federal judges in Washington state have twice sided with protecting treaty fishing rights from harm by other activities , including denial of a permit to a commercial fish farm . In the Minnesota pipeline case , Lipman said that evidence presented so far does not support the claim that treaty rights will be harmed . If Chippewa property rights were impaired by the pipeline , he wrote , the remedy would be to compensate the Indians . Erlinder said the judge recognized that Chippewa bands have property rights under treaties . welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive , mutually respectful exchanges over news topics .
