World population From Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search The total number of living humans on Earth An editor has expressed concern that this article may have a number of irrelevant citations . Please help improve this article by verifying these references and challenge any that are not reliable or do not support the article . Though it is not permanently inhabited by any fixed population , Antarctica has a small , fluctuating international population based mainly in polar science stations . Even earlier , genetic evidence suggests humans may have gone through a population bottleneck of between 1,000 and 10,000 people about 70,000 BC , according to the Toba catastrophe theory . Modern era Map showing urban areas with at least one million inhabitants in 2006 . Many countries in the developing world have experienced extremely rapid population growth since the early 20th century , due to economic development and improvements in public health . According to current projections , the global population will reach eight billion by 2024 , and is likely to reach around nine billion by 2042 . Projected figures vary depending on underlying statistical assumptions and the variables used in projection calculations , especially the fertility variable . There is no estimation for the exact day or month the world 's population surpassed one or two billion . The points at which it reached three and four billion were not officially noted , but the International Database of the United States Census Bureau placed them in July 1959 and April 1974 respectively . In 2015 , the World Health Organization estimated the average global life expectancy as 71.4 years . Most densely populated countries Further information : List of countries and dependencies by population density The tables below list the world 's most densely populated countries , both in absolute terms and in comparison to their total populations . Population density -LRB- people per km 2 -RRB- map of the world in 1994 . Red and pink areas denote regions of highest population density . 10 most densely populated countries -LRB- with population above 5 million -RRB- Rank Country Population Area -LRB- km2 -RRB- Density -LRB- Pop . per km2 -RRB- 1 Singapore 5,612,300 710 7,905 2 Bangladesh 165,210,000 143,998 1,147 3 Taiwan 23,572,415 36,193 651 4 Lebanon 6,093,509 10,452 583 5 South Korea 51,635,256 99,538 519 6 Rwanda 12,001,136 26,338 456 7 Netherlands 17,260,000 41,526 416 8 Haiti 11,112,945 27,065 411 9 India 1,337,120,000 3,287,240 407 10 Israel 8,920,000 22,072 404 Countries ranking highly in both total population -LRB- more than 20 million people -RRB- and population density -LRB- more than 250 people per square kilometer -RRB- : Rank Country Population Area -LRB- km2 -RRB- Density -LRB- Pop . The vertical axis is logarithmic and is in millions of people . Population size fluctuates at differing rates in differing regions . Nonetheless , population growth is the long-standing trend on all inhabited continents , as well as in most individual states . During the 20th century , the global population saw its greatest increase in known history , rising from about 1.6 billion in 1900 to over 6 billion in 2000 . By 2000 , there were approximately ten times as many people on Earth as there had been in 1700 . A world map showing global variations in fertility rate per woman , according to the CIA World Factbook 's 2015 data . In 2006 , the United Nations stated that the rate of population growth was visibly diminishing due to the ongoing global demographic transition . An alternative scenario is given by the statistician Jorgen Randers , who argues that traditional projections insufficiently take into account the downward impact of global urbanization on fertility . The shaded regions correspond to the range of projections by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs . The availability of historical population figures varies by region . Latin America comprises Mexico , Central America , the Caribbean , and South America . Projections Main articles : World population estimates and Projections of population growth Long-term global population growth is difficult to predict . The UN has issued multiple projections of future world population , based on different assumptions . From 2000 to 2005 , the UN consistently revised these projections downward , until the 2006 revision , issued on March 14 , 2007 , revised the 2050 mid-range estimate upwards by 273 million . Average global birth rates are declining fast , but vary greatly between developed countries -LRB- where birth rates are often at or below replacement levels -RRB- and developing countries -LRB- where birth rates typically remain high -RRB- . Different ethnicities also display varying birth rates . Death rates can change rapidly due to disease epidemics , wars and other mass catastrophes , or advances in medicine . -LRB- millions -RRB- Difference USCB est. . The hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development . The transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the demographic transition . During the 2nd millennium , each doubling took roughly half as long as the previous doubling , fitting the hyperbolic growth model mentioned above .

Researchers predict that similar cases of resource scarcity will grow more common as the world population increases . Malthus wrote the essay to refute what he considered the unattainable utopian ideas of William Godwin and Marquis de Condorcet , as presented in Political Justice and The Future Progress of the Human Mind . The predictions of Ehrlich and other neo-Malthusians were vigorously challenged by a number of economists , notably Julian Lincoln Simon , and advances in agriculture , collectively known as the Green Revolution , forestalled any potential global famine in the late 20th century . The world population has grown by over four billion since the beginning of the Green Revolution , but food production has so far kept pace with population growth . However , oil prices then fell sharply . The situation has continued to worsen , as at the time of the 1994 IAP statement , the world population stood at 5.5 billion and lower-bound scenarios predicted a peak of 7.8 billion by 2050 , a number that current estimates state will be reached in the late 2020s . Population control Main article : Human population planning India is predicted to overtake China as the world 's most populous country by 2022 . Human population control is the practice of intervening to alter the rate of population growth . Historically , human population control has been implemented by limiting a region 's birth rate , by voluntary contraception or by government mandate . It has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of poverty , environmental concerns , and religious reasons . The University of Nebraska publication Green Illusions argues that population control to alleviate environmental pressures need not be coercive . Of the territorial claims in Antarctica , the Ross Dependency has the largest population . It excludes Taiwan and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau . www.worldometers.info .
