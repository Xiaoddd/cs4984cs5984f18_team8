-LRB- Photo : Greenpeace Canada -RRB- Indigenous peoples and climate campaigners scored a major victory in Canada on Thursday as the Federal Court of Appeals ruled that the government 's review of the controversial Trans Mountain Pipeline , a project of Kinder Morgan , did not adequately consult with First Nations before greenlighting the project . This is the consequence of the unholy alliance between the federal government and corporations taking shortcuts through consultation . My faith in the judicial system is somewhat restored today . As the Financial Post reports : The decision means the National Energy Board will have to redo its review of Kinder Morgan Canada 's project . The court also concludes that the federal government failed in its duty to engage in meaningful consultations with First Nations before giving the green light to the project . That decision means the government will have to redo part of its consultations with Indigenous groups . Though the widely criticized effort by the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to purchase the pipeline from Kinder Morgan has not been completed , company shareholders officially approved the sale barely an hour after the Federal Court of Appeals ruling was made public . It is time for real political leadership that truly respects Indigenous rights , does not bow to the interests of Big Oil , and prioritizes all of our interests in setting us on a path to a sustainable economy and environment . The Court of Appeal just quashed the approval of the TransMountain pipeline meaning years of delays .
