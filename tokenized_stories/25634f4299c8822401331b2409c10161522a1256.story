The protesters were locked together and blocked the entrance to the bank in a direct action against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . The pipeline will cross Standing Rock Sioux Tribal land and under the Missouri River , as well as eight other major waterways . Over the past few months , the Water Protectors have occupied the route of the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- to prevent its construction . As the months have passed , the site has become increasingly militarized . On Sunday night , tensions boiled over and reports surfaced that the police used water cannons , rubber bullets , tear gas , and pepper bombs in below freezing temperatures on over 400 people protecting the land from the DAPL , injuring over 150 people . They told BUST that the risks they were about to take were minimal in comparison to what the people in North Dakota were sacrificing . They felt it was imperative to stand with indigenous rights and protect the environment . In the past 24 hours , the non-violent actions of Water Protectors have been met with tear gas , concussion grenades , and water cannons . Citibank , Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ , and Mizuho Bank are three other investors , according to Democracy Now . If TD Bank withdrew its assets as well , the project could dry up , and activists believe it will send a message that their business , which prides itself on supporting responsible energy development , is not going to fund a project that could destroy the environment and negatively impact indigenous people . There has been a call to action by indigenous women to put pressure on Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- the parent company of the Dakota Access Pipeline -RRB- , where it will hurt most : their investors . Abigail Meinen , another participant , said in the release . They are the guardians of the water , the life-giving force of the Earth . The protestors felt they wanted to use their privilege as white women to make a stance with indigenous women , who have been on the front line from day one , and who have sacrificed such a tremendous amount in order to prevent DAPL . They shut down the bank for an hour and drew a crowd of more than 20 people . The Army Corps of Engineers , which is the federal agency that oversees the project , recently released a statement that more analysis and conversation with the Standing Rock Sioux Nation is needed in order to move forward with the pipeline . ETP fired back and said they are suing the government in order to complete DAPL . 6 women were arrested Monday morning , including the 3 women chained to the bank , 2 women holding the sign , and a sixth woman who was involved . This is part of a broader solidarity movement that has been occurring all over the country . A week of action has been called to protest the banks involved starting on November 25th to Dec 1st to make a stance against DAPL .
