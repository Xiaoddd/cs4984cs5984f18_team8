On India 's social media if you 're trending Israel , then it 's a very big deal , Saxena says . When I get Israel trending , I know how much hard work it takes . Saxena is what is called in India an internet Hindu : a vast and incalculable army of right-wing Hindu nationalists dominating the country 's political discourse . Social media campaigns in India were credited with helping Modi and his Bhartiya Janta Party win the 2014 election in a landslide . These campaigns further encouraged nationalists on the Indian internet . 1 -RRB- Go to the link . 2 -RRB- Click on ` Israel Filter ' 3 -RRB- Upload your Photo then It 'll be add Israel Flag Filter . 4 -RRB- Download it 5 -RRB- Make it your DP in support of Israel for 1 day . I have an attachment to Israel , and that 's why I do this . I dont get anything , he says . In the days leading up to Netanyahu 's visit , he tried to find an app that could add a filter of the Indian and Israeli flags to Twitter profile photos . There wasnt enough time to merge the two , so he settled for the Israeli blue and white . Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga , now a BJP spokesman in Delhi , was then a famously aggressive internet Hindu . He worked on that campaign , and held a solidarity protest for Israel . Only 200 people showed up , but they made a human chain and carried banners saying India and Israel were united against terrorism . Israel . Israel . Israel . Social media is occupied by Hindutva 's people , adds former journalist Manoj Joshi , referring to the main form of Hindu nationalism in India . He says it 's very hard to ascertain how widespread these ideas are beyond Hindu nationalists . But the similarity between Israel and India , Joshi says , is a kind of imagined similarity . Mainstream Indians are also very affected by these majoritarian kind of ideas , he says . All they see is that Israel has fought so well , Israel has dealt with its Muslims so well , not realizing that the reality is something else . Meaning Israel is a garrison state constantly under pressure , constantly living with insecurity . Few reporters on the ground This preoccupation with Israel , though , is largely invisible in the world outside social media . The Indian media is notoriously insular . The only Indian correspondent in Israel is a reporter for the news agency Press Trust of India , and prominent newspapers rely on Western news agencies . And although he thinks that there is tremendous interest in Israel among many Indians , our understanding of Israel is very limited . Even among informed people , says P.R. Kumaraswamy , a professor of Middle Eastern studies specializing in Israel at New Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University . Hindu nationalists have vehemently admired and supported Israel since the 1940s . But Hindutva was a very small force in the 40s , and therefore a very small number of people were arguing on those lines , he says . But today it is seen as a large discourse , so the admiration is proportionately increased . Last month , Abhijit Iyer-Mitra , a senior fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies in New Delhi , wrote a piece criticizing India 's vote in the UN General Assembly . He rejected India 's vote that condemned Washington 's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel . When I wrote that piece I was expecting to get abused as usual when I criticize this government , he says . But instead , among Hindu nationalists , Indias vote was seen as a betrayal by the government . Nationalists tweeted to External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj expressing their disappointment . And they also tweeted something to Netanyahu : apologies . In recent days , the apologies have been replaced by excitement over Netanyahu 's visit . Hes also putting together a video on why Israel is our best friend and why India runs away from Israel when that country is doing so much for us . The greatest level of sympathy for Israel was found in India , he says , referring to a survey of people in 13 countries including the United States , Britain , Canada , France , China and Russia . I want that in future surveys , this 58 percent turns into 90 percent . Last time he checked with the filter creators , 1,030 people had added the filter -LRB- though he doesnt know how many of them are in India -RRB- . And as he promised , Saxena hosted an Israeli party on the streets in south Delhi . He handed out tea and samosas to everyone in the street , from rickshaw drivers to children . When the samosas ran out , he replaced them with khichri , a dish of rice and lentils . Your comment was successfully submitted and will be published in accordance with site policy .
