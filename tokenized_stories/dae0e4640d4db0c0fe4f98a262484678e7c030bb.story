fbq -LRB- ` track ' , ` PageView ' -RRB- ; RL Miller of Climate Hawks Vote with the California version of the No Dirty Money pledge Our democracy is being drowned by a tidal wave of carbon cash . Money from the fossil fuel industry has brought progress on climate action to a standstill . The way we end that is by asking public officials , and candidates running for elected office , to stop taking dirty money from oil , gas , and coal companies . Renewables are cheaper , cleaner , and more profitable , and create more jobs without devastating the environment or the health of our citizens . Please stop being bought by these immoral money-grubbing polluters and stand for what is right for our state and country .
