As a result , corporations are able to drill , frack , farm and fell timber on Native lands , paying landowners little in return . Companies like Koch Industries and Walmart , however , reap huge profits . On the way , the line crosses a 160-acre plot of Navajo reservation land owned by 88-year-old Mary Tom and dozens of her family members . After years of negotiations with family members , the company invited just a handful of them , including Tom , to an October 2013 meeting at the El Rancho Hotel in Gallup . The purpose of the gathering : Get the signatures needed to renew the right of way for another 20 years . Tribes own about 44 million of those acres ; individuals like Mary Tom own the rest . The BIA arranges business deals on Native land and is obligated by law to negotiate the best possible terms for landowners like Tom . But In These Times found that instead , the agency appears to make it cheap and easy for outsiders to exploit Native resources . At the 2013 luncheon at the El Rancho Hotel , BIA and company officials urged Tom to agree to the renewal , says Tovar . She says she was soon escorted out by a Western Refining representative . She asked the whereabouts of other trusted family members , but they had not been invited either . When businesses negotiate leases or rights of way , landowners often get a pittance in return . Some received as little as a few pennies . Meanwhile , access to the land is crucial to a host of companies and individual operators that drill , frack , farm and fell timber in Indian country . The list of companies that profit from access to Native land includes Koch Industries , Wal-Mart , Dollar General and many more . Native landowners are on an uneven playing field when they negotiate with corporations , and documents and interviews obtained by In These Times suggest the BIA does little to level it . And when landowners complain of harassment or foul play by corporations , the BIA may sometimes look the other way . From the September 2016 Issue This reporting was made possible by a grant from the Leonard C. Goodman Institute for Investigative Reporting . Corporate manifest destiny These events are taking place in the 21st century , but they sound like something out of centuries past , when the federal government encouraged its Indian Agents and others to cheat Natives under cover of law . Between the earliest days of the American republic and the end of the 19th century , millions of acres of Native land were signed away through treaties or stolen by force . The 1887 General Allotment Act , aka the Dawes Act , set the stage for what would become the prime tactic outsiders use to extract profit from Native land : exploitative leasing . Some tracts were given to tribal members and the rest declared surplus and sold to settlers . The Bureau of Indian Affairs The Bureau of Indian Affairs -LRB- BIA -RRB- is the agency that manages 55 million acres of land the federal government holds in trust for Native owners . Established in 1824 , the agency is tasked with promoting economic opportunity on Native land . The BIA arranges deals that allow outside companies and individual operators to use Native land and resources , but landowners believe they often get the short end of the stick . Soon after , Congress authorized leasing of allotted land to non-Natives , with federal agencies controlling the process and the proceeds . Advocates for Native land rights say that this divide-and-conquer strategy left Native landowners isolated and exceedingly vulnerable to exploitation . Many remaining Native lands now sit atop valuable oil and gas reserves , and stories abound of giant corporations cutting questionable deals . Native landowners also report being stalked and harassed by oil companies seeking their signatures . He refused to sign , wishing to consult family . An agent came to his house . He refused again . With few or no businesses on reservations , tribes and tribal members also must look to border towns for goods and services . Established in 1824 , the agency is tasked with promoting economic opportunity on Native land . Mary Tom Tom co-owns a 160-acre plot of Navajo reservation land in New Mexico along with dozens of her family members . In October 2013 , Tom , 88 , was invited to a meeting at the El Rancho Hotel in Gallup , New Mexico with representatives of the Texas-based oil company Western Refining , as well as staff from the local BIA office . Some of her family members were never invited to the meeting , and say that the BIA allowed Western Refining to isolate Tom and pressure the non-English-speaking elder into signing off on the deal . In recent years , Native landowners have shown in court that they were getting not just a raw deal , but a fraudulent one . Billions of dollars were missing . Documents had disappeared . Meanwhile , similar land off the reservation garnered 10 to 20 times as much . Terry Beckwith , a realty expert with ICC Indian Enterprises and a Quinault Indian Nation member , says that the BIA-supervised leasing and right-of-way processes make it easy to lowball landowners . For starters , the agency typically allows prospective lessees to hire their own appraiser to determine the fair market value of the land . Native landowners and advocates contacted by In These Times agreed . The BIA manages an intricate leasing process , made exceptionally complex by the fact that some allotments have hundreds or even thousands of co-owners . Instead , Native people were made subject to state laws for those who died without a will . Gopher struggled to get more information from the BIA , and eventually the deal went forward despite her objections . As a result , all eligible heirs inherited when an allotment owner died . With each generation , the number of owners multiplied , each owning his or her own unique percentage of the whole . When an allotment has a large number of co-owners , the BIA has even more control . It can approve a deal even without the consent of a majority of landowners . Beckwith , who gives seminars for Native landowners nationwide to help them navigate the leasing process , says the BIA frequently fails to provide them with sufficient information . At one of his sessions , for example , Beckwith saw the oil lease of an attendee from the Bakken region in North Dakota . Beckwith advised him and other attendees to rescind their consent and ask for proper agreements . She took the matter to the Interior Board of Indian Appeals -LRB- IBIA -RRB- , the Interior Department administrative court for Native claims . Then , when Gopher used the completed record to raise her objections , the court told her she was too late : She should have raised them earlier . The deal went forward despite her complaints . But a number of family members had refused to consent . In September 2010 , Patrick and his brother Frank Adakai joined Tovar and other relatives in filing a lawsuit with the IBIA . Western Refining went back for more signatures . For these gatherings , the BIA sent letters to all landowners , letting them know the times and locations . This has created rifts among the co-owners of the land , he says . In September , the company wrote to the BIA of its plans to hold a luncheon with certain landowners whose consent it needed , including Mary Tom . When asked about these communications , Nedra Darling , a spokesperson for the BIA , told In These Times that the BIA did not coordinate with the oil company ahead of the luncheon , or help prevent family members from attending it . At the meeting , Tom asked for her older brother and her nephew Patrick . Roberta Tovar phoned Patrick , who lives several hours from Gallup , and told him what was going on . Patrick immediately asked Tovar to hand the phone to a BIA official . No one would listen to him , he says . Tovar claims a Western Refining employee escorted her and her father out of the meeting . They asked for a sign-in sheet from the meeting . Darling says no . The landowners who had filed the lawsuit continued to reach out to the company to attempt to negotiate a better deal . But landowners In These Times spoke to , BIA documents and IBIA court decisions reveal that the Freedom of Information Act must often be used to obtain needed documents . Complicating matters further , since 2014 Western Refining has brought two federal lawsuits seeking to resolve the situation . He says they should be updated and expanded to include the purpose and time span of the agreement , remedies in case of damage to the land , such as an oil spill , and other necessary items . One solution is to return control of land and resources to tribes , reversing some of the worst effects of allotment , including fractionation . By 2015 , tribes had regained and placed in trust 1.5 million acres via Cobell , according to the Interior Department . In South Dakota , the Rosebud Sioux Tribe operates the Tribal Land Enterprise -LRB- TLE -RRB- , a land buyback program that long predates that set up by Cobell . Since its establishment in 1943 , TLE has acquired about a million acres . These include a grocery store on a reservation where there are few , 600 units of badly needed housing and a wind farm . All of this is done with an eye on the future , says Little Elk . In the shorter term , Patrick Adakai and his relatives continue to fight Western Refining in court .
