The incidents occurred in November and December , either in or near the protest camp near the mouth of the Cannonball River , Timian said . Timian said he believes both incidents occurred on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land . Charged with unlawful possession of big game in the December incident were Sean Carney of Center Conway , N.H. , and Danny LeClaire of Pocatello , Idaho . North Dakota authorities have issued warrants for their arrest , but the men are believed to have left the state . The two were identified in a photo skinning a deer they likely were n't licensed to possess . Charged with unlawful possession of big game in connection with the second incident , which occurred in November , were William Larkin of Olean , N.Y. , and William Bighorse of Freeville , N.Y. . The two were charged based on a video showing a whitetail buck being dragged from the Cannonball River in November . The video then shows the men killing the buck by stabbing it with a knife and then suffocating it in the mud . Authorities still are trying to identify other suspects in the video , which was released to the public Jan. 5 . Arrest warrants for Larkin and Bighorse were issued , but they also are believed to be out of state . Public 's help According to Timian , the charges resulted from an investigation that began in December , when Game and Fish received a photograph of deer that may have been taken illegally . The department then issued a news release seeking the public 's help in identifying the people in the photo . That 's how they found out about the November incident . Game and Fish then released the video asking for additional information . Through all of that , authorities were able to identify Larkin and Bighorse , Timian said . In both cases , Timian said , the department was able to collect enough information to convince the Morton County state 's attorney to pursue charges . Because the men likely have left the state , they potentially could lose their hunting and fishing privileges nationwide because of a multi-state agreement called the Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact , in which violations that occur in one member state are recognized as violations in all member states . North Dakota , New York , New Hampshire and Idaho all are members of the compact . Anyone witnessing a potential hunting or fishing violation in North Dakota should call the state 's Report All Poachers hotline at -LRB-800-RRB-Â 472-2121 .
