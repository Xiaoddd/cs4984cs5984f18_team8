Little did the Cass County sheriff know that his professional life was about to be upended . The call was from a fellow sheriff asking for help in dealing with the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline in Morton County , just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . Laney expected the altercation would last , at most , two weeks and he and his deputies would soon be back home . In almost three decades in law enforcement , as a Fargo police officer and as sheriff , Laney has faced armed standoffs , the fiery oil train derailment near Casselton and potentially devastating floods . He prayed every night that nobody would be hurt . Once , on the eve of what he predicted would be an especially confrontational day , when officers would try to move back the protest line , he got up in the middle of the night and knelt beside his motel room bed and prayed . Because of his experience and training in incident response command , Laney quickly emerged as one of the leading , and most visible , law enforcement officers on the scene . It was not a role that he sought , but Laney said he felt a sense of obligation to stick with the job . Laney said . Laney said he and his fellow officers were routinely thanked by Bismarck-Mandan residents who were grateful for their assistance . Once home , Laney said the vast majority of his Cass County constituents supported the active role he and his office took in the protest response . The most notable exception , he said , was a talk radio host who criticized his role . Echoing earlier comments by former Gov. Jack Dalrymple , Laney said that , despite criticism from protesters and sympathizers , and portrayals on social media , he believes officers acted with restraint in dealing with sometimes belligerent protesters . The dogs , which were not licensed in North Dakota , bit several protesters . It was frustrating to be accused of being the security force for the pipeline company , Laney said . But a leading activist involved in the pipeline protests maintains that police were not restrained , acted provocatively and fired rubber bullets , beanbag charges and used stun grenades -- allegations Laney and other law enforcement officials deny . In time , with help from the National Sheriffs Association , the peace officers were able to counter with their own photographs , videos and messages , he said .
