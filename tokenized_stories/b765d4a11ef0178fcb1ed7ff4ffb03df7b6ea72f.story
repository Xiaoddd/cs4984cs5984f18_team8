A banner flaps in the wind at the Dakota Access Pipeline protest camp near Cannon Ball , North Dakota , on Jan. 24 . A group of concerned citizens started the online petition last December at Change.org . Japan , another nongovernmental organization . The petition said the three banks are violating their own human rights values . All three have adopted the so-called Equator Principle that determines , assesses and manages environmental and social risk in project financing . The delivery of the petition in Tokyo came as Trump is upping efforts to undo the legacy of his predecessor , President Barack Obama . But Trump ordered the secretary of the army to advance construction as soon as possible after his swearing-in . Energy Transfer Partners say it will carry 470,000 barrels of oil a day from the oil fields of western North Dakota to Illinois and create thousands of construction jobs and fuel the economy . But members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and environmental groups view the project as threatening the environment and their culture . The route crosses their ancestral lands , and there is concern about environmental damage should it rupture near the Missouri River . There have been massive protests against construction near the site , and the United Nations last October started an investigation on potential human rights violations against Native American protesters by North Dakota law enforcement officials . But on Monday a U.S. court judge denied a restraining order that would have suspended the construction , and North Dakota Gov. Doug Bergum Thursday ordered the protesters to evacuate their camp .
