The snow melts a little , only to refreeze into sheets of black and white ice that covers every surface . As you walk through camp , the snow and ice crunch under your feet , and your eyes and nostrils begin to freeze . It blows and bellows so powerfully that you can actually feel the sound down deep in your core . Here , the snow comes at you horizontally like tiny , frozen razor blades that rub your skin raw . The folks left in camp , about 500 , are defiant and strong . Many of them -LRB- like my 68 - year-old mother-in-law who lives in a ger , round tent covered with skins , in the Kul Wicasa camp -RRB- are elders who have seen so many broken promises from federal and IRA governments , that they are determined to stay and fight for the water , the land , the wildlife , and the treaties . They are determined to stand against the continued cultural , environmental , and physical genocide of Indigenous peoples . Linda Black Elk Soon , due to the floodplain , everyone will have to leave the current location of the All Nations and Rosebud camps . Abandoning camp is out of the question . No . We must remain hopeful . We have to start somewhere . Complete divestment from fossil fuels will take decades , but we have to begin now . We have to give our children a choice .

And it is built off the ground so animals can get under it in places . I would guess this would be the same here . They are more interested in their tech items or being torn between the two worlds . The National Defense Authorization Act was in a form of an Executive Order signed in 2012 by Obama and had not been signed into law . NDAA is a life-threatening incarceration -LRB- clearly explained by Rachel Maddow on her 2012 Show -RRB- . If true the arrestee will not have an attorney nor be heard in the court of law and will serve a straight 10 or more years . Micaela Ward 2 years ago The NDAA is different every year . INDIGENOUS ANGEL 2 years ago Good message and I think resistance is everyday and every step . Not everyone can make it out to these resistance camps . On my rez there is alcohol and liquor up front in the grocery stores . I mean this is the first thing you see when you walk in . Having alcohol and liquor available in the way that it is in a very remote tribal community is environmental racism . More of our people need to . Some of the greatest resistance is challenging what is on your front steps not 1,000 miles away . Might want check it out when Trump gets into the 1st 100 days of being president .
