Mark Hand Twitter May 19 , 2018 , 9:18 am SHARE Facebook Twitter Email SMS WhatsApp Share Spectra Energy prepares to drag its 42-inch diameter natural gas pipeline under the Hudson River adjacent to Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant . But in a 3-2 vote , FERC ruled Friday that federal laws do not require it to consider greenhouse gas emissions caused by the production or consumption of natural gas that would inevitably result from the approval of a pipeline project . Instead , it was tucked inside an otherwise routine decision rejecting an appeal of its approval of a pipeline project in New York proposed by Dominion Energy . Advertisement Environmental groups and climate change activists have tried for years to get federal regulators to take greenhouse gas emissions into account when they review a natural gas pipeline application . Last year , the groups finally made headway when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit told FERC to consider the effects of the greenhouse gases caused by the use of natural gas by power plant operators . Court hands pipeline opponents a major victory The permit for constructing Florida 's Sabal Trail project has been vacated . Natural gas-fired plants emit large amounts of carbon dioxide , although the emissions are 50 to 60 percent less than a typical new coal plant if the gas is used in a new , efficient natural gas power plant . The drilling and extraction of natural gas from wells , and its transportation in pipelines result in the leakage of methane , the primary component of natural gas that is much stronger than carbon dioxide at trapping heat . Each of the three members who voted to end the practice of measuring the climate impacts of building pipelines is Republican . LaFleur argued in her dissent that FERC could not simply stop analyzing the climate impact of building pipelines at the end-use level . The U.S. Court of Appeals noted that the Sabal Trail project was intended to transport natural gas to Florida power plants , some of which already existed and others that were in the planning stages . In his dissent , Glitch said the principal reason the commission does not have adequate information is because it did not ask for it . FERC has several opportunities throughout its review process of a pipeline application to request information from the pipeline developer about the source of the gas to be transported , as well as its ultimate end use . The decision also comes at a time when FERC is planning to review a nearly 20-year-old policy that guides how it decides whether to approve natural gas pipeline projects . Glick said he is particularly disappointed with the timing of the policy change , given that the broad review will include how greenhouse gas emissions are assessed . Critics of FERC , who view the agency as a rubber stamp because of its history of approving almost every natural gas infrastructure application it receives , are hoping the policy review will lead to fewer pipelines getting permits . For one reason or another , FERC has resisted calls from the public and the courts to consider climate change when considering whether to approve a natural gas pipeline project .
