Access to water is an indispensable part of life , health , and dignity . In 2010 , the UN General Assembly recognised the human right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation ; the US has yet to agree and ratify this view . On Dec 10 in Flint , Michigan , a city of 100 000 mostly impoverished African Americans , residents will have been without clean water for an incredible 443 days . What they may have saved in dollars they have reaped in illness and death by failing to ensure the new water supply was properly treated and monitored . Escherichia coli and hazardous levels of lead were subsequently found , and a spike in cases of shigellosis and Legionnaires disease , including 12 deaths , ensued . The state of emergency declared in October , 2015 , followed months of government dismissal of community concerns about water contamination . The damage to public health and trust continue ; Michigan is currently fighting a court order that requires it to provide bottled water to residents . A failure to recognise the right to water also looms in Standing Rock , North Dakota , where the battle over a proposed oil pipeline through indigenous territory will likely continue to brew . For the Sioux Nation , the pipeline would disrupt ancestral land and water sources . For proponents of the pipeline , the threat of oil spillage into water supply for drinking and agriculture appear ancillary to corporate and private interests . Disregarding the importance of water as a human right has health consequences . But it also allows for the view that water is a commodity rather than a public good , which is similarly dangerous . Privatising water supplies shifts the power from people to corporations , and can not ensure safe , clean , accessible , and affordable water supply . Recognising the right to water can .
