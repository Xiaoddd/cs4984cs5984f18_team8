To wit , Herr told the Times no one was arrested for either making or throwing explosives . Unicorn Riot , which reported from the scene that night and is camping with Standing Rock Sioux and hundreds of other water protectors , returned to Backwater Bridge on Monday and , along with detonated tear gas canisters , discovered remnants of at least one Stinger grenade . Second , video footage from multiple angles indisputably proves not only the presence of a law enforcement water cannon , but that water protectors were the intended target , and were doused immediately while fires burned next to the equipment . Police say one officer suffered a minor head injury from an object thrown by the crowd , but if that was the extent of aggression that led to an over six-hour assault with ostensibly less-than-lethal weapons , that response would be severely disproportionate , at best . Now , some 50 years after such images infuriated the world and fueled the efforts of the Civil Rights Movement , there is a confluence of historical contexts playing out in the movement to stop construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . Indeed , it would seem police chose to weaponize water as a cruel and twisted joke . Water is my first medicine . We believe it to be our first medicine . They used our medicine as a weapon . The temperature here last night was 23 degrees . A grenade exploded right as it hit Sophia in the left forearm taking most of the undersurface of her left arm with it . Both her radial and ulnar artery were completely destroyed . Her radius was shattered and a large piece of it is missing . Her medial nerve is missing a large section as well . Sophia will have surgery again tomorrow as bit by bit they try to rebuild a somewhat functioning arm and hand . The first surgery took a vein from her leg which they have implanted in her arm to take the place of the missing arteries . She will need multiple surgeries to try to gain some functional use of the arm and hand . She will be , every day for the foreseeable future , fearful of losing her arm and hand . There are no words to describe the pain of watching my daughter cry and say she was sorry for the pain she caused me and my wife . I died a thousand deaths today and will continue to do so for quite some time . Until they do speak up , put an authoritative foot down , admonish police barbarism , or affect anything substantive to address the concerns of Standing Rock Sioux water protectors and human rights advocates , the belligerence and lies will continue on a perilous course for disaster . Perhaps the politicians , the pipeline company , and , most of all , the police officers , should remember the whole world is watching avidly as centuries of exploitation and brutality repeat in real time . However , in a press release Tuesday morning , her father noted that they are trying multiple surgeries in an attempt to keep some functionality of her arm .
