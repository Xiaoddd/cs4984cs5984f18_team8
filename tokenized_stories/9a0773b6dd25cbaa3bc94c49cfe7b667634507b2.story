A combination of law enforcement and military units forced aside the last inhabitants so the remaining structures could be demolished , while a Customs and Border Protection -LRB- CBP -RRB- helicopter orbited overhead . Out-of-state law enforcement from the Wisconsin State Patrol -LRB- WSP -RRB- was also deployed under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact -LRB- EMAC -RRB- . Just after 11 am , the combined eviction forces began their approach into the camp . Between a few dozen to a hundred water protectors were estimated remaining in camp at that time , with most having left the previous day but some having returned that morning by walking across the frozen Cannonball River . Bypassing the main entrance , two Bobcat-type skid steer loaders were used to clear a path down the snowy hill into the north end of Oceti Oyate . Different teams of law enforcement roamed throughout the north end of the Oceti camp , establishing perimeters and performing military-style sweeps of tipis and other structure , entering each structure with guns drawn . Several water protectors who remained in the camp were arrested . Some of the water protectors had been engaged in prayer at the time of arrest . It was reported that other arrestees told the officers that they were violating treaties as they made arrests . A group of veterans was also arrested while passively resisting . A separate force with utility terrain vehicles entered from the east . As on the previous day , North Dakota authorities arrested several journalists who were reporting on the scene . One water protector held a position on top of large structure for some time : After the eviction force finished clearing the entire grounds of the camp , they formed a curved formation facing south , and began pushing the remaining crowd back , forcing people to retreat onto the iced-over Cannonball River . As this push advanced , law enforcement charged forward and several arrests were made , and at least six officers fell face down in the mud and snow as they attempted to run downhill towards targets who evaded them . Two water protectors were also tackled and arrested during the charge . As some water protectors remained on the frozen Cannonball River , others had gathered to observe the eviction from the Rosebud camp on the south side of the river on Standing Rock Indian Reservation land . A water protector explained to Unicorn Riot that the hasty destruction of the structures would cause more pollution needlessly . After 2:50 pm , after the North Dakota state eviction force had completed their takeover of Oceti Oyate , Bureau of Indian Affairs -LRB- BIA -RRB- federal police began to push people out of the Rosebud camp which had also reportedly been slated for eviction yesterday . Park Rangers from the United States National Parks Service -LRB- NPS -RRB- assisted BIA police in evicting the Rosebud camp on the reservation side of the Cannonball River . In an interview with Unicorn Riot , Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Chairman Harold Frazier pledged that resistance to the DAPL pipeline would continue , and he said he intended to work on getting the BIA disbanded through legislation . Smaller encampments further south , inside Standing Rock Indian Reservation territory , remain active .
