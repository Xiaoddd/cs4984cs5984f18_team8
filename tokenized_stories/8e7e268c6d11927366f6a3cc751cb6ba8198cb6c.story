The report , titled Fumes Across the Fence Line , released by the NAACP in partnership with the National Medical Association and the Clear Air Task Force , analyzes how Black communities who reside near industrial activity are impacted by air pollution . According to the report , more than one million African Americans live within a half mile of existing gas facilities which exposes them to an elevated risk of cancer due to toxic air emissions from natural gas development . Dr. Doris Browne , the president of the National Medical Association , an organization that advocates for African American physicians , said African American families who reside in these areas are disproportionately exposed to chemicals such as formaldehyde and benzene which contribute to respiratory diseases such as asthma . The report said as result of ozone increases due to natural gas emissions African American children are burdened by 138,000 asthma attacks and 101,000 lost school days each year . One community highlighted in the report is South Philadelphia , which shares a neighborhood with Philadelphia Energy Solutions , the largest fossil fuel refinery on the East Coast . The report notes that the refinery is responsible for 72 percent of the toxic air emissions in Philadelphia . Toxins released from the refinery include ammonia , hydrogen cyanide , benzene and sulfuric acid , which cause effects ranging from headaches to cancer . The report noted that Pennsylvania is one of 10 states that have the largest share of African Americans who live in close proximity to these facilities . Nationally , the study found , African Americans are 75 percent more likely than Caucasians to live in communities next to commercial facilities whose noise , odor , traffic or emissions directly affect the population .

He said about 25 million people in the country have asthma and the condition impacts two and half million African Americans and more than two million Latinos . He said repealing the Clean Power Plan could cause vulnerable communities to be disproportionately impacted by the economic opportunities that are taken away because the country will no longer be moving forward with a 21st century clean energy paradigm .
