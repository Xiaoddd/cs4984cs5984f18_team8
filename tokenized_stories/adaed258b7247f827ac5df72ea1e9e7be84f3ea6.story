Submit More : 7 history lessons that explain tribal objections to DAPL Citing increased violence between protesters and law enforcement and the increasingly harsh winter conditions , the Army Corps said it decided to close its land to the protesters who have been there since early April . Col. John Henderson , the Army Corps ' district commander , asked Archambault in a letter to tell members of his tribe , along with supporters there , to move from the property north of the Cannonball River . The letter was sent after a protester 's arm was severely injured by a concussion grenade that protesters contend was thrown by local law enforcement . Police also sprayed protesters with a fire hose in near-freezing conditions . The free speech zone the Army Corps has proposed south of the Cannonball River is slightly more than 41 acres and provides clearer jurisdiction for police , fire and medical units . The letter makes it clear that the land will be closed to the public and that anyone who enters it will be considered trespassing and could face prosecution under federal , state and local laws . Saturday , two prominent North Dakota politicians said the onus was on the federal government to close the camps . More than 400 people attended the rally to support those law enforcement officers who had been dealing with the protests . The demonstration was n't in support of or opposed to the pipeline , organizers told NBC station KFYR of Bismarck . We want unity . Bismarck police arrested more than 30 people at a mall Friday for alleged criminal trespassing involving the protesters . About 100 protesters had gathered to generate a prayer circle , which police said disrupted Black Friday shopping . Thousands of people have flocked to North Dakota to aid the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , who believe the pipeline could contaminate their water source , the Missouri River , and desecrate the tribe 's sacred sites . The company behind the pipeline , Energy Transfer Partners , says that it has taken measures to prevent such leaks , that the pipeline is far safer than transporting oil with trucks or trains , and that there is no archaeological significance to the area .
