This will be more important than ever in the Trump years . His administration announced Sunday afternoon that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has decided to deny a request for an easement so the Dakota Access Pipeline could be completed through the Missouri River . Word of the decision spread like wildfire in the Oceti Sakowin Camp and was hailed as a great victory for the environment and Native Americans all over the country and the world on social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter . It will be considered a major milestone and a historic protest in compating climate change due to global warming from the burning of fossil fuels . In the camps by the river it was hailed as a great victory by thousands of water protectors who have been blocking the construction from reaching the river north of Cannon Ball , North Dakota , with camps on federal property and protest actions when the company was seen trying to work on the project . Those celebrating included a large contigent of U.S. military veterans , arriving by the thousands this weekend . Her office had announced the delay in the decision on the easement on Nov. 14 . Darcy said that the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an Environmental Impact Statement with full public input and analysis . If not completed in time , oil delivery contracts for the pipeline will expire in January . It is not clear if this will permanently jeopardize the entire pipeline , since the Corps announcement said moving the pipeline was still on the table . It could still be left to the next administration to make the final decision , so protest leaders in the camp were urging people to stay and remain vigilant . The Dakota Access Pipeline is an approximately 1,172 mile pipeline that would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Pakota , Illinois . The pipeline is 30 inches in diameter and is projected to transport approximately 470,000 barrels of oil per day , with a capacity as high as 570,000 barrels . The current proposed pipeline route would cross Lake Oahe , an Army Corps of Engineers reservoir on the river near the confluence of the Cannonball River , running along the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation just a half a mile down the road from the border . The company constructing the pipeline , Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners , with Donald Trump as a major investor , had said it was unwilling to reroute the project . The tribe says the oil pipeline , largely complete except for the now-blocked segment underneath Lake Oahe , would threaten fresh drinking water , wildlife and Native American burial grounds , and it is considered a major milestone and a historic protest in compating climate change due to global warming from the burning of fossil fuels by activists from all over the world . It will now have to go back to the drawing board , although Energy Transfer Partners issued a statement reiterating that it would continue to try to build the pipeline and cross the river at Lake Oahu anyway . In spite of consistently stating at every turn that the permit for the crossing of the Missouri River at Lake Oahe granted in July 2016 , comported with all legal requirements , including the use of an environmental assessment , rather than an environmental impact statement , the Army Corps now seeks to engage in additional review and analysis of alternative locations for the pipeline , the company says . Tribal leaders and others involved in the protest are urging people to remain in the camp and stay vigilant . Standing Rock is such a signifcant place now that perhaps Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders was on to something when he suggested that the Obama administration declare it a national monument . Even if the victory at Standing Rock turns out to be temporary , it was cause for celebration never the less . This type of reporting and analysis is vital .
