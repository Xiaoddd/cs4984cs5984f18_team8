There were countless hours of overtime for law enforcement officials plus the hiring of additional temporary officers . All that adds up to money , and were talking quite a bit of it . The matter might not be that simple . Common Cause , a nonpartisan group that promotes government accountability , says accepting money from a private-sector business in an industry it regulates would present the state with an ethical dilemma . This has turned into a rather strange and twisted story . Right off the top we have to consider the fact that for reasons which completely escape me , the energy company who is building the pipeline has offered to reimburse the state for these costs . I suppose one might venture a guess and say that they were already so far over budget because of the protesters that 10 or 20 million more dollars might not be that big of a deal . We then learn that the state may be unwilling to accept the money . Having an energy company handing out money to the government would apparently suggest the smell of corruption in the minds of some . They no longer need permission from anyone to do the work . The pipeline is basically finished now . You probably already guessed it . From you . I suppose George Soros and his friends will wind up getting a hearty laugh out of all of this if their well-financed army of activists can run up a bill of that size and wind up sticking the rest of us with it .
