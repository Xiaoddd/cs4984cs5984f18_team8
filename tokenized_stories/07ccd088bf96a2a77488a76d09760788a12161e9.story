October Surprise conspiracy theory From Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search For a more general definition , see October surprise . Reagan won the election . According to the allegation , the Reagan Administration rewarded Iran for its participation in the plot by supplying Iran with weapons via Israel and by unblocking Iranian government monetary assets in US banks . During the investigation -LRB- a.k.a. Debategate -RRB- , the Subcommittee on Human Resources of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee obtained access to Reagan Campaign documents and discovered numerous instances of documents and memorandum referencing a monitoring effort for any such October Surprise . About August 12 , 1980 : Karrubi meets again with Casey , saying Khomeini has agreed to the proposal . Casey agrees the next day , naming Cyrus Hashimi as middleman to handle the arms transactions . More meetings are set for October . September 22 , 1980 : Iraq invades Iran . January 20 , 1981 : Hostages are formally released into United States custody after spending 444 days in captivity . The release takes place just minutes after Ronald Reagan is sworn in as president . Sick 's credibility was boosted by the fact that he was a retired Naval Captain , served on Ford 's , Carter 's , and Reagan 's National Security Council , and held high positions with many prominent organizations ; moreover , he had authored a book recently on US-Iran relations -LRB- All Fall Down -RRB- . Sick wrote that in October 1980 officials in Ronald Reagan 's presidential campaign including future CIA Director , William Casey , made a secret deal with Iran to delay the release of the American hostages until after the election ; in return for this , the United States purportedly arranged for Israel to ship weapons to Iran . He appeared to be traveling on leads for his investigation into the Inslaw Affair . His death was ruled a suicide . Snepp alleged that Sick had only interviewed half of the sources used in his book , and supposedly relied on hearsay from unreliable sources for large amounts of critical material . Snepp also discovered that in 1989 , Sick had sold the rights to his book to Oliver Stone . Specifically , Newsweek found little evidence that the United States had transferred arms to Iran prior to Iran Contra , and was able to account for Bill Casey 's whereabouts when he was allegedly at the Madrid meeting , saying that he was at a conference in London . They were unable to verify any of the evidence presented by Sick and supporters , finding them to be inconsistent and contradictory in nature . They also pointed out that nearly every witness of Sick 's had either been indicted or was under investigation by the Department of Justice . It is now very clear that there were two separate agreements , one the official agreement with Carter in Algeria , the other , a secret agreement with another party , which , it is now apparent , was Reagan . They made a deal with Reagan that the hostages should not be released until after Reagan became president . So , then in return , Reagan would give them arms . We have published documents which show that US arms were shipped , via Israel , in March , about 2 months after Reagan became president .
