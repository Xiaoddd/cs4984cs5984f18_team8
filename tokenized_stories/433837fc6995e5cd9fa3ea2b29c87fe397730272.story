Just this month , ETP spilled between 6,500 and 7,500 gallons of drill slurry within 10 feet of the Tuscarawas River . The Ohio EPA demanded ETP remove the slurry from the quarries and wetlands after finding that previously leaked material contained illegal diesel fuel . Just days later , ETP received a violation from FERC for demolishing The Stoneman House , a historic building located in Carroll County , OH , in order to continue construction . In West Virginia , DEP stopped construction following four notices of violation for stormwater pollution , uncontained sediment during construction , water quality violations and sediment runoff into creeks in Doddridge County , WV . As a result , DEP issued a cease-and-desist . ETP was given 20 days to propose a new plan of corrective action . FOR MORE INFORMATION Photos from the event will be posted here .
