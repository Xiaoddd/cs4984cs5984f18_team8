The MOU establishes specific objectives for onshore and offshore renewable energy development on federal and state lands and waters , directing Interior and California agencies to take the necessary actions to achieve these goals . A high priority is placed on processing applications for renewable energy projects in areas that minimize environmental effects , make efficient use of existing transmission systems and are consistent with ongoing cooperative planning efforts , such the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan , Western Solar Plan , and the Renewable Energy Transmission Initiative . The Task Force will expedite offshore renewable energy by advancing collaborative planning , conservation through data sharing , development and utilization of common data platforms and tools , and proactive stakeholder engagement . Since there are significant renewable energy resources in the Western United States that are in less populated areas , a key component of facilitating renewable energy development is providing transmission capacity to move that power to demand centers . The two lines approved today respond to that need . The transmission lines will also minimize impacts on Greater Sage-grouse and other sensitive avian habitat through specific design features and compensatory mitigation . Both projects are co-located with existing transmission lines and roads to the maximum extent possible to reduce overall ground disturbance and visual impacts . Their construction is expected to generate more than 2,300 jobs in the West .
