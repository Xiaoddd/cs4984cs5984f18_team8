Early in the planning process , Dakota Access considered but eliminated an alternative that would have crossed the Missouri River about 10 miles north of Bismarck instead of the route currently under construction . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers evaluated the Bismarck route and concluded it was not a viable option for many reasons . In addition , the Bismarck route would have been 11 miles longer with more road crossings and waterbody and wetland crossings . It also would have been difficult to stay 500 or more feet away from homes , as required by the North Dakota Public Service Commission , the corps states . The tribe is suing the corps over its approval of the water crossing . State regulators did not evaluate the Bismarck route because Dakota Access had selected the current Missouri River crossing when it submitted its application in December 2014 , said Public Service Commission Chairwoman Julie Fedorchak . A map included in the Dakota Access application has a May 2014 date on the Bismarck route . The proposed route was changed in September 2014 to cross the Missouri River near the Standing Rock reservation , according to dates on the PSC documents . The corps , which issued a permit for the water crossing , said the pipeline will be installed 92 feet below the riverbed with horizontal directional drilling methods to minimize impacts . The Corps also noted safeguards that will be in place , including remote monitoring of the pipeline and emergency response plans . Public Service Commissioners defended their approval of the pipeline project this week , saying it was thoroughly reviewed and considered risks to water bodies . Standing Rock leaders have , however , repeatedly objected to the way the corps evaluated the route and now are asking a federal judge to intervene . Gov. Jack Dalrymple issued his first public statement on the protest Thursday , emphasizing safety and stating that law enforcement and state agency directors would continue to closely monitor the situation .
