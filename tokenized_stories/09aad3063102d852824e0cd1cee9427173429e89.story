However , the police version of the story makes it sound like Herzog was some crazed assailant attacking heroes . Now , the firefighter is facing a felony . Unfortunately , Cannelton police officer Ryen Foertsch did not get the memo . Foertsch was at the location of the fire and in plain clothes , not dressed as an officer and was attempting to smash in one of the windows of the house , a move that could have obviously made the fire far worse . Herzog arrived on the scene to witness the blunder , and attempted to prevent the officer from literally adding fuel to the fire , and tried to get him away from the house . Sensing that his authority was being threatened , Foertsch arrested the fire chief as the house continued to burn . To make matters worse , as the house burned , the police ordered the remaining fire crew off of the property , preventing them from doing their jobs and putting lives and property at risk . Officer Foertsch claims that Herzog was shouting obscenities at him and shoving him . However , Herzog says that he was simply attempted to diffuse a dangerous situation , and even if he was shouting at the officer , he had every right to considering the circumstances . Chris Zukeschwerdt , the man who owns the house that was burning , was horrified by the encounter that he witnessed . Zukeschwerdt said that he heard the chief yell to the other firefighters to stay and make sure the fire was put out , as he was dragged away in handcuffs . However , he says that next the police officers took over the scene and ordered the firefighters to leave . Soon after the arrest , Herzog was bailed out of jail by Cannelton Mayor Mary Snyder . It is important to note that the National Incident Management System , which sets national standards for first responders in emergencies such as this , states that the first fire unit arriving on the scene of a house fire are the ones to take command of the incident , which means that Herzog was within his rights to take charge of the situation when he arrived on the scene . It seems that officer Foertsch was more concerned with his own ego and perceived authority than he was with saving lives , which is a dangerous consequence of giving a person unlimited power .
