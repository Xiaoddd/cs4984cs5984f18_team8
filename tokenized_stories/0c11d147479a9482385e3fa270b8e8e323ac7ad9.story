Leaders in Berlin are concerned that any instability might spread to Europe -- and they want to send a message to the American government . There was the spring of 2017 , when he accused the German government of adopting Nazi methods . Or when he stayed silent after the Turkish press depicted German Chancellor Angela Merkel with a Hitler moustache . Government officials argue that everyone knows the Turks do n't allow themselves to be intimidated like that . Ultimately , Trump will fail to secure the release of the imprisoned American pastor Andrew Brunson , they argue , and he will instead poison relations between Turkey and the West . Now , it 's Trump of all people who is pushing Germany and Turkey back together . The looming collapse of the Turkish economy is a genuine dilemma for the German government . It does n't want the Turkish economy to fall deeper into crisis , no matter what . They are worried about potential consequences for the eurozone and the German economy , about the 3 million Turks living in Germany and about the possible unraveling of the deal with Ankara that is preventing more refugees from making their way to Europe . If it becomes necessary to act , officials in the German government argue , Germany will be at the front of the line .

I understand that I may repeal my consent at any time . On the other hand , the German government has little inclination to help a man who only recently compared them to Nazis . Hardly anything would be less popular among the Germans than sending taxpayers ' money to the autocrat in Ankara . When Andrea Nahles , the head of the center-left Social Democrats -LRB- SPD -RRB- , raised the possibility of German aid for Turkey , it was followed by a prompt denial from the government . German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz of the SPD also had little enthusiasm for the idea . The fact of the matter is that many in Berlin believe Nahle 's suggestion was premature , but not fundamentally incorrect . Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert also did n't broadly exclude the possibility of aid for Turkey . But if they do n't suffice , it seems clear that Berlin wo n't simply sit back and watch . For now , German aid to Turkey has been restricted to rhetorical assistance . German politicians are outdoing one another in stressing Turkey 's immense importance as a partner for Germany and Europe . FAQ : Everything You Need to Know about DER SPIEGEL Seven Decades of Quality Journalism : The History of DER SPIEGEL Reprints : How To License SPIEGEL Articles In Ankara , the government happily took note of Berlin 's fawning words , which noticeably calmed the markets . A Softer Tack At the same time , the German government set in motion an unprecedented round of phone calls and visits . Finance Minister Olaf Scholz demonstratively invited his Turkish counterpart and Erdogan 's son-in-law Berat Albayrak to Berlin . Even before President Erdogan embarks on his visit with full military honors to Berlin in four weeks , Foreign Minister Heiko Maas -LRB- SPD -RRB- will travel to Ankara . Economics Minister Peter Altmaier -LRB- CDU -RRB- is planning a visit to Turkey a few weeks later . DER SPIEGEL The German government wants the softer new approach to Turkey to send a message -- to Donald Trump and the markets . But for Merkel , any German support for Erdogan puts her in an awkward position . Since the refugee deal , the chancellor has been accused of having allowed herself to be blackmailed by Erdogan . When she visited the Turkish president during her election campaign , widespread criticism followed . It does n't help the chancellor that voters with Merkel 's CDU are particularly critical of Erdogan . This makes Turkey even more satisfied with Merkel 's handling of the crisis . Erdogan 's adviser says the president feels validated in his assumption that , when in doubt , the Germans wo n't leave the Turks hanging . He is convinced that , given the millions of Syrian refugees his country has taken in , he can place pressure on Germany . At the same time , Erdogan does n't want to portray himself as a supplicant , making it unlikely he will publicly ask the German government for any financial aid . The symbolic support from Germany is , for now at least , more important to the Turkish leader . Government experts believe financial aid for Ankara is theoretically possible , but not bilaterally and without conditions . The line right now goes that direct financial aid can not and will not happen . In the Finance Ministry , officials are also saying that the European safety net , the European Stability Mechanism , can not be used to help the country because Turkey is n't a member of the eurozone . In the coming talks with his Turkish counterpart Albayrak , Scholz wants to urge Turkey to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund -LRB- IMF -RRB- . People in the ministry argue this is the normal channel for dealing with the kinds of turbulence Turkey is currently experiencing . Psychological Factors People close to Erdogan are excluding the possibility that the president will ask the IMF for a bailout . Erdogan has repeatedly boasted of having revived the economy after the dire 2001 crisis and of making Turkey independent from the West . If he asks for help from the IMF as his predecessor did , it would be tantamount to an admission of failure . That 's why officials in Berlin are looking for other ways to help the Turkish economy . Finance Minister Scholz , for example , could imagine the Europeans adopting joint measures to spur investment in Turkey . Plenty of opportunities exist , especially in the tourism sector . The summer 2017 decision to limit the state guarantees for exports to Turkey has been lifted , and the Foreign Ministry also recently downgraded warnings for people traveling to Turkey . The German government has also requested that the Turkish government convene a meeting of the German-Turkish Economic Commission , which was founded in 2013 but has never held a meeting . Since economics is half psychology , the German government wants to do everything in its power to calm the financial markets . It is worried the stability of the eurozone might once again be jeopardized as a result of the Turkish economic crisis . For German banks , the lira 's weakness does n't pose a huge risk because they only have about 21 billion euros in outstanding loans to Turkish companies . But it is dangerous for Spanish financial institutions , which have lent 69 billion euros . The first euro crisis was caused by , among other things , bankrupt banks with bad loans on their books . But the German government also wants something back in return for its support . It has communicated to Ankara in various ways that the seven Germans still being held in Turkey for political reasons , partly without charges , must be freed . The lifting of the ban on Turkish-German journalist Mesale Tolu leaving Turkey on Monday is being viewed as an early sign of compromise by the German government , and as an indication that further decisions in this vein can be expected in the near future . If that happens , German government sources say , it is also feasible that Germany would stop blocking negotiations in the EU for a customs union with Turkey . It remains questionable whether Erdogan will be willing to make concessions under pressure . The president suspects that his power will erode if the economic situation further deteriorates . But he still does n't have the will to raise interest rates or to reduce state expenditures , as most economists are suggesting . Erdogan wants to be able to boast of growth numbers in the regional elections in early 2019 , and is blocking any reform that might curb growth for this reason . He believes he can sit out the crisis . His people also make it clear that Erdogan will not back down in a fight with Trump . As such , the Turkish government is lining up allies in Europe and Asia with the goal of isolating Trump in the conflict . In this respect , Germany holds special importance for Turkey , and Erdogan is demonstratively seeking to close ranks with the German government . As a first step , he has instructed all his ministers to dial down their verbal attacks against Germany . Finance Minister Scholz also believes the newfound proximity to Turkey is necessary for geopolitical reasons . He believes the Europeans need to show President Trump that they will not allow the U.S. to create disruptions in their own backyard without a fight . Jetzt aufrufen . Hinweis nicht mehr anzeigen .
