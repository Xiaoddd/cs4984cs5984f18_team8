Attorneys for Greenpeace International , Greenpeace Fund and BankTrack filed motions on Tuesday to dismiss a lawsuit filed in August by Energy Transfer Partners in U.S. District Court in North Dakota . Tom Wetterer , general counsel for Greenpeace USA , said in a statement the lawsuit is an effort to silence critics of the Dakota Access Pipeline . Greenpeace attorneys called the case a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation , or SLAPP case , and compared it to a similar lawsuit brought against Greenpeace by Resolute Forest Products of Canada , which has been dismissed . Energy Transfer Partners is represented by the same New York law firm , Kasowitz , Benson & Torres , that represented Resolute Forest Products and also represents President Donald Trump . Greenpeace is seeking to transfer the case from North Dakota to the District of Columbia , arguing in its motion that most of the allegations in the lawsuit did not occur in North Dakota and it would be more convenient for the parties to travel to Washington , D.C. , for hearings . An attorney for BankTrack argues in a motion to dismiss that the lawsuit 's claims are frivolous and an attack on the First Amendment rights of citizens and organizations engaged in public advocacy work . In August , Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners said in a news release the company believes it has an obligation to shareholders , partners , stakeholders and those affected by the protests to file the lawsuit .
