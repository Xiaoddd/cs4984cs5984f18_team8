Currently , 20 states have passed or are considering legislation that would curtail our rights to protest environmental destruction and human rights violations . Dear Mr. President , Since you took office , I have watched America diminish and become a danger to the world . Climate change is not a hoax , and making sure your grandchildren have a habitable world to live in is far more important than increasing the profits of your friends in the oil business . Thankfully , we live in a nation founded on freedoms . The First Amendment of the Constitution allows for and prioritizes the need for dissent . It protects even the abhorrent expressions of white nationalist fervor you failed to adequately condemn in Charlottesville . And it certainly protects the rights of people to vocally oppose dangerous fossil fuel infrastructure . Now , however , on your watch , those freedoms are disappearing . In 20 states , legislators have passed or are considering 30 different laws that , in one way or another , curtail our freedoms to assemble and speak freely . We remember Blackwater from Iraq . Private military contractors helped give us Abu Ghraib . Our use of them violates the 1989 United Nations Mercenary Convention . They should have no place anywhere , and certainly not on our home soil . Never has the country been so divided . Never have we been such a laughingstock on the world stage . Every nation on the face of the planet but us is participating in a basic agreement to address climate change because doing so is essential to our survival as a species . Those who exercise their First Amendment rights to assemble and speak in defense of the earth must not be treated like terrorists . Not on our watch .
