Tell us how the Trump tariffs are affecting you . A couple embraces as opponents of the Dakota Access pipeline leave their main protest camp Wednesday , Feb. 22 , 2017 , near Cannon Ball , N.D. , as authorities were preparing to shut down the camp in advance of spring flooding season . The Army Corps of Engineers ordered the camp closed at 2 p.m. Wednesday . The camp has been home to demonstrators for most of a year as they tried to thwart construction of the pipeline . Some of the last remnants of it went up in flames when occupants set fire to makeshift wooden housing as part of a leaving ceremony . Many of the protesters left peacefully , but police began making arrests more than an hour after the deadline passed . It was not immediately clear how many people had been arrested . Authorities brought five large vans to the scene . Hours earlier , about 150 people marched arm-in-arm out of the soggy camp , singing and playing drums as they walked down a highway . It was not clear where they were headed . One man carried an American flag hung upside-down . Authorities sent buses to take protesters to Bismarck , where they were offered fresh clothing , bus fare home and food and hotel vouchers . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers set the deadline , citing the threat of spring flooding . At the height of the protests , the site known as Oceti Sakowin hosted thousands of people , though its population dwindled to just a couple of hundred as the pipeline battle moved into the courts . The camp is on federal land in North Dakota between the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and the pipeline route that is being finished by Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners . When complete , the project will carry oil through the Dakotas and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois . Some of the remaining protesters were focused on moving off federal land and away from the flood plain into other camps , said Phyllis Young , one of the camp leaders .

Others , including Dom Cross , an Oglala Sioux from Pine Ridge , South Dakota , said he planned to return home after living at the camp since September . Law enforcement officers and first-responders were on hand from several states . Charles Whalen , 50 , an alcohol and drug counselor from Mille Lacs , Minnesota , said he and a group of about 20 people were not going to leave on their own and were willing to get arrested to prove their point . Levi Bachmeier , policy adviser for Gov. Doug Burgum , said authorities would rather not apprehend people , but they would enforce the deadline . Some campers said they were leaving with mixed feelings , both energized by the long protest and saddened to leave new friends . Some people set off fireworks . Matthew Bishop , of Ketchikan , Alaska , has been in North Dakota since October . He planned to move to another camp . Bishop said as he tied his possessions to the top of his car . A massive effort to clean up the camp has been underway for weeks , first by protesters themselves and now with help from the Army Corps in removing debris . Some vehicles and pedestrians were having trouble getting through the muck created by recent rain and snow , and cleanup efforts were suspended in part because camp officials did not want heavy equipment making the conditions worse .
