by Andrea Germanos , staff writer 0 Comments Protestors block the gates of the Kinder Morgan Richmond Terminal in California in solidarity with First Nation 's people in Canada on July 24 , 2017 . We want to work to address these challenges together . Stopping the fossil fuel project , though would reap benefits beyond the two provinces the pipeline runs through , as author and climate campaigner Bill McKibben noted : Odd to watch Alberta fighting with Ottawa fighting with BC , as if the interests of a -RRB- First Nations and b -RRB- Planet Earth are not also -- indeed mostly -- on the line . Offering a similar reaction , Greenpeace Canada 's climate and energy campaigner Mike Hudema , said : Investors should note that the opposition to this project is strong , deep and gets bigger by the day . This announcement shows that this widespread opposition has reached critical mass . British Columbians ' desire to protect clean water , safeguard the environment and stand behind Indigenous communities can not be ignored or swept under the rug . We encourage Kinder Morgan to shelve this project before the litany of lawsuits , crumbling economics , and growing resistance against the pipeline does it for them . Despite such threats , Ottawa and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley are still aggressively pushing for the project . Access to world markets for Canadian resources is a core national interest .
