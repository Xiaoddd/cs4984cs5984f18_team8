By the 20th century , disease , war , and forced assimilation had reduced the indigenous population to a mere shadow of what it had once been . By the 1950s , as Hollywood westerns had transformed the Indian into a tragic symbol of lost freedom and innocence , the federal government had adopted a policy designed to eliminate Indian Tribes as discrete groups . The legacy of conquest continues to shape U.S. policy and inflicts ongoing suffering on Native communities to this very day . Against overwhelming odds , however , Native Americans fought back .
