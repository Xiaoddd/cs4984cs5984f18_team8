John Laurits Insurgent journalism . Poetry . Weaponized math . I was able to get a few decent videos & even found enough of a signal to live-stream part of it , although the audio of the live-stream was pretty much ruined by the blizzard . And I also messed up the caption , too . Glad you care more about heart than you do about perfection . Never take yourself too seriously .
