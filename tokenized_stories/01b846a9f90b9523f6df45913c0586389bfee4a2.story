But yet look at what the Trumpster is doing here . They were gon na go out , and they were gon na appeal to all of these disparate minorities : The sexual minorities , the gender minorities , the racial minorities , the ethnic minorities , the religious minorities , the vaginal minorities . So they maybe were a little early here , and by writing off such a huge percentage of the white working class , in terms of people that are going to seek votes from , they calculated really badly . Even if you get all of these obscure minorities , and then even if you get all of them to show up and vote , you still are nowhere near overpowering or outnumbering the white working majority that you have just sent packing . As I keep telling you , the Democrats have just lost electoral seat after electoral seat . And they only have 16 governorships in the country . Just hang on , folks . Some of these other candidates also have the same attitude . Frustratingly so . Wait just a minute , Rush . The narrative is this : That Trump had a horrible day Saturday . First Spicer , then Trump goes over to CIA . He stole the unions . The Trans-Pacific Partnership : Sent packing . This morning the Keystone pipeline and the Dakota thing also sent packing . And it is monumental . I noticed that . He reads it and then reads it to people , he reads it to the media , and then signs it , puts his signature on there . I think much of this is what a lot of Trump supporters foresaw . I think a lot of people supported Trump knowing full well or hoping full well that this is the kind of thing that would happen . They have no idea . They are underestimating that aspect of the Trump support base . They are underestimating the animosity that Trump supporters have for liberalism and for the Democrat Party and what they have done to this country . Trump supporters are a combination of things . They have had their fill of the destruction that has been brought about by the Democrat Party , and I can go down the list . You know the things : Obamacare , immigration , taxes . That leads back to Obamacare . Many people who support Trump are very much aware that the Democrat Party considers them the enemy in this country , the white working class . The Democrat Party has signaled them as the enemy . They are headquartered in the white working class . The white working class is very much aware of it . So the Democrats are digging their grave each and every day while they think they are rebuilding . And I tell you , our old buddy Jonathan Martin who used to be at Politico who occasionally would send me an email asking from a contribution for me in a story he was writing . How the Democrats are gon na rebuild . What the Democrats are gon na do to put it all back together . What the Democrats are gon na do to start winning elections , starting in the midterms in 2008 . I read this story , and -LRB- laughing -RRB- I started laughing and I started cheering and I was at the same time incredulous . Now , wait a minute . Remember when the Tea Party sprang to life , the Democrats went out and created Occupy Wall Street and tried to tell us that it was organic . They bought it , they paid for it , they organized it , they cherry-picked it . There was nothing organic or natural about Occupy Wall Street . The first mistake the Democrats are making is the Republicans did not create the Tea Party . It sprang up out of Middle America . It had no congressional or Republican Party membership . There were no ties . The Tea Party existed despite both political establishments . They tried it again with Black Lives Matter . The Tea Party was real . So they want to create what they think was phony . The Tea Party , to them , was a political construct with the Republican Party was behind it . They remain clueless . And I told you that on a couple of occasions , emissaries from the White House were dispatched down here to get my mind right on it . I never was in favor of it . If we can own the immigration issue , we can own the Hispanic population . The one thing they had in common was love of Big Government and hatred of conservatism , and the Democrats throwing them away is a relevant step in Trump scooping them up . Trump is scooping them up with policy . Those are two pipelines that Obama and the Democrats had stopped , and the reason they did was not climate change . Literally nothing to do , because pipelines are eminently safer than trains and over-the-road trucks . And , by the way , the Dakota pipeline does not traverse one inch of sacred Indian ground . The reason the environmentalist wackos oppose these pipelines has everything to do with capitalism . They want government in charge of as much as they can secure , and they want the government being anti-capitalist and pro-socialist . And this is the primary reason . It was a giant , giant snooker that Hillary and Obama and the Democrats were engaged in . The Keystone protests are not about the transmission of oil or fossil fuel . We just officially terminated TPP . So gon na have plenty of trade . Stop the tape . And then you hear your former donors and people that loved you praise Trump the way they never praised you . Now , stop and think of this . I mean , I have friends that want to build in the United States . And I am , to a large extent , an environmentalist . I believe in it . RUSH : There again . These guys were aligned with the Democrat Party , they donated to the Democrat Party , they propped up the Democrat Party , they elected the Democrat Party . They were for Big Government . They were for everything that we opposed as conservatives . They excoriated Republicans . They had made these ads showing Paul Ryan pushing his grandmother over a cliff in a wheelchair . They did some despicable things . They hated the Republican Party . They hated conservatism . They hated the idea of small government . They were in bed almost literally with the Democrat Party . Now all of a sudden , these same guys are singing the praises of Donald J. Trump . But they keep voting Democrat . The unions were the same . The unions were constantly angry , constantly enraged , always ripping a new one for Republicans and so forth . They were just total lockstep with the Democrat Party , even though all the Democrat Party did was talk a good game . The thing that united union workers and the Democrat Party seemed to be a common hatred of conservatism , small government , you name it , with the mistaken belief that the Republican Party was inexorably tied to big business . They just loving them some Donald John Trump .
