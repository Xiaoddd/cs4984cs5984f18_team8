While in North Dakota , Nora sat down with Ronya Hoblit , Acting Director of the Native American Training Institute -LRB- NATI -RRB- and member of the UU Church and Rev. Karen Van Fossan , Minister at the UU Fellowship and Church of Bismarck-Mandan to learn more about the engagement of their congregation in support of Standing Rock and ways UUs throughout the country can support the work of the water protectors there . Nora : I have only been here a few days but appreciate what has looked to be an organic and transformative relationship that has emerged between your congregation and folks at Standing Rock . Ronya : I first visited when it was Sacred Stone . We knew there were needs . I got up in front of the congregation and asked if folks could donate any paper goods for the kitchen . People were very kind and generous in the congregation . The movement in Standing Rock grew quickly , and the engagement at the church with Standing Rock grew parallel , and with similar speed . At the same time Baton Rouge floods were happening , along with other crises . It was powerful to see that folks gave to both . People here are donating without any self-glory ; they are not focused on asking for recognition . Karen : A progressive group in town was organizing folks to send more supplies and asked our congregation to be a drop off spot . Before we knew it we were THE drop off spot in town . There has always been a physical solidarity component to this work : first it was physical things being delivered , and volunteering in the kitchen . Increasingly we became involved in the bigger camp : we would go a few times a week , go to meetings , camp there . We also quickly realized we were a hub for UUs from other places who wanted to support the work , and for other people of conviction who thought to contact a local faith community as a way to be in solidarity . There have been more and more calls for leaders of faith communities to both identify ourselves as well as to show up when we do . We are carrying out what we believe in by going there . I love this gesture of our church taking lead from -LRB- and flanking -RRB- Standing Rock . Our Social Action Working Group -LRB- SAWG -RRB- meetings are getting fuller and fuller . Though the UU community has always been energetic here , there are now stronger roots to the justice work that we are doing . Ronya : In the past , there would be a beginning and end to our engagement and whoever donated would have felt good about it . With this work , its like you can touch the bottom . You know where you are , you know the goal , you know your place in this much bigger movement . When I use water now , this has shifted my relationship . When I use water , and every time I let it run , I see my granddaughter in the water and her not having that water . So I have to work for it now , for that future . Now because I have been in a place to protect this water , I have such a different relationship to it . You are both lifting up profound questions about our own future and the possibility of future generations . Ronya : Prayer . I have intentionally prayed more in last six months than in my entire life . In recent months you - Karen - did a sermon about the power of prayer . That absolutely impacted me . I define it as kind , thoughtful and intentional conversations with the universe . Karen : Standing Rock has facilitated a reflection between giving up , and giving over something of myself . When I see the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- moving along the land , it takes everything in me to not go stop it : I have always loved that river . From what I have experienced from traditional Lakota values -LRB- what I have learned through Ronya and through folks at the camp -RRB- , this is a space that has been created that if you are hungry , you can eat ; if you are thirsty , there is water ; if you are hurt , there is a clinic ; there is space at the fire for you ; there is always prayer . These are things that are given to each of us . I have lived in different places in my life , I have been accustomed to chronic loneliness . I have known pervasive , chronic loneliness . And that is gone . Ronya : There is such a long history of abuse . There is a little conflict there . The people who have shown up in Standing Rock have love in their hearts and have illustrated a general sense of respect . In general , they are not here to appropriate our experiences ; but also understand that the tribe is comfortable being the spearhead with others supporting us . It is good to have people of faith involved with the movement . Civil disobedience is not something people can or should go into lightly . We are thankful for any and all support that is showing up at Standing Rock . It is so powerful to see so many people showing up in support . That all of this exists in the context of the doctrine of discovery . I think that work has something to do with why Unitarian Universalism was able and willing to show up at this time . It is not to say that systems of oppression are not still in place and some of us are still benefitting from them . When I see people doing things like songs , dance , and prayer that are not mine , I just get to be an invited witness . It is also important that I remember the grief that I feel is not the job of Native people to take care of . When I am in solidarity , I will face both shame for being the intended recipient of systems of oppression and the beneficiary of systems of oppression . I often say I receive more than I give . That is indeed true . Ronya : When you set your foot in that camp you have to trust that folks will take care of you , and that we are taking care of each other . No one enters that camp without having made some sort of sacrifice in their life . And that matters . I hope and guess that everybody goes away knowing that it is a gift to be able to be part of it . No one is excluded from this . Rocks , air , land , humans : we all have a connection to water .
