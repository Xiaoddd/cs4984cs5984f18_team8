The spill came from a six-inch pipeline built in the 1980s , which transports 1,000 barrels of oil per day . The oil spill contaminated the Ash Coulee Creek , but did not reach the Little Missouri River , according to Bill Suess , a spill investigation manager for NDDoH . The cause of the pipeline spill is under investigation . The oil spill happened some 170 miles northwest of Cannon Ball , North Dakota , the site of the gathering of American Indian and allies resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline . The spill personifies exactly the reason they have fought for many months to stop the Dakota Access pipeline . Previously , he served as editor of the Native News Network .

American billionaires are going to get every ounce of oil & coal & gas out of the ground , and the environment be damned as far as they are concerned , before they turn to renewable energy . While the rest of the world is looking at America and wondering what kind of mass psychosis we are suffering from that we not only are so far behind them in recognizing the problem of global warming , but that we are so self destructively ignorant as to elect a man who says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese . America has bought the booby prize at the ballot box , and now they will pay for it with the destruction of their land by the very people they gave away their allegiance to . Greed , ignorance , and hatred and fear are the attributes of the so called civilized American populace , that the rest of the world will know them by . Susan 2 years ago Thanks Levi for keeping us undated . TribalMember and Proud of it . 2 years ago This is very disheartening to hear about , which was first posted on the Sacred Stone Camp Facebook page as well as the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Facebook page . The creek on my way to work is now freezing over but it is one which during these past few months , had been given many good thoughts with an arm stretched out towards it while driving past daily . It is a sad , mournful time to know that the creatures which once lived in the waters that become contaminated can no longer exist .
