That dream has been slowly dying ever since . That same month the federal government released permits for the controversial Site C dam in B.C. , despite strong opposition from local First Nations . Of the 120 First Nations consulted by Kinder Morgan , only 39 have issued letters of support for the project . The company has not secured the consent of two-thirds of potentially impacted Indigenous nations to go ahead with the project . Tsleil-Waututh , Squamish and Musqueam First Nations have mounted considerable opposition to the project , including threats of legal action and Standing Rock-inspired blockades to prevent its construction . Of course , there are many arguments deployed by governments and corporations to justify this neglect . But those are the terms articulated by former primer minister Stephen Harper , a leader representing a political vision Trudeau was ostensibly elected to remedy . As Trudeau famously said : governments grant permits , communities grant permission . The ad-hoc review panel formed to fix that was riddled with alleged flaws including a lack of clarity in mandate , failing to reach out to participants , organizing meetings during the summer when many people were away and appointing a panel chair who had a previous business relationship with Kinder Morgan . The truth is that two-thirds of impacted Indigenous nations do not want the Kinder Morgan project threatening their lands and waters with potential oil spills , destroyed marine mammals and catastrophic climate change . This is a truth that our elected officials are aware of , but seem not to care about . The federal government could have called off the review process until the reviews of the NEB , Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and the Fisheries Act were completed . The Alberta NDP could have recognized that the oilsands can not be expanded further without the free , prior and informed consent of impacted Indigenous nations , choosing instead to clearly articulate to constituents and industry why it would not be petitioning for federal approval . But despite all this , Indigenous nations do not back down . A new indigenous coalition created to fight fossil fuel expansion , the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion , now has over 100 Indigenous nations and organizations on its list of signatories . Trudeau and Notley can pretend to care about many things : the economy , jobs , re-election . This is what colonialism looks like .
