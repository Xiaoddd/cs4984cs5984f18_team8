In a 4-minute SoundCloud interview with the Indigenous Environmental Network , Angela Bibens describes the devastating effects of tear gas , rubber bullets , concussion grenades , mace , and water cannons used on 400 peaceful protestors in North Dakota by local police in the last 48 hours . According to Bibens , several demonstrators suffered seizures , broken ligaments , loss of bowel control , and , in some cases , loss of consciousness , including one elder who went into cardiac arrest . A reported 300 people have been injured , 26 hospitalized , and several arrested . Both the Standing Rock and Cheyenne Sioux Tribes deployed emergency services for on-the-ground resuscitation and opened a nearby community center for evacuation . But a video posted to Twitter yesterday clearly shows authorities drenching protestors in areas where there were no fires , using tanks that bear no resemblance to fire trucks . In a joint report by the International Network of Civil Liberties Organizations -LRB- of which the ACLU is a founding member -RRB- and Physicians for Human Rights , water cannons are characterized as particularly dangerous and life-threatening weapons . The use of water cannons can induce facial , skull , and rib fractures ; brain trauma ; bruises ; prolonged nausea ; and even blindness . Water cannons have been attributed to deaths in Indonesia , Zimbabwe , Turkey , South Korea , and Ukraine . In North Dakota this weekend , temperatures reached 26 Fahrenheit , or -3 Celsius , making the targets of water cannons also susceptible to hyp0thermia and frostbite . Use of unjustified force and massive less-lethal weapons by law enforcement against largely peaceful protestors is all too familiar . The ACLU and other groups warned against abusive police practices at Standing Rock and called on the Justice Department to investigate possible constitutional violations and suspend police use of federally supplied military equipment . These tactics have not occurred in a vacuum . And construction of the pipeline has continued despite a call in September by Victoria Tauli-Corpuz , the UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples , for it to be halted for posing a significant risk to the drinking water of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and to their burial and sacred sites . It suggests there is an equal balance of power between the militarized police force and weaponless demonstrators . It is a catastrophe with serious human rights implications .
