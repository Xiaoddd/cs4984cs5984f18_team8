Authorities do n't yet know what caused the fire on the Phillips 66 pipeline in Paradis , but a crew of six workers was cleaning it at the time , St. Charles Parish Sheriff Greg Champagne said at a news conference . The remaining worker was unaccounted for , and a helicopter was being brought in to help search for him . Champagne said the source of the 20-inch pipeline had been shut off but the fire would have to burn off the rest of the liquid inside , which could take hours or even days . The pipeline was carrying a highly volatile byproduct of natural gas , which was burning cleanly and very hotly over a 30 - to 40-foot area , the sheriff said . Sixty homes were evacuated and highways were being diverted around the area in Paradis , which is about 30 miles west of New Orleans .
