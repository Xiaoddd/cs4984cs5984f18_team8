By Daniella Zalcman Daniella Zalcman BuzzFeed Contributor Posted on December 26 , 2016 , at 9:16 a.m. . We chose to show contributed images that the remaining protesters and the residents of nearby Mandan had taken as Polaroids alongside a portrait of the person quoted . This is intended to widen the perspective beyond that of an arriving journalist and to give everyone a chance to show their relationship to the land and camp . Some of the people have been watching this protest unfold for months ; others arrived more recently . My last meeting was with a Lakota man named Travis who lived in Pierre . At the end of our conversation , he told me that he was heading to a pipeline protest that weekend and I should come along . As far as the Lakota were concerned , this was their land , the site of their burial grounds and sacred spaces , and their main source of water . They saw the pipeline as a direct threat to their environment . Right : a teepee in the nearby Standing Rock camp . Over the next few months , thousands of people amassed in the Standing Rock camp along the banks of the Cannonball River , with tribal representatives arriving not just from across North America , but from as far away as Norway , New Zealand , and the Amazon . Having spent several years photographing the ways that the US and Canadian governments have tried to subjugate , marginalize , and assimilate First Nations peoples , it was frustrating for me to have to leave after a week . I knew I had colleagues on the ground who were doing amazing work , Native and non-Native , and realistically I knew that my presence would have been completely redundant . I focused on other projects and commitments , but kept an eye on Standing Rock . To tell the story properly , I knew I had to do something different . So instead , I turned to the residents of the Standing Rock camp , to the water protectors and local North Dakotans who had been living through this conflict for months . These are their photos , and their words . He mills all of the pieces at home in New Mexico and drives them up in a moving truck . The structure is made from wood , covered with tarp , and insulated with blankets . I went back home and it was bugging me , so I figured out how to put a yurt together . I used to work in construction and I like to build things , so it was easy for me . I brought the first one up and got it set up in about two hours , and now I 've made six here . They 're warm and sturdy and can fit about six to eight people . He took this photo of officers on what has become known as the front line of the DAPL protests , before various barricades were erected on Backwater Bridge . The figure in the hoodie and gas mask stared down the officers in silence . There are peaceful people , there are prayerful people , there are violent people . And I 'm just here to worry about the people with violent intentions . When we looked fire hoses , well , that was a bad optic . That made us look bad . Using water was a means to remove those agitators from that situation . We stopped at the sacred fire , and I busted out my hand drums , and I knew how I could contribute . She took the photo of bison roaming freely in Theodore Roosevelt National Park over the summer . Half of them are paid to be here . But they think they 're entitled to go on the Army Corps of Engineers ' land and just set up camp . They think they 're entitled to go on neighboring farms and ranches and run amok . Their ancestors may have been here before my ancestors , but that does n't mean anything now . Now we all are having to suffer . I would be mad if anyone would sit here in the house and make a derogatory joke about black people . Left , Benita poses for a photo at camp . We 're only here for a few days , but I 'd definitely come back . At right , he poses with a fish . Even if it breaks , it 's going to be beneath the river , so it 'll be fine . Those protesters are saying that it 's on reservation land , but it 's not . Right , he paints his face in a Pueblo tradition for ceremony or times of war . I 'm busy all the time . I did n't think I could make it up here . But all of a sudden I started seeing all these signs : It was always raining , I saw this amazing double rainbow , all of these things pointing to water . Every sense was telling me I had to come . Right , a photo by her shows the yurt at Pueblo Camp , which was painted by Legun Coriz . We have this connection to our land . We 've all experienced similar traumas . It 's that solidarity with sovereignty . It 's stepping up and saying that as Native people , we 're still here . I was working on a degree in environmental science and sustainability at UNM . Right , a photo that he took shows the ceremonial relighting of a sacred fire . It 's been eye-opening for me . It 's been an awakening . I came to bring back stories to my community about what this means , what it means to be part of this . They know there 's a pipeline , but they do n't really know what 's going on . At left , a photo by Stacey shows her and her grandson Benjamin in Carrington , North Dakota . One of the days they came in to protest in Mandan , I was trying to take my son to dialysis in Bismarck and it took us forever to get out because they were blocking off the roads . I did n't appreciate that . I do n't want to see pipelines near sacred lands . It 's our water . We need to think about the next generation . At right , he takes shelter from the weather in the Standing Rock Casino , which became a base for water protectors to take an occasional break from the harsh winter weather . But for me , it 's turned into a spiritual awakening . We 're all going to take this home . This is going to mean something to all the other pipeline fights . At right , one of his images shows a police clash with water protectors after a man brandishing a loaded AR-15 began to threaten the crowd . And people here need help . I 've seen police abuse first hand and I know if there 's no evidence , it did n't occur . Without photos , it 's just our word against theirs . So I 'm here , and I 'm taking photos . At right , a photo that he took earlier this year shows a view of Oceti Sakowin camp shortly after the Wabashaws first arrived . We had to be here . This is more important than all of us .
