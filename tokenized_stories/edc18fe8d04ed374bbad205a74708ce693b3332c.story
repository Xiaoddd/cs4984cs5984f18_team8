No Pay . Despite the celebrations taking place at the site of protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline , experts say the recent decision to stop the pipeline could be reversed by the Trump administration or the next Congress . On Sunday , in a stunning surprise , the Army Corps of Engineers denied Energy Transfer Partners , the Dallas-based company building the pipeline , the easement permit it needs to complete construction under the Missouri River . The corps recommended studying alternate routes that would bypass the Standing Rock Sioux reservation and its water supply . But according to Deborah Sivas , a professor of environmental law at Stanford University , there are multiple ways the pipeline might still be completed legally in its current location . The Republican-led Congress could vote to clear the way for Energy Transfer Partners to drill under the Missouri River by passing an appropriations rider . Then the company would no longer need an easement from the corps to comply with the Clean Water Act and could thus complete the pipeline . Alternatively , according to Buccino , Congress could exclude public input from the environmental impact statement ordered by the Army Corps of Engineers , excluding Standing Rock Sioux tribal members from participating and thereby sidestepping complaints that the project desecrates sacred burial sites . Such actions likely would be subject to public criticism , she acknowledges . Buccino also points out that Jo-Ellen Darcy , the corps official who made the announcement , was appointed by President Barack Obama and will leave her position in January . Trump has expressed his support for the pipeline project . She believes its recent announcement is largely a gesture .
