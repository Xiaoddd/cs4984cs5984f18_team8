Now , the pipeline company will have just six months to dismantle and completely remove the structure . The tense relationship only unraveled from there . A majority of land owners never agreed to the proposed amount because it was far below market value . Despite insufficient consent , a firm named Enogex continued to operate the pipeline , part of a larger network of gas transmission lines in Oklahoma . The BIA sequestered the decision from the people whose land would be impacted by the pipeline . Because a compromise never came to fruition , the court held the pipeline operator has been trespassing on private land since that date and striking down arguments from the defense . With six-month window to disassemble and evacuate , for now the federal court is forcing Enable Midstream Partners to limit in its explotation of Indigenous Peoples . Featured image : photo credit .
