jpratt27 Climate change ca n't be ignored . We need to live more simply so others can simply live . Already , only 17 years into the millennium , the planet is profoundly changed : half the ice missing from the polar north , for instance , which in turn is shifting weather patterns around the globe . That galloping momentum of warming -LRB- building on itself , as white ice gives way to blue ocean and as fires in drought-stricken forests send clouds of carbon aloft -RRB- scares me . It should scare everyone ; for a decade now , it has threatened to take this crisis beyond the reach of politics . And it helped conjure up the counter-momentum that was beginning to take hold : renewable energy was suddenly outpacing fossil fuel in many places . Carbon emissions were starting to stabilize . Four days later , Donald J. Trump was elected . And since pace is everything here , that might well be enough . Our not-verygood in-any-event chance just got much , much harder . One is the almost unbelievable fall in the price of renewable energy , which is continuing apace . Each passing month brings cheaper solar panels , more efficient wind turbines , more powerful batteries at lower cost , shinier electric cars . The other reality is darker , but no less real : Global warming will happen on a spectrum . The battle never really ends : You just keep falling back to the next redoubt , finding some new weapon with which to fight , yielding no more ground than you must . To some degree , in Washington . Still , D.C. was a place you could stand and fight : Obama had promised to do something about climate change , and you could try and hold him to that promise . If the filibuster remains in place and the Democrats can round up 40 votes , the worst damage can perhaps be avoided . New York is halfway into the most ambitious utility restructuring plan on the continent . Assuming that Gov. Andrew Cuomo stays the course -LRB- and as a pol with an eye on bigger things , that seems a reasonable bet -RRB- , the Empire State will demonstrate what a modern energy system might look like . And even across the middle of the country , sense keeps breaking out . In this new landscape , the large , sprawling , diverse climate movement that has sprung up in the last decade can push the process in many useful ways . Take , for instance , the ongoing battles against new fossil fuel infrastructure , exemplified in the last few years by the battles over the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines . Those were crucial fights , and only in part because they slowed the construction of particular pipelines . They also scrambled the investment thinking of multinationals , banks , and investors . The idea that tar sands output would triple or quadruple has vanished ; even Exxon is facing the likely need to write off its investment in the north . The battle waged at Standing Rock over the Dakota Access pipeline was a particularly powerful chapter in this fight , and not just because it made crystal clear to the larger public what many of us have known for years : that frontline communities , and in particular Native Americans , are leading much of this struggle . In fact , the fossil fuel divestment movement will see a new surge of organizing . Now it becomes an even more compelling place to act : With the system jammed in D.C. , the pressure will inevitably build elsewhere . But defying reality is a hard trick , day in and day out . That leaves those who care about the climate standing with those who care about the poor , about racial justice , about immigrants , about peace . Which means , in turn , that one goal of our fight must simply be to break the power of Trumpism and all that it represents . If you want good news , here it is : Trump and his crew have pushed all their bets onto fossil fuel . Which means that if they fall , then climate denial should fall with them . Fossil fuel worship should fall with them . Their backward-looking vision should tumble down around them . Bill McKibben is an author and environmental leader who lives in Ripton . Our children & future generations deserve a sustainable economy based on renewable energy . LikeLiked by 1 person Reply GarryRogers says : January 29 , 2017 at 9:46 am Thanks . With the agreement updated at Doha COP18 . The problem was , the USA with the largest per capita consumption and carbon emissions never signed up to it . Two other countries which are not signatories to it , also with large per capita consumption and carbon footprints are Australia and Canada . We respond by demanding more details , and by assigning the problems to institutions ill-equipped to cope with them . Environmental degradation , first seen as mainly a problem of the rich nations and a side effect of industrial wealth , has become a survival issue for developing nations . It is part of the downward spiral of linked ecological and economic decline in which many of the poorest nations are trapped . Despite official hope expressed on all sides , no trends identifiable today , no programmes or policies , offer any real hope of narrowing the growing gap between rich and poor nations . Nearly thirty years later , the situation is worse , we are still heavily addicted to fossil fuels , whilst inequality and poverty have increased . Whilst white affluent middle-class , so-called environmentalist , make a fortune writing about it . The poor have been sacrificed , so the middle-class can continue to think they can continue to live , the way they do .
