2016 . The Pipeline violates the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 and 1851 signed by the United States , as well as recent United States environmental regulations . The potentially 1,200-mile pipeline presents the same environmental and human dangers as the Keystone XL pipeline , and would transport hydraulically fractured -LRB- fracked -RRB- crude oil from the Bakken Oil Fields in North Dakota to connect with existing pipelines in Illinois . While the pipeline was originally planned upriver from the predominantly white border town of Bismarck , North Dakota , the new route passes immediately above the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation , crossing Lake Oahe , tributaries of Lake Sakakawea , the Missouri River twice , and the Mississippi River once . Now is the time to stand in solidarity with Standing Rock against catastrophic environmental damage . The different sections and articles place what is happening now in a broader historical , political , economic , and social context going back over 500 years to the first expeditions of Columbus , the founding of the United States on institutionalized slavery , private property , and dispossession , and the rise of global carbon supply and demand . Indigenous peoples around the world have been on the frontlines of conflicts like Standing Rock for centuries . This syllabus brings together the work of Indigenous and allied activists and scholars : anthropologists , historians , environmental scientists , and legal scholars , all of whom contribute important insights into the conflicts between Indigenous sovereignty and resource extraction . While our primary goal is to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline , we recognize that Standing Rock is one frontline of many around the world . This syllabus can be a tool to access research usually kept behind paywalls , or a resource package for those unfamiliar with Indigenous histories and politics . Like those on frontlines , we are here for as long as it takes . We have joined forces to support the Standing Rock Sioux in their continued assertion of sovereignty over their traditional territories . Indigenous peoples are enslaved and killed , but also resist , trade , and move in relation to European empires . European empires , the United States , and later independent Caribbean and Latin American states establish plantation economies relying on enslaved Black labor . Up to the abolishing of the slave trade , European empires capture and transport approximately 15 million Indigenous people from Africa , primarily to the Caribbean and Latin America . 1676 British settlers in Virginia led by Nathaniel Bacon revolt against the Governor in order to drive out local Doeg -LRB- Algonquian -RRB- Indians . During the rebellion , indentured Europeans and enslaved Africans united , provoking elites to enact the strict Virginia Slave Codes in 1705 to divide the colonial labor force by the racial status of inheritable enslavement . To forestall Native wars , Britain passes the 1763 Royal Proclamation , forbidding the purchase of Indian lands and British settlement past the Appalachian Mountains . Elite land speculators from Southern colonies , including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson , begin to build opposition to British rule . After two British military expeditions retake many of the forts , the fighting reaches a stalemate and the British government makes concessions to end the conflict , though does not give up claim to the Ohio territories . 1776-1791 The American Revolution ends with independence from Britain , and the Constitution of the United States lays the foundation of the new government , including the enslavement of African-descendant peoples . The new government rejects the British Proclamation of 1763 as a basis for Indigenous sovereignty . 1787 United States Northwest Ordinance opens land for white settlement in allotments , provoking Indigenous resistance . 1803 Thomas Jefferson approves the Louisiana Purchase , purchasing from France land west of the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains . 1804 Lewis and Clark venture into Oceti Sakowin territory on the Missouri River on an army expedition to map and expand United States territorial claims . After refusing to pay tribute for their passage , they are rebuffed by the Oceti Sakowin . 1812-1815 United States declares war with Britain in part to move beyond established western boundaries of the new nation-state . In the Northwest , Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa form a confederacy and ally with the British . The treaty of Ghent establishes firm borders between British Canada and the United States , ignoring Native land claims . The end of the war marks the last time a European or American state forms an alliance with a Native nation or confederacy . 1815 No longer checked by British competition , the United States begins removing Indians to western lands . 1816 Congress restricts licenses for trade with Indians to American citizens , effectively preventing foreign trade relations with European empires . 1824 The Bureau of Indian Affairs is created within War Department of the Executive Branch . 1832 The John Marshall Supreme Court issues a third decision that the United States federal government , through the commerce clause of the Constitution , had the authority to govern relations between indigenous nations and states . 1835 After the discovery of gold in Georgia , the state of Georgia pressures the Cherokee to move westward . The Treaty of New Echota provides the legal basis of Cherokee removal , though not approved by Cherokee National Council or Principal Chief . 1836-1840 A smallpox epidemic in the Missouri Basin carried by American fur traders spreads to the Blackfoot , Assiniboine , Arikara , Crow , and Pawnee . 1846-1848 The Mexican-American War and Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ceded land east and north of the Rio Grande to the United States . Article XI of the Treaty stipulates that the United States must secure the new frontier lands against Indian raids , targeting Apache and Comanche who resisted both Mexican and United States expansion . Between 1850 and 1912 the Mexican Cession land is turned into ten new states . 1848 Gold discovered in California , settlers scramble West . 1849 Department of Interior is created and adopts the Bureau of Indian Affairs from the War Department . 1851 Treaty of Traverse des Sioux signed by the United States and the Dakota nations of what was Minnesota Territory . The treaty , although broken by the United States , stipulated Dakota peoples would live sedentary , agricultural lifestyles apart from white settlers and adopt Christianity in exchange for government rations and annuities for ceded lands . 1851 First Fort Laramie Treaty -LRB- the Horse Creek Treaty -RRB- signed by the United States and representatives of Arapaho , Arikara , Assiniboine , Cheyenne , Crow , Hidatsa , Mandan , and Sioux nations to guarantee safe passage of settlers to California in exchange for goods and services . Ten to fifteen thousand gathered in what is the largest gathering of Plains Nations in history . Many nations never receive payment from the United States . -LRB- See Map -RRB- 1852 California passes bounty law for Indian scalps , encouraging settlers to kill local indigenous people . 1861 The Civil War begins , leading to an increasing professionalization of the United States army . Native nations and forces fight for both the Union and Confederacy in order to preserve their lands and sovereignty . 1862 The Homestead Act opens 270 million acres of land west of the Mississippi for settlement . Settlers who lived on the land for five years , improved it , and filed an application were given ownership of the land . Bands of Dakota attack settlers , and the United States Army is called in to protect them . United States military tribunals charge 303 Dakota of murder or rape of civilians and 38 Dakota men are sentenced to death in the largest penal execution in American history . The following year , the Bureau of Indian Affairs abolishes the Dakota reservation and forcibly moves the Dakota to Nebraska and South Dakota . 1864 The Colorado Volunteer Cavalry destroy a Cheyenne and Arapaho village in Southern Colorado , killing more than a hundred , and display the maimed and disfigured bodies as trophies . 1864 Union Army Captain Kit Carson begins total war against the Navajo , destroying orchards , livestock , and Hogans . There , they are interned with little support , vulnerable to weather and raids , until allowed to return to a portion of their homelands in 1868 . 1865 The Civil War ends with surrender of the Confederacy . There is an increasing need for land as slavery becomes outlawed and migration to large Northern cities increases the national population . The 14th Amendment provides citizenship for Black and white people born within the United States . 1868 The Fort Laramie Treaty guarantees Sioux reservation land including the Black Hills , and hunting rights in Montana , Wyoming , and South Dakota . 1876-1877 The Great Sioux War begins after gold is discovered in Black Hills and settlers rush to the area , prompting the United States Army to violate the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty . Colonel Custer attacks Sioux and seizes the Black Hills . During the Battle of Greasy Grass -LRB- Little Bighorn -RRB- , Lakota , Northern Cheyenne , and Arapaho forces kill Custer and a large portion of the U.S. 7th Cavalry . 1877 The United States Army is directed to kill buffalo , which are a threat to the railroad and cattle industries as well as a primary resource for Plains nations . The Black Hills were ceded but there is no record that the United States purchased the land . 1883 The United States Supreme Court rules in Ex Parte Crow Dog that , unless Congress authorizes it , federal courts have no jurisdiction over offenses tried at the tribal councils for Indian on Indian crimes . This decision began the plenary power doctrine used to limit Indigenous sovereignty -LRB- See 1885 Major Crimes Act -RRB- . The initial seven were murder , manslaughter , rape , assault with intent to kill , arson , burglary , and theft of personal property . In addition , eight more were added , to include kidnapping , maiming , sexual abuse , incest , assault with a dangerous weapon , assault against a minor , child abuse or neglect , and robbery . 1887 The Dawes Act grants the President authority to survey and divide Indian tribal reservation lands held in trust by the federal government and sell them to individual Indians . Those who accepted allotments and lived separately from tribes would be granted U.S. citizenship . 1889 United States violates the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty by breaking up the Great Sioux Reservation into five smaller reservations , enforcing private property ownership , agriculture , and residential schools without adequate resources . -LRB- See Map -RRB- 1890 In response to the United States breaking up of the Great Sioux Reservation , Lakota Sioux take up the Ghost Dance . The Bureau of Indian Affairs calls in the Army , which assassinates Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull . A small band of Lakota is forced to camp outside Pine Ridge Reservation at Wounded Knee Creek , where the army attempts to disarm them . The U.S. army escalates a confrontation and kills 250 to 300 Lakota , mostly women and children . 1908 In Winters v. United States , the United States Supreme Court clarifies Indian reservation rights to water by ruling that Indian reservations have water use rights that can not be blocked through water projects . This greatly expands funds for Indians by releasing the federal government from a strict adherence to treaty provisions . 1924 Indians are unilaterally made citizens of the United States , furthering the project of assimilating Native nations into the United States rather than recognizing their sovereignty . 1934 Indian Reorganization Act ends allotment and replaces traditional governance structures with Western , electoral system and tribal constitutions modeled after the United States Constitution . 1944 Indian Claims Commission is set up to settle outstanding claims against the United States . Generally viewed as the beginning of the termination era . 1944 Congress passes the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Plan , a massive water infrastructure project meant to increase hydropower , navigability , fishing and wildlife , and recreation along the Missouri River and its tributaries . In building these projects , the Army Corps of Engineers violates the Fort Laramie Treaties and Winters doctrine supporting the sovereignty of tribal lands , consultation , and access to water . 1944 National Congress of American Indians is established -LRB- Denver , Colorado -RRB- in anticipation of federal termination and assimilation policies in order to resist the elimination of tribal status . 1945 President Truman enters office and directs the Bureau of Indian Affairs to focus on termination and the assimilation of Indians into American Cold War society .

Oglala Lakota and American Indian Movement members occupy the town of Wounded Knee in the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to protest against the corrupt reserve governance structure .
