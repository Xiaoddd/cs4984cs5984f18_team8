The email states that all correspondence must be approved by the Department of Health and Human Services . As you can see , that statement is far more specific than the one we were originally looking into this morning . To be clear , we do not know how different these new temporary procedures are from existing ones . Accompanied by his actions on the EPA and USDA today , thos clearly indicates the Cheetoh-in-chief wants to wage war on science . He will have to pry my HPLC from my cold dead fingers . Censorship of information , excepting national security matters , from any of our governmental agencies is not commensurate with the U.S. Constitution . Very little of the information funded by or conducted within the National Institutes of Health can be considered to be vital to our national security . There seems to be a fear of factual information implicit here . Excellent Reply Mansi says : February 7 , 2017 at 8:51 am I already got my ID badge and temporary offer letter before Christmas . Also on Jan. 19th , I got my firm offer letter ready and i was about to start from Feb , 6th . But the HR put it on hold because HHS told the HR not to send out any firm offer letter . And unfortunately , HR did not send me even though it was ready . I have already told to my current job about the new job because HR told me to do so . But luckily I just gave the verbal notice .
