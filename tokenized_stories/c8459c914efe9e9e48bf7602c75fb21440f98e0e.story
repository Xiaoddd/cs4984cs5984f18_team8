He conducted an experiment focusing on the conflict between obedience to authority and personal conscience . Milgram -LRB- 1963 -RRB- examined justifications for acts of genocide offered by those accused at the World War II , Nuremberg War Criminal trials . The experiments began in July 1961 , a year after the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem . -LRB- Milgram , 1974 -RRB- . Milgram selected participants for his experiment by newspaper advertising for male participants to take part in a study of learning at Yale University . The learner -LRB- a confederate called Mr. Wallace -RRB- was taken into a room and had electrodes attached to his arms , and the teacher and researcher went into a room next door that contained an electric shock generator and a row of switches marked from 15 volts -LRB- Slight Shock -RRB- to 375 volts -LRB- Danger : Severe Shock -RRB- to 450 volts -LRB- XXX -RRB- . Milgram 's Experiment Aim : Milgram -LRB- 1963 -RRB- was interested in researching how far people would go in obeying an instruction if it involved harming another person . Stanley Milgram was interested in how easily ordinary people could be influenced into committing atrocities , for example , Germans in WWII . Participants were 40 males , aged between 20 and 50 , whose jobs ranged from unskilled to professional , from the New Haven area . At the beginning of the experiment , they were introduced to another participant , who was a confederate of the experimenter -LRB- Milgram -RRB- . Two rooms in the Yale Interaction Laboratory were used - one for the learner -LRB- with an electric chair -RRB- and another for the teacher and experimenter with an electric shock generator . The learner gave mainly wrong answers -LRB- on purpose -RRB- , and for each of these , the teacher gave him an electric shock . There were four prods and if one was not obeyed , then the experimenter -LRB- Mr. Williams -RRB- read out the next prod , and so on . Prod 1 : Please continue . Prod 2 : The experiment requires you to continue . Prod 3 : It is absolutely essential that you continue . Prod 4 : You have no other choice but to continue . All the participants continued to 300 volts . All he did was alter the situation -LRB- IV -RRB- to see how this affected obedience -LRB- DV -RRB- . Obedience to authority is ingrained in us all from the way we are brought up . This response to legitimate authority is learned in a variety of situations , for example in the family , school , and workplace . I set up a simple experiment at Yale University to test how much pain an ordinary citizen would inflict on another person simply because he was ordered to by an experimental scientist . That is , they are seen as legitimate . The person being ordered about is able to believe that the authority will accept responsibility for what happens . Agency theory says that people will obey an authority when they believe that the authority will take responsibility for the consequences of their actions . For example , when participants were reminded that they had responsibility for their own actions , almost none of them were prepared to obey . In contrast , many participants who were refusing to go on did so if the experimenter said that he would take responsibility . Milgram Experiment Variations The Milgram experiment was carried out many times whereby Milgram -LRB- 1965 -RRB- varied the basic procedure -LRB- changed the IV -RRB- . By doing this Milgram could identify which factors affected obedience -LRB- the DV -RRB- . In total 636 participants have been tested in 18 different variation studies . Milgram carried out a variation in which the experimenter was called away because of a phone call right at the start of the procedure . Change of Location The experiment was moved to a set of run down offices rather than the impressive Yale University . This suggests that status of location effects obedience . When there is less personal responsibility obedience increases . This relates to Milgram 's Agency Theory . Touch Proximity Condition The teacher had to force the learner 's hand down onto a shock plate when they refuse to participate after 150 volts . Social Support Condition Two other participants -LRB- confederates -RRB- were also teachers but refused to obey . Confederate 1 stopped at 150 volts , and confederate 2 stopped at 210 volts . Absent Experimenter Condition It is easier to resist the orders from an authority figure if they are not close by . Many participants cheated and missed out shocks or gave less voltage than ordered to by the experimenter . The proximity of authority figure affects obedience . We obey in a variety of real-life situations that are far more subtle than instructions to give people electric shocks , and it would be interesting to see what factors operate in everyday obedience . The sort of situation Milgram investigated would be more suited to a military context . Milgram 's sample was biased : The participants in Milgram 's study were all male . This is because they became participants only by electing to respond to a newspaper advertisement -LRB- selecting themselves -RRB- . Yet a total of 636 participants were tested in 18 separate experiments across the New Haven area , which was seen as being reasonably representative of a typical American town . However , Smith & Bond -LRB- 1998 -RRB- point out that with the exception of Jordan -LRB- Shanab & Yahya , 1978 -RRB- , the majority of these studies have been conducted in industrialized Western cultures and we should be cautious before we conclude that a universal trait of social behavior has been identified . Milgram also interviewed participants afterward to find out the effect of the deception . Protection of participants - Participants were exposed to extremely stressful situations that may have the potential to cause psychological harm . Many of the participants were visibly distressed . Signs of tension included trembling , sweating , stuttering , laughing nervously , biting lips and digging fingernails into palms of hands . Three participants had uncontrollable seizures , and many pleaded to be allowed to stop the experiment . In his defense , Milgram argued that these effects were only short-term . Once the participants were debriefed -LRB- and could see the confederate was OK -RRB- their stress levels decreased . Milgram also interviewed the participants one year after the event and concluded that most were happy that they had taken part . However , Milgram did debrief the participants fully after the experiment and also followed up after a period of time to ensure that they came to no harm . Milgram debriefed all his participants straight after the experiment and disclosed the true nature of the experiment . Participants were assured that their behavior was common and Milgram also followed the sample up a year later and found that there were no signs of any long-term psychological harm . Right to Withdrawal - The BPS states that researchers should make it plain to participants that they are free to withdraw at any time -LRB- regardless of payment -RRB- . The experimenter gave four verbal prods which mostly discouraged withdrawal from the experiment : Please continue . The experiment requires that you continue . It is absolutely essential that you continue . You have no other choice , you must go on . Milgram argued that they are justified as the study was about obedience so orders were necessary .
