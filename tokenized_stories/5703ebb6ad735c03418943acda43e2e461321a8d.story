Official Amnesty International USA profile . Non-violent Indigenous People opposed to the Dakota Access pipeline have been met with over-militarized policing and excessive , disproportionate and unnecessary military force . People exercising their human rights to assemble , pray and speak out have been brutally arrested , shot with rubber bullets , drenched in tear gas , and sprayed with water in freezing temperatures . The situation could deteriorate this weekend after the Governor of North Dakota and the Army Corps of Engineers have ordered people to leave the Oceti Sakowin Camp . Under international law , the government is obligated to respect and facilitate the right to peaceful protest , not treat people as enemies on a battlefield . These abuses must be stopped , the Department of Justice must investigate and the evacuation orders must be rescinded . Under international law and human rights standards , governments are obligated to seek the free , prior and informed consent of Indigenous Peoples before approval of major infrastructure projects , including pipelines , that carry a risk of harm to their human rights . You can email your own letter to the President in support , here . The Army Corps of Engineers should conduct an Environmental Impact Statement , including consultation with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe about the environmental and cultural impacts of the pipeline . The government must also seek their free , prior and informed consent before ever moving forward with construction regardless of the outcome of the Environmental Impact Statement . Until then , President Obama must ensure that construction fully stops , that no drilling under the Missouri River takes place and that the rights of Indigenous People are respected , protected and fulfilled .
