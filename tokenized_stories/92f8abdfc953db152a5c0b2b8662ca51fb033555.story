IITC , first and foremost , offers our thoughts for her and her family , and our prayers for her recovery . The multi-billion dollar oil pipeline threatens the water , Treaty rights and sacred sites of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . Due to the severity of her injuries , Ms. Wilansky , who is 21 , was airlifted to Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis where she has undergone several hours of surgery . IITC Board member Lisa Bellanger , based in Minneapolis , is in close contact with the family and we will continue to monitor her condition in that way . In addition to concussion grenades , North Dakota law enforcement also used high pressure water cannons , mace , tear gas and rubber bullets against the water defenders who were attempting to cross a bridge near the DAPL construction site . Many suffered from hypothermia as a result of cold water directed at them at high velocity in sub-freezing temperatures with potentially life-threatening effects . The IITC considers these actions as constituting use of deadly force . New reports indicate that over 300 water protectors were injured in this incident , and 27 were taken to hospitals including some with broken bones and head injuries . Photos , videos and eyewitness accounts were widely circulated on social and other media . The IITC strongly condemns this escalating violence used against peaceful human , Treaty and environmental rights defenders opposing the DAPL . The IITC has reported this latest incident and the escalation of police violence it represents to the United Nations -LRB- UN -RRB- human rights system including the UN Rapporteurs on Human Rights Defenders , Rights of Indigenous Peoples , Right to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association , members of the UN Working Group on Human Rights and Multinational Corporations , the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the UN Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . IITC has requested that UN human rights bodies immediately contact the United States government to call for an immediate halt to the increasing human rights violations including the use of deadly force against these unarmed defenders . However , the tactics used in the November 20th incident far exceeded those used previously which were addressed by the Rapporteur . IITC worked with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe -LRB- SRST -RRB- to organize an official visit by Grand Chief Edward John , member of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues -LRB- UNPFII -RRB- in late October to observe the continued impacts of the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- construction such as threats to water , Treaty rights and sacred areas . His report included the escalating levels of repression , violence and intimidation against Tribal members and their supporters by state law enforcement , private security and the National Guard . Roberto Borrero representing the IITC accompanied him as a human rights observer . IITC and the SRST also submitted two joint urgent actions to the UN Human Rights system , including four UN Special Rapporteurs , in August and September of this year . Laramie Treaty . Primary concerns expressed by the SRST included the potential devastating effects on the Missouri River , its primary water source as well as on sacred sites and burial grounds . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has also extended an invitation to Victoria Tauli-Corpuz , UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of indigenous Peoples , which is currently in process . IITC has also recently received very disturbing reports of suspected pesticides or other toxic chemicals being sprayed over the Oceti Sakowin camp , possibly by airplanes during the night , causing immediate health effects . The use of chemicals by private individuals or law enforcement has not been confirmed , but a growing number of on-site reports indicate that there is cause for serious concern . IITC calls on local law enforcement , the State of North Dakota , the United States Department of Justice and Environmental Protection Agency to determine if such chemicals have been used in this way , obtain samples of suspicious droplets found on vehicles and tents , and report their chemical contents and known or suspected heath impacts without delay . Such applications in this situation , including exposure of the many children in the camp , may constitute the use of chemical weapons under international law . This must be investigated , confirmed or denied without delay .
