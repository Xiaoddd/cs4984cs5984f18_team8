During my Native America Cal ... Speaking Truth To Power for a Real Native Free Press My Great-Aunt Nancy Bighorse I posted this today on Facebook and Twitter : Thank you to everyone for your support . Her legal team will have 14 days to appeal . Fallis was found guilty of one count of civil disorder and one count of possession of a firearm and ammunition by a felon . In the video of her arrest on October 27 , 2016 , Fallis , a medic at the camp , can be seen arriving on an ATV where a line of police in riot gear are faced off with water protectors . Behind the line of armored law enforcement , five men pile on top of her . As they pin her arm behind her back and with their knees hold her legs down , the gun which is not visible in the video because of all the men on top of her can be heard discharging three times , apparently into the ground . It was revealed in leaked documents reported by The Intercept in December , her boyfriend Heath Harmon , 46 , from the Fort Berthold reservation was an informant working for the FBI and that the gun Fallis allegedly fired during her arrest belonged to him . In his leaked interview with Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms he claims he immediately returned to camp to collect all of her possessions and return them to her family on Standing Rock . This after his girlfriend was tackled by several large men for free speech in front of him . After giving false and contradictory testimony to law enforcement regarding the gun , he continued the pretense of being her boyfriend even after she was arrested . In leaked audio of their phone calls , Fallis can be heard tearfully confiding , unknowingly , to him , a paid infiltrator , her fears and desire not to serve time for something she did not do . Some of these women gave birth to children by undercover police officers who never revealed their true identities . Arrest of Red Fawn Fallis at Standing Rock , October 27 , 2016 Native American women have long been the target of violence both by the United States government though total wars waged against their nations to gain access to homelands and through structural violence in the resulting colonial society that marginalizes them . A widely quoted 2010 Department of Justice report found Native women experienced rape and murder at rates nearly 2 and half times that of other American women . In some counties , the murder rate is 9 times . Most American women are primarily assaulted by men of their own race . More data is needed to address the vulnerable picture this paints of Native women in America . At the hearing , U.S. District of North Dakota Chief Judge Hovland granted Fallis permission to wear civilian clothing at the nearly 6-hour hearing . She appeared shackled and wearing a traditional ribbon dress . Under the deal , the most serious charge against her of firing an weapon at law enforcement was dropped . That charge could have put her in prison for 30 years . He also refused to allow any defense based on treaties that were violated by the building of the pipeline . At the prayer after her sentencing was postponed in June , friends , family , attorneys and supporters of Red Fawn gathered for prayer in a Bismarck hotel meeting room . Her hunka uncle and University of Colorado professor Glenn Morris and attorney , spoke to those gathered telling them that he had spoken to his niece that morning . She has already been in custody for more than 20 months . I was born free , I will live free and I will die free . In 1874 , it was in search of gold that Custer led 1,000 men into the Black Hills in violation of the Fort Laramie treaty . In 2016 , the battle was the transportation of heavy crude from the Bakken through unceded Lakota treaty lands which potentially endangered Lakota communities and millions of Americans downriver that precipitated the Dakota Access pipeline protests at Standing Rock . and try again then .
