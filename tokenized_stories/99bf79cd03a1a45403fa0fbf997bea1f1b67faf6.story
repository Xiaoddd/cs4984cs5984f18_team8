In December last year , nearly 1,000 U.S. veterans camped with the protesters at Standing Rock , finally leading then-president Barack Obama to issue an order to halt the construction of the pipeline . But with the coming of Donald Trump , that little victory seems to have taken place ages ago . This week , scores of veterans , many of whom had also visited the site in December , returned to put their bodies on the line to protect the Native protesters from the forces of the militarized police , according to the Guardian . Matthew Crane , a U.S. navy veteran who is helping coordinate a return group with the organization VeteransRespond , said the reason that many U.S. veterans were coming to help the protesters deal with the police was because it is a humanitarian issue .
