The meeting was scheduled , in part , to discuss the details of the emergency evacuation order , according to Bigelow . A source at the camp told ABC News after Thursday 's meeting that the federal deadline of Feb. 22 -- the same deadline set by the governor 's order -- remains in effect for the camp to be vacated . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe began coordinating a cleanup in late January , but state officials say it is n't happening quickly enough . The Cannonball River is a tributary of the Missouri River . The Army Corps , in a letter issued Feb. 3 , ordered those camping on federal property to vacate to prevent injuries and significant environmental damage in the event of flooding in the area . North Dakota governor issues emergency evacuation order for Dakota Access pipeline protest camp Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe files 1st legal challenge over Dakota Access pipeline easement Native American solar energy visionary equips Standing Rock protesters with green technology Bigelow , a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe who has been at the Oceti Sakowin protest camp for the past six months , said law enforcement officials on Wednesday moved up the barricade separating protesters from the pipeline construction area to within a few hundred yards of the camp 's north gate , the main entrance . But there was no law enforcement presence south of the barricade ahead of Thursday 's meeting , Bigelow said . Bigelow said there was some tension this morning when front-load tractors and roll-off trucks rolled in to begin removing garbage and waste from the campground , which is situated at the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation . Federal officials from the Bureau of Indian Affairs remained south of the barricade this morning and were expected to set up a road block to prevent vehicles from crossing the Cannonball River Bridge during the meeting , according to Bigelow . The Army Corps granted an easement on Feb. 8 to the developer of the Dakota Access pipeline , allowing it to install the final segment of the 1,172-mile pipeline . Part of this 1.25-mile section will run under Lake Oahe , a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota just upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation . Speer said the decision was made based on a sufficient amount of available information . While the Army Corps says this area is federally owned land , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe cites an 1851 treaty that it says designates the land for Native American tribes . That lawsuit is pending , and the Army Corps and the company behind the pipeline argued in court papers that they followed a standard review process . On Monday , the court denied that motion seeking a temporary restraining order . The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed a separate motion seeking a preliminary injunction directing the Army Corps to withdraw the easement issued to the pipeline company on Feb. 8 . This court can not wait until the harm begins to issue equitable relief . That motion seeking a preliminary injunction is expected to be heard in court later this month . After receiving the easement to build the pipeline across land on both sides of Lake Oahe , the Texas-based developer , Energy Transfer Partners , announced it would resume construction immediately , and indeed work has resumed . The Dakota Access pipeline , which would connect oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Patoka , Illinois , is expected to be in service in the second quarter of 2017 , according to the company . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has been at the forefront of massive and prolonged protests over the four-state crude oil pipeline . The demonstrations have drawn thousands of Native Americans , environmental activists and their allies to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation . Darcy also encouraged the Corps to share company documents containing risk analyses and spill models that had not been made available to the tribes during the initial environmental review . She is no longer in the position after the change in administrations . The move to deny the easement was hailed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other pipeline opponents as a major victory . But on his second weekday in office , President Trump signed a memorandum aimed at advancing the Dakota Access pipeline , as well as one directed at the Keystone XL pipeline .
