Jessica Andrews Apr 13 , 2018 12:00 PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest This op-ed explores cultural appropriation at Coachella , as witnessed by our Fashion Features Editor Jessica Andrews . Since it launched in October of 1999 , Coachella 's become something of a cultural force . The music and arts festival draws almost 100,000 people per day , according to Goldenvoice , including today 's top performers and street-style stars . But every year , the thorn in the festival 's side is appropriative fashion . Bindis , feathered headpieces , dashikis , war paint : Coachella street style is mired in cultural appropriation . And it 's the kind that reeks of privilege . For South Asian women , bindis are a cultural symbol that represents the third eye , a sacred site of wisdom and spiritual development . For some Coachella attendees , it 's just a pretty forehead accessory . But that does n't mean anything to those Coachella attendees who do n't respect other cultures . When you ca n't see the humanity in people who are different from you , you find no fault in treating their sacred cultural symbols as something to be worn and discarded .

It 's a mistake I regret , and I 'll never do it again knowing how hurtful it is . With appropriation being such a huge conversation these days , it 's easier than ever to educate yourself about cultural symbols . If you still choose to regard one as a disposable trend , it 's because you simply do n't respect the people behind it . Like fashion , appropriative hairstyles are now ubiquitous at Coachella . When outlets cover the hairstyle as if it started with Kylie Jenner , it 's not appreciation ; it 's erasure . Those celebratory headlines are yet another reminder that black hairstyles are only acceptable when they 're removed from actual black people . Unbeknownst to some Coachella attendees , there 's a stigma associated with cornrows and braids when black people wear them . The same hairstyle is celebrated when other races wear it . When black people wear cornrows , they get passed over for jobs , and are asked to leave their classrooms .

Appropriation and assimilation are two very different ideals . In a world where high schools ban students for wearing natural hair , people are fired for defending their Afros , and celebrities are compared to dogs for wearing Afros , black women feel undue pressure to straighten their hair just to get by . As you 're packing your outfit for a fun-filled weekend in Palm Springs , remember that sacred cultural symbols are not a fashion trend . Stripping a cultural object of its significance and donning it like a costume is the very height of disrespect . It 's not just ignorant ; it 's dehumanizing and incredibly painful . All rights reserved . It looks good on every complexion . I love that it goes on like a lip gloss and dries matte . Also , La Prairie eye cream is magic when you need to look fresh-faced , and have n't slept in days . true test of character is how you treat people who can do nothing for you . Always be kind to everyone you encounter from interns to the CEO . become something of a cultural force .
