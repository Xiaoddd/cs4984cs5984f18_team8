The statements , if anything , reveal what happens when politicians are isolated from the American public for so long . Both Bill and Hillary have blamed the loss on the FBI . While this is becoming a popular trope among the Democratic establishment , it 's a terrible excuse for Hillary 's loss . First off , the FBI investigation into the Clinton email mess was admittedly a bit of a public fiasco , but Hillary has openly admitted that she mismanaged the safety and security of her emails . She has to own her primary role in that debacle . Secondly , this is Obama 's FBI . While this gets closer to owning the problem , even it does not honestly diagnose the real failures of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party . Hillary Clinton was a terrible candidate to run against Donald Trump . Of course the Obama and Clinton families will never say this , but she was . I honestly believe that she may have been the only leading Democrat that Donald Trump could 've beaten . Next to him , she was among the least popular politicians to ever run for president . Her weaknesses and challenges counterbalanced those of Trump time after time after time . Trump is a rich , unethical liar with major character problems . To beat him , you run the opposite of that . Clinton , true or not , was not seen as the opposite , but the Democratic equivalent . Bernie Sanders , Elizabeth Warren , or even Joe Biden or Cory Booker would 've all matched up better against Trump and his weaknesses , but you could n't tell the Democratic Party that . They had it all figured out from the very beginning . Republican candidate Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election in the early hours of the morning in a widely unforeseen upset . The former Democratic Presidential nominee conceded defeat to president-elect Donald Trump earlier in the morning . Donald Trump defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to become the 45th president of the United States . Donald Trump walks onto the stage as the 45th U.S. President after defeating Hillary Clinton in an improbable victory on Nov. 9 , 2016 . 2016 . Republican nominee Donald Trump claimed an early lead in the race to become the president of the United States . Whereas Trump tapped into the anger and frustration of his voter base , the Democratic Party failed to do the same thing on issues that had widespread grassroots support from coast to coast . The Black Lives Matter Movement never really believed Clinton cared . She all but ignored the Dakota Access Pipeline - in spite of the fact that millions of people were outraged about it . Documents revealed that she supported fracking . Terry McAuliffe , who by all accounts is among the closest confidantes of the Clinton family , openly said she would flip on TPP once elected . Instead of being anti-war , she was seen as a hawk . That 's what cost her the election . Each of those issues are fueled by an energized base of supporters who knew full well that they did not have a true friend and ally in her or the Democratic Party establishment . It 's why she struggled to fill arenas as Bernie regularly spoke to thousands of supporters . Both Bill and Hillary have blamed the loss on he FBI . He 's not even that charismatic , but doggone it , people believed him when he speak out on the issues that mattered most . White supremacy made a difference . The FBI debacle made a difference . Russian interference made a difference Hillary Clinton was a terrible candidate to run against Donald Trump . The Democratic Party put out the wrong candidate , but even with her , they could and should 've still won this election , but they repeatedly ignored and dismissed progressive people and causes that could 've tipped it in her favor . As nice as Tim Kaine is , they chose a Vice President who was safe , but did nothing to move the needle even marginally . I 've never seen anything like it . Hundreds of thousands of people have come forward to say they want Keith to lead the party , but the party stalls and stalls and stalls , and seems determined to do anything other than pick the progressive choice . If the Democratic Party is going to have any success moving forward , it must lean into progressive populism and not away from it . So far , I do n't see this happening and the Obamas and Clintons do n't seem to be taking us there . You are now following this newsletter . See all newsletters .
