The New York City Banking Commission , which is scheduled to meet today , and of which the Mayor and the Comptroller are members , approves and oversees the banks that hold City deposits . As such , today the Mayor and Comptroller will vote to prevent agencies from entering into new banking services or related contracts with Wells Fargo , as well as bar agencies from renewing or extending existing contracts on expiration . The only allowable exemption will be for affordable housing financing , which has a direct benefit to New York City residents . I encourage Wells Fargo to quickly clean up its act and do right by the millions of customers who trust the bank with their savings . Until then , we will not be entering new contracts with the bank . We need to send a message to this bank and the broader industry that ethics matter .
