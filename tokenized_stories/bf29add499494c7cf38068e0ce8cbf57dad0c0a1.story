It is said that there are documents proving that the armed group was trained in the northern Kurdistan town of Silopi and receives between 400 and 700 dollars per capita . In the week in which they made this statement , successive explosion occurred in Kirkuk . That 's no coincidence . The reason why such declarations are made right now results from the developments taking place . At the NATO summit , the situation of Kirkuk was also dealt with . The meeting leaked information that NATO troops were to be stationed in Kirkuk and that the city would be placed under the protection of NATO and the international coalition . At the beginning of 2012 , Tarik Hashimi , Deputy President of Iraq and leader of the Islamic Party , fled to South Kurdistan , from where he was handed over to Turkey , to shirk responsibility for a massacre of Shiites in Iraq . He also visited Qatar . After his leave from Iraq , ISIS began to show itself to be a powerful organization . Iraqi courts sentenced Hashimi to death in his absence . In 2013 , ISIS took the stage in Syria . It was stronger both militarily and organizationally . In 2014 , ISIS occupied the cities of Anbar , Tal Afar and Mosul . Even though the Iraqi Federal Court issued an arrest warrant for Nuceyfi , he was not extradited to Iraq . The plan to give Shengal to ISIS after Mosul was forged in Amman . In a sense , the plans that Hashimi had designed and implemented through ISIS became reality . While the ISIS occupied large areas in Iraq , the Turkish state sent military forces to Bashiqa near Mosul . This deployment led to a serious crisis between Iraq and Turkey . The Turkish government stuck to its claim to carry out training there only . However , it comes out clearly only now who they actually trained there . While Iraq organized the Hashd al-Shaabi militia to fight the ISIS , Turkey , with their forces in Bashiqa , trained an organization called Hashdi-Vatani . However , Hashdi-Vatani is a kind of official form of ISIS and al-Qaida . After a while , there was no mention of these Hashdi-Vatani militias who were trained by Turkey . There was neither a declaration of dissolution nor a declaration of its continued existence . The armed group is one of these groups now appearing in Kirkuk . But not only that , it has to be known that in Iraq and South Kurdistan there are many armed groups that have organized themselves under the name Hashdi-Vatani . At the moment they are being exposed in Kirkuk . Over time , all these groups and their background will be revealed . After their emergence in Syria , ISIS later took control over many cities in Iraq . So the ISIS could advance only until Mosul and Shengal . Of course , this is not only related to the international forces . The IS nevertheless wanted to advance to Kirkuk . That is why ISIS has been constantly attacking Kirkuk . The massacre and occupation attacks in Afrin developed in the wake of this process . As the attacks on Efrin began , the ISIS groups deployed in Kirkuk and the disputed territories were mobilized and hundreds of attacks were carried out . Dozens of people were massacred . The armed gang group under the Iraqi Turkmen Front , which was formed by Turkey and Erdogan , and has been exposed by PUK officials recently , reveals what elements have been organized within the ISIS in Kirkuk . Now the question arises as to what will happen after this Turkey-led ITC armed group has been exposed by PUK officials . The PUK officials have stated that they have submitted the relevant documents to the Iraqi government . The Iraqi government has so far shown no official response . However , this situation is not limited to Iraq . International law prohibits one country from forming and paying for armed groups in another country . This fulfills the requirement of interference in the internal affairs of a country and can bring with it the accusation of importing terror into another country . It is difficult to predict in which direction the whole thing will develop . It looks like the PUK is not ready to give up on the subject . Unavoidably , when Kirkuk is in question , the PDK comes into play as well . This can be observed , inter alia , in the media . Not only PDK and PUK , but also the international powers are interested in Kirkuk . That 's why the US , England , France , Iran and many other countries will be putting the issue on their agenda . Everyone has their interests and plans with Kirkuk oil .
