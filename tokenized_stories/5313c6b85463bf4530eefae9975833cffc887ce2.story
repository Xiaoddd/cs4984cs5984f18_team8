Mark Labato , David Pakenham , Ronald Williamson , Lorenzo Serna , Victor Puertas and Sean Jordan were charged with criminal trespass and engaging in a riot in connection with a Dakota Access Pipeline protest in southern Morton County . Some had attached themselves that day to a vehicle found at the construction site . Bruce Nestor , a Minnesota-based attorney affiliated with a group of attorneys representing the protesters , said he believes the other cases from that day also should be dismissed . Nestor represented Serna , a journalist with the volunteer media collective Unicorn Riot . Nestor said the Committee to Protect Journalists and other groups concerned with First Amendment rights had written letters arguing that Serna should not have been charged . He also said there was n't any proof that the property was posted against trespassing . The cases were scheduled to go to trial this week .

Victorio Camp , of South Dakota , faces charges of criminal trespass and engaging in a riot stemming from the Oct. 22 protest . Camp 's attorney Matthew Arthurs said Camp took a plea deal of a single count of disorderly conduct and deferred sentence , because Camp could n't risk being recharged and having to make a trip back to North Dakota . Nestor said he does n't believe the state should make plea bargains for those arrested on Oct. 22 , who may take the deal because they live far away .
