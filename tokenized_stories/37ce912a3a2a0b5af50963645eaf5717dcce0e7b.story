A water defender stands in defiance of a fully militarized North Dakota law enforcement battalion at the site of the Dakota Access Pipeline construction project . -LRB- photo : COUNTERCURRENTNEWS -RRB- War Has Broken Out in North Dakota By Marc Ash , Reader Supported News 23 November 16 he situation in North Dakota at the site of the Dakota Access Pipeline has degenerated into what can now only fairly be described as a war zone . The escalating assaults on unarmed protesters by heavily armed , fully militarized police units have transformed the Dakota Access Pipeline construction site into a battlefield . Scores of people have been injured and medics are struggling to evacuate the injured to area medical facilities for treatment . The scene is one of constant clashes and assaults by North Dakota military police attempting to drive Native American protesters away from the pipeline construction site . Using military tactics , law enforcement unleashed barrage after barrage of military grade tear gas , rubber bullets , water sprayed from high-pressure hoses in below freezing temperatures , and concussion grenades . The worst injury reported occurred as a result of a concussion grenade thrown by police directly striking a 21-year-old protester from New York . Sophia Wilansky suffered severe damage to her arm when the grenade detonated in close proximity . The injury caused a compound fracture and extensive damage to muscle , nerve and bone , resulting certainly in a lifelong disability . Details of the Wilansky incident have gone viral on Twitter . With hostilities and injuries mounting , President Obama is taking a disturbingly hands-off approach . They are here , and the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation is the first great battlefield .

Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections : For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S. , particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election . We too were alarmed at the patterns we were , and still are , seeing . It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy , disciplined , and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before . It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time . We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century . The comments of our readers are the most vibrant , best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News . Accordingly , we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services . It is , however , important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in . Adapt and overcome . This is the response of the most powerful corporate juggernaut in history . But right in the tradition of the Ludlow massacre . I only hope his daughters never fully understand the depth of his betrayal to all of us . These are the bravest of the brave who are fighting against a monster that destroys without care or compassion , who have no regard for the rule of law and have abandon all morality . Human rights and our lives are being trampled on for profits and we should expect much more abuse of our rights and liberties in the years to come as we are taken down the road to extinction for the short - term benefit of a few . The water protectors are peaceful , they are praying and communing together to protect the resource , water especially that belong to everyone , the goons attacking them as well . Well , Obama , here 's an indication as to why we have the dictator-elect we have . NOT stupid , no more than Adolf Eichmann was stupid . Moreover , the orders are obviously coming from the proto-Nazi emperor himself , and will only become infinitely more deadly when the real Nazi takes over on 20 January 2017 . But they are both pigs , and both ugly . They are both corporate-fasci sts , so they are both Nazis . They are all totally complicit . Thank you . Confrontations seem to frighten and intimidate him . The other reason is political . Democrats are afraid to bite the hand that feeds them . Sunoco Logistics Partners is set to acquire Energy Transfer Partners , the company constructing the pipeline , while Sunoco will oversee its operation . get everything they want , and everybody else gets screwed . If they protest , violence is inflicted on them . America no longer cares about appearances , it just let 's it 's fascist ideology hang out into the open and dares you to defy it . Indeed , in several more weeks he will no longer be president . Indeed , in several more weeks he will no longer be president . He 's no wimp in the sense you and others mean it , he 's just doing what he 's expected to do by his corporate-fasci st , globalist masters and puppeteers . He does n't dare deviate from that , or he knows he 's dead -LRB- not that I 'm AT ALL excusing him WHATSOEVER -RRB- . Yes , he 's a coward , like all global imperialists and corporate-fasci sts are , but he 's not a wimp when it comes to doing their bidding . It would be interesting to know more fully the nature and methods of exerting control over him . For some reason I still believe he knows this pipeline is the wrong thing to do . For instance he vetoed the keystone pipeline . He made some efforts to stop this one . But is allowing this massacre to ensue . I wonder . I 'm not necessarily saying it was exactly like in the book and the movie -LRB- s -RRB- , but he has been completely brainwashed . Then he was groomed , prepared and installed in the presidency . He was completely cowed a very long time ago . I hesitate to say what may have also been systematically done to him in order to completely brainwash him , but it is not far-fetched or unlikely at all , though I do n't dare express it here . Wake up completely and get totally knowledgeable about what 's really going on and who 's behind it ; that , again , you should already know so you would n't feel the need to ask me such willfully-inept questions . You do n't seem to realize that unfortunately enforcers of the law work for the Fascist Plutocrats that are soon to rule our nation . You do n't seem to realize that unfortunately enforcers of the law work for the Fascist Plutocrats that are soon to rule our nation . Yes , but members of law enforcement are individual people who go home after work . A blown up car here , a burnt out shed there . Money ca n't buy happiness and it sure ca n't buy safety for the little minions either . It has arrived in our country , where it began very probably as an invasion right after WWII with Paperclip . It has been setting up shop . Like any aggressive cancer , it spread to the most vulnerable areas of the world-wide ecosystem first . We are now seeing in our own country , starting where the people and ecosystems are most vulnerable , what horror it has perpetrated in other resource rich countries such as Ecuador , Brazil , the Congo , Indonesia -LRB- a list which would use up all the symbols left -RRB- . This fascist cartel skillfully uses all the techniques of popular uprising massacre . PLUS murder . It would not surprise me in the least that , as in the Amazon regions , leaders of the eco-revolution in our own country are quietly , in the night , assassinated . If you still do not believe me , look at the men being given positions of power around a charismatic leader put in place by a small , deluded minority of our citizenry . Sounds almost like ... . the Nazis . No , it did n't . Weirdly , it seems to me that in my daily social encounters , it is the Rush Limbaugh listeners who are most likely to admit the frightening depth of corruption in our country , despite the deeply odious , racist , bigotry spouted by that particular oaf . get everything they want , and everybody else gets screwed . If they protest violence is inflicted on them . She would really have helped these good people . She would really have helped these good people . She would really have helped these good people . You 're being facetious , I presume . We have a legal system in this country . If they want to stop this they need get those who signed the right-of-way agreements to recind their approval . This is a doable legal step that truly would stop the pipeline . Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander , & this one really needs saucing . It could have been somebody else , but you really need to stay in more , and read significant stuff . It 's kind of a sore spot with them , y ` see . What a system of communication this wonderful -LRB- more sarcasm -RRB- technology affords us . Just one more genocidal police state action among 1000s waged against Native Americans , Native Peoples worldwide really when including all of Central and South America , Africa and Asia . Genocide is the name of Obama 's game . That is his legacy . The munitions multiply , but the psychopathology remains . That will change unless the aggressors stop . As a believer in reasonable gun control restrictions , I feel almost ashamed that I am glad there are millions of guns and billions of rounds in the hands of ordinary Americans . It is frightening and sad but crazy people with guns will be drawn to this conflict like moths to a flame , whether in ND or their own home towns . And I 'm ashamed that I harbor hope things will escalate to the point where there will be no turning back - us against them . We do n't have the fire power , many on this website have moaned . Well consider this . An ant is very small compared to a human being . It 's a massacre . Hiding behind Michele 's skirt . Probably trying to protect his daughters . Jordan Chariton of TYT Politics has been covering this in a way that much of the MSM has not . Likewise those murdered by the USian Empire at Wounded Knee ... or at Kent State University and Jackson State College . I 've just always thought of the killing of many unarmed people who ca n't or wo n't defend themselves as a massacre . Going to take you a lot more of these kind of commentaries to repair your and RSN 's damaged credibility . The oil wars are not ` over there ' any longer . Ash ; very well said indeed . About which five points : -LRB- 1 -RRB- - This -- the violent and ultimately murderous suppression of dissent -- is precisely the purpose for which the USian local police were federalized and militarized into a new Gestapo . -LRB- 2 -RRB- - The grenade that nearly killed Sophia Wilansky was obviously a military grenade -LRB- not a crowd-control grenade -RRB- or it would not have inflicted the wound it did . -LRB- 3 -RRB- - Ms. Wilansky would have died were she not given immediate aid by water-protector medics . In other words , the neo-Gestapo is already using lethal ammunition against the water protectors . -LRB- 4 -RRB- - The horrors are just beginning . Mass murder -- including by air-strikes and artillery -- is not inconceivable . -LRB- 5 -RRB- -RRB- - Again too many on the Left are using the wrong invective . He is a white-hearted closet Nazi in blackface whose primary assignment was to clear the way -- by nullifying the Bill of Rights -- for a publicly-avowed Nazi to become emperor , and precisely because of his monstrous , morally imbecilic intellect , he has succeeded beyond his One Percent masters ' fondest dreams . But it 's not surprising at all . As the U.S. , the West and the world become more of the oppressive and repressive totalitarian militarized corporate-fasci st state that they are rapidly being transformed into , we are going to see more and more of this kind of thing . It is all being done intentionally . Everyone who resists the global corporate-fasci st totalitarian militarized police state will be destroyed , or indefinitely imprisoned for the rest of their lives . As far as the powers-that-be -LRB- PTB -RRB- are concerned , we will all be subjugated , and not raise any fuss against it whatsoever , or we will be imprisoned or destroyed . That is the message we are being sent by the PTB with these precursors to the far worse that is coming down the pike if we do n't totally submit and accept our complete enslavement under absolute domination and control , with no True Freedom and Liberty existent anymore at all . They do n't leave room for anything else . The PTB want us all willing , and completely cowed , slaves who do n't dissent in any way , or we will be crushed . It is not about saving humanity and the planet , but about subjugating and enslaving us all , and eventually exteriminating most of humankind . That is why it is all that much more important to not surrender to or bow down to this eradication of all of our True Liberty and Freedom in any way -LRB- s -RRB- whatsoever , and to stand up against it no matter what . The only other alternative to standing up against this madness , is surrendering to and bowing down to it ; but that is NOT an option . We have got to at least try to put a stop to this insanity , even if we have to die doing so , because the alternative is not acceptable in any way , shape , form or fashion at all . So , be courageous people , do n't be cowards , and please stand up against all of this global -LRB- ist -RRB- totalitarian corporate-fasci st enslavement with all your non - violent might , and do n't at all give up or give in , come what may , for all of our sakes . Maybe full on -LRB- un -RRB- Civil war within 5 - 10 yrs . Hell , they already do . It wo n't . Because the majority was needed to rise up to truly be successful . It 's not all these peoples ' fault . They 've been turned into spineless cowards who rationalize everything that is the opposite of doing what is truly right , heroic and courageous . The powers-that-be have been much too successful at counter - acting and neutralizing the people , all by their design and implementation of multitudinous means , none of which are any accident , but were all systematically instituted for our detriment . In the past I have been rudely assailed at RSN for mentioning this . But in the spirit of trying to break through the silence , take the risk again . Heck , they wo n't even entertain the FACT that fluoride was used in the Jewish ghettos and the concentration camps to keep the people docile and passive , so they in most cases would n't fight back , and would , relatively peacefully , go to their internment and deaths , as they did , with little or no dissent . Thus , they of course also wo n't entertain the FACT that it is absolutely no accident that all across the U.S. and the Western world , and then some , the public water supplies consumed and bathed in by the vast majority of the population , are filled with fluoride . So , it is also absolutely no accident that the powers-that-be want to force us all to be vaccinated , in violation of informed-consen t , with vaccines full of immune-destroyi ng live viruses and preservatives -LRB- and , even if the mercury was removed , which I 'm not convinced of , there are several other immune-destroyi ng preservatives that are put in the vaccines -RRB- . Then , you add to that most of the pesticides , etc. , that are in all of our foods , and it is very clear that we are being systematically , and intentionally , poisoned at every turn , to lower our immunity and make us much more prone to disease -LRB- s -RRB- , and to cause us to develop cancer -LRB- s -RRB- . One thing that impedes arrival at consensus here is the combining of various ideas into a min-manufesto . For example , Loren-bliss 's 5-point offering above : four of five points seem worthy . So my support for 1-4 goes unvoted . Happens a lot with combination posts . Just a thought : maybe we could make more progress in our discussion by untangling our messaging . Coming up , blacks who acted like him were called Oreos . But Obama 's legacy is far worse than any of those blacks who simply seek white acceptance by adapting their racist memes . He has in fact taken away all of our rights to habeas corpus , provided more of the military weapons and equipment to police than any Presidents since Bill Clinton signed the 1033 Program , dramatically increased offshore oil drilling and onshore fracking for methane . And of course , he 's been bombing 7 or 8 countries , murdering untold numbers of non-whites . In other words white nazis are less bad than black nazis . That appears racist to me . To be sure , many of obama 's actions , and many US actions he has presided over have been severely disappointing . Because of being at odds with his campaign and other promises . But to the extent that particular expectations for his behavior in office were based on his race , that is the definition of racism . Well , he 's an Uncle Tom , too ; the same thing as calling him the Oreo cookie that he is . Falling for same is to falsely believe and respond the way -LRB- s -RRB- that the puppetmasters , false-propagand ists and controllers of the masses want us to believe and respond . It feeds right into their hands , and their manipulations and brainwashing of us . But , on the contrary , we ARE supposed to freely express , and allow , such speech . Apropos political correctness , obviously you who damn me as a racist are too simple minded to understand it is one of the most effective Ruling Class weapons to obscure the reality of -- and necessity for -- class struggle . Moreover , identity politics is the most effective barrier to Working Class solidarity our capitalist -LRB- i.e. , Nazi -RRB- overlords have yet devised . -LRB- By the way , this alleged racist you so maliciously denounce went to jail -- and by so doing sacrificed an extremely promising journalism career for the Civil Rights Movement . This was in Knoxville , Tenn. , on 2 June 1963 . Hence to be insulted and condemned by the likes of you -- or by any zealot whose identity-politi cs fanaticism is one of the enablers of Nazism -LRB- and is thus in fact a collaborator with Nazism -RRB- -- is not something to which I will silently submit . Campaigning as Obama the Orator , he shape-shifted into Barack the Betrayer literally days after his election . Moreover , the manner in which he transformed proved it was planned years before the 2008 election : that he was raised a moral imbecile and thereafter carefully schooled in the deceptions essential for false-flag candidacy . His legacy -- especially after our new Nazi overlords finish propagandizing it -- will be the destruction , forever , of all African-America n political aspirations . Not only is the Betrayer therefore an archetypal Uncle Tom , an exemplary Oreo , he is a traitor to his race -- and given the ecocidal capitalist malignancy of his Nazi deceptiveness , he is therefore a traitor to our entire species . Indeed , if there is any one person to be blamed for the fact that on 20 January we officially become a Nazi nation , it is Obama -- the Betrayer who made sure Trump would take office with all the powers formerly held by Adolf Hitler . In this context the color of Obama 's skin is pivotal -- precisely because it was the main prop he used to leverage his colossal deceptions . I do n't recall ever hearing a white use the term . Yes , for a member of an oppressed minority to deliberately do harm to other members of oppressed minorities can certainly be seen as worse . White males may be clueless . Not that that 's an excuse , but I know a lot of clueless people . Similarly , gay legislators who pass laws that discriminate against LGBTQ individuals can be seen as worse . Women who vote to take away other women 's right to choose can be seen as worse . They all should know better , and likely do . That 's how completely right-on it is . I 've avoided replying to your comments since that tiff , but have continued to up vote them as I continue to find almost all of them right on . Cheers back atcha . I 'm something of a wordsmith , so I looked it up . If that was not your complaint , you might want to repost as a direct reply to the offender . There have been a lot of people taking a lot of offense to a lot of posts for a lot of weeks due to misunderstandin gs . Errors in communication are unavoidable , but exactly as you suggest , we can not afford to alienate the people with whom we must collaborate most directly before we can make common cause with people with whom we have much more serious disagreements . Our Prime Minister John Key was sent here by the bankers to turn this country into a third world country which he has done . The people here have no input at all and have trade agreements forced upon us against our wishes . Police have been militarized and working for the National government . Clearly these fascist dictators are all over world doing their jobs of destroying nations , putting the people into debt from childhood , therefore enslaving them to their countries . Capitalism is rampant here with the people pushed to the wall , thrown out of their state houses to be sold . With such low wages many can not afford to buy food so families live in poverty , going hungry . Homelessness is rife throughout the country now . National has flooded the country with a hundred thousand immigrants a year , many with no job skills , and undercutting our wages . They can become citizens very quickly so will then be able to vote and keep the National Party in power . All has been well planned by using hegemony to keep the people in line . Many kiwis now can not be bothered voting which is having a terrible effect on elections . Throughout the world people are all suffering and what the Dakota Indians are going through is a travesty against humanity . Many of us are with you and you do not stand alone . Most people who get into politics sell out today , if it was n't always the case . It 's all part of the globalist corporate-fasci st plans to subjugate and enslave the entire West , and then the entire world . Hence what a huge irony if China , in its quest for economic independence , becomes the savior of human liberty . And many if not most of the packages from there are probably radioactive from being x-rayed going through customs , so we 're probably going to get cancer -LRB- s -RRB- from handling the packages and products . No , China is n't going to save us from nothin ' . The terrain is made for long range rifles and unless actual armored helicopter gunships are used regular helicopters are also in danger . The National Guard has the helicopters . So , we may find out if the American Military will shoot rebelling American Citizens on American soil .
