That jump was largely driven by a massive increase in solar panel installations , according to a report released Tuesday by the non-profit solar advocacy group The Solar Foundation . The rise in installations was caused by a rapid decrease in the cost of solar panels and unprecedented consumer demand , according to Andrea Luecke , president and executive director of The Solar Foundation . The National Solar Jobs Census 2016 , the seventh annual report on solar employment issued by the foundation , says installed solar capacity is projected to grow a record 14 gigawatts in 2016 , almost double the 7.5 GW growth experienced in 2015 . With such a gain , solar will likely exceed all other sources of new electric generating capacity for the year , according to the report . The solar jobs census follows a U.S. Department of Energy study released last month that found more Americans work in solar than at natural gas or coal power plants . The DOE report says 187,117 workers are employed at coal , oil , and natural gas power plants compared to nearly 374,000 people in the solar industry . The latest solar job numbers are significant . Still , the National Solar Jobs Census 2016 documents the dramatic growth of an industry in less than a decade . However , the growth in residential and commercial capacity deployment may offset utility-scale job losses , according to the report . A few more highlights : One out of every 50 new U.S. jobs was in the solar industry . Solar industry employment growth outpaced that of the overall U.S. economy by 17 times as it increased by over 51,000 jobs , for a total of 260,077 U.S. solar workers . The number of solar jobs increased in 44 of the 50 states in 2016 . California employs the most solar workers , followed by Massachusetts , Texas , Nevada , and Florida . Workers who install rooftop solar panels make up the largest share employment in the sector at 137,133 jobs . SolarCity , which merged with Tesla -LRB- tsla -RRB- in 2016 , Vivint Solar , and Sunrun -LRB- run -RRB- are the biggest residential installers . Manufacturing is a distant second with 38,121 jobs , followed by 34,400 in project development , and 32,147 in sales and distribution .
