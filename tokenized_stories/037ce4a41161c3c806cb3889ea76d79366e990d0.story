Every time we go , we encounter unexpected opportunities to serve the protectors there . Sometimes , it 's building materials or shelter . Sometimes , it 's gas cards or a warm meal after a cold day . Last trip , it was a visit to a doctor for a protector suffering from pneumonia . Recently , we got the opportunity to support the travel of Navajo & Hopi women from New Mexico . If you 'd like to support efforts to immediately meet needs like these with unexpected but much appreciated generosity & kindness , please stuff pennies from heaven in our pockets here on GoFundMe . When I woke up Tuesday , my heart told me it was time to head North . UPDATE : We 've arrived now , supplies in hand . Photo by Dallas Goldtooth . PS : If you would prefer , you may also make a cash PayPal transfer . All PayPal funds will be delivered in cash to camp so that the funds may be used for their emerging needs . I do not know how people against whom a genocide has been perpetrated , and whose land has been systematically stolen for centuries , continue to stand strong in the face of violence and oppression . I do not know . Only a few days since my return , and already I am exhausted . A few minutes ago I locked myself in a bathroom stall to cry tears that my body can not hold . I heard another woman stifling sobs in the stall next to mine . When we woke up this morning , the thermometer in our rental car read 38 degrees . We got a new rental car last night after a white pickup truck pursued us when we tried to catch a glimpse of just how close the pipeline has now come to the river . It appears pipe has now been laid nearly to the east bank of the river , while on the west they work all night under bright construction lights on a hill overlooking camp - mocking the protectors below . Today , we climbed out of our tiny condensation-soaked tent and took our morning drive to a nearby casino where we wash our faces , brush our teeth and check messages . Several more weeks . Someone needs to tell our President that this is no game . The pipeline has already been laid nearly to the bank of the river . North Dakota 's winter is quickly approaching . And our Native American brothers and sisters are being maced and mauled and shot with rubber bullets . On our way back to camp from the casino , the President 's words fresh in my mind , we saw blue dump trucks pull to a nearby intersection and dump mountains of destroyed belongings by the side of the road . Everything from the camp that was raided last week - tents , trash and rotten food were all piled together with ceremonial pipes , torn tipis , and sacred feathers . Fresh paint appeared to have been poured on the objects to cause even more damage than the bulldozers already had . As we walked over , we saw some crying while a few others gathered in prayer and burned sage before getting to work sorting through the items in an effort to recover whatever we could for those who lost all their belongings in last week 's raid . Someone remarked it felt like cleaning up after Katrina . But this was a hurricane purposefully wrought against people who were standing in prayer to protect the water . It was violence inflicted for profit . This was no force of Mother Nature ; it was the brute force of man inflicted on those standing up to protect Her . After spending a few hours folding blankets and sleeping bags in hopes that they would be returned to their owners in a condition that resembled something other than trash , we saw emergency vehicles headed toward camp and got word that mace and rubber bullets were again being deployed . We found our friend Desiree on the top of the hill directing emergency vehicles to someone who had reportedly been shot in the left lung with rubber bullets . We grabbed ear plugs and tape in case they used sound cannons , and walked to the water where a bridge that had been built overnight had been destroyed and the sound of the drum , song and prayers rose in opposition to dozens of militarized police who formed a line on the opposite bank . Our front line was in the cold water at their feet , with the protection of the prayers behind them and tarps and tupperware that they held up as shields when they were sprayed with mace , or when rubber bullets were aimed from point-blank range . I noticed one man in a headdress in the water whose body kept dancing to the beat of the drum throughout the confrontation . The irony of shirtless men using tarps and tupperware as shields against what appeared to be fully armed militarized police was too much to bear . If the line of troops on shore was not enough , more soldiers were in boats on the water . When someone near us threw a small clump of dirt futilely in the direction of an officer who had brandished a weapon , his brothers and sisters escorted him from the front line and reminded him that their movement was peaceful and prayerful . I wish you could have witnessed the intensity of the young men singing on those banks . How the soldier-police across the river maintained their position in the face of the pain they were causing , in the face of so many prayers rising , I will never know . Before the confrontation ended , we went back to check on our friend , and made her fruit salad with mangos and pomegranate as some small comfort in the midst of so much pain . We spoke about the irony of peaceful people standing in the face of such force , and through tears she reminded me that this has been going on for 500 years . I do not know how our country can stand idle in the face of such injustice . I do not know how we can continue to steal from the people whose land we now call our own . I do not know . So much I do not know and can not say for sure , but these are the words that came . I have never been in an occupied territory , but I imagine it must feel like this . Planes and drones fly low overhead in constant surveillance . A bridge to the north is out , ostensibly due to damage from recent confrontations . The road to the south has a police barricade at which you must check in every time you enter . People report being followed by black suburbans . Horse scouts report finding sniper sites near camp . We brought two-way radios to help improve communications at camp ; DAPL workers use the same frequencies to taunt them with so-called jokes about peace pipes and past violence . Some feel there are infiltrators in camp and that psychological warfare is being employed to inhibit trust and cohesion . There was a prairie fire the night before last about 100 yards from camp ; the emergency was reported around 1:45 am , and help finally arrived around 6 am . It is cold here too , but only a glimpse of how cold it will soon be . Yesterday , someone suffered hypothermia after falling out of a canoe into cold water . Everyone has been traumatized by recent violence . The UN has been here for the past two days to collect testimony at the circle by the fire . Hopefully , this will lead to further intervention . Amnesty International is also here to monitor the situation . There are plans in place to swim across the river to escape in case of a raid or violence . Meanwhile , DAPL construction is continuing around the clock , and it appears the pipeline is only a few days from breaching the river . It 's true that the Army Corps of Engineers has not yet issued river-crossing permits , but it is also true that it would likely cost the company more to delay construction than to pay whatever fines they may face by proceeding without the necessary permits . It would not be the first time a company broke the law after weighing the costs and benefits of doing so . As for on-the-ground help , if you 're in a position to raise funds and manage the logistics of delivering semi-trucks full of firewood or construction supplies , that would be helpful . If you can send pre-paid credit cards that can be distributed for campers to buy gas , propane or other supplies , please send them to PO Box 211 , Fort Yates , ND , 58538 . and we will use your funds to purchase whatever needs arise while we are here . If you feel called to Standing Rock , come . Know that it will not be easy or without risk , and come anyway . Your body is needed . Everyone here at camp must focus entirely on basic survival and the task at hand , the day-to-day hands-on effort to lead and execute direct action , all while processing recent trauma . If you are waiting for additional instruction after reading this list , look into your heart to find it . My own heart says we also need to push HRC to move past the equivocation of her recent statement . Yesterday , Our Revolution released a petition on this point . Also consider planning a coordinated protest this week at your local HRC campaign office or event . Right now , I am doing my very best to care for friends here - going on supply runs , shopping for comfort food , doing laundry and and unpacking mail . We have no coverage at camp so updates will be infrequent . If your heart calls you to help , if you have an idea , run far and fast . Standing Rock needs all the love you have to offer . After my mind tried to convince my heart otherwise with every last rational argument it could muster , and my husband did the same , my heart won -LRB- as she always does -RRB- . Yesterday , I bought tickets to return to North Dakota this weekend with my husband Sanjay . I do n't know how else to say it or how to say it less desperately . Please . We need you now . Like right now . Please . Today , as you may have seen , the police raided one camp , using pepper spray , rubber bullets and sound cannons to push Native Americans off the land to make way for a pipeline that will destroy sacred land and likely poison their water . I do not know what waits for us there at Standing Rock , but I hope you will come too if you can . If you can not come , please consider making a donation so that we can purchase supplies for camp as needed during our visit . Already , friends have reached out asking for fuel , firewood , gas cards , radios and more . We want to be able to provide whatever we can to keep our brothers & sisters safe and warm as they prepare to confront the advancement of militarized police , and weather the cold North Dakota winter .
