Gun control , immigration and money to combat the Zika virus top the congressional agenda as lawmakers sprint toward the political conventions this month and a seven-week summer recess . The Federal Aviation Administration carefully considers requests from law enforcement and other entities before establishing Temporary Flight Restrictions -LRB- TFR -RRB- in U.S. airspace . The TFR currently over the pipeline protest was approved to ensure the safety of aircraft in support of law enforcement and the safety of people on the ground . In the case of unmanned aircraft , operators must also comply with the requirements of Part 107 and coordinate beforehand with the FAA . Although the FAA is aware of anecdotal reports of drones being shot down , the agency has received only one official report . On Oct. 23 , a drone was shot down with bean bags after allegedly being flown in a threatening manner near a law enforcement helicopter . That incident is still under investigation . The agency also is investigating several incidents in which protestors have allegedly flown their drones in violation of the provisions of the TFR . Nor is it a legal basis for issuing flight restrictions . Mr. Sachs , a well-known authority on drone law , raises the question whether the TFR issued over the Standing Rock protests in North Dakota was issued for the same reason as the Ferguson TFR : to prevent journalists , specifically photojournalists using drones , from flying over the protest site and documenting the events . Ms. Lakin has not been flying the drones herself but has been providing technical assistance to Native American drone journalists . As Mr. Sachs points out in his article , the FAA has to follow specific regulations in establishing airspace flight restrictions . I reached out to the FAA for more specific information on why the TFR was issued , including whether it was issued because of the reports of drones being shot down . I also requested information on whether drone journalists could get permission to fly through the TFR and , if so , how . Lastly , I asked what the FAA was doing to investigate and prosecute the 8 or more instances of drones being shot down as the agency confirmed to me several months ago that shooting down drones was a felony . The FAA indicated that it would respond tomorrow . I will provide an update when it does . All Rights Reserved .
