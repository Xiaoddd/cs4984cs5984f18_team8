Eric Hylden , Forum News Service Facebook Twitter Email Print Save The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe applauded the federal government Wednesday for beginning additional environmental review of the Dakota Access Pipeline , while some North Dakota leaders called the process a delay tactic that will likely be rescinded by the Trump administration . The Department of the Army published a notice Wednesday to begin gathering information to prepare an environmental impact statement for the pipeline crossing at Lake Oahe , the site of recent protests . Sen. John Hoeven , R-N.D. , said an environmental impact statement could take months or years and called on President-elect Trump to approve the four-state pipeline without delay . Rep. Kevin Cramer , R-N.D. , said he expects the Trump administration will rescind the environmental impact statement process and issue an easement for the Lake Oahe crossing . Cramer said he is hopeful Trump will take action on Dakota Access next week or shortly thereafter . The notice from the Army said it is accepting comments on the scope of the environmental impact statement through Feb. 20 . The Army also said it will hold public scoping meetings that will be publicized at least 15 days in advance . Standing Rock leaders said the EIS should be more broad than currently proposed and should include the territory of the entire Great Sioux Nation , not just Lake Oahe and the northern border of the reservation .
