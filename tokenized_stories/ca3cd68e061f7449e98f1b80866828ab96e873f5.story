Satyagraha From Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search For the opera , see Satyagraha -LRB- opera -RRB- . For the 2013 Hindi film , see Satyagraha -LRB- film -RRB- . Shrimad Rajchandra , a revered philosopher , writer and poet , well known as the spiritual guru of Mahatma Gandhi who sowed the qualities of satya and ahimsa in him . He deployed satyagraha in the Indian independence movement and also during his earlier struggles in South Africa for Indian rights . Someone who practices satyagraha is a satyagrahi . Subsequently , to make it clearer , Gandhi changed it to Satyagraha . Nothing is or exists in reality except Truth . In the context of satyagraha , Truth therefore includes a -RRB- Truth in speech , as opposed to falsehood , b -RRB- what is real , as opposed to nonexistent -LRB- asat -RRB- and c -RRB- good as opposed to evil , or bad . Asatya , meaning untruth , also means nonexistent , and satya or truth also means that which is . If untruth does not so much as exist , its victory is out of the question . And truth being that which is , can never be destroyed . Truth -LRB- satya -RRB- implies love , and firmness -LRB- agraha -RRB- engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force . In September 1935 , a letter to P. K. Rao , Servants of India Society , Gandhi disputed the proposition that his idea of Civil Disobedience was adapted from the writings of Thoreau . The statement that I had derived my idea of civil disobedience from the writings of Thoreau is wrong . The resistance to authority in South Africa was well advanced before I got the essay of Thoreau on civil disobedience . But the movement was then known as passive resistance . As it was incomplete , I had coined the word satyagraha for the Gujarati readers . But I found that even civil disobedience failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle . I therefore adopted the phrase civil resistance . Gandhi described it as follows : I have also called it love-force or soul-force . For what appears to be truth to the one may appear to be error to the other . And patience means self-suffering . Moreover , passive resistance does not necessarily involve complete adherence to truth under every circumstance . Gandhi says : It is perhaps clear from the foregoing , that without ahimsa it is not possible to seek and find Truth . Ahimsa and Truth are so intertwined that it is practically impossible to disentangle and separate them . They are like the two sides of a coin , or rather of a smooth unstamped metallic disk . Nevertheless , ahimsa is the means ; Truth is the end . The opponent must be converted , at least as far as to stop obstructing the just end , for this cooperation to take place . There are cases , to be sure , when an opponent , for e.g. a dictator , has to be unseated and one can not wait to convert him . The satyagrahi would count this a partial success . The means used to obtain an end are wrapped up in and attached to that end . Therefore , it is contradictory to try to use unjust means to obtain justice or to try to use violence to obtain peace . I would say , ` means are , after all , everything ' . It arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power . If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy , we can not afford to be intolerant . This end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society . Therefore , the non-cooperation of satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the cooperation of the opponent that is consistent with truth and justice . But he would observe any obligatory rule of this kind , if only to escape the inconvenience of facing a prosecution for a breach of the rule . He founded the Sabarmati Ashram to teach satyagraha . Suffer the anger of the opponent . Never retaliate to assaults or punishment ; but do not submit , out of fear of punishment or assault , to an order given in anger . Voluntarily submit to arrest or confiscation of your own property . If you are a trustee of property , defend that property -LRB- non-violently -RRB- from confiscation with your life . Do not curse or swear . Do not insult the opponent . If anyone attempts to insult or assault your opponent , defend your opponent -LRB- non-violently -RRB- with your life . As a prisoner , behave courteously and obey prison regulations -LRB- except any that are contrary to self-respect -RRB- . As a prisoner , do not ask for special favourable treatment . As a prisoner , do not fast in an attempt to gain conveniences whose deprivation does not involve any injury to your self-respect . Joyfully obey the orders of the leaders of the civil disobedience action . For example , Martin Luther King Jr. wrote in his autobiography about Gandhi 's influence on his developing ideas regarding the Civil Rights Movement in the United States : Like most people , I had heard of Gandhi , but I had never studied him seriously . As I read I became deeply fascinated by his campaigns of nonviolent resistance . I was particularly moved by his Salt March to the Sea and his numerous fasts . The whole concept of Satyagraha -LRB- Satya is truth which equals love , and agraha is force ; Satyagraha , therefore , means truth force or love force -RRB- was profoundly significant to me . As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi , my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished , and I came to see for the first time its potency in the area of social reform . And for doing this I should not wait for the fellow Jews to join me in civil resistance , but would have confidence that in the end the rest were bound to follow my example . If one Jew or all the Jews were to accept the prescription here offered , he or they can not be worse off than now . But if the Jewish mind could be prepared for voluntary suffering , even the massacre I have imagined could be turned into a day of thanksgiving and joy that Jehovah had wrought deliverance of the race even at the hands of the tyrant . That involves the determination of India not to give quarter on any point whatsoever and to be ready to risk loss of several million lives . But I would consider that cost very cheap and victory won at that cost glorious . That India may not be ready to pay that price may be true . I hope it is not true , but some such price must be paid by any country that wants to retain its independence . After all , the sacrifice made by the Russians and the Chinese is enormous , and they are ready to risk all . The same could be said of the other countries also , whether aggressors or defenders . The cost is enormous . Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor . Cambridge University Press . pp . ISBN 978-1-139-45657-9 . Gandhi 's pilgrimage of faith : from darkness to light . SUNY Press . p. 138 .
