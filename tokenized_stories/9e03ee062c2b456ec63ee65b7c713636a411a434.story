Your weather is set to . You can change the location at any time . It 's got to be more than veterans . The uncompleted stretch of the project was set to run under Lake Oahe . In recent weeks , there was an all out call for military veterans to join the fight - a move that Flint resident Arthur Woodson said may have helped end the fight . Protesters have been fighting against the pipeline for months and have endured being shot with rubber bullets and sprayed with water in freezing temperatures by police . So far , reports say an estimated 564 people have been arrested . Woodson traveled to North Dakota on Dec. 3 to show support with fellow veterans with another Flint resident and military veteran , George F. Grundy II who said he was overwhelmed by the amount of attention the Flint water crisis had gained with supporters of the Standing Rock fight . Both Woodson and Grundy talked to community activists , veterans and Native Americans about Flint 's water crisis and stressed the need to keep the national spotlight on the issue . An estimated 4,500 veterans came to Standing Rock to support the protest . Community activist Jay Ponti said momentum has been loss with the Flint water crisis and journalists need to make sure it stays relevant in the news . It 's a great disservice . You can not have a healthy democracy if the citizens are not informed . When there is no information ... the citizens can not make decisions ... Our people are suffering . They are suffering in Standing Rock . They are suffering in Flint . Ponti who was covering the Standing Rock protest said he making plans to come to Flint to help with the city 's water crisis . In September 2015 it was found that children in Flint had elevated blood lead levels since the city 's switch from using Detroit as a water source in 2014 to the Flint River . They are poisoned .
