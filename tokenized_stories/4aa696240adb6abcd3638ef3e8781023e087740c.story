The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe applauds this decision , which comes on the heels of a similar move by ING , and a series of meetings between banks and tribal leadership . In a statement , DNB cites discussions with the tribe , the companies building DAPL , and its own consumers as the basis for its decision . With construction of DAPL nearing completion , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is calling on all investors behind DAPL to take action to address this blatant violation of tribal sovereignty . The remaining banks in the DAPL syndicate include Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ , BayernLB , BBVA , BNP Paribas , Citibank , Credit Agricole , ICBC , Intesa Sanpaolo , Mizuho Bank , Natixis , Societe Generale , SMBC , SunTrust , TD Securities , and Wells Fargo .
