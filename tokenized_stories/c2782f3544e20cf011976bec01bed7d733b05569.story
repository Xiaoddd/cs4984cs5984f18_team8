Tribal members conduct a cleansing ceremony for the veterans who traveled to North Dakota to oppose the Dakota Access oil pipeline . But in the end , veterans who traveled to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation found something far more profound . Inside the auditorium at a reservation casino , Wes Clark Jr. and about a dozen veterans in formation behind him faced a small group of Sioux spiritual leaders . Encircling them , hundreds of other veterans looked on . We fought you . We took your land . Then Clark took off his hat , dark blue with gold braid , and lowered to one knee , as did the veterans behind him . At a time when so much of the nation is divided by politics and ideology , the protest against the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota forged an unlikely coalition of veterans , Native Americans and environmentalists who produced an even more unlikely outcome . Thousands of veterans , including Clark 's group , had joined the encampment just one day before the Army Corps ' announcement . Then on Monday , as a blizzard bore down on Standing Rock , Clark took a knee and bowed before Lakota medicine man Leonard Crow Dog . As smoke from the sacred bundle of cedar , sage and sweetgrass rose , Crow Dog gently placed his hand on Clark 's head . Someone let out a ululating cry , and fellow Sioux spiritual leaders offered prayers and songs of cleansing and forgiveness . Hardened veterans wept openly . It was apparent that the former servicemen and - women received far more in the forgiveness than they gave in supplies and the goodwill they brought with them . Wes Clark Jr , center , apologized to tribal leaders for past misdeeds committed against Native Americans by the U.S. military . For many of them , the cleansing ceremony was the most visible of intimate encounters with the water protectors . After I got out , I pretty much did n't have anything worth fighting for . It was hard for me to comprehend something that was worth me dedicating time and effort in my life to do . But it was n't just the tent . His anger , frustration and sadness rose to the surface . Hardeen recalled his time overseas in quelling protests , essentially on the other side of the line , but declined to go into specifics . Hardeen 's own transformation began over the Thanksgiving weekend , when he drove from his home in Flagstaff , Ariz. , his Chevy Silverado loaded with hay bales , blankets , warm parkas and two sheep his family had butchered for the journey . It feels like actually I 've got a purpose . While I was in the Marines and serving , there was always a sense of longing . Native American veterans sing before a cleansing ceremony held by tribal members at the Prairie Knights Casino . He appreciated the sentiment , but said it was not only the veterans who needed to apologize . Tolan is a special correspondent .
