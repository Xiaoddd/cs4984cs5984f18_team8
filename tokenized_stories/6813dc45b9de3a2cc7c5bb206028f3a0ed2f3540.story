Oil pipeline construction . The Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes had argued that information about spill risks could potentially strengthen their case for more environmental review of the project . U.S. District Judge James Boasberg rejected that argument , saying that shielding the information from public view would prevent vandalism of the pipeline . Other information , however , will be available to the public , such as how Energy Transfer Partners plans to handle potential spills . Last year , protest camps near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation brought tens of thousands of protesters , including military veterans and activists from other countries . At times , the protests turned violent , with police using non-lethal bullets , dogs , teargas , and water cannons against protesters . As of February , there had been 750 arrests of anti-pipeline protesters , according to the Associated Press . The Obama administration had temporarily halted construction of the pipeline in December , ordering the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a more thorough environmental study of the risks associated with the pipeline . Any spill , the tribe argued , could threaten their access to clean water . The Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes are still currently engaged in litigation against the pipeline , arguing that the Army Corps failed to conduct a thorough enough environmental study of the pipeline . They also argue that the government failed to take tribal concerns into account when approving the pipeline . When pipeline operators , for instance , violate laws like the Clean Water Act by spilling pollutants into waterways , the EPA is normally the agency that imposes fines on those operators . Last week , for instance , the EPA and the Department of Justice issued a fine against a pipeline operator in Ohio that violated the Clean Water Act by discharging approximately 1,950 barrels of gasoline from a pipeline into nearby waterways . Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections : For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S. , particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election . We too were alarmed at the patterns we were , and still are , seeing . It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy , disciplined , and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before . It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time . We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century . The comments of our readers are the most vibrant , best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News . Accordingly , we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services . It is , however , important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in . Adapt and overcome . They already know the risks if not in fine grain detail - that 's why they are protesting the almost certain damage to and quite likely the loss of their drinking water . Remember United Airlines .
