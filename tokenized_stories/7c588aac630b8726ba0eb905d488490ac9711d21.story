Energy Transfer Partners spokesman Chuck Frey told North Dakota 's Public Service Commission Thursday that 56 percent of the easements needed along the North Dakota route have been obtained . The company wants to build the 1,100-mile pipeline to move 450,000 barrels of North Dakota crude daily to Illinois . Read it here . A public agency , such as the Iowa Department of Natural Resources or the Iowa Department of Transportation , would be required in such a project to test land for archaeological significance , wrote John Doershuk , director of the Office of the State Archaeologist , in a May 22 letter to the Iowa Utilities Board . Dallas-based Energy Transfer requested a permit from the Iowa Utilities Board for its subsidiary Dakota Access LLC to build the Bakken Pipeline for crude oil , which would cut diagonally across 343 miles in Iowa .

The US Fish and Wildlife Service has closed the application process for a position as Region 6 archaeologist to serve the states of North and South Dakota .
