During these weeks of action , we are calling on people to join us in solidarity by organizing actions targeting the banks funding these pipeline projects , or by joining the frontlines and taking action directly with us . Across Turtle Island , Indigenous people and frontline communities are leading the fight to stop oil and fracked-gas pipelines . These pipelines and all fossil fuel extraction endangers the communities they pass through , contaminate the air and water , contribute to global climate change and continue the colonization of native lands . When resisting these projects , we take every legal route available -- and we also utilize direct action : placing our bodies and lives on the line . As our resistance has escalated , so have the tactics of our opponents : we face intimidation , surveillance and violence . We confront government entities that are growing inseparable from the fossil fuel industry . Still , we resist . The pipeline projects we are fighting are all facing key moments and critical deadlines . If we are to stop these projects we must act now . It is with this backdrop that we are calling on you to rise up in solidarity with our frontline resistance . You can also organize a supply drive or fundraising event to support frontline resistance campaigns . Below is a list of banks that finance eight of the largest pipeline projects in so called US and Canada -LRB- Bayou Bridge , Rover , Atlantic Coast , KXL , Trans Mountain , Line 3 , Mariner East 2 and Mountain Valley -RRB- .
