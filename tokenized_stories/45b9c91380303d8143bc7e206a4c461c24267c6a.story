While the Murdoch press is stoking up tensions to undermine the Prime Minister , the simple fact is that there is a hardcore of reactionaries in his party who reject science and climate change . After yet another back down to the extreme Right within his Coalition Government , this time on climate change , the answer seems pretty clear . He stands for nothing , other than to remain in power . Turnbull is a salutary lesson in the pitfalls of managing capitalism in the two-decade-long decline of profit rates globally . In Australia , that decline began after the collapse of the mining boom . The graph below shows the stabilisation of profit rates after 1997 -LRB- and even an increase due to the neoliberal policies of the Howard Government and the intervention of the Rudd Government in the GFC -RRB- but the tendency of the rate of profit to fall -RRB- reasserting itself in 2013 . The latest Turnbull NEG sell-out debate has reignited tensions . As well , for them , the problem is the target being in delegated legislation , like an executive order or regulation . As previously mentioned , the target will be met more or less through the current Renewable Energy Target -LRB- RET -RRB- anyway , without further action . It was itself designed to appease the climate change deniers and coal fetishists in the Coalition . Politically , Turnbull is in no position to challenge these forces of reaction . He needs them for the Coalition to remain in power and for him to continue as Prime Minister . Now the emboldened extreme Right is apparently supporting Peter Dutton to challenge Turnbull for the Prime Ministership . This is more than just posturing by the climate change deniers and coal fetishists to put pressure on Turnbull to de-NEG the NEG . Dutton has denied he will challenge . The more intelligent Liberal Party members know they can not win an election under Dutton . As I have written , before it is not who is selling the shit sandwich that is the key to understanding the rejection of the Abbott government and now the Turnbull Government , it is the shit sandwich . Turnbull has not changed the ingredients he and the rest of his neoliberal crew are trying to sell us . It is why to date his Government has lost 38 Newspolls in a row . The disunity and infighting only make it worse for this neoliberal Turnbull Government . He is a one card trick of racism and xenophobia . They do not increase real wages . They do not improve public health , education and transport . All such fear campaigns do is fan the flames of racism and give Nazism an opportunity to flourish . It is built on the genocide of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people . It is built on the systemic racism that is Australian capitalism . This means that changing leaders or even changing the Government without challenging and defeating the systemic drivers of neoliberalism , racism and xenophobia , condemns us to repeat history over and over again , the first time as tragedy , the second time as farce . Our task to make Turnbull powerless must be to defeat racism , xenophobia and neoliberalism by our own collective efforts and in doing that give birth to a strong political Left in Australia , which challenges the old ways of doing things economically , politically and socially .
