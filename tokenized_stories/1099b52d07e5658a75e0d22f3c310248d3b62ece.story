USA Today reports that the arrests came just hours after remnants of the camp were set on fire as part of a departure ceremony . From USA Today : About 150 people marched arm-in-arm out of the camp , singing and playing drums as they walked down a highway . One man carried an American flag hung upside-down . Authorities sent buses to take protesters to the North Dakota capital of Bismarck , where they were offered fresh clothing , bus fare home and food and hotel vouchers . The encampment is on federal land in North Dakota between the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and the pipeline route that the Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners is constructing . When complete , the pipeline will carry oil through the Dakotas and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers set the Wednesday deadline , citing the threat of spring flooding . Advertisement USA Today also reports that Phyllis Young , one of the camp leaders , told the Associated Press that some of the remaining protesters were focused on moving off federal land and away from the flood plain into other camps . According to USA Today , there are new camps popping up on private land , including one the Cheyenne River Sioux set up about a mile from the main camp . Meanwhile , a group of about 20 other people , including 50-year-old Charles Whalen of Mille Lacs , Minn. , vowed not to leave on their own and were willing to be arrested to prove their point .

Doug Burgum , told AP that authorities would rather not apprehend people , but they would enforce the deadline . Water protectors made a massive effort to clean up the camp before leaving , and they got some assistance from the Army Corps in removing debris , but because vehicles and pedestrians were having trouble getting through the muck created by recent rain and snow , those cleanup efforts were suspended by camp officials who did not want heavy equipment making the conditions worse .
