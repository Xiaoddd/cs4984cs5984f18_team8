Violating anuk nu'at ` en -LRB- our laws -RRB- , Canadian law , and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples , BC and Canada have permitted TransCanada to work on their Coastal Gaslink pipeline within our Aboriginal title territories without obtaining our consent or undertaking meaningful consultation . The Wet ` suwet ` en people have never lost in court against BC or Canada . In the Delgamuukw-Gisday ` wa decision , the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Wet ` suwet ` en rights and title had never been extinguished across the 22,000 km2 of Wet ` suwet ` en Yi n'tah . As was upheld in the Tsilhqot ` in decision , Aboriginal title includes the right to exclusive use and occupation of land , and the right to decide its use . It is our people that steer our decisions as hereditary chiefs . The Delgamuukw-Gisdaywa ruling recognized the Baht ` lats -LRB- Feast Hall -RRB- as the forum of Wet ` suwet ` en governance . In feasts , the Gilseyhu , Laksamishu , Gitdumden and Tsayu clans have rejected all pipeline proposals . The province is aware that all affected Wet ` suwet ` en house groups reject TransCanada 's Coastal Gaslink project as it infringes on Wet ` suweten Title , Rights , and Interests . This consultation process exacerbates conflict in our Wet ` suwet ` en communities and creates public confusion . They are going to the elected people who have only jurisdiction on reserve land . Wet ` suwet ` en people have already witnessed catastrophic impacts from unimpeded industrial access to our Yi n'tah and neighbouring territories . From the damming of the Nechako River , which drowned our Caribou in 1952 , to seepage of toxic tailings from Equity 's silver mine that decimated the salmon stocks of Goosley Lake in the 1980s , to the many clear cuts that scar our lands , it is clear that industry can not be left to their own devices to operate on our Yi n'tah . We have to make sure that we are the ones that make the decisions on them . Release contains wide tables . View fullscreen . All rights reserved . A Cision company .
