After the announcement by the Army Corp of Engineers , denying the easement , police vacated their post by removing their police tanks , LRAD sound cannons , and other vehicles that had been stationed at the bridge since the confrontation took place . Since the time of the violent attack , the police erected numerous concrete barricades to prevent people from accessing or crossing the bridge . Due to the attack , a tribal elder was put in critical condition , with another woman left permanently blind in one eye after being shot in the face with a tear gas canister . As we previously reported , during that attack the heavily militarized police began firing water cannons , flashbang grenades , tear gas , and rubber bullets on water protectors trapped on the bridge . Following a brief confrontation with police , in which military vehicles were reportedly set alight by provacateurs , and ultimately cleared from the roadway by water protectors , heavily armed police in riot gear kettled water protectors on a bridge and began brutalizing those trapped . The already spotty internet availability has also been cut by law enforcement repeatedly during similar clashes , likely in coordination with TigerSwan , the private military contractor coordinating intelligence at Standing Rock To now see the unity of water protectors and military veterans marching side-by-side to reclaim the bridge is not only a symbolic victory but a strategic one as well , as the bridge is the access point between the construction area and the camps . Make no mistake that the strategic de-escalation by pro-DAPL forces will not be accepted the water protectors , which is seen as exactly the sleight-of-hand move it is , and that the fight against the DAPL will continue . The easement denial was in many ways is an attempt to derail the growing protest movement as it reached critical mass with the arrival of thousands of veterans .
