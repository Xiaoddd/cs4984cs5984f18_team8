But Woodley seems determined not to turn her arrest into a joke . But I immediately found myself cringing when he says Woodley was arrested and the audience laughs . Back in 2016 , Woodley talked about her arrest quite a bit . Hearing her talk now , I wonder what the last year and a half has been like for those 26 people . I do wish , though , that she were willing to use the P-word in discussing her own experiences .
