Here she explains the fund and the importance of promoting Indigenous voices within the media . Dedicating significant financial resources to reporting on Indigenous issues is an essential part of creating a more democratic media landscape in Canada . To this end , we have created the Indigenous Reporting Fund , which will prioritize support for Indigenous journalists undertaking investigative reporting projects . The fund will support in-depth reporting and complement the regular news and opinion articles we publish , but it will not not be the only Indigenous content you will read in Ricochet . Instead , it will beef up that content and ensure we are investing the necessary resources in telling the stories no one else is telling . This is through no fault of their own , as the public school system and journalism schools do not present these issues in an in-depth manner in their curricula except in Indigenous or Aboriginal studies . Seven dedicated investigative journalists and producers currently work at APTN , the national Aboriginal news broadcaster in Canada . Six journalists and producers work for CBC Aboriginal News Online , following the push for better analysis of Indigenous issues due to Idle No More . At the Tyee , there are general fellowships for journalists , including those that cover Aboriginal affairs , made possible through special fellowship funds . CanWest Global has one internship placement in broadcasting for Aboriginal students still in J-school , or freshly graduated , and this is no guarantee they will report on Indigenous issues . For a country of over 630 First Nations , representing over 1.4 million Indigenous people , 14 dedicated journalists to research , investigate and report in-depth news stories is not enough . The Indigenous Reporting Fund at Ricochet will prioritize the research and writing of Indigenous journalists . Ricochet has built its foundation to allow reporters the time , the independence and the focus needed for the sort of hard news stories that come with experience and skill . In addition to the investigative work of the fund , we will also debut a weekly opinion column on Indigenous issues . Shared between four to five writers from different nations , we will aim to cover underreported Indigenous stories from coast to coast to coast . Ricochet is dedicated to illuminating voices which go underrepresented in the mainstream media , and paying contributors a fair rate . We will prioritize pitches from Indigenous reporters , but we will also accept story ideas from experienced journalists who know the issues . Ricochet will also hold a dedicated crowdfunding campaign to raise the funds we need to support Indigenous investigative journalism , an inherently expensive endeavour . With your support , we look forward to building our Indigenous Reporting Fund into a hub for Indigenous reporting and writing , one that provides talented journalists with the funding and freedom they need . Whether we succeed depends on you . Support this experiment in crowdfunded news by becoming a member today .
