The regulatory process that the Army Corps employed in this task , known as Nationwide Permit 12 -LRB- NWP 12 -RRB- , is designed to do one thing and one thing only : fast-track the permitting of oil and gas infrastructure , circumventing the thorough environmental review required under the National Environmental Policy Act -LRB- NEPA -RRB- . chapters , NWP 12 was not supposed to apply to gargantuan , interstate fossil fuel projects . Having contributed to over 100 documents associated with NEPA reviews , I can honestly say that the process is not cheap . Using the notorious NWP 12 permitting process is another way out . Double , Double Oil in Trouble Double , double toil and trouble ; Fire Burn , and caldron bubble . After reaching a peak of over 1 million barrels in December 2014 , production in the Bakken oil field has been in decline . The downward spiral is not just limited to the Bakken . The Bakken Peak has sounded an alarm throughout the local oil and gas industry , which can be heard from construction workers to executives to everyone in between . For instance , the three largest Bakken drillers have experienced a precipitous collapse in revenue of 70 percent since 2014 . And this is a big problem for ETP , one that may lead to a Showcase Showdown with its backers . Moreover , while prices have slightly rebounded in recent months , analysts are skeptical that the recovery can be sustained . Even if it was operational by January 1 , 2017 , which is now impossible due to the Army Corps decision , the price of oil still would not be at 2014 levels . ETP knows this better than anyone , which may help explain why the company sold almost half of its stake in DAPL this past August to a joint venture involving Enbridge Energy Partners and Marathon Petroleum . But any relief from that move will not be realized until the Army Corps grants final approval . Stopping work at this time is near impossible without causing significant and extreme harm . It would be an infeasible task without grave and irreparable impacts to DAPL , its workers , the landowners , economy , both the state and federal government , and the environment . This may be the first and only time I say this in my life , but I think we need to take the oil corporation at its word . These developments are the equivalent of lighting money on fire . A Market-Based Solution We Can Get Behind The valiant and peaceful Native-led resistance to DAPL is in large part responsible for the Army Corps decision , which represents a major blow to the Black Snake . But as surreptitious as the oil and gas industry can be , they are never coy about their stated resolution to make as much money as possible for themselves and their stockholders , and 2017 will be no different . There is existing capacity in the region to move about 2.5 million gallons per day , meaning that DAPL is unnecessary . DAPL has taught us many lessons , and one of the most consequential may be reserved for oil investors : going in on fossil fuels is like putting money on the Cleveland Browns . If you listen closely , you will hear the silent screams of the Black Snake bleeding out . He has presented the case for climate justice , environmental justice , and climate change action at universities nation - and worldwide and written on the subjects for various publications . Here on the south most tip of Texas , the proposed Valley Crossing Pipeline to be built by Spectra is planned to connect with the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan Pipeline to be built by TransCanada partnered with Sempra out in the Gulf of Mexico .

DAPL gets its money back , the drinking and other domestic use of the river water will not be contaminated , and drought conditions can be mitigated .
