Sunday evening tensions escalated between police and protesters against construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . The confrontation on the Backwater Bridge involved at least 400 protesters , including Wilansky . Wayne Wilansky , Sophia 's father , says his daughter may need as many as 20 surgeries to save her arm and hand . He and witnesses to the incident say Sophia was struck in the arm by a concussion grenade thrown by law enforcement . Police officers have a different view on the explosion incident . Lieutenant Tom Iverson with North Dakota Highway Patrol says they were n't using concussion grenades at the scene and says the claim is false . They add that the group pulled a female from under a burned vehicle on the bridge then fled . Upon further investigation law enforcement says they recovered a punctured one pound propane cylinder , rocks and glass containers they say are commonly used to make Molotov cocktails . Iverson says they are aware of the information about Wilansky , but he says the injuries are inconsistent with any resources used by law enforcement and are not a direct result of any tools or weapons they used .
