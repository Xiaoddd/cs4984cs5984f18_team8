Expert agitator . You think you know but you have no idea . Thanksgiving has long been one of my favorite holidays . Thanksgiving is a holiday rooted in the genocide and displacement of Indigenous peoples . The mythical meal shared by Native peoples and colonizers , which is taught in middle schools all over the country , paves over this important context . In recent days , many of you have reached out asking how you can stand in solidarity with Indigenous communities resisting the pipeline . Learn the history of the people whose land you occupy . Discuss it with your family and friends . Awareness is the first step to shifting culture and behavior . We must de-center ourselves and center Indigenous culture . There are dozens of financial institutions and banks that are financing the Dakota Access Pipeline . Move your money to a credit union . I just withdrew all of my money from Citi , which is one of the main financiers of the pipeline . You should , too . For more on moving your money , check out here and here . Donate to the Native-led struggle against the pipeline . You can do so by contributing here , here and here . There are other places to donate , too . Forego your holiday gifts , and instead donate money so that folks on the frontlines can stay warm this winter as they block the construction of the pipeline . This is not Burning Man . This is not fun . People are not here for you to take their pictures , or to extract their stories , or to discuss a business opportunity . The Sacred Fire is not there for you to light your cigarettes in . Do not get on the camp microphone to freestyle . People are here in prayer , in defense of water , land , and a livable future . If you show up , do so in service of the needs of Indigenous people . In this respect , come with your ears , not your mouths . Check your expectations at the front gate . Take direction , and get your hands dirty . Recognize that many people here will not and can not leave until this pipeline is stopped . You are a guest on sacred land . This is not an experience ; this is survival . We need each other now more than ever . I hope you all have a blessed day with family and friends . Give Rob Friedman a round of applause .
