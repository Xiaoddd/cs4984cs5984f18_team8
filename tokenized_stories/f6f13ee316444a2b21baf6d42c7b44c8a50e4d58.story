Unfortunately , this is not the first time Magellan has dealt with spills from pipelines . The U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- recently settled federal charges against Magellan related to three previous spills . Magellan , formerly known as Williams Pipe Line Co. LLC. , was sued for their role in the spill of 5,177 barrels of petroleum products , which spilled into waterways . Magellan also contaminated the Pierre Bayou north of Texas City , Texas , when 482 barrels of gasoline leaked . Two Magellan pipelines in Nemaha , Nebraska , also burst after being struck by construction machinery and leaking 650 barrels of diesel fuel , 655 barrels of jet fuel , and 1,529 barrels of gasoline . This latest spill comes only days after President Trump issued executive orders and a presidential memorandum regarding moving forward on the Keystone XL pipeline and the Dakota Access pipeline . Both projects have faced heavy resistance from indigenous activists , environmentalists , and private property advocates who view eminent domain as theft . Only time will tell . Hopefully , for the sake of the Earth and humanity , Trump will end the suppression of alternative energy sources and allow the Oilgarchy to collapse under the weight of its unsustainable products .
