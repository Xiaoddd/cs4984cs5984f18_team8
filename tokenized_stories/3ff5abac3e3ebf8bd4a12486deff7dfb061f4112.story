It 's like a mini version of Central Park . It seems nice and clean , it 's beautiful to walk around in the summer and looks like a great place for whatever events may happen . I love the huge pond that 's in the center . I do n't know if I would get in that water myself but it looks like a lot of kids do . such a beautiful park ... so much history surrounding it . It 's green , lush with life , activity , and people . At Boston Common , you have all the space you could ever want . From sprawling space to picnic space , to park benches . the starting point of the Freedom Trail , and holds the distinction of being the oldest city park in the country . Spanning almost 50 acres There were a few carts set up to buy drinks or snacks , there were also guys making balloon animals for kids . Swan boat ride looked like fun . T station is right beneath it . The bronze fountain is decorated with the mythical figures of Neptune , Galatea , Amphitrite , and Acis . I can keep this place in the same line as Central Park , NY . Great place for a stroll . One of the great public spaces in Boston to enjoy . Great for a leisure walk or spending some outdoor time with kids or dog or even having a picnic . Freedom Trail begins here as well . Also close to many good dining locations -LRB- lunch and dinner -RRB- . Richer in history than many other areas , as a consequence of circumstances , it does n't so much cling to such but rather evoke a pride in it 's rich tapestry of the past . Exceedingly neat and well cared for the attraction of this area for individuals is to wander through it and to see and experience the myriad and variety of typical Bostian life ... . and if the sun shines what could possible be better . It is the oldest public park in the United States . It is a popular place for walking , biking , skateboarding and strolling with the kiddies . There is a beautiful lake with ducks and ducklings . There are some activities and boats for a little cruise . It is beautifully maintained and a wonderful refresher from the hustle and bustle of the city . Not only is this a beautiful park with well maintained grounds , but this is also the start of the Freedom Trail . There are a number of sights to see in the park , but also to pickup the Freedom Trail and begin your path back in time to learn about the history of our country . I was lucky enough to visit here during Memorial Day weekend and the park was decked out with American Flags to remember the fallen . best for families and kids with lots of energy to expend The historic landmarks and reading about them were my favorite experiences here . I came here by myself while on a trolley tour , and I rode the carousel . ride . I was the only adult who rode the carousel on that particular round . Playgrounds are for adults , too . I do n't even have kids but I love to do some kid things . That one is far more dignified and to my liking , but I 'm glad I went here , too . Each place you visit has something to offer , whether it 's a lesson or a laugh or a touching memory ... . So the big water fountain splasheroo wading pool is the big draw here . The bathrooms are the most HIDEOUS things you can imagine - sick and yucky , with long lines from hell . Go to a nearby business instead or try to hold it if you can . Do NOT do your business in the pool . That 's why I hated public pools , even as a kid . I definitely recommend taking a stroll here while visiting this lovely , historic city . The Common consists of 50 acres and is located downtown . I was impressed with how well maintained , clean , and safe it is . We walked through on our way to tour the Massachusetts State House in the afternoon and again at night , and it was well lit and we felt safe . There was a Shakespeare in the Park performance going on which would be a fun thing to do in the evening . Because this is n't just any park . Baseball fields , historic graveyards , lush botanical gardens , even carnival rides and foods . There it is , a refuge from the chaos of the city , right in the city . The grass is thick enough to walk around barefoot or layout beneath a tree . It is near every international store and boutique you could think of , at least 20 coffee shops , and twice that in restaurants . Certain nights find live music being played and the holidays find a large tree lit and decorated . Come here for a visit or for a day , but be sure to come here soon . I get the whole history aspect of this place . Possible seeing the history surround the city of Boston . Other than the history of this park , I 'm not exactly sure what people get excited about . It feels like a regular park . Just like any other . Not much really stands out . It 's kept clean . It 's centrally locates in the city . It somewhat feels like a poor mans version of Central Park . Again nothing really cool about it . Grab a coffee and walk through the entirety of the park in about 20 minutes . This is a lovely little park to take a stroll in . It is centrally located with beautiful and well maintained grounds . It is close to several fine dining establishments as well many dives . A few minutes from the Boston library , China town , and lots of hotels . The park itself also has lots of play area for young kids to play . It is filled with spaces to spread out on the grass , lots of beautiful mature trees , and water fountains . It is not expansive like Central Park , but is beautiful nonetheless , not to mention that the park is filled with US history ... Lots of history in Boston Common and kept relatively clean . However there were several homeless people sprawled on the grass which made a positive place about American history go negative really quickly . I could n't help but wonder why the city of Boston would allow that to happen in a place such as that . Back in Boston after a few years and I made a point of stopping here at the Boston Common for a few minutes . Early in the morning and still early August , it was warm enough to sit for a bit and take in the surroundings , listen to the history and watch the crazy lady feeding the pigeons . Quite a lot has happened on the Common which dates back nearly four hundred years to 1634 . Of course , Beacon Hill and the State Capitol is nearby with it 's large gold dome . Used as a camp ground by the British before the Revolutionary War , it was used for many public hangings until 1817 . Sometimes a dumping ground , part of it is a burial ground , it was used for protesting the Vietnam War . It has been a US National Historic Landmark since 1987 . I love a good middle-of-the-concrete-city park and this was no exception . There were food carts , fountains to play in , and grass galore . Friendly to all types : we saw bicyclists , runners , dogs , people playing sports , and even police horses . There is plenty of room to spread out on the grass and enjoy an evening among nature . America 's first public park , which means it has good and bad history . The park is very beautiful , lots of monuments , lots of stuff for kids to do -LRB- playground , splash pond , swan boats , etc -RRB- . A good place to go on walks . The park to me , does n't seem huge , which makes it easy to explore . A place to go to if you love history , have kids , and just like beautiful open space . One of my favorite places . Parking anywhere in Boston is pretty tough so I definitely recommend public transportation . I park miles away so I can walk through the city , grab some takeout and then throw down a blanket here with some food and my library book . People watching is at its finest . They have a cool little carousel here and a pond with a small food shack . Tons of benches and a few picnic tables . I always bring a bag of peanuts to feed the squirrels . They come right up to you . I love them . If you get thirsty or hungry there are venders around with Gatorade , lemonade etc. and you have to try those sausage with peppers and onions . Mmmmm . Food trucks stop here too so tons of choices . A little piece of heaven in the city . The history of the place is cool . Frog Pond , freedom trail , and impromptu labyrinth someone lined out with chalk . Food trucks and random vendors along the pathway . My favorite time coming here was when it was cool and drizzly . It 's perfect to jog through in the misty weather . The rain keeps most of the crowds away and I felt in tune with Boston 's urban Mother Nature environment . You can catch the T from here too . Really nice park . . loved the swans in the lake and flowers . Trees were blooming . I was a lovely very clean park and felt safe . . great green space to enjoy . We were only in town for a couple days but I wanted to see this park . Actually it had been mentioned several time by an author we both like . . Robert b Parker . . we have done his audiobooks on many road trips . There 's a large pavilion to lounge around as well as a cute merry go round to bring your kids -LRB- or adults -RRB- to hang out at . There were lots of bostonians ambling about during the work morning which was really nice . It 's very close to the Boston public gardens as well which is pretty and has lots of statues . Really beautiful and clean park . One of the best places to take pictures in Boston . I love going and seeing everyone with their dogs .
