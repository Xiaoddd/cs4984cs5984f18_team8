In the next few weeks Congressman Rob Bishop will attempt to push through the U.S. House of Representatives the first Indian land grab in over 100 years . In a startling lack of transparency , Congressman Bishop plans only one hearing on this 215-page bill with about 129 other land management proposals in the obscure Subcommittee on Federal Lands . The Ute Indian Tribe strongly opposes H.R. 5780 , the devastating effect it would have on our Uintah and Ouray Reservation and precedent that the bill sets for federal Indian policy . The bill is promoted as a local solution to difficult federal land management issues in eastern Utah . Nothing could be further from the truth . In fact , much of H.R. 5780 was built on the back of the Ute Indian Tribe and our 4.5 million acre Uintah and Ouray Reservation without our knowledge or consent . The Tribe was shocked to learn that the bill proposes to take more than 100,000 acres of our Reservation lands for the State of Utah . After 4 years and , apparently , more than 1,200 meetings with stakeholders , the Tribe first learned of this proposal when a discussion draft of the bill was released on January 20 , 2016 . Over these 4 years , the Congressmen never invited the Tribe to a meeting or came to our Reservation to discuss their proposal to take our lands . This modern day Indian land grab can not be allowed to stand . The Federal government rejected these devastating policies long ago as tribes prospered under policies of tribal self-determination and restoring and protecting tribal homelands . H.R. 5780 also proposes to alter the management of another 200,000 acres within our Reservation and without our consent . These changes would directly affect our ability to exercise tribal self-determination , utilize our water rights and manage our Reservation lands for the benefit of our members . The Ute Indian Tribe is a major economic engine in northeastern Utah . We are currently working with State and local governments to address long-standing issues related to jurisdiction , air quality , preservation of cultural and environmental resources , and responsible energy development . H.R. 5780 threatens to undermine these relationships . It did not have to be this way . If the Congressmen had accepted the Ute Indian Tribe as a full partner , we could have developed a Utah Public Lands Initiative capable of passing Congress .
