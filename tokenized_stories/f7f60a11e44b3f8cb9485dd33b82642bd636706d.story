Your CA Privacy Rights . For months , a steady drip of news reports have suggested a web of clandestine lobbying efforts by Flynn and his son Michael G. Flynn on behalf of foreign governments including Turkey . But it could also deal a more glancing blow . Obama had appeared tired , irritated , on the defensive . So did the liberal media , perhaps feeling betrayed by the vanishing act of their heretofore cheerleader in chief . But Obama , an indefatigable basketball fan , soon turned it around and flashed his competitive side . He roundly beat Romney in the second and third debates , before soaring through November and concluding one of the most quietly accomplished portfolios of any president in the modern era : auto-industry bailout , Wall Street reforms , new fuel-efficiency standards , increased aid to veterans , expanded F.D.A. food-safety oversight , gay marriage , getting private lenders out of the federal student-loan program , the Iran deal , and of course , the Affordable Care Act , a.k.a. Obamacare . Finally , in March , Obama put an end to the guessing game : the family will remain in Washington at least until youngest daughter Sasha graduates from high school in 2019 . Wherever they are , the windows are likely to be open . She even made Barack Obama laugh , inspiring a legendary set of photos of the former president doubled up in the Oval Office . Aretha Franklin was the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 . For 40 years , she held the record for the most songs on the Billboard Hot 100 , dethroned by Nicki Minaj in 2017 . Franklin , whose mother died when Aretha was 10 , was raised primarily by her father , C.L. Franklin , a Baptist minister and a civil-rights activist that organized the 1963 Detroit Walk to Freedom , which was the largest civil-rights demonstration in U.S. history until the March on Washington displaced it two months later . I 'm looking at the miles it covered . You had people everywhere in every corner and on every side and that went on for a very , very long way down Woodward . Franklin spent the turbulent 60s building her career , and in 1967 released her most famous song , and one that became inextricably linked to the civil rights and feminist movements of the time . Franklin , who Elle noted had it written into her contract in the 60s that she would never perform for a segregated audience , was glad that the song became linked to feminist and civil-rights movements . We are very resourceful . Women absolutely deserve respect . Though Franklin did n't participate in civil disobedience herself , she lent very public support to at least one person who did . In 1970 , famous feminist activist , scholar , and a then-avowed member of the Communist Party Angela Davis was arrested at the Howard Johnson Motor Lodge in Midtown Manhattan and incarcerated for 16 months for what were found to be wrongful kidnapping and murder charges . Angela Davis must go free . Black people must be free ... . Jail is hell to be in . Will Smith is even spotted scrubbing down the hood of a car while Azealia Banks perches in the branches of a tree . The video also includes tributes to artists who have died , including a reference to XXXtenacion , Michael Jackson , and Whitney Houston . She was a great woman , with a wonderful gift from God , her voice . But you can break the glass only once . has yet to declare some sort of emergency , as many on the left would like him to do . But you can break the glass only once . Many Americans would love for Obama to don a pink pussy hat and go full Olbermann on his successor . Others would like him to go away . To review , some of the moves of post-presidential Obama have surprised people . A temporary rental has become a full-fledged purchase , and the Obamas are installing a backyard pool , the sort of improvement that suggests a longer-term stay . When he and Michelle socialize at home , it tends to be with a small set of elite black Washingtonians . Things are low-key . It was a plea for the preservation of the liberal international order that readers mined mainly for digs at Donald Trump . The former primarily has to do with seemliness . The latter has to do with effectiveness . Fortunately for Obama , though , when it comes to buckraking , he stands on the shoulders of giants . Gerald Ford was the first ex-president to start cashing in with paid speeches , but Bill Clinton was the first to see its full potential , like Les Paul with the electric guitar . They also allowed Clinton Foundation work and government work to bleed into one another in notably lackadaisical fashion . His statements of principle and policy have never lined up consistently with his real-world actions . Obama could speak the language of working-class disaffection over trade or immigration , but he never acted much on either . He spoke of restraint and moderation when it came to race and gender , but his administration in practice took a heavy-handed approach on most civil-rights matters in which it could intervene , from school discipline and local policing to Title IX guidance on gender . He spoke often of transparency , but his administration fell short on that front , and even the Obama library will not house his records . On this , Americans are more divided . Some want him yelling through a bullhorn , while others prefer that he stay as quiet as George H.W. Bush did after Bill Clinton came to office . But , here , the grade for Obama rises much higher . When the Democratic Party seemed likely to choose Sanders supporter Keith Ellison to lead it , Obama stepped in behind the scenes to put a thumb on the scale for his labor secretary Tom Perez . When Obama released a list of 81 Democrats for state and federal office whom he is endorsing in the mid-term elections later this year , he omitted , among others , rising star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , a self-proclaimed socialist . Nothing about this is unethical , but it suggests that Obama sees a party lurch to the left as a threat to its future , while others argue that such a move provides its salvation . But you can break the glass only once . If Trump threatens our existence and requires extraordinary intervention , Obama will undoubtedly say so , probably in concert with his predecessors . Sitting presidents can do a lot to replenish their political capital , but ex-presidents must make do with an exhaustible supply . Republicans are opponents , not deplorables . Trump is a worrisome buffoon , not a Mussolini . The meetings with adversaries are flawed diplomacy , not capitulations to evil . Russia is a troublemaker , not a new Third Reich . His take should mean something . They trusted him , just as they distrust Trump . They assumed the best of the choices Obama was making and checked out , just as they now assume the worst of Trump and constantly check in . But you can break the glass only once . But you can break the glass only once . He famously went kitesurfing in the British Virgin Islands , took a nostalgic trip to his onetime childhood home of Indonesia , where he whitewater rafted , and was seen around New York City having lunch with Bono . A year later , 44 is still having just as much fun . Obama , who now has the time between book projects to attend these kinds of far-flung family functions , came to the opening of the Sauti Kuu Foundation , a resource center Auma founded . Here , the avid presidential dancer got to his feet and danced . He can be seen helping his step-grandmother to her feet as well . US President , Barack Obama gestures as he makes an address on July 16 , 2018 in front of a projected backdrop showing a view of his father 's home village , the hamlet of Nyang ` oma in Kogelo , during the opening of the Sauti Kuu Resource Centre founded by his half-sister , at Kogelo in Siaya county , western Kenya . - Obama is in the east african nation for the first time since he left the US presidency and met with President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga in Nairobi .

Texas is Texas , after all . It has no impact . I want to do what excites me . Cruz , too , is working hard and not taking the race for granted . And he has a point : in modern times , no Democratic candidate has hit more than 42 percent in a statewide election . For a midterm candidate . Because Democrats want to hear about both , and it would be silly to pretend otherwise . His communications director , Chris Evans , live-streamed shaky , grainy video of the whole event , as he does with every town hall , as the crowd rose with applause . There were college kids and veterans and old women standing up out of their wheelchairs to catch a glimpse of him . One woman cried at the touch of his hand . It seemed like a silly question . I was in Iowa in 2007 . The Legend of Beto is growing bigger than Texas . Bernie Sanders is perhaps the only other name that comes to mind , but Sanders was also unable to dispatch Hillary Clinton , one of the most unpopular candidates in American campaign history , in the last presidential race . Sanders is also 76 . And his fellow putative front-runners , Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden , will also be in their 70s if they decide to run next year . History also bears out an important pattern : since Vietnam , Democrats have only captured the White House by nominating youthful outsiders who offered a clean break from their predecessor . You hear that a lot from Democrats these days . They look uneasily at the current crop of potential candidates , and keep waiting for their Obama-like savior to surface . That might be true . Since 2008 , there is simply no evidence that voters in either party care more about ladder-climbing credentials than personality and vision . Nothing feels practiced . offers not just a path to victory in Texas but an antidote to the entire stupid artifice of American politics in the Trump era . At the 2016 Democratic Convention , just months before Donald Trump was elected to office , Michelle Obama delivered a searing but compassionate address to her fellow party members , urging the left to be better than bullies on the right . In the febrile early months of the Trump White House , shortly after the president took office , a mysterious memo began to circulate among West Wing staffers and the National Security Council . Until John Kelly was hired as chief of staff , Trump regularly received news in the form of Breitbart and Daily Caller articles . Like most ex-presidents , Barack Obama adheres to the longstanding tradition of refraining from criticizing his successor by name . The result is that Obama is under more pressure to act than most former presidents , particularly from a certain subset of the Democratic base that would love to see him tear Trump a new one . During his 90-minute speech at the Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture in South Africa on Tuesday , Obama stuck to his practice of not saying the T-word , but made a strong case against the rise of disturbing global trends that could theoretically result in a world leader much like Trump . The free press is under attack . Censorship and state control of media is on the rise . Though his words were strong , and his speech peppered with exhortations of hope , Obama seemed unwilling to use an excursion abroad to launch a grueling ideological battle at home . Inside Washington , it was assumed that Donald Trump would try to change the conversation after his debilitating diplomatic performance with Vladimir Putin last week . The bloodcurdling message that followed was spelled out with all capitalized letters . An exasperated press corps was firmly reproached by White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Monday . And to a degree , it worked . But Iran , a strategic petro-state with a sprawling network of influence throughout the Middle East , understands better than most how to thrive in the shadows . Unlike with North Korea , where there was little appetite for nuclear war in East Asia , the Republican Party is brimming with hard-liners hungry for regime change in Iran . U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , and National Security Adviser John Bolton , meanwhile , are all infamously hawkish on Iran . Outside of the neoconservative bubble , meanwhile , fear and consternation are rising . Insiders doubt that another glossy , high-profile summit can fix the problem , especially as relations with North Korea grow increasingly strained . The worst case , these people say , is a world in which Trump ultimately triggers a nuclear-arms race across the region . The Trump Organization , in which he retains a financial stake , is run by his two sons , one of whom has told the press he gives his father quarterly financial reports . Trump regularly hosts foreign heads of state at his for-profit club Mar-a-Lago , where the initiation fee doubled shortly before the inauguration , and where the presidential seal is printed on golf markers . The Chinese government has granted Trump dozens of trademarks . Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn , for one , seems to think the threat is total bulls -- t. McCabe , of course , had his security clearance revoked when he left the F.B.I. in January . WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH . On Wednesday morning , Kim Kardashian West arrived at the White House for the second time since May , where she will participate in a listening session on clemency and prison reform , along with senior adviser and First Son-in-Law , Jared Kushner , according to a person familiar with the plans . The Kush-dashian relationship has been building for months . -LRB- Kushner has had a personal connection to the topic ever since his father , Charles Kushner , was incarcerated for 14 months after being convicted of illegal campaign contributions , tax evasion , and witness tampering . Kardashian made her first visit to the West Wing at the end of May , when she met with Kushner , who took her to the Oval Office so she could formally ask President Trump to grant Johnson clemency . A week later , he did . Kardashian called Johnson in prison to share the news . Since then , Kardashian has been in near daily contact with Kushner or White House staff members to push for more names . After the president solicited N.F.L. players to suggest victims of the criminal-justice system in June , Kardashian reached out to ask whether he was serious , and if so , if she could compile a list , too . She was told that yes , she could , and decided to take Trump up on his offer . The bill faces a much steeper climb in the Senate , though Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed to a whip votes on the bill after elections . Kushner flew back commercially to D.C. , from a brief trip to New York , to be there in time for the listening session . This time , the meeting was kept intentionally quiet . It was always fairly obvious that the people who make up the Trump administration , as well as those who orbit it , are both dumb and mortifyingly unqualified . At this point , the entire operation seems like a mishmash of influence peddlers and profiteers . new generation of leaders is trying to reshape the world in the way it was handed to them . Flying to Fargo , North Dakota , on Friday , Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wants Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate the writer of the piece . With Trump so far unable to execute a strategy to stanch the drip-drip-drip of damaging disclosures , Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have taken the lead in getting control of the crisis . According to three sources , Jared and Ivanka floated a theory on Wednesday that Kelly could be behind the Times op-ed . Under this scenario , the sources said , the op-ed was written by Zachary Fuentes , the deputy chief of staff , at the direction of Kelly . On Wednesday night , Ivanka and Jared laid out for Trump the theory that Fuentes might be the author , an outside adviser with knowledge of the conversation told me . Trump disagreed with their theory , an outside adviser said . But for Javanka and others , Kelly and Fuentes are far from the only suspects , and West Wing advisers continue to hunt for the author . The Times reported yesterday that the White House has a list of around 12 potential suspects . According to one person familiar with the list , one person being scrutinized is Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman . One former West Wing official said that Huntsman had three strikes against him : he served in the Barack Obama administration , he was very close with John McCain , and he has political ambitions of his own . Jared and Ivanka never said this to anyone because the idea never crossed their mind .

The couple , who have been dating since 2012 , are vacationing in Italy alongside Paul McCartney , billionaire and husband of Diane von Furstenberg , Barry Diller , and designer and friend to Meghan Markle , Misha Nonoo . Kloss , who at one point enlisted the help of her boyfriend to take pictures of her on the yacht , has posted photos from her trip to Instagram , most recently of her in Portofino . narrative is O.A.I. is not competent and inexperienced . Last July , when the International Olympic Committee announced that Los Angeles would host the 2028 Olympic games , the Trump administration immediately seized on the political opportunities posed by the good fortune . Moreover , Trump found in the I.O.C. exactly the sort of deference that he most cherishes . Trump agreed , and , again handed the lift over to Kushner and O.A.I. By that July , the United States Soccer Federation , along with the corresponding groups from Canada and Mexico , had already confirmed its intentions to bid for the games in North America , and had since become the overwhelming favorite on account of its advanced infrastructure , facilities , and transportation options . Since Russia and Qatar had locked up the games in 2018 and 2022 , Asia and Europe were eliminated from consideration . Morocco had previously sought the World Cup in 1994 , 1998 , 2006 , and 2010 , but had been passed over each time on account of skepticism about its infrastructure capacity and capital . In any year , it would seem like an overmatched competitor against North America . But this year was different . Undeterred , the bid committee went into a full-court press , traveling around the globe to meet with about 150 of the 211 FIFA federation . The committee started communicating to Kushner , according to the person familiar with the situation , about how he might be able to exert his increasing influence on the global stage . He did the same with the House of Khalifa in Bahrain . The Department of Homeland Security , for instance , had to assure the committee that players would , in fact , be able to easily enter the country for the tournament . The Departments of State , Transportation , and Commerce had to make similar guarantees . President Trump also made entreaties to the committee , giving them his word that his immigration policy would not hinder travel to the U.S. for the World Cup . In what has been a long year and a half for the O.A.I. , it was a nice validation . But this is an accomplishment . It is . The book by the veteran White House chronicler portrays Donald Trump as an unhinged and ill-informed commander in chief surrounded by aides who doubt his intelligence and question his fitness for office . Current and former staffers , meanwhile , pointed fingers in all directions as they sought to deflect blame for the damaging leaks . Two sources told me Trump is furious at the portions of the book that describe administration officials questioning his intelligence and emotional stability . One source said Cohn called up his former colleagues to ask them how he came off in the book .

It appears that Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner are , in fact , enjoying their Italian vacation , as the couple have gotten engaged . According to People , the couple got engaged a few weeks ago during a trip to upstate New York . Unlike the whirlwind engagements of her peers -LRB- see : Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson -RRB- , Kloss and Kushner have been together since 2012 , making this engagement a little less surprising . Ivanka Trump sat in the first row , with her father and step-mother to her left , and her three siblings to her back . As expected , the conversation touched on how the family business might view its descent on its newest market : Washington . Leslie Stahl probed Ivanka about the assumption that she would be part of the Trump administration . The resultant criticism was swift , but the behavior was hardly new . A few months earlier , Ivanka had been chastised after her brand tweeted a link to purchase the dress she wore on stage at the Republican National Convention , in Cleveland . Both times , spokespeople blamed over-eager employees for the messages . In private , Ivanka Trump can be direct and less affected . In her public communications , she is often less straightforward . From early on , Ivanka Trump seemed to realize that a formal split between herself and her business was essentially only a talking point given the tacit financial connection between the business and its namesake ; she was , after all , the business . Like her father at the Trump Organization , she stepped down from her day-to-day responsibilities at her company and put her interests in a trust . Still , the arrangement would allow her to continue to profit off the business while she served as a senior White House staffer . But unlike her father , who is testing the limits of his notion that he could get away with murder in broad daylight , Ivanka is no Teflon Don . Since the campaign trail , she has been dogged by criticism over the conflicts of interest that her brand posed . She was dinged for wearing pieces from her line . She caught heat over a distribution deal with a Japanese company that had ties to the government . There was the furor when China issued trademarks to her companies in what seemed like a political gesture . Underneath the political upheaval are some economic considerations . Brand sales , which soared through the election year , had begun to lag . Some retailers , citing soft sales , stepped back . The brand was still making money , but perhaps not enough to justify the myriad complexities it posed . On Tuesday , the brand informed its 18 employees that the company would be shutting down for good , according to The Wall Street Journal . Ivanka was set to address the laid-off workers in the afternoon , telling the Journal that she had grown frustrated in recent months by the restrictions placed on the company in order to avoid conflicts of interest . Or at least dipping her toe in with the new opportunities she has been handed . This is a signal that she is in D.C. to stay . Every generation of Trump , or any dynastic family , builds and expands upon itself . Fred Trump built a respectable real-estate empire in Queens . Donald Trump took that empire and fortune and set his sights across the river to Manhattan , where he envisioned his name splashed across the city and his presence accepted in its insular circles , and lusted after fame . In recent weeks , she has spent her time participating in workforce-development events in the White House or in sessions on Capitol Hill , posting photos from a trip to an asphalt-company site and STEM summer camps . -LRB- Kardashian-West was asking President Trump to grant a pardon for a woman serving a life sentence in prison for a first-time drug offense . In some some ways , this latest move reflects some level of self-preservation . Sure , she slinks in for meetings or hair appointments or small dinners with confidants every now and then , but former friends note there is not exactly a welcoming committee waiting upon her arrival . Washington , though not without its own perils and criticisms , seems like the safest place for her right now , allowing her to chip away at a host of bipartisan , uncontroversial issues . She can do so while accepting invitations from world leaders , as she has from Angela Merkel , Shinzo Abe , and Narendra Modi , to speak on issues related to female entrepreneurs and workforce development . The person stalled . On the surface , there was a broad consensus regarding the 965-word New York Times column . Old-school conservatives and anti-Trumpers in the National Review mold condemned the op-ed writer for being self-serving in revealing what is , in effect , a conspiracy to undermine the president . Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume made a similar point . And those who do not quit or are not fired in the next few days will have to work even more assiduously to prove themselves loyal , obedient , and on the team . Things will be worse after this article . Those in the White House agreed , publicly turning on their unknown colleague . Trump himself was torn between his instinct to deny the existence of the mole as fake news , and to capitalize on his or her existence as proof of the seditious forces arrayed against him . As always , the hosts of Fox & Friends played the role of the concerned friend mounting an intervention . But as with all things Deep State-related , the conspiracies could not stop percolating : hoax proponent Mike Cernovich , meanwhile , wondered if the op-ed author was not a double-agent , but a Trump loyalist playing three-dimensional chess . In the wake of his outbursts , White House officials have discussed whether Trump would listen to his closest New York City friends in an effort to rein him in . But Trump refused to take the meeting , sources said . -LRB- Spokespeople for LeFrak and Lorber say they have no knowledge of a meeting . More than ever , Trump is acting by feeling and instinct . Even Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are unsettled that Trump is so gleefully acting on his most self-destructive impulses as his legal peril grows . According to a source , Jared and Ivanka told Trump that stripping security clearances from former intelligence officials would backfire , but Trump ignored them . Allen Weisselberg and National Enquirer publisher David Pecker are cooperating with federal prosecutors , have rattled Trump like few other turns in the investigation have , sources said . By the weekend , though , his anger had returned . According to sources , the president feels cornered with no clear way out . Privately , according to two sources , Trump attorneys suggested that a strategy for dealing with the issue could be for Trump to admit to having affairs with women and paying hush money to them for years . Trump , according to the sources , rejected this advice . Inside the West Wing , a sense of numbness and dread has set in among senior advisers as they gird for what Trump will do next . Two sources told me that Trump continues to raise the possibility of a pardon for Manafort , his former campaign chairman . Trump has been clashing with White House counsel Don McGahn , who , sources said , is strongly against granting Manafort a pardon . Is Nuts .
