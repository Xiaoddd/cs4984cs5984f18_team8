VIP The Harvard Gazette Saying no to the Dakota Access Pipeline Fake news is giving reality a run for its money National & World Affairs Saying no to the Dakota Access Pipeline National & World Affairs Saying no to the Dakota Access Pipeline A panel discussed the Dakota Access Pipeline under land owned by the Standing Rock Sioux , explaining their opposition and lessons learned during their protests . Speaking is Shelly Lowe , executive director of the Harvard University Native American Program . The panel at the Science Center emphasized the importance of bringing historical perspective to the fight over the pipeline in North Dakota , which is to go under an area that provides drinking water , and of linking the protests to such broader themes as national sovereignty , oppression of people , and destruction of the natural environment . Sponsored by the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History and the Harvard University Native American Program , the forum came a month after the camp was cleared by authorities , effectively ending the protest . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers earlier that month had approved the project . Ostler cited an 1874 military expedition led by Gen. George Armstrong Custer that confirmed rumors of gold on sacred Lakota land in the Black Hills of South Dakota , and a subsequent expedition led by Col. Richard Dodge . A poster advertising the event alludes to the anticipated polluting of the Missouri River by the Dakota Access Pipeline . Nick Estes , a member of the Lower Brule Sioux , also sought to put the pipeline episode in the broader context of the impact of racism , colonialism , and capitalism , topics he explores in a forthcoming book . And in the 1950s , he said , the need for water to meet irrigation and public drinking supply needs led to the creation of dams on the Missouri River that flooded more than 300,000 acres of mostly Sioux land . Jace Cuney DeCory , a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux and assistant professor of history and American Indian studies at Black Hills State University , said her family was among those displaced by the Missouri River dam project . But she sounded a note of optimism . The Grand Opening Celebration with performances , food , and more starts at 4 p.m. Thursday .
