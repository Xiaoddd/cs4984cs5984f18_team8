In the US alone , there are 130 endangered Native American languages . Among them is the Wukchumni language , spoken by the Yokuts of California . There is just one remaining fluent speaker : Marie Wilcox , who is fighting to keep Wukchumni alive . This short film , directed by Emmanuel Vaughan-Lee for Go Project Films , is dedicated to her . In the film , Wilcox says that she stopped speaking Wukchumni when her grandmother died . However , when she heard her sisters trying to teach their daughters , she started to go back to it word for word . Over the course of seven years , she and her daughter , Jennifer , worked on making a Wukchumni dictionary . This task is made even more pressing by the fact that Wukchumni is the only surviving dialect of the Tule-Kaweah language . Once the dictionary was finished , Wilcox set about on an equally important task : recording the sound of her language . Wilcox and her daughter also offer weekly language classes so that tribe members can regain the language and achieve fluency .
