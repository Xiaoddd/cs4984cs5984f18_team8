The event was held on International Human Rights Day because activists contend that the threat the pipeline poses to ancestral lands and drinking water is a human rights issue . The Standing Rock Sioux say the pipeline violates Sioux territory that the federal government established by treaty , and could disrupt sacred sites and contaminate their only supply of drinking water . Police have used water cannons , pepper spray , and rubber bullets against the people camped in protest at the Missouri River . Last week the Army Corps of Engineers said they will not approve the easement necessary to permit the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe in North Dakota , but protesters are worried the victory is a fleeting one . We have to persevere through our fear and turn it into courage because we ca n't let this pipeline go through . Native activists also want President Barack Obama to grant Leonard Peltier clemency before he leaves office , and they say time is running out . Peltier is a Native American activist convicted of the murder of two FBI agents at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota in 1975 , though supporters contend he was framed . Prominent human rights groups such as Amnesty International have called for the release of the 72-year-old Anishinabe-Lakota man , who now suffers from diabetes and other health problems . His health is deteriorating rapidly . The sweet , calming smell of burning sage permeated the air as musicians , dancers , drummers , and speakers performed at the rally in front of the Capitol building , many urging courage and vigilance . best of dcist The Best Ways To Get Local News In D.C. .
