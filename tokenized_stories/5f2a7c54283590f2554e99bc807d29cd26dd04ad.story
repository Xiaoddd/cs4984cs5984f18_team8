The pipeline would also run through a portion of the Ramapo Valley Reservation . Similar to the Standing Rock Sioux , the Lunaape worry that a potential pipeline leak would pollute drinking water and sacred sites . The pipeline is capable of carrying 400,000 barrels of oil per day . The company , which announced the project three years ago , has not yet applied for the permit that would define their exact pipeline route . Members of the Lunaape want others in New Jersey to join their fight against the project . NBC New York reports that the Lunaape have displayed anti-Pilgrim pipeline signs alongside teepees that were initially erected to recognize the efforts of the Standing Rock Sioux , who are protesting the heavily contested Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota . The tribe has been hosting teach-ins about the pipeline at their encampment . Dozens of people have already attended . Mahwah has issued a summons for their occupation , even though the town is officially against the pipeline and agrees that its route through Ramapo Valley Reservation is unacceptable . The coalition is calling on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to oppose the project . Cuomo and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation also denied a key permit to the Constitution Pipeline Project in April . Christie , however , is more of a wildcard . Although the Garden State is a solar power all-star , Christie is a fan of pipelines and a vocal supporter of the controversial Keystone XL .
