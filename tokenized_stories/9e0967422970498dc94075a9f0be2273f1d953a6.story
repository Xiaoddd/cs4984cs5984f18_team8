Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP , which owns the Dakota Access Pipeline , and Sunoco Logistics released a statement Sunday criticizing the Obama administration 's move to halt development . Anny Chen wants Winnipeggers to consider moving their money from big banks into credit unions that are n't invested in the oil and gas sector . RBC said they are lenders to Energy Transfer partners but do n't have direct financial involvement in the Dakota Access Pipeline . Chen said banks may not be actively financing the Dakota Access Pipeline in particular , but the fact they have money invested in the fossil fuel industry at all goes against the goals of sustainable energy . Chen asked . Winnipeg educator Leah Gazan said now that construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline has been suspended , it 's time for Canadian Indigenous land and water protectors to turn their attention to the pipelines approved recently by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau . Many protesters remain committed to staying at the Dakota Access Pipeline construction side through the winter .
