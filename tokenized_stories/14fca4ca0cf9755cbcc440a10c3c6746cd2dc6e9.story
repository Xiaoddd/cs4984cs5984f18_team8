This unprecedented cancelling of an EIS and further Tribal consultation will be challenged in court , with the filing of a motion for a temporary restraining order , and an injunction to halt construction . Mr. Trump has put the worst of his crocodile buddies in charge of that swamp , and they seem determined to do as much damage to our environment as quickly as possible . The range of issues , alternatives , and potential impacts may be expanded based on comments received in response to this notice and at public scoping meetings . Expect mass resistance far beyond what Trump has seen so far . And , it goes against the treaty rights of the entire Seven Councils Fires of the Sioux Nations . Our tribal nations and Indigenous grassroots peoples on the frontlines have had no input on this process .
