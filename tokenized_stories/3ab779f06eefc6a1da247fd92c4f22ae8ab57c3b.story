Hariri 's resignation last week was seen as a move by Riyadh to take its rivalry with Iran to the tiny Lebanon . Some fear the escalation will pave the way for Israel to strike against Hezbollah , against which Israel has fought a number of wars . Nasrallah said Saudi Arabia was encouraging Israel to attack Lebanon . While an Israeli attack could not be ruled out entirely , he said , it was unlikely partly because Israel knew it would pay a very high price . Western countries have looked on with alarm at the rising regional tension . U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned other countries and groups against using Lebanon as vehicle for a larger proxy fight in the Middle East , saying Washington strongly backed Lebanon 's independence and respected Hariri as a strong partner of the United States , referring to him as prime minister . The French foreign ministry said it wanted Hariri to be fully able to play what it called his essential role in Lebanon . Hariri has made no public remarks since announcing his resignation in a speech televised from Saudi Arabia , saying he feared assassination and accusing Iran and Hezbollah of sowing strife in the Arab world . Two top Lebanese government officials , a senior politician close to Hariri and a fourth source told Reuters on Thursday that the Lebanese authorities believe Hariri is being held in Saudi Arabia . Riyadh has advised Saudi citizens not to travel to Lebanon , or if already there to leave as soon as possible . Other Gulf states have also issued travel warnings . Those steps have raised concern that Riyadh could take measures against the tiny Arab state , which hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees .
