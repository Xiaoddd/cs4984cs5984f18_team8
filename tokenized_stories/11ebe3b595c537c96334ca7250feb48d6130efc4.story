After that conversation with his friend , Alexander Good Cane Milk quit his job , said goodbye to his girlfriend , and drove up to the protest camp , just outside the Standing Rock Sioux reservation . Living at camp and meeting people from different changed him , he said . He even took on a new name : Topa , the number four in the Dakota language . He stood on the front lines , facing the security guards and the police . He stood with members of the Crow Nation , once bitter enemies of his people , now allies in this battle . He was a warrior , he says . A water protector . Now , that fire has spread . Indigenous people are battling a pipeline in British Columbia . Others are standing up to pipelines in Louisiana and Virginia . And Topa is still fighting pipelines , in Wisconsin and Minnesota , nearly two years after Standing Rock .

But this is n't just a story about culture and identity . Treuer has written several other books , including a history of the Red Lake Nation in Minnesota .
