Donald Trump had just been elected . But then a couple of things happened . First , on Tuesday , the Obama administration said the Army Corps of Engineers would not make a decision right away . This is huge . I know how tempting it is to think President Barack Obama could swoop in and declare the Dakota Access project over . Each agency has to have a say , then it has to be debated at the White House , and at each step there has to be a legal basis to support a decision . This move is brilliant because it ties the decision-making process to an established law that requires federal agencies to consult with tribes . So if the Army Corps finds that it had not effectively carried out consultation , then it will have the justification to deny the permit to go under Lake Oahe and , more importantly , to deny the necessary easement . The Army Corps essentially admits that it rushed to build dams , destroyed habitat , and stole Indian land . Now , fast forward to Jan. 20 and a President Donald Trump . That means his administration would have to untangle the refusal of the permit , the easement under the lake , and the federal-tribal consultation process . It takes months to rewrite federal regulations , including publication of draft regulations with time for public comment and , of course , the mandated tribal consultation . At that point a President Trump will wonder if he really won . He can . This week , Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners filed a lawsuit in Washington , D.C. , demanding a federal court intervene and order the Army Corps to grant the easement . Because this filing represents a whole new potential area of litigation , as well as appeals , that will consume time and , possibly , much-needed transparency through the legal discovery process . It appears the Dakota Access pipeline has now lost its fight with time . It had promised to deliver oil to refineries by the end of this year . The estimate is a pre-sale of 8 million barrels of oil . Meanwhile , the fear at the Oceti Sakowin camp is that Energy Partners will drill anyway . More equipment has been moved into place so that it can tunnel under Lake Oahe right now . But if that happens , if the company is that brazen , it will be declaring war on the Army Corps of Engineers and , more significantly , the authority of a federal judge . No Ads .
