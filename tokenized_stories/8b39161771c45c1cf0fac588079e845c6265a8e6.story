Another climate-denying nominee will be named Friday for a key environmental position in the Trump administration , multiple sources are reporting . Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers -LRB- R-WA -RRB- will likely be tapped to lead the Department of the Interior , which oversees all of the U.S. public lands , including forest management , the Parks Service , and fossil fuel extraction . She has also opposed federal ownership of public lands and voted to make it more difficult for the president to create national monuments . McMorris Rodgers is the author of a bill that would have directed the Department of the Interior to sell off federal lands in Arizona , Colorado , Idaho , Montana , Nebraska , Nevada , New Mexico , Oregon , Utah , and Wyoming . The Interior Department transition team has been led by Doug Domenech , the director of a pro-fossil fuels project at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation . McMorris Rodgers has repeatedly expressed her support for oil . She supports expanding offshore drilling , voted for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , and voted against raising the royalty rates for oil and gas that comes from public lands . The Department of the Interior includes the Bureau of Offshore Energy Management , which permits offshore drilling and renewable energy . If confirmed under the Trump administration , McMorris Rodgers will have a key role in shaping the next plan . On the League of Conservation Voters scorecard , which tracks environmental votes in Congress , McMorris Rodgers has a lifetime score of 4 percent . Her 2015 score was zero . Advertisement McMorris Rodgers spent much of 2011 tweeting about high gas prices , which she blamed on Obama and the EPA . As production massively increased from 2009 to 2014 , gas prices did not fall accordingly . There are many complex economic factors that determine gas prices , including the fact that oil is traded on a global market . To that end , McMorris Rodgers voted to lift the oil export ban last year .

With McMorris Rodgers at the helm of the Department of the Interior , and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt heading the Environmental Protection Agency , environmentalists , public lands supporters , and climate advocates are bracing for many battles ahead .
