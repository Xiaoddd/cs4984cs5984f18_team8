A federal judge in Washington , D.C. , ruled that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers violated the National Environmental Policy Act -LRB- NEPA -RRB- in its expedited review of the pipeline , which was ordered by President Trump shortly after taking office . On Wednesday , the parties in the DAPL case will appear in court for a hearing about how to respond to the NEPA ruling . Oil could stop the flowing under Lake Oahe , the fourth-largest dam reservoir in the Dakotas . But that stoppage would be temporary . If the Army Corps does revise its environmental assessment , the court could allow the pipeline to resume operation . Lake Oahe stands at the center of a painful , decades-long story regarding the marginalization of Native Americans . In 1958 , the Army Corps took over 200,000 acres from the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux , forcing them from their homes and sacred religious sites , so it could build a dam . Fast-forward nearly 60 years , and the reservoir created by the dam draws a million yearly tourists to its more than 50 recreational sites . I joined the effort as legal researcher . Conservatives successfully employed the statute to argue that corporations with deeply-held religious beliefs , like the arts-and-crafts chain Hobby Lobby , could deny contraceptive coverage to female employees . In February of this year , attorneys for the Sioux tribes turned to the same playbook when seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe . Judge Boasberg pressed attorneys for the Sioux on whether they attributed the religious burden to the pipeline itself or the oil flowing through it . In 2008 , a federal judge in Oklahoma granted an injunction in response to a religious freedom claim by the Comanche tribe against the United States government . With numerous other encroachments onto indigenous land on the horizon , the religious freedom argument remains viable and relevant , with the Medicine Bluffs case as a hopeful precedent . Using the Religious Restoration Freedom Act to connect environmentalism with indigenous rights does far more for environmental justice than procedural laws like NEPA . In the legal and grassroots battles to come , we should remember that these legal challenges are not just about oil spills or environmental impact statements , they are about the very fabric that unites a people .
