Petition Closed Stop Militarized Response to Standing Rock Water Protectors This petition had 113,993 supporters Renee Roman Nose started this petition to President Barack H. Obama and 3 others Reports are pouring out from Standing Rock that the military are now moving in against the peaceful protectors who are camped to protect the water . Militarized police are macing peaceful men , women and children . Militarized police are rounding up protectors , charging them with trespassing , and subjecting them to strip search and overnight incarceration . This behavior is a flagrant abuse of civil liberties . There are more than 375 Tribes , and thousands of allies , who have come together from all over the world to highlight the importance of clean water . Present day protectors march in prayer to protect the water of their children and the bones of their ancestors . The clean water of more than 17 million people is threatened by the nearly inevitable oil leaks from this pipeline . In the face of this existential threat to the life of millions of people , the police and National Guard are serving as private enforcers of the pipeline company interests .
