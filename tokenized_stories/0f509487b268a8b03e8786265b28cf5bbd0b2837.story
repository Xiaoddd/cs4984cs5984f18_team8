We believe that the DAPL has great potential to leak into the Missouri River and cause harm to the great people of this nation whose water and livelihood depends on the river . Sign to stand with us and demand a stop to the Dakota Access Pipeline . Together with People Over Pipelines , we lead a relay race over 500 miles to deliver the signatures from this petition to the Army Corps of Engineers . Young people from across the Oceti Sakowin lands and non-Native youth ran over 8 days through South Dakota , Nebraska , and Iowa , from reservation to reservation , through smalls towns and bigger cities along the Missouri River . A lot of lives who will be effected if this pipeline were to be approved . The Dakota Access Pipeline is projected to extend 1,134 miles and connect the Bakken and Three Forks production areas in North Dakota to Patoka , Illinois . It is set to be built in May 2016 , with construction beginning in the Bakken , and is supposed to be running later this year . The DAPL is designed to transport 450,000 barrels of crude oil per day along this route , and it will cross the Missouri River less than a mile away from the Standing Rock Reservation . We 're worried that it could leak and pollute our river , poison our people . The power of prayers carried us at times we could n't run anymore , but something made us all get out there and keep running . We all understood that the sacrifice was much bigger than ourselves . We wanted people to hear us so we had to show them and bring the Dakota Access Pipeline issue to light to protect Unci Maka -LRB- Mother Earth -RRB- . We saw thousands of faces who would be impacted by the construction of this pipeline . The fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline can only be successful if we have your voice . Please sign your name to tell the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that the Dakota Access Pipeline Project is damaging to all life along the Missouri River . Let them know that we do not need oil to live , but we do need water , and water is a human right and not a privilege . Join Lynda and 564,463 supporters today .

We believe that the DAPL has great potential to cause harm to the great people of this nation whose water and livelihood depends on the Missouri River . For a long time , man has behaved as though he has absolute dominion over nature , and now we are beginning to see the effects of what this attitude has done to our world . DAPL is a 1,134-mile oil pipeline from the Bakken Shale deposits to Illinois refineries . The pipeline diameter would be 12-30 inches , with an expected capacity of up to 570,000 barrels per day , or more . The DAPL would cross the Missouri River less than one mile upstream of the mouth of the Cannon Ball River , and only about 12 river miles upstream from the Reservation drinking water intake on the Missouri River at Fort Yates . For this reason , there is a great possibility that anyone who gets their water from the Missouri River will be threatened by a potential spill . In North Dakota alone there have been 300 oil spills in the last two years . It is therefore not a matter of if the pipeline will break , but when , and how large the spill will be when it does . the threat to public health both on and off reservations , there is no lead federal agency for DAPL , so there has been no comprehensive environmental impact analysis . The oil company prepared an environmental report for the Corps of Engineers containing general information about certain segments of the pipeline , but there has been no effort to conduct the requisite analysis under the National Environmental Policy act -LRB- NEPA -RRB- . federal agencies have sent letters to the Army Corps with concerns with the draft EA . These organizations are the EPA , the Historic Preservation Office , and the Department of Interior . Dakota Access fails to meet the conditions of any one of these enacted recommendations it stands as a clear indication that it is not a safe & sound project deserving of permitting . needs you . has already take action for orca whales . orcas are starving to death . horses in Texas need your help in 100 degree weather .
