The story , like many others at the time , was being suffocating by an obstreperous presidential campaign that had just entered the home stretch . At first , I too had thought this was a Keystone XL one-off , soon to be swept away by the unforgiving cycle of news . But , after barreling half way across the country and trudging through over the frozen Dakota plains , I came to the realization that this story was riddled with oligarchic , environmental and indigenous oppression that was far more riveting than any pipeline story I had ever seen before . In September , I was honored to interview LaDonna Brave Bull Allard , who told me the story of her people and provided me with true insight on the issue . Just a couple of weeks prior , police had unleashed dogs on the water protectors . Allard had gotten involved solely for personal reasons . She had lost her son , and he was buried on ground adjacent to the pipeline site . Inspired by Allard 's story and commitment , I began to research Standing Rock . The government of North Dakota is dependent on the oil industry , and I realized the decision to cease the pipeline was much more difficult than it should ever be . Still , the abuse at the protest sight seemed impossible to ignore . As a young journalist fresh out of college , I covered the Democracy Spring movement , protesting Citizens United in Washington D.C. , where 1400 people were arrested . I covered protests outside the Democratic National Convention , including a three-mile march down Broad Street to FDR Park . In fact , these are events I very much enjoy reporting on . I believe that protesting is a cornerstone of democracy . This event was very different . This was not a protest . People from all over the country joining together to not only defend the land that belongs to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe , according to the treaties of Fort Laramie in 1851 and 1868 , but also to defend the purity of the Missouri river that 18 million Americans use as a source of drinking water . I was operating on a very tight budget . In terms of my tech equipment , I made use of what I had , bringing my mother 's ten-year-old canon 3od camera , a GoPro Hero 3 , my notebook , my laptop and a few portable phone chargers . I flew out of Newark Airport on a clear Friday morning . It set the scene for Standing Rock perfectly : The civil dissent took place while a corporatized media busied itself pursuing ratings and seeking profit , ginning up endless stories of Donald Trump , and then laying blame for the outcome of the presidential election on anybody and anything the pundits could conjure . I landed in Bismark and rented a car for the 55 minute trip to my hotel in Cannon Ball , North Dakota . I had never seen such dark roads in my life . About 12 miles from my destination , there was a roadblock . The main highway from Bismarck to Cannon Ball was closed , expressly to discourage people from traveling from to the protest . So I turned down the narrow road my navigation system diverted me to , but I came to a couple of dead ends . The small road was a sheet of ice , untouched by plow . While making a K-turn to head back towards the main highway , my car slid into a snowbank . I maneuvered lamely for half an hour but only made the situation worse . I was running out of ideas . To my surprise , an SUV pulled down the road . I tapped my brakes rapidly to draw attention to myself . The driver who stopped to offer his full assistance became someone I am still very thankful to have met . The man who stepped out of the car was Tony Hill , a Navy veteran who served eight years as an aviations electrician . We were both headed to the same place , and for similar reasons . He was properly dressed for the North Dakota weather , friendly and surprisingly talkative for someone I had just met . He had snacks , supplies and cases of water in his trunk . He looked prepared ; he looked like a veteran . I was pleased to have his companionship and encouraged by his conversation . By the time we got the rental back on the road , we were friends . We agreed to travel together to the protest the next morning . Oceti Sakowin , the protest camp of the Standing Rock Sioux , was one of the most beautiful places I had ever seen . It was much larger than I could have imagined . While in line I met a number of journalists , photographers , filmmakers and freelancers , mainly from smaller media outlets . I wanted to gather information from them and to understand why they decided to come out here and what they planned on documenting . I spent the rest of the day chatting with locals , veterans and travelers who came from all over the country to stand in solidarity . I walked up a hill just outside of the camp to get some shots of the closed and barricaded highway . The police , who looked like an army , loomed in the distance in armored vehicles and trucks . I was able to take some useful photographs and then made my way down the hill to Blackwater Bridge , walking to the furthest point we were allowed . He stared into the distance at the occupying force , as if he was sending some sort of message to them . There was something very eerie about it , something anachronistic to witness in the year 2016 . The atmosphere of Oceti Sakowin was one of peace and love . The camp was inhabited by people from all over the country who might otherwise never have crossed paths but who stood in solidarity for one common goal . It was the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed . On Monday morning , I attended an informal press conference for veterans that included speakers like Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and Phyllis Young , tribal elder and prominent leader of the movement . They thanked the veterans for their support , and discussed the importance of unity . I took some time to talk to a few veterans . Their courage and dedication to continued service of their nation 's best interests was inspiring . I realized at that moment how much their presence meant to the Natives , to activists and to the movement in its entirety . Seeing veterans travel far and wide to protect and stand in solidarity with the Native Americans and their supporters was awe inspiring . I saw Dr. Cornel West greeting protectors , natives and veterans with hugs and kind words . There was a large crowd and a strong spirit of confidence in the air . Protectors joined hands and encircled the entire camp . Minutes later , a Native came to announce that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had denied the final pipeline permit and construction would be halted . As word spread , so did joy and a sense of accomplishment . On Monday morning , I attended a ceremony in the casino I was staying at . It was a meeting between some of the military veterans and tribal members of the Standing Rock Sioux . Many of the elders , including Phyllis Young , Chief Leonard Crow Dog and others spoke before the crowd . They reminded everyone that there was still a fight ahead and that they must remain organized and peaceful , even if ETP defied orders and continued to drill . Afterwards , Wes Clark , Jr. , one of the primary leaders of the veterans ' movement , got in formation by rank , with his men and women behind him . He spoke softly , humbly asked for forgiveness for the long brutal history our country has with the Natives , and offered his service . The ceremony ended with the two groups hugging one another , while some veterans shared their stories and explained why they have come to contribute to this cause . My time in North Dakota was one of the greatest experiences of my life . It is about a level of environmental oppression that deserved national coverage . The story was overlooked as merely the latest chronicle in the tale of the haves and the have-nots . The Standing Rock Sioux encampment was a communitarian living structure : food , shelter and healthcare were shared . Much of what we take for granted is the same thing these people have historically been denied . Charlie May Charlie May is a news writer at Salon .
