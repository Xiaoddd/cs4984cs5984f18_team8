Tribes including the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux are fighting the Dakota Access project because they fear it will harm drinking water and cultural sites . Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners says the 1,200-mile pipeline through the Dakotas , Iowa and Illinois will be safe . The Corps cited North Dakota 's oncoming winter and increasingly contentious clashes between protesters and police . Advertisement The agency previously had said it would not evict protesters due to free speech reasons . North Dakota officials contend the Corps should not allow people to be on the land without a permit . More than 525 people from across the country have been arrested since August . In a recent clash between police and protesters near the path of the pipeline , officers used tear gas , rubber bullets and large water hoses in freezing weather . Organizers said at least 17 protesters were taken to the hospital , some for hypothermia and one for a serious arm injury . One officer was injured . It 's been called the largest gathering of Native American tribes in a century . Standing Rock tribal members and other Native Americans believe the land with the encampment is rightly owned by the Sioux through a more than century-old treaty with the U.S. government . Protest organizers said they do n't intend to leave or stop their acts of civil disobedience . Archambault and others do n't believe the Corps will forcibly evict people from the camp . The pipeline is projected to move a half-million barrels of crude oil daily to an existing pipeline in Patoka , Illinois , for shipment to Midwest and Gulf Coast markets . The Standing Rock Sioux , whose reservation straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border , are suing federal regulators for approving the pipeline . They have challenged the Corps ' decision to grant permits at more than 200 water crossings and argue that the pipeline would be placed less than a mile upstream of the reservation , potentially affecting drinking water for more than 8,000 tribal members and millions downstream . The tribe has n't fared well in court . A federal judge in September denied its request to block construction of the entire pipeline . An appeal is pending . The Corps of Engineers in July granted Energy Transfer Partners the permits needed for the crossing , but the agency decided in September that further analysis was warranted given the tribe 's concerns . Since then , the Corps has called for even more study and tribal input . The company responded by asking U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to declare that it has the right to lay pipe under Lake Oahe . The judge is n't likely to issue a decision until January at the earliest . President Barack Obama earlier this month raised the possibility of rerouting the pipeline , and Archambault has said that would be acceptable to the tribe provided the new route is n't near the reservation . Archambault and others have called on Obama to stop the pipeline altogether . Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren told The Associated Press that that the pipeline wo n't be rerouted and the company has no alternative than to stick to its plan . President-elect Donald Trump holds stock in Energy Transfer Partners . Pipeline opponents worry that Trump 's investments could affect any decision he makes on the project as president .
