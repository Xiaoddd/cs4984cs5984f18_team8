It was a battle over a story that could define the future of America . Its old version was that Indigenous peoples have always been in the way of progress , their interests a nuisance or threat , their treaties a discardable artifact . In that story , the American heroes forged on these high plains of the west were never the Indians : they were the gold-diggers or gamblers , the cowboys or cavalry . But over the past months , it became impossible to watch peaceful Indigenous people and supporters attacked by snarling dogs , maced , and shot with rubber bullets and water cannons in freezing conditions , and still see in them a threat . It was impossible to look upon these young Indigenous men and women , in jingle dresses or on horseback , and not observe the courage that America desperately needs . It was impossible to listen to the cry of their slogan and not hear a rallying vision for all of us : Water is Life . Along the snowy banks of the Missouri river , a new story is being painfully birthed . It tells us that frontiers must at some point close . That endless taking must become care-taking . And that Indigenous rights , cast aside for too long , are a key to protecting land and water and preventing climate chaos . America is waking up to new heroes . This is not high-minded romanticism . It is hard-bitten reality . Almost everywhere these fossil fuel projects have emerged , Indigenous peoples have been their first and fiercest opponents : the Cheyenne stopping coal in Montana , the Lummi defeating an export terminal in Washington , and throughout my country of Canada , Indigenous peoples standing in the way of mines and tar sands pipelines . Forget all those supposedly progressive heads of state who have touted the Paris climate accord but effectively undermined it with their actions : real climate leaders , those keeping carbon in the ground , are doing so directly on the land . Those with a deep stake in the prevailing economic order can not have it otherwise . That is why they are poor and America has become rich . That history squats on the present , explaining the continuing brutality toward them . Attempts by the North Dakota state to police them into submission , and then to deny emergency fire and ambulance services and to prevent delivery of supplies and food to the camp , are part of this lineage . Evicting Indigenous peoples from their lands or starving them out : in truth , the Indian wars never ended . But brave activism has shown that an unbroken history of ugliness and violence is never a guarantee of the future . It turns out treaty rights were never a specimen of the past . They were always living and sacred obligations . In ways clear to more and more people , they have also become the most powerful non-violent weapon for a habitable planet . Which means that honouring the treaty and land rights of Indigenous peoples is now not only a long-overdue moral and legal duty : a stable climate depends on it . That is something to remember as Donald Trump and his coterie of climate change-denying corporate lobbyists enter the White House , ready to lift any barriers to fossil fuel extraction . Who can yet tell to what new paths the victory here will lead . These Indigenous rights will , however , never gain their true and full clout without the power of a durable mass movement behind them . The dirt road in the centre of the water protectors camp displaying the flags of an unprecedented coalition of Indigenous nations is one necessary part of any future equation : the unparalleled support among non-Indigenous peoples is the other . The latter must now grow into the kind of power that can turn these rights into economic and political realities that are impossible to ignore . One promising such gesture of solidarity in early November was the astonishing 1.4 million people who symbolically signed into Standing Rock on Facebook . Alongside continuing divestment campaigns against the banks invested in the pipeline and continent-wide solidarity protests , which will continue through December , this is what can permanently turn the tide . So too the building of surprising but all-too-necessary alliances : like the thousands of American war veterans who joined the Standing Rock camp this weekend to act as human shields between the water protectors and the police and army . The story is indeed changing : even the cavalry are defecting , themselves becoming water protectors . With the White House soon to be taken over by Trump , the Dakota Access pipeline company may yet be approved next year . Even the environmental review now mandated may still end up green-lighting the current pipeline route . There is a great fight ahead . But a sense of hope and possibility loomed large at the water protectors camp , where celebrations with song and fireworks continued late into Sunday . According to the older story many of us know best , the routing of Indians was an inevitable step to civilizational advance . This time , if they lose , we all do . This time , Indians are winning .
