Any individuals found on Army land north of the river after that date would be considered trespassing and could be prosecuted . Temperatures were below freezing when protectors were repeatedly hosed down by police that Sunday night , November 20 . There have also been reports that concussion grenades were fired at protectors . Dozens were hospitalized , including 21-year-old Sophia Wilansky , who may face the amputation of her arm , and Cheree Lynn Soloman , who is fundraising for eye surgery . They want to push you off that land . The group , along with Honor the Earth , the International Youth Council , and the Camp of the Sacred Stones , is planning a news conference for Saturday afternoon , which IEN will live-stream from its Facebook page . If the Army Corps tears down this protest camp hundreds more will spring up in its place . A crucial alliance between indigenous values , native sovereignty and environmental movements has been forged here . We expect that the Standing Rock movement will find new and creative ways to fight the Dakota Access Pipeline no matter what , and that the Standing Rock movement and its alliances will find many areas of common ground and protest .
