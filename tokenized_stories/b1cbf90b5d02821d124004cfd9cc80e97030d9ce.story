Most people have found out about it through activist and well-known actress Shailene Woodley , who was arrested on October 10th for peacefully protesting DAPL , and live streamed her arrest on Facebook . Only now are we getting some type of media coverage , but the news and media has remained silent . The point of the pipeline is to transport up to 570,000 barrels of oil daily from North Dakota to Illinois . For reference , the pipeline was going to be placed in Bismarck , North Dakota but was averted by the residents because of their concern of having clean drinking water . Now , Bismarck 's population is predominantly white , so the fact that their needs were heard without hesitation and accommodated almost immediately boggles my mind , but I digress . A vast amount of Natives in North Dakota have resided in this reservation for many years , and the Missouri River is the only source of water that they have in their surroundings . The Pipeline is supposed to be run under the Missouri River , which is their main source of water and if DAPL is moved forward , there will eventually be a leak . Even the highest quality pipeline will eventually burst , creating pollution for the Natives that use this river as their main , if not only , source of water . Along with that , this pipeline work is supposed to be constructed in sacred burial grounds . Natives have become angered with this controversial happening and have taken this situation into their own hands . They are asking for allies to stand with them in solidarity and battle the demons of government greed . Natives have felt the burn and still remain as peaceful people , tolerating no violence on their part and living up to the standard of a truly peaceful protest . Many protesters have claimed that there have been aggressive and semi-violent approaches from the police force using K9 dogs as a form of intimidation . We can write to congressmen about the Standing Rock issue or make donations to the Standing Rock Tribe . Along with that , we can spread the word and get informed about this pressing issue in current events . I stand in solidarity with those suffering this terror . We must stand with them and remind one another , UNITED we stand , divided we fall . technical sections detected . technical sections detected . Sign up for our weekly newsletter .

This was the day that two of President Donald Trump 's most-important associates were convicted on eight counts each , and one directly implicated the president himself . Paul Manafort was Trump 's campaign chairman for a few months in 2016 , but the charges brought against him do n't necessarily implicate Trump . However , they are incredibly important considering was is one of the most influential people in the Trump campaign and picked Mike Pence to be the vice presidential candidate . Manafort was convicted on five counts of tax fraud , two counts of bank fraud , and one count of failure to file a report of a foreign bank account . And it could have been even worse . The jury was only unanimous on eight counts while 10 counts were declared a mistrial . Michael Cohen , Trump 's personal lawyer , told a judge that Trump explicitly instructed him to break campaign-finance laws by paying two women not to publicly disclose the affairs they had with Trump . Those two women are believed to be Karen McDougal , a Playboy model , and Stormy Daniels , a pornstar . Trump had an affair with both while married to his current wife , Melania . And then to no surprise , Fox News pundits spun this in the only way they know how . Sara Carter on Hannity said that the FBI and the Department of Justice are colluding as if it 's some sort of deep-state conspiracy . The Republican Party has for too long let Trump get away with criminal behavior , and it 's long past time to , at the very least , remove Mr. Trump from office . And then Trump should face the consequences for the crimes he has committed . Yes , Democrats have a role , too . But Republicans have control of both chambers of Congress , so they head every committee . They have the power to subpoena Trump 's tax returns , which they have not . They have the power to subpoena key witnesses in their Russia investigations , which they have not . It does not seem like there is one , so for the time being we 're stuck with a president who paid off two women he had an affair with in an attempt to influence a United States election . Imagine for a second that any past president had done even a fraction of what Trump has . Barack Obama got eviscerated for wearing a tan suit . If he had affairs with multiple women , then Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell would be preparing to burn him at the stake . If they wo n't , then Trump 's enthusiastic would be more than happy to do so . For too long we 've been saying that Trump is heading down a road similar to Nixon , but it 's evident now that we 're way past that point . Donald Trump now has incriminating evidence against him to prove he 's a criminal , and Special Counsel Robert Mueller is just getting started . Knowing his fragile ego , there 's honestly no telling what he 'll do . But it 's high time Trump leaves an office he never should have entered in the first place .

If you really pay attention to the story on the different platforms , many people are saying that white people are just mad because a black person is the featured person . No , actually , the race of the man has nothing to do with people 's feelings . The people that are upset by his actions , not the color of his skin . I do n't care what age , gender , ethnicity , sexual orientation someone is ... if we have differing opinions , then we just have differing opinions . It 's as simple as that . I recently came across a story of the white cop that was off duty when she entered her black neighbor 's apartment thinking it was her own . Then , she shot him thinking he had broken into her apartment . After this story came out , I saw a picture surface of her posing with this man that she shot . Maybe there was an altercation , maybe she wrongly shot him , but there 's no reason for everyone to just assume she did it out of racism . I 've said it before and I 'll say it again ... there is always going to be a bad apple in the bunch , but not everyone is racist . Just because there is one racist cop , one racist white person , one racist black person , one racist in politics ... that does not in any way mean that every person is that way . Some people think this way , but not everyone does . It all comes down to respect with me . If you respect me , I 'll respect you . It does not matter what you look like , listen to , agree with or do n't agree with . I will be friendly to anyone that deserves my kindness . Stop letting the media tell you it was out of racism . Stop believing it was out of racism . Stop spreading the rumor that it was out of racism . Just read the news and get the FACTS . This is what the world needs now . We need to come together , rather than letting everything divide us . These are setup in Ad Manager .
