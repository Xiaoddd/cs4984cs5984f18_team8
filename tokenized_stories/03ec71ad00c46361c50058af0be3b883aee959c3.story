Land protectors say the indiscriminate pepper spraying was unprovoked and have conducted themselves in non-violent fashion . Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirhmeier called the demonstration a riot . It was obvious to our officers who responded that the protesters engaged in escalated unlawful tactics and behavior during this event . Previously , he served as editor of the Native News Network . He is a resident of Grand Rapids , Michigan . This officer pushed one of the protectors and sprayed him with some liquid from a red canister . Of course it went viral over the internet as several thousand had already viewed it and comments made . There is definitely a need for negotiations here before this paramilitary force gets out of hand . This unprecedented Gather of First Nations governmental tribes caught every entity off guard and appear to be handling it as best as it can . Where is the EarthJustice Attorney who can mediate for both sides . TribalMember and Proud of it . 2 years ago Where is the proof of this behavior . In a court of law there must be evidence of such allegations . Selena F. Akerley 2 years ago AGAIN . As we have been saying all along .

The oil companies make their deals even Before those surveyors go out to the sights where these pipelines are being put into the ground . That is why even the elderly farmers out in Iowa who tried to stop the pipeline on their property were arrested and NOT those planning the construction . Eminent Domain , it allows this type of injustice to go on . There r cops being set to take the fall for misleading agendas , so the cops r being put between those who want to bring harm to the public or society and the rest of society or public . Marjorie Stevens 2 years ago We do not know about conspiracy . The lndians are guided by the Great Spirit and our sacred pipe . We do not intend to commit crimes . If theres a crime against looking for justice , where do we go to find justice here in America . They continue to morally confused and unable to live in Divine Order . Maka sitomne ukiye .
