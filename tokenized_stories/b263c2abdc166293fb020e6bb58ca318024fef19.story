London : Cape , 1979 . Most of them were Polish ; the Jewish children were already dead . So in the freezing cold they marched the children down to the river and made them take off their clothes and soak them in the water as if they were washing them , and then made them put on these wet clothes again . Then they marched them back to the area in front of the barracks where they had been living and had a roll call . Standing in their wet clothes . The roll call lasted for many , many hours while the children stood wet and freezing and night came . All of the children died of being exposed that day .
