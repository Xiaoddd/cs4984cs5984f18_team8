However , this whitewashed holiday has a different significance in Indian Country . It is a day of remembrance and mourning of the genocide perpetrated against millions of American Indians , the theft of their lands , and the relentless assault on their culture . Although pilgrims and Wampanoag Indians did share a meal in 1621 , this feast was followed by centuries of broken treaties ; murder , rape , and arson ; theft of land and property ; kidnapping and enslavement , as well as torture and imprisonment . What is omitted from the historically revisionist narrative of Thanksgiving is the fact that the American Indian population has since been decimated and surviving tribal citizens continue to have injustices perpetrated against them to this day . Despite the Standing Rock Sioux tribe raising the same concerns and others , the pipeline construction was approved for rerouting north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation . In response , hundreds of tribes from across the United States and indigenous populations from around the world have joined Standing Rock in protesting the pipeline . Police have been accused of committing human rights abuses against the predominantly peaceful demonstrators , by using water cannons in freezing temperatures as well as pepper spray , rubber bullets , dogs , tear gas , and concussion grenades . Some are describing these actions as perpetuating a modern form of colonialism , while others continue to rationalize and legitimize the pipeline construction . Today , American Indians continue to be put in positions where they must assert their sovereignty and protect themselves , their land , resources , and culture . The only difference is that now they are criminalized in order to delegitimize their cause .
