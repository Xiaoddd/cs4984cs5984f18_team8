The company had to stop cutting by the end of March in order to protect migratory birds and endangered bats in the path of the project , which will run from West Virginia to terminals in Virginia and North Carolina . Opponents of the controversial natural gas pipeline from the Appalachian Mountains to the Atlantic coast celebrated a win that will hold up the project . Jamshid Bakhtiari , the Virginia field coordinator for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network , said the FERC decision will delay but not stop the project . The denial means tree clearing has to halt until at least September , and at some points on the route , until mid-November . The pipeline is one of two conduits for fracked gas , up to 42 inches in diameter , that developers want to build through the central Appalachians , across terrain that critics say is both scenic and poorly suited to heavy infrastructure . The right-of-way for the line would be up to 125-feet wide , stretching from northern West Virginia to west of Wilmington , North Carolina , with a 70-mile spur to the Virginia coast near Norfolk . But while the pipeline has generated intense opposition along the 600-mile route , the builders have been racking up regulatory approvals in the three states it would traverse . It has all the federal authorization it needs , while Virginia and North Carolina officials have so far certified that the project will meet state environmental standards . Opponents are urging Governor Ralph Northam to put that report out for public comment before signing off on the findings . But the axes started swinging in January , three months after FERC stamped its approval on the project . It ran behind schedule , so builders asked the commission to extend the deadline to finish cutting until May 15 . That would have cut into the time when birds in the Appalachian forests would be nesting for the spring . The restrictions also were carved out to protect two species of bats that live in the area : the endangered Indiana bat , which roosts under the loose bark of dead or dying trees in the summer , and the threatened northern long-eared bat , which may roost in caves and mines . In its request , Dominion said it could make up for the extended cutting period by watching more closely for birds and bats before taking down trees . The company did not respond to a request for comment . Dominion said in February that it hoped construction would have been in full swing by early spring . But the resistance is still trying to convince FERC to reconsider its approval , and have asked a federal appeals court to block work while the commission weighs that request . That will make it more and more of a headache for Dominion and its shareholders , Bakhtiari said . Sign up for daily updates from Sierra magazine . Something went wrong .
