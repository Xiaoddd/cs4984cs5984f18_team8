Furthermore , African Canadians , in spite of their long history in Canada are seen as recent immigrants and thus not a part of the historical memory of the nation . The conference call claims that Afrikans played a crucial role in building the Canadian nation state and , therefore , should be included in the national historiography . Seeking inclusion could be strategic , given the multiple ways Afrikans have suffered within the confines of the colonial state . As the Canadian state consolidates its colonial hold through various juridical , discursive , and coercive means , violence against Afrikans increases . Given the depth of anti-black racism , the expansion of the prison industrial complex that affects many of our peoples , the economic and social deprivation , political disenfranchisement , and the reality that the racist apparatuses of the colonial Canadian nation state have violently erased and made invisible the histories of Afrikan peoples , it makes sense that we might seek freedom via any means possible . However , the violence of colonial inclusion , perpetuated by this approach for redress , is untenable . Afrikans , at times , have been forced , to be participants in a colonial project that was and is always intended for the benefit of white settlers . We should not wish to be included in the nation state ; inclusion is not freedom . History shows how the white supremacist colonial state of Canada strategically desires our inclusion at times , to further its colonial agenda , only to exclude us to sustain its racist , anti-black agenda . To be included in the nation-state is to be in a colonial relationship with Original Peoples of this land , and inclusion necessarily comes at the expense of Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination . To avoid perpetuating colonial relationships with the Original Peoples of this land , Afrikans need to reflect on our history here , our relationships with Original Peoples and continue working to practice decolonial solidarity against and beyond the nation state . A history of relationships Relationships between Peoples of Afrikan descent and the Original Peoples of Turtle Island have deeply entangled historical roots . Though quite contentious , there are historical accounts that suggest that our communities had relationships prior to European colonization of the Americas and trans-Atlantic enslavement of Afrikans . In each of these scenarios , relationships between Original Peoples and Afrikans are highly mediated by white supremacist colonial institutions . White supremacy has mediated in ways that have materially benefited Afrikans who have played the inclusion game . The allure of material gain has led some Afrikans to align with the Canadian state and seek their liberation through legal , economic and political processes of the state that constitute the network of the colonial apparatus . It is clear that , in these Afrikan maneuverings for inclusion , Original Peoples of this land do not figure outside of rhetorical gestures of solidarity . The doctrines of terra nullius continue to influence how some Afrikans view Original Peoples and their lands . White supremacy has also fed anti-Afrikan racism in some Indigenous circles -LRB- Amadahy & Lawrence , 2009 -RRB- . Thus , highly mediated by our respective oppressions under white supremacy , the relationships between Afrikans and Original Peoples of Turtle Island are inevitably complicated . White supremacy looms large in the interactions between our communities . Our histories show multiple forms of relationships of solidarity , against and beyond the nation state , that have contemporary resonance for Afrikans and Original Peoples . Original Peoples provided shelter and protection to Afrikans fleeing from slavery -LRB- Katz , 2008 -RRB- . A prominent example of this was the Underground Railroad that was supported by Indigenous communities in the north of Turtle Island . While an agreement existed between the British Governor of New York and the Iroquois Confederacy , the Delaware and the Huron , which bound these nations to return freed Afrikans back to enslavement , they did not comply -LRB- Katz , 2008 -RRB- . -LRB- Amadahy and Lawrence , 2009 , p. 107 -RRB- I read the quote above as a call for material decolonization . This is a call for a praxis that brings together the ideological and practical considerations of what it means to engage with and in a politics of Indigenous resurgence and self-determination , both for Original Peoples of Turtle Island and Afrikans . The question of self-determination is inevitably a question of land reclamation -LRB- Alfred & Corntassel , 2005 -RRB- . The land on which we carry out our struggles , and the Original Peoples of that land , should be a central aspect of our paths and strategies for our liberation beyond the nation . While the BSCA call could be read as calling for the telling of subjugated histories within the north of Turtle Island , it is also clearly a claim to belonging within the nation state , a nation state that is not a friend . Racism and colonialism root the Canadian nation state and they continue to sustain it . And , in the absence of radical anti-colonial change , the Euro-Canadian colonial nation state is here to stay . It is these colonial discourses that birth a desire to belong through Afrikan-Canadian nationalisms that seek inclusion into the colonial states . Inclusion continues to be promoted as the antidote to many of the oppressions that hinder our material wellbeing . It is a corrective philosophy that finds its support in the basic belief that oppression happens exclusively through means of exclusion . It is quite clear that inclusion and co-optation have scattered many revolutionary struggles . Additionally , inclusion within colonial nation states entails that those included are included under the terms of those in power . Afrikan liberation through state recognition and inclusion is untenable for the following reasons : It forecloses the possibility of telling other histories that do not fit into the narratives of racist , colonial Canada . For example , the histories of anticolonial collaboration between Indigenous peoples and Afrikans become untellable and unintelligible within this frame . It recruits Afrikans into relations of oppression with Original Peoples . Seeking inclusion is material endorsement of the continued colonization of this land . There are global implications and inconsistencies of Afrikans belonging to a imperialist nation state that continues to support oppression of Afrikans on the continent , in the Caribbean , in South America , as well as here . To claim a place in colonial history is to betray the possibility of Indigenous resurgence and self-determination . We can see , then , that the process of recruiting us into a colonial relationship with Original Peoples , through belonging , is a relationship we have an obligation to refuse . We can also see that anti-racism struggles that remain bound by political , legal and economic provisions of the Canadian nation state , are nothing but a perpetuation of colonization and the co-optation of our struggles . The only ethical option that remains for Afrikan Peoples is to connect in solidarity with Original Peoples against the logics of colonialism and white supremacy . Racism , capitalist exploitation , gendered violence , police brutality , and the imprisonment of Afrikan peoples are a result of and integrally constitute the colonial superstructure . The emancipation of Afrikans on Turtle Island is contingent on the Original Peoples of Turtle Island achieving sovereignty and own-determination ; our freedoms are folded into one another .
