The groundwater portion of the site will remain on the NPL to address benzene and to protect drinking water and agricultural wells . . Located just east of the city of Fillmore in Ventura County , the Pacific Coast Pipeline site was added to the EPA Superfund list in 1989 . Decades of oil and refinery operations and disposal at the site contaminated soil and groundwater with lead , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds . The surface soil portion of the cleanup , now complete , included excavation and disposal of more than 42,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil and the installation of a multi-layer cap . A soil cleanup system -LRB- air sparging -RRB- at the site continues to remove benzene and petroleum chemicals from soils deeper than 10 feet below the ground surface . While the property may be used for industrial or recreational purposes , residences and schools are not permitted to be built on the site . EPA will continue to assess the site every five years to determine if the cleanup remedy remains protective of human health and the environment . The most recent review , conducted in 2016 , found that the remedy at the Site is currently protective of human health and the environment . The Pacific Coast Pipeline partial deletion was finalized on March 22 , 2018 . Administrator Pruitt established the Superfund Task Force to provide recommendations for improving and expediting site cleanups and promoting redevelopment . Objectives identified in the Superfund Task Force report include maximizing full and partial deletions for sites that meet all applicable requirements and facilitating site redevelopment to support community revitalization . Work to prioritize and reinvigorate the Superfund program is underway and will continue in 2018 . Sign up for our free newsletter I agree to the Terms and Privacy Statement .
