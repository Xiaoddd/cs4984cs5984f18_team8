You really are what keeps us going , which is why , twice a year , we plead for donations like this . Whatever you decide to give , it does matter when it comes to TD . In July , The Intercept , the London-based research firm Forensic Architecture , and Amnesty International revealed that a drone base used by U.S. forces in Cameroon was also a site for illegal imprisonment , brutal torture , and even killings on the part of local forces . In August , according to a blockbuster investigation by the Daily Beast , U.S. Special Operations forces took part in a massacre in which 10 Somali civilians were killed . In October , four Special Operations soldiers were killed in murky circumstances during an ambush by militants in Niger . This spate of questionable , scandalous , or even criminal activity involving U.S. forces in Africa should come as little surprise . Over the last decade and a half , operations on that continent have been expanding and evolving at an exponential rate . There have also been numerous indications of U.S. forces behaving badly from one side of the continent to the other . Few in the mainstream media or among those tasked with oversight of such operations have , however , taken any significant notice of this . This attention deficit helped set the stage for the recent scandals that have forced lawmakers and the public to take some notice . The situation of the U.S. military in Africa is , in some respects , not unlike that in California , where TomDispatch regular Rebecca Gordon begins her latest article . There , climate-change-charged dry weather and unseasonably warm temperatures made the state a tinderbox that recently burst into a series of devastating wildfires . The U.S. military has created its own tinderbox in Africa , where longtime expansion without oversight has led to a series of blazing scandals . And all of this is just a small part of the larger story told by Gordon -- of a world filled with the dry underbrush of decades of failed U.S. policies and of a president with a penchant for setting fires . Once , ignoble political calculations , futile strategies , ideological idiocy , and intellectual ineptitude provided flashpoints capable of sparking foreign policy failures , conflicts , or ruinous domestic policies . Today , writes Gordon , the commander-in-chief functions as a one-man flamethrower , setting blazes the world over as a matter of whim and embracing the inferno as an end in itself . She and my dad got the call to evacuate after midnight last night . Months of dry weather and unseasonably warm temperatures have turned the southern part of the state into a tinderbox . Once again the country watches in horror as firefighters struggle to contain blazes of historic voracity -- as we watched only a couple of months ago when at least 250 wildfires spread across the counties north of San Francisco . All it takes is a spark . Sort of like the whole world in the age of Donald Trump . Not surprisingly , his prediction has already begun to come true with demonstrations in the West Bank , Gaza , and Lebanon , where U.S. flags and posters of President Trump were set alight . Kushner 's new BFF is Mohammed bin Salman , the heir apparent to the Saudi throne . The vast majority of Israeli settlements in the West Bank , which most of the world considers illegal , would remain . Here he has made a major concession to Israel without receiving a thing in return , except words of praise from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -LRB- and from evangelicals in this country -RRB- . Given that Israel came into possession of the eastern half of Jerusalem through military conquest in 1967 , a method of acquiring territory that international law views as illegal , it was quite a concession . The ultimate status of Jersalem is supposed to be a subject for the final stage of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations , not a gift to one side before the talks even begin . Behind this concession , as far as can be seen , lies no strategic intent of any sort , not in the Middle East at least . In fact , President Trump was perfectly clear about just why he was making the announcement : to distinguish himself from his predecessors . Just like his predecessors , he promptly signed a semi-annual waiver that once again delayed the actual embassy move for six months . It gave him the usual warm bath of adulation from his base and another burst of the pleasure he derives from seeing his name in the headlines . In his daily behavior , in fact , Trump acts less like a shrewd dealmaker than a child with pyromania , one who relieves anxiety and draws attention by starting fires . Each time , just imagine him striking another match , lighting another fuse , and then sitting back to watch the pyrotechnics . The Middle East has hardly been the only part of the world our president has taken visible pleasure in threatening to send up in flames . Consider the situation on the Korean peninsula , which remains the greatest danger the world faces today . In recent weeks , for instance , not only Trump but his coterie have continued to ramp up the rhetoric against that country . Indeed , Vipin Narang , a nuclear nonproliferation specialist at MIT , thinks the Trump administration may already have accepted the inevitability of such a war and the near-guarantee that South Korea and Japan will be devastated as well -- as long as it comes before North Korea can effectively launch a nuclear strike on the U.S. mainland . North Korea remains the designated U.S. enemy in a war that , almost seven decades later , has never officially ended . And Kim has had ample opportunity to observe how Washington has treated other leaders -LRB- Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi -RRB- who gave up their nuclear programs . Certainly , threats of fire and fury are not going to make him surrender his arsenal , but they may still make Donald Trump feel like a real commander-in-chief . These achievements helped realize his vision of the United States as a Great Society , one that provides for the basic needs of all its citizens . Not a subject he even mentioned on the campaign trail in 2016 , but different people are aiming that flamethrower now . As a friend said to me recently , taxes are a more organized way of crowd-funding human needs . President Trump is a different matter . This only requires a simple majority to pass in each house . He must be having an effect . At least half of all Republicans now seem to believe that he indeed did win that vote . And before we leave the subject , just a couple of final notes on literal fires in the Trump era . His Department of Transportation has been quietly at work making those more likely , too . Government data shows there have been 17 such derailments of trains carrying crude oil or ethanol in the U.S. since 2006 . Donald Trump can hardly be blamed for that one . The climate in this part of the world has already grown hotter and drier . There is the fact that much of the world is standing up to him . The head of the World Bank insisted that the institution would stop funding fossil fuel programs within the next two years . I take comfort , too , in the extraordinary achievements of international civil society . In fact , none of the existing nuclear powers signed it , but the treaty remains significant nonetheless . We should not underestimate the moral power of international agreements like this one . Few of us remember the 1928 Kellogg-Briand pact , which outlawed recourse to war for the resolution of international disputes . Nevertheless , that treaty formed the basis for the conviction of Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg for their crimes against peace . By implication , the Kellogg-Briand treaty also legalized a whole set of non-military actions nations can now take , including the use of economic sanctions against countries that violate international norms or laws . ICAN leaders Beatrice Fihn and Setsuko Thurlow -LRB- herself a Hiroshima survivor -RRB- believe that , over time , the treaty will change how the world thinks about nuclear weapons , transforming them from a necessary evil to an unthinkable one , and so will ultimately lead to their elimination .
