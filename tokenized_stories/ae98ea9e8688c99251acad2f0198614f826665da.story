EPA continues to oversee the response to the ExxonMobil Silvertip Pipeline Spill on the Yellowstone River . Sampling data results will be made available as quickly as validated results permit . A decision was made by Unified Command early on to ensure that all the response data associated with this incident be consistent with Montana DEQ methodology and standards . As such , we are using only certified labs in Montana and those businesses have been working diligently to process samples and data packages . When data becomes available it will immediately be posted to the maps section of the EPA website . Regulators said the company failed to adequately heed warnings that the line could rupture and there were no safeguards to minimize the spill when the line broke . The US Army Corps of Engineers had been tinkering with the upper Yellowstone River as the Billings Gazette 's Clair Johnson tells us : The plan , called the Upper Yellowstone River Special Area Management Plan , directs the Corps to evaluate how a project may affect the entire watershed , flood plain and valley before approving a permit . The Corps study began after two consecutive years of record flooding in the late 1990s triggered a rash of bank stabilization permits to prevent further erosion or property damage . Reuters brings this : After inspecting the pipeline in July 2009 , PHMSA issued a warning letter to Exxon a year later about oil leaking from some of the valves on the pipeline . Exxon resolved all the concerns raised by the agency and no fine was issued . From a post in Switchboard , the blog of the Natural Resources Defense Council , Anthony Swift says : An accident that should have been prevented is not really an accident . Tragedies like the Yellowstone River spill can be prevented by strong safety regulations and the proactive action of regulators . Today we are in desperate need of both . Pipeline accidents involving crude oil grew 87 percent from 2009 to 2014 . At least 73 incidents occurred last year , including the Bridger Pipeline LLC failure at Poplar . Almost half the incidents in the past five years involved pipelines installed more than 40 years ago . Eight months before the spill , the Army Corps of Engineers seemed the most likely agency to help repair the eroding riverbanks .
