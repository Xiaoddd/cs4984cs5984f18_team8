This action was in protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota , and in solidarity with the encampment and protest at Standing Rock . The burning of that oil would pump more greenhouse gases into the environment , further escalating the global climate crisis . The pipeline route cuts through land that is historically and culturally important to the Sioux and other Native people . And leaks from the pipeline where it is designed to cross the Missouri River would threaten the water , health , and livelihood of the people at Standing Rock reservation and millions of others in the region .

Now , of course , slavery was not the only factor that played a significant part in the emergence of the U.S. as a world power , whose economic strength underlies its massive military force . A major historical factor in all this was the theft of land , on a massive scale , from Mexico as well as from native peoples .
