Yet it clings to the walls of our tent , threatening to collapse the fragile structure . Repeatedly during the night , we pound on the tent walls to free them of snow . The sounds are abundant and loud . They continue late into the night . Singing and drumming . Voices joking and strategizing . Our tent remains warm and dry , but between camp noise and tent-wall snow removal duty , sleep is minimal . The next morning , the weather goes from bad to worse , with more snow and high winds that lead to blizzard conditions . Lyssa and I opt for breakfast at the casino , which is both satisfying in terms of the price tag , and unsatisfying in terms of nutrition and quality . Lyssa and Ed braving the blizzard en route to the meeting of elders in the dome . Manape LaMere , a camp leader and one of the seven elders , invites us to a meeting of camp elders . Lyssa and I lean into the blizzard for the grueling ten-minute walk from our tent site to the dome . We assemble in a cold , crowded structure heated by a wood stove . The air is filled with a cocktail of smoke from sage , wood and tobacco . The interior never warms up much . The meeting is long , interesting , important . The Elders talk about tribal unity , and the importance of non-native allies remembering that they are guests , and not here to provide leadership . The camp is governed by Native leaders using traditional structures and time-honored procedures . This is likely to be foreign , uncomfortable to non-natives at the camp . It is easy for those of us from a western mindset to slip into a mode of benevolent , well-intentioned colonialism . It is solid advice . White folk still have this imperial mindset , where are the ones to fix things , the ones who ride to the rescue . Ed , Manape LaMere and Julie LaChappa . Julie partook in the Farmers Defense Camp and civil disobedience in Iowa . They appreciate my report and the commitment of their allies in Iowa . But here at Standing Rock , this movement is more than just a fight against the pipeline . It is a movement of historic proportions . It is a movement that is just beginning , a movement involving the cultural revival of traditions , I believe , that will supplant the failed , non-sustainable paradigms that have dominated Western civilization .

Got it . we are with you all in spirit . Kathleen November 30 , 2016 at 5:55 am Ed , so glad you are keeping us updated . I am in Newton , Iowa and have been following since August . Have not participated in any direct nonviolent action events , but have given money and ordered several things for Mississippi Stand . I would like to have a better excuse than senior citizen with poor knees , but I do what I can from home . Someone from the Newton Daily News messaged me last night asking if I knew of any local vets participating this coming weekend . I did not know of any , although I posted the event in several Newton sites . Stay warm and safe and post pics when you can . I am so grateful for their vision on behalf of all of us and am keeping all of you wrapped in support and energy from a distance . We have much to learn from them .
