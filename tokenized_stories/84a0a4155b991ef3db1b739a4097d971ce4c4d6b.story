Plainly they do not . For the first time we can see the numbers on which the agreement depends , and their logic is inescapable . Governments can either meet their international commitments or allow the prospecting and development of new fossil fuel reserves . They can not do both . Thanks to a report by Oil Change International , we can now answer this question with a degree of precision . And even if all coal mining were to be shut down today , the oil and gas lined up so far would take it past 1.5 C . The notion that we can open any new reserves , whether by fracking for gas , drilling for oil or digging for coal , without scuppering the Paris commitments is simply untenable . There are tax breaks for North Sea oil and gas companies , and fracking , but not of course for renewables This is not an extreme precautionary case . Quite the opposite , in fact : the report uses the hazard assessment adopted by the United Nations . But despite vast efforts to demonstrate the technology , it has not been proved at scale , and appears to be going nowhere . Our energy policies rely on vapourware . As for the belief among some governments that they can overshoot the climate targets , then at a later date suck carbon dioxide out of the air : this depends on scenarios that would be no less realistic if they involved sorcery . The most popular proposal is to combine the capture and storage phantasm with biofuel plantations covering an area between one and three times the size of India , then harvesting the material they grow , burning it in power stations and burying the emissions . All this nonsense is a substitute for a simple proposition : stop digging . There is only one form of carbon capture and storage that is scientifically proven , and which can be deployed immediately : leaving fossil fuels in the ground . Not developing fossil fuel reserves is much easier than breaking them open then having to close them later . As the Oil Change report points out , shutting working mines and wellheads means confronting and compensating companies that have invested heavily in production , and retraining and re-employing the people who would lose work . Some of this will have to happen anyway , if governments are to honour their promise in Paris . But their effort should be to minimise pain , not to extend it . Their choices are as follows . First : a gradual , managed decline of existing production and its replacement with renewable energy and low-carbon infrastructure , which offer great potential for employment . Second : allowing fossil fuel production to continue at current rates for a while longer , followed by a sudden and severe termination of the sector , with dire consequences for both jobs and economies . Third : continuing to produce fossil fuels as we do today , followed by climate breakdown . Our governments seem determined to choose option three . Governments are intervening all right : to try to crush political opposition to these projects , while using public money to protect them from market forces . While local people have been granted a special veto over wind turbines , the government has awarded itself special powers to override local decisions on fracking , to ensure that it goes ahead . Preventing climate breakdown means defending democracy from plutocrats . I doubt it . Please choose your username under which you would like all your comments to show up .
