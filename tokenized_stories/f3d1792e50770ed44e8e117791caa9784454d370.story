But like Keystone XL , as DeSmog previously reported , much of the steel for the Dakota Access project appears to have been manufactured in Canada by Evraz North America , a subsidiary of the Russian steel giant Evraz . Evraz is owned in part by Roman Abramovich , a Russian multi-billionaire credited for bringing Russian President Vladimir Putin into office in the late 1990s . DeSmog 's finding comes on the heels of Trump 's former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigning for potentially having discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with Russian diplomats before Trump took office , apparently without the knowledge of Trump or now-Vice President Mike Pence . Trump repeated the steel production talking point at his first campaign rally for the 2020 presidential cycle , made less than a month into his presidency , on Feb. 18 in Melbourne , Florida . They said , sir , it can be made anywhere . I said not anymore . I put a little clause in the bottom . Lisa Dillinger , who does media relations for Dakota Access , LLC , told DeSmog that 57 percent of the pipeline was manufactured in the U.S. by both Stupp Corporation in Baton Rouge , Louisiana and Welspun in Lake Charles , Louisiana . The remaining pipe , Dillinger said , was manufactured in Canada , though she did not comment on which Canadian company manufactured the steel . Welspun does not appear to have a plant in Lake Charles , though it does have one in Little Rock , Arkansas . The company is headquartered in Mumbai , India , while Stupp is headquartered in Baton Rouge . Made in Canada In March 2015 , the Dakota Free Press published photos of a line pipe storage site located in Brown County , South Dakota . Four months later in July 2015 , Dakota Free Press published an image of an auction announcement from Aberdeen American News showing that 30 miles of line pipe in Brown County was up for auction . The occupant listed : Evraz North America . It also listed Dakota Access LLC as an interest holder . Indeed , that would only be a small fraction . Dakota Access is a 30-inch diameter pipeline and runs through Lincoln County . Dun , for what it 's worth , also lists unloading , hauling and racking 185 miles of Evraz and Welspun steel in North and South Dakota for Dakota Access as one of its projects on its website . Representatives for Dun did not respond to a request for comment submitted for this story . Evraz did not comment on how much steel it made for Dakota Access , referring DeSmog to its Jan. 24 press release touting Trump 's executive orders . Phony Claims Similar to Keystone XL , the steel production for the Dakota Access pipeline was a done deal long ago , well before the pipeline got all the permits it needed . In the case of Dakota Access , nearly all of the pipeline already sits underground , other than the most contentious segment , which could soon go under Lake Oahe and the Missouri River located near the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe 's land in North Dakota . That segment consists of 0.02 percent of the line , according to Energy Transfer Partners . Though many in leaders of the U.S. labor movement , including professional pipeliners , have praised Trump 's jobs initiatives , some within labor are n't as elated and are more critical of Trump 's claims about creating U.S. steel jobs .

The scorecard shows that 140 House members voted against chemical safeguards every time , while 149 members consistently voted for chemical safety protections . However , the action fund praised the lawmakers that bucked their party to vote for chemical safety , including Reps. voted for funding chemical reviews and against a farm bill that included pesticide safety loopholes . Florida Reps. A Preview of the People , Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule , two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Updated and reissued every five years , these guidelines are the nation 's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations . supply . These nominees will be well-known in their fields , and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers , academics and practitioners . part of the process is happening in real time . what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors . Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff , and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally . Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries . And here 's the first place you 'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition : rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected , USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first , soliciting public comments in the process . In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts , it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance . And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious . After the committee is announced in early 2019 , it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report . all appearances , the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs . though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable , plant-based diets have been all but stymied , there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle . Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance , including the meat industry , dairy industry , and sugar-sweetened beverage associations , as well as formula companies , which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers . -LRB- This may be happening in real-time , too . Exposure can be caused by contact , ingestion or inhalation . Short-term health effects can range from skin irritation and numbness to fever and headaches . Long-term exposure can lead to cancer , liver failure and sperm damage . is traditionally called blue-green algae is actually a class of microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria . Cyanobacteria can be toxic and can also produce various types of cyanotoxins that have different hazards . With their small , developing bodies , children are especially endangered by algae exposure . was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption . But it probably wo n't be the last , especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year . Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets . If you believe your pet may have been exposed , be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy , seizures , diarrhea or vomiting . And as climate change gets worse , the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks , creating a toxic feedback loop . The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish . Communities that struggle with regular , serious toxic algae outbreaks , like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie , can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation . The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth . The women were all non-smokers , had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies . Macrophages , which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body , protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles , such as bacteria and pollution particles . The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants . That 's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA 's Office of Inspector General -LRB- OIG -RRB- , the agency 's internal watchdog . EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement , and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was required to respond to the April 2017 petition within 90 days , but nearly 17 months have passed with no finding . more than 97,000 giraffes remain in the wild , and the species is gravely imperiled by habitat loss , civil unrest , hunting for meat and the international trade in bone carvings , skins and trophies . U.S. provides a large market for giraffe parts . for their six-foot-long necks , distinctive patterning and long eyelashes , giraffes have captured the human imagination for centuries . But so , under this definition , are multi-thousand-acre corporate entities using automated machinery to grow genetically engineered corn . Size of the farm is not a factor ; neither is the style of agriculture . A family farm may not even have a family that owns or works the land . issue with such a broad definition of family farming is primarily in the discourse . Aid is divvied up by revenue among family farmers , with additional programs going to some specialized farmers , like young or beginning farmers , organic farmers , and sustainable farmers .
