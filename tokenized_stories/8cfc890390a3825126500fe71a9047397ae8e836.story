I Live On A Reservation 3 Hours From Standing Rock . She is part of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Nations and Sicangu Lakota , and works with Seeding Sovereignty , a non-profit that brings indigenous women together against dangerous environmental practices . In grade school , you are taught that the Pilgrims sailed across from Europe in the Mayflower . Two months later , they landed in what is today Plymouth , Massachusetts . You are told that Squanto , an indigenous person from the Patuxet band of the Wampanoag Tribe , taught the Pilgrims how to grow food , to catch fish , to prevent them from starving to death . This treaty proposed that the Wampanoag would protect the English from any enemies , and that the English would do the same for the Wampanoag . But as all first nation tribes know , treaties meant nothing to the colonizers . The sickness they brought wiped out most of the Wampanoag Nation , but this was not the end . The pre-contact population of Native Americans across North and South America was as high as 112 million in 1492 , according to the Center for the Study of Diversity in Science , Technology , and Medicine . Today , there are only around three million Native Americans in what is now the U.S. , 30 percent of which are below the age of 18 , according to the National Congress of American Indians . The U.S. Census found that only seven percent of the native population is over the age of 65 . My family does not have enough money to have a feast for Thanksgiving , and neither do most families on reservations . If this seems radical or overdramatic , look back at everything I just told you . You might see why we feel this way . Courtesy of Andreanne Catt Last year , I spent my Thanksgiving with the International Indigenous Youth Council in Oceti Sakowin camp in Standing Rock , South Dakota . Today , we are still opposing big oil companies and the building of pipelines . On Thursday , Nov. 16 , 2017 , the Keystone Pipeline reportedly leaked 210,000 gallons of crude oil in Marshall County , South Dakota , the cause of which is under investigation . On Nov. 20 , the Nebraska Public Service Commission approved the last stage of the pipeline 's construction , clearing the way for KXL to pump more than 800,000 barrels of tar sands crude oil a day from Alberta to Steele City , Nebraska , then all the way to Nederland , Texas , in other connecting pipelines . We know the hurt that our ancestors had to go through just for us to be here today . Our people are still in pain : Over 90 percent of Native American women have experienced violence at the hands of a non-tribal member , according to the National Institute of Justice . That is 10 times higher than the national average . In my work with Seeding Sovereignty , a women-led non-profit organization that works to decolonize popular narratives like Thanksgiving , I teach self-care and coping mechanisms to other youth who have been affected by the violence of colonialism . We seek to amplify the voice of indigenous cultures and youth at a time when our communities and planet needs to move beyond the roles instilled by the patriarchy . We will keep fighting the same way our ancestors did to protect the land and to decolonize the story of Thanksgiving . So this year , when you 're sitting around the table with your family , remember what this day actually observes . It may not matter much to you , but it matters very much to us . Correction : A previous version of this article misrepresented the current population estimate for Native Americans in the U.S. . It has been updated to more accurately reflect that information .
