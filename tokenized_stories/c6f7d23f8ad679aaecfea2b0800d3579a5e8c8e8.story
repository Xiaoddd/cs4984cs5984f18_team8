A young United Farmworkers organizer , Cesar Chavez , was orchestrating peaceful protests by Filipino and Chicano farmworkers against meager pay and brutal working conditions . My father only reluctantly attended the hearings . While he was sympathetic with the farmworkers ' plight , he already had a full plate of issues ranging from the Vietnam War , rioting cities to starvation in the Delta and education on Indian reservations . He did n't think he had bandwidth for another cause . The prospect of law enforcement officials deploying the states police power on behalf of lawbreaking corporations against law abiding citizens whose only crime was their poverty and powerlessness made him steam . My father despised bullies and believed in rule of law . He gaveled the morning session to a close . That afternoon , he joined the farmworkers on their picket line . Chavez became his closest political and moral ally . On Sunday , the U.S. Army Corps issued a declaration to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe that might have been penned by the Kern county sheriff . The Corps Colonel John Henderson told Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II that the agency was evicting the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- protesters from their camp for their own protection . Henderson 's threats would be troubling if addressed to any group of American citizens , but coming from the U.S. Army Corps to the Sioux Nation , it is positively chilling . One wonders whether Colonel Henderson is even peripherally aware of the Corp 's central role in the Indian genocide , the most shameful stain on America 's national experience , our high ideals and character . Standing with my son Conor Kennedy and the water protectors . Anthropologist Nancy Scheper-Hughes has observed that Genocide is a continuum that runs for years , decades or centuries . It begins with marginalization and dehumanization of an identifiable minority , the theft of their lands and property , their slaughter and decimation , and the gradual squeezing of remnant populations . Colonel Henderson 's letter manages to be both , patronizing and menacing . Similar letters to the Sioux preceded the evictions that reliably followed their various treaties with the American government in 1825 , 1837 , 1851 and 1868 . Those missives were the milestones that officially declared , justified or ratified the long parade of treaty violations by the U.S. government , enforced by the Army Corps , each of them shrinking the Sioux 's rightful treaty lands . It 's worth remembering that the lands and waterways now coveted by Dakota Access , a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners , are the same lands our government and the U.S. Army Corps deeded the Sioux in the treaties of 1825 and 1851 . Eight years after we signed that last treaty , the Sioux received their most devastating removal letter from the Army Corps ; Trespassing prospectors had discovered gold in the Black Hills , the sacred lands and critical hunting grounds where the Sioux wintered away from the frigid , barren plains that are uninhabitable during the cold months . In direct violation of the treaty , Colonel George Custer rode into the Black Hills to evict the justifiably angry Sioux to make way for the illegal mines . When the Sioux rose up to enforce the treaty , resisting Custer 's military attack , Colonel Henderson 's predecessors slaughtered their women and children at Wounded Knee . Now , once again , illegal white mineral interests need the Sioux 's land , and , once again , the Army Corps is insisting the Sioux move . Colonel Henderson 's threats are meant to protect DAPL 's promoters , Energy Transfer Partners , an outlaw oil company . There is no question that the 1,200 mile pipeline meets both criteria . The pipeline will create more carbon pollution than 27 coal burning power plants , and cross and disrupt 209 waterways , including Lake Oahe , the Sioux 's only water source . The Corp considers a catastrophic water poisoning pipeline failure , so likely , that following protests by Bismarck residents , Henderson agreed to move the pipeline away from its more direct route across the Bismarck water supply and into Indian country . Henderson 's menacing letter on behalf of yet another law-breaking mineral interest has mobilized 300 American tribes who have assembled to protest the illegal construction , the largest gathering of tribes in a century . Indian Country regards DAPL as an existential threat ; for the tribes the outlaw enterprise , forced upon them at gunpoint , represents the extension of their 500 year genocide into a new millennium . But Chief Archambault has consistently stated the Indians are not fighting only for Indian rights but for American democracy and for humanity 's survival . The scorecard shows that 140 House members voted against chemical safeguards every time , while 149 members consistently voted for chemical safety protections . However , the action fund praised the lawmakers that bucked their party to vote for chemical safety , including Reps. voted for funding chemical reviews and against a farm bill that included pesticide safety loopholes . Florida Reps. A Preview of the People , Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule , two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Updated and reissued every five years , these guidelines are the nation 's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations . supply . These nominees will be well-known in their fields , and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers , academics and practitioners . part of the process is happening in real time . what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors . Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff , and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally . Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries . And here 's the first place you 'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition : rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected , USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first , soliciting public comments in the process . In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts , it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance . And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious . After the committee is announced in early 2019 , it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report . all appearances , the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs . though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable , plant-based diets have been all but stymied , there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle . Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance , including the meat industry , dairy industry , and sugar-sweetened beverage associations , as well as formula companies , which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers . -LRB- This may be happening in real-time , too . Exposure can be caused by contact , ingestion or inhalation . Short-term health effects can range from skin irritation and numbness to fever and headaches . Long-term exposure can lead to cancer , liver failure and sperm damage . is traditionally called blue-green algae is actually a class of microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria . Cyanobacteria can be toxic and can also produce various types of cyanotoxins that have different hazards . With their small , developing bodies , children are especially endangered by algae exposure . was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption . But it probably wo n't be the last , especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year . Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets . If you believe your pet may have been exposed , be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy , seizures , diarrhea or vomiting . And as climate change gets worse , the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks , creating a toxic feedback loop . The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish . Communities that struggle with regular , serious toxic algae outbreaks , like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie , can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation . The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth . The women were all non-smokers , had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies . Macrophages , which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body , protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles , such as bacteria and pollution particles . The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants . That 's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA 's Office of Inspector General -LRB- OIG -RRB- , the agency 's internal watchdog . EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement , and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was required to respond to the April 2017 petition within 90 days , but nearly 17 months have passed with no finding . more than 97,000 giraffes remain in the wild , and the species is gravely imperiled by habitat loss , civil unrest , hunting for meat and the international trade in bone carvings , skins and trophies . U.S. provides a large market for giraffe parts . for their six-foot-long necks , distinctive patterning and long eyelashes , giraffes have captured the human imagination for centuries . But so , under this definition , are multi-thousand-acre corporate entities using automated machinery to grow genetically engineered corn . Size of the farm is not a factor ; neither is the style of agriculture . A family farm may not even have a family that owns or works the land . issue with such a broad definition of family farming is primarily in the discourse . Aid is divvied up by revenue among family farmers , with additional programs going to some specialized farmers , like young or beginning farmers , organic farmers , and sustainable farmers .
