Police make arrests at Standing Rock in push to evict remaining activists Read more The armed occupation of the largely abandoned plain brought an anticlimactic and forlorn end to the sprawling Oceti Sakowin camp , which had been home to thousands of indigenous and environmental activists since last August . The tribe argued that the pipeline route , which passes under the Missouri river , violated its treaty rights , threatened its water source , and damaged sacred sites . I honestly thought the camp would always be there . Some activists set fires to structures , and 10 were arrested on the road near the camp . But on Thursday , with a few dozen holdouts still in camp , law enforcement officers moved in from multiple directions . It was not known how many more remained within the camp . February 23 , 2017 Black Elk spoke to the Guardian from Sacred Stone , the original encampment that is within the reservation and has not been evicted . A live stream from independent journalist Unicorn Riot showed officers in military fatigues and riot gear marching through camp , some with rifles drawn , while a helicopter hovered overhead and heavy machinery began demolishing remaining structures . Then , thousands of activists braved blizzard conditions to sleep in tipis and army tents , communal kitchens churned out three meals a day , and tribal elders gathered around the sacred fire to share songs , ceremony and information . Just four days after taking office , Trump revived the pipeline , ordering the expedited approval of the final permit . The Standing Rock Sioux tribe is challenging that decision in court , but the tribal council supported the closing of the encampments . Amid the anger and sadness over the eviction of the camp , however , water protectors expressed determination to keep fighting for indigenous and environmental rights . For Black Elk , the Standing Rock fight has made indigenous people visible to non-Natives in a powerful and important way .
