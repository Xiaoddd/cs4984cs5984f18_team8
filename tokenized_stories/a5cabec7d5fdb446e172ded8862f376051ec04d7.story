Some of the cases include a woman with a serious eye injury after being shot in the face by a rubber bullet , a tribe elder who lost consciousness and was revived on scene , a young man with internal bleeding who was vomiting blood after a being hit in the abdomen by a rubber bullet , and a man with blunt force trauma and severe head lacerations after being struck by a rubber bullet near his spine , among many others . The most seriously injured was 21-year-old Sophia Wilansky , who protesters claim was directly hit by a concussion grenade thrown by police , an allegation denied by local law enforcement , which severely damaged her hand and arm . Wilansky was airlifted to a hospital in Minneapolis and underwent her first eight-hour surgery the same day . In the best case scenario , her father reports , she will only recover 10 to 20 percent functionality of her arm . The incident took place at about 6 p.m. at Backwater Bridge , just north of the main encampment near Cannon Ball , North Dakota , where about 100 activists attempted to remove two burned trucks which have served as a barricade for police over the last several weeks . The barricade has raised safety concerns for the residents of the camp and the reservation , as it blocks the most direct route from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation to Bismarck , North Dakota , forcing all traffic to take a 20-mile detour . Authorities reportedly responded with tear gas , pepper spray , rubber bullets and a water hose . The decision to use the water hose , despite below freezing temperatures in the area , led to multiple cases of hypothermia and has been highly criticized by the public . The response from the Sheriff 's department was complete denial . However , no propane bottles were reported to have been exploded , and no protesters have been arrested for making or throwing explosives . Activists and protesters have rejected these allegations . Chilling videos and photographs show a highly militarized police force complete with armored vehicles and shields standing off against unarmed activists who are often singing or praying . These actions have become standard operating procedure for suppressing protests in America . Over 400 protesters have been arrested since the start of the demonstration . Reports of detainees being marked with numbers and held in cages have prompted allegations of human rights abuses . The law enforcement response to the protest has prompted powerful backlash from people all throughout the country and the world . Despite the overwhelming support by broad masses of people , the political establishment has remained largely silent . For his part , president-elect Donald Trump enjoys close financial ties to the pipeline operator , Energy Transfer Partners . Energy Transfer Partners will likely find a strong ally in the new presidency , as Trump has declared his support for lifting all restrictions on the exploitation of untapped natural resources .
