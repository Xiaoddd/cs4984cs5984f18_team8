this album is a thank you , and a stern reminder to take this holiday season to revisit and rekindle the flame in you . to take more of an active part in the world and not lie dormant . you work to survive . too long you 've been silenced , placated , ameliorated , flat out lied to , medicated , pilled , reprocessed , taken advantage of , snuffed out , desensitized , overstimulated , and stuffed with preservatives , processed sugars and white pills , monotonous music , mindless alternate realities on cable tv , brainless celebrity idols and carnival games to keep you entertained , like a baby . a paycheck is not your end goal in life . join a library . take a class . teach a class somewhere . read something . take up a hobby . paint outside . learn to plant a tree . cut meat out your diet . read up about clean energy tech . engage yourself . look into local farms . really not up to anyone , or any god , anymore. , to tell us everything will be ok . i am not a baby . it is truly up to us as the most powerful species in the known universe and the sheer power of the instantaneous internet to shepherd this world in a positive direction for all of us . otherwise , we die . in any denominational way you choose .
