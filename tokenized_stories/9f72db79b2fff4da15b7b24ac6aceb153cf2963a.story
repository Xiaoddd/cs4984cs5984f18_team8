As the president of the Bold Alliance , a grassroots campaign to challenge Big Oil , Kleeb had helped lead a rural resistance to defeat the Keystone XL pipeline , blocking it in-state and successfully lobbying President Obama to deny its permit in 2015 . Thirty-three state legislators recently sent a letter to the PSC , asking the commissioners to permit the pipeline . Two of the fiercest holdouts along the proposed pipeline route are Art and Helen Tanderup , Bold members who have come to take the fossil-fuel economy as a personal insult . On a visit to their farm , Art takes me down to the rye field where , in 2014 , Willie Nelson and Neil Young played for 8,000 anti-pipeline demonstrators , and points out a row of cottonwood trees that screen the fields from the road . Oil companies bulldoze Alberta forest to expose a thick , semi-solid tar , which is melted out of the ground with superheated steam , and diluted with byproducts of fracked natural gas . It is because of this aquifer that the prairies are a breadbasket to the world ; in some places , the water table is so high that fence postholes fill with water . The Tanderups told the TransCanada agents : no deal . And the agents told them they had no choice . For obscure reasons of history , most states also give this right to pipeline companies . After a one-time payment , the company had control of the easement forever : It could enter at any time , destroying whatever crops it deemed necessary . Now , with the PSC decision coming up , the fight over the future of the Keystone XL may be approaching its endgame . In an environment where TransCanada is always circling , trying to pick off landowners , the meetings create the kind of solidarity that lets a cash-strapped farmer say no to a million dollars , bills on the barrelhead . In August , as the commission prepared to hold a round of hearings , Lincoln braced for violence . Bold had gotten more than 461,000 comments submitted to the commissioners ; the Omaha World Herald and the Lincoln Journal-Star , among others , published 32 letters from Bold supporters . In a country spun toward division , it seemed a rare point of light . There are signs that the national attitude is shifting as well . Over the past two years , from Ohio to Kentucky , state courts and legislatures have looked skeptically at the idea of pipelines using eminent domain . In Georgia , the Republican-dominated Legislature has twice voted to deny pipeline companies the right to condemn land . If the bulldozers come , they say , TransCanada will meet massive resistance .
