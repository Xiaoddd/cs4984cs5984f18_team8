You have the power to end this pipeline . Now is the time to use it . Thank you to the creators of this video : Elevate films , Lori Woodley , Doug McClean , & Jonathan Klett Posted by Unify on Thursday , November 24 , 2016 Standing Rock member Kendrick Eagle just released a heartfelt message for President Obama , asking him to be a man of his word .
