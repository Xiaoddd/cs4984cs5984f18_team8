Crude oil pipeline mileage rose 9.1 per cent last year alone to reach 66,649 miles , according to data from the Washington , D.C.-based Association of Oil Pipe Lines -LRB- AOPL -RRB- set to be released soon . By last year , the U.S. had built 12,000 miles of pipe since 2010 . On Monday , TransCanada asked the U.S. State Department to suspend review of its controversial Alberta-to-Nebraska pipeline in the latest episode of a six-year drama that has seen as many as five environmental reviews , numerous legal challenges and a rejection in 2012 by President Barack Obama . The 487-mile southern leg of the project , dubbed the Gulf Coast project , between Cushing , Okla. and Texas refineries came on stream in 2014 . While the northern leg of Keystone XL remains under review , the Lower 48s have seen new oil pipes crisscrossing the country . The U.S. midstream infrastructure is responding to a near-doubling of U.S. production over the past six years . The U.S. saw an 11.6 per cent increase in crude oil transport via pipelines in 2014 , according to AOPL data . But as U.S. oil production eases in response to lower crude prices , the rapid build-up could see pipeline capacity exceed production in the Bakken in North Dakota and even the Permian basin straddling Texas and New Mexico , Ogunnaike estimates . Armed with shipping commitments despite low crude prices , key pipeline operators are proceeding with many projects to alleviate the bottlenecks , which could add as much as 8.7 million barrels per day by 2018 , Reuters data shows . TransCanada has reported higher volumes on the Keystone Pipeline System in its third-quarter earnings , while Enbridge Inc. is also looking to expand its presence in the Gulf Coast . Much of the opposition in the U.S. has focused on crude rail terminals , especially in California and Oregon , which has led to delays on some rail projects . In many states , pipeline is viewed more favourably than the sight of crude-bearing rail cars barreling down town centres . But for many the fight against Keystone XL pipeline remains a high priority in a larger battle to combat climate change . All rights reserved .
