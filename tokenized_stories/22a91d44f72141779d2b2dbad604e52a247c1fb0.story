I presented the following testimony at a Senate Democratic roundtable explaining two reasons why Mr. Pruitt is unfit to be EPA Administrator : -LRB- 1 -RRB- he misrepresented his positions and misled Senators during his confirmation hearing ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- he has stated his intention to continue disabling conflicts of interest if he becomes EPA Administrator by switching sides and representing EPA in ongoing lawsuits and related rulemakings in which Mr. Pruitt is suing EPA to overturn EPA clean air and clean water protections . Scott Applewhite Thank you , Senator Carper for the opportunity to testify today . I have worked at NRDC since 2000 . Before that I was a Clean Air Act attorney in the Office of General Counsel for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- . My testimony today will address two topics . Mr. Pruitt seriously misled Senators on the Committee about his own statements and the nature of his legal challenges . His brief argued EPA was wrong to adopt the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards under Clean Air Act section 112 , and even that EPA should have deferred regulation to the states under some wholly different part of the Act . In his October 2012 brief challenging these standards in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit , Mr. Pruitt challenged these protections on multiple substantive grounds . Cir . Apr. 15 , 2014 -RRB- , Pet . Br . 23 . Mr. Pruitt urged federal judges to vacate the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards on substantive and process grounds . See , e.g. , id . at 26 , 38 , 55 , 57 , 66 . He failed before both the D.C. Circuit and Supreme Court , which both left those standards in place . First , it is a serious matter to give misleading testimony to Senators during a confirmation hearing . Senators should not confirm a nominee that deliberately misleads them on such an important matter . And yet Mr. Pruitt is pretending that he is impartial . To the contrary , he testified that he intends to switch sides and represent EPA in this and other lawsuits that he brought against EPA , as well as in subsequent rulemakings concerning these standards . He concealed that position in his testimony last week . There is no escaping the conclusion that he misrepresented his position before this Committee last week . Indeed , as the Appendix to my testimony shows , Mr. Pruitt has made repeated representations to federal judges that the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards he will be expected to enforce in his view run afoul of the Clean Air Act and even Supreme Court rulings . As Oklahoma Attorney General , Mr. Pruitt also has failed to disclose documents -LRB- reported to exceed 3,000 in number -RRB- responsive to open records requests that have been pending for two years concerning communications between regulated energy companies and his office . 61 , 70 -RRB- .
