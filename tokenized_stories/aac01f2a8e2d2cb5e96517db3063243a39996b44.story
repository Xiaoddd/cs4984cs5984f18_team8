In 2012 , President Barack Obama toured the TransCanada Stillwater Pipe Yard in Cushing , Okla. -LRB- AP file -RRB- As one of the first acts of the 114th Congress , Republicans are committed to passing a bill that would permit construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada through the United States . As the showdown plays out , we wanted to answer to three key questions you might have about the Keystone XL proposal . SUPPORT POLITIFACT 'S KICKSTARTER TO LIVE FACT-CHECK THE 2015 STATE OF THE UNION . The 875-mile Keystone XL pipeline would carry heavy crude oil mixture from Western Canada to Steele City , Neb. . Then , it would connect with an existing southern leg that opened in early 2014 , delivering more than 800,000 barrels of oil to refineries on the Gulf Coast . Extracting this type of dirty , thick crude oil is energy-intensive and produces a significant amount of carbon emissions . Critics say that Keystone XL will elevate greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change by encouraging expansion of the tar sand development . Also , if it leaks , the oil is corrosive and difficult to clean up . In other words , the pipeline would not significantly contribute to carbon pollution -- Canadian officials and oil producers vow that the oil will be extracted and reach the American marketplace by other means . In short , the State Department expects that the project would only result in only a few permanent jobs that last past construction . Many proponents , like TransCanada CEO Russ Girling , say the project will create 42,000 jobs . The State Department report does puts the total number of jobs at 42,100 -- but the definition of a job in this sense is a position filled for one year . This total reflects both jobs created directly as a result of construction and manufacturing for the pipeline -- about 3,900 annual positions over two years -- as well as spin-off jobs supported by construction workers who purchase materials for the project or spend their wages in the economy . Much of the construction work would come in four - or or eight-month stretches . We rated that statement False . Based on the State Department report , we also rated that claim False . The construction phase , though , is expected to take only one to two years . After construction , the pipeline would employ a lesser number , primarily for maintenance . The total number of long-term jobs : about 50 . Help fund PolitiFact 's Kickstarter to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union and GOP response .
