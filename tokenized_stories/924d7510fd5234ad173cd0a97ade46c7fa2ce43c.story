The hour-long drive passes through miles of rolling prairie land , vast and empty except for the occasional herds of grazing cows and small clusters of houses . As you approach the campground , the road veers to the left and dips down past the town of Cannon Ball and then you see it : a teeming tent city nestled in the bowl of the surrounding hills . Quick-pitch tents are huddled next to giant teepees that billow out wafts of smoke from stoves within . Caravans and RVs and trucks and minivans are parked alongside each other . Horses graze in makeshift pens . And everywhere there is movement : people carrying supplies , chopping wood , raising tents , making signs , preparing food , chanting in drum circles , praying . In April , members of the tribe set up a resistance camp that eventually drew hundreds of other tribes from across North America , comprising the biggest Native American alliance in 150 years . They had come together for one purpose : to protect their land and water . Thousands of people have made this their home for months . There are schools , field kitchens , medic tents , art centers , traditional ceremonies , media headquarters and direct action training . Donations of supplies from across the country arrive on a regular basis . The sheer scale of it is striking . The police presence is also striking . As the camp grew over the summer , the governor of North Dakota declared a state of emergency . Police departments from 24 counties and 16 cities in 10 different states poured in . The National Guard followed . They deployed military-grade equipment , set up roadblocks and checkpoints on public roads and , the tribe says , clearly targeted native people and harassed them . The camps were put under continuous surveillance with low-flying planes and helicopters constantly overhead . The pipeline lies less than 800 meters to the north of the camp , behind a heavily armed barricade . What began as several tents housing two dozen people had grown into a sprawling encampment abuzz with members of 200 indigenous nations as well as thousands of non-native allies , including environmentalists , activists , students and celebrities . Standing Rock had become a symbol of resistance . And as the numbers of water protectors grew , so did the police presence confronting them . Police in full riot gear attacked with rubber bullets , beanbag rounds , tear gas , pepper spray , concussion grenades and water cannons in freezing temperatures . Hundreds were injured and nearly 600 arrested , but , despite the brutal crackdown , the protectors did not back down and the camps continued to swell in size . As the confrontation escalated , everything hinged on whether the US Army Corps of Engineers would grant Dakota Access the final permit they needed to drill under the river to complete the pipeline . This was the situation when I arrived in early November . It was the first time I had left Egypt for a significant stretch since 2011 . I had mixed emotions . At times , it felt like a release , a temporary escape from the dark fog enveloping everything . Arrest , interrogation , asset freeze , travel ban , forced disappearance , prison . Our vocabulary has become laden with this dirty lexicon , our questions have no answers . Fleeing this gloom for a while felt like a guilty pleasure , a way to escape the pangs of defeat . Then in Standing Rock I saw something of Tahrir . It was unmistakably there : the clear sense of purpose ; the transformative feeling of community ; the fearlessness in the face of police brutality ; the newfound courage ; the tensions that arise from living in a shared space ; the indescribable joy in being a part of something , a movement , that seems like it can not be broken and will never end ; the sheer sense of possibility ; the feeling that one would never be the same again . It was inspiring . Something real and effective had been created through months of grassroots organizing , movement building and leadership from indigenous people . They had used their bodies as a form of resistance . They had a physical presence that could not be removed . They had made a stand in defense of the environment and Native American sovereignty against corporate and government power that reverberated across the country . And yet I was apprehensive . That they would lose . The reasons were well-founded . Donald Trump , a lewd , authoritarian conman , had just been elected president . Resisting a White House that holds the environment in utter disdain will be daunting . In Egypt , the government has a similar track record of exploiting natural resources , protecting private companies and trampling over indigenous rights . And then there was the weather . North Dakota winters are notoriously brutal with lows of 20 degrees below zero . Blizzards arrive that eviscerate color and lash at the skin with bitterly cold , snow-laden winds . By December , camp life at Standing Rock had become harsh . Thick snowdrifts sent cars skidding off the roads . People huddled inside their tents to try and stay warm . Daily chores became a grueling ordeal . The outdoor bustle of the tent city had quieted . Meanwhile , the state governor had ordered a mandatory evacuation by December 5 . A showdown was looming . I left Standing Rock for a brief period and returned on December 4 in anticipation of the evacuation deadline . When my plane touched down in Bismarck , I heard the surprise announcement : the army said they would be denying the easement necessary for Dakota Access to cross under the river and that they would do a full environmental review and look for ways to reroute the pipeline . The atmosphere was joyous at the camp . Fireworks lit the sky amid whoops of celebration . There was a sense of vindication . They had won , at least for now . Perhaps my experience in Egypt has left me indelibly scarred , cynical , disillusioned . Maybe this was always the pattern of the world : These moments of beauty that can not last . Maybe victory is in those moments of creation that can not be forgotten and , in there , progress is painstakingly forged . Trudging through the snow , talking to tribal elders and young activists , I was told that the battle was not over , that native people were determined to stay at the camp and continue the fight . We left Tahrir too early . More questions that have no answer . In 2011 , there was a giddying sense of possibility in Tahrir . That was what I glimpsed at Standing Rock . There is something uniquely liberating about carving out these shared spaces of dissent . A weight is shed . Mass mobilization and the simple assertion of physical presence is not only a form of resistance but of transformation . Even if the gains are reversed , these types of protests can crack open a window into a different world and profoundly alter those who take part . In Egypt , we ultimately lost , but we were not wrong to go out . Back then , there was no other way to be .
