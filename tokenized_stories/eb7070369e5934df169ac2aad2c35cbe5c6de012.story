BAJI Executive Director Opal Tometi is an admirer of convicted cop killer and terrorist Assata Shakur . It is our duty to win . We must love and support one another . We have nothing to lose but our chains . Shakur is a hero to communist revolutionaries for her involvement in the 1960s and 1970s with a violent , criminal Black Panther Party offshoot called the Black Liberation Army . After her conviction , Shakur escaped prison when other Black Liberation Army members visiting her pulled a gun and took guards hostage . Shakur lived on the lam for several years , as her associates refused to cooperate with authorities , until fleeing to Cuba in 1984 . Her biography does not mention that Ms. Oso is a convicted felon who took money from another community group she worked with . She was fired after she failed to show up for work for three days , and the embezzlement was apparently discovered soon afterward . She pleaded guilty to one count of felony theft .
