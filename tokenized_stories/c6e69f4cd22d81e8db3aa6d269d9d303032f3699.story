Using nonviolent means , their goal is to stop the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- that would connect production fields in North Dakota to refineries in Illinois . Their primary fear is that an oil leak would threaten water quality for many members of the tribal community . But shortly after , federal officials said they would temporarily stop construction pending further review . But despite the national attention to this case , one point has gone largely ignored in my view : Stopping DAPL is a matter of climate justice and decolonization for indigenous peoples . It may not always be apparent to people outside these communities , but standing up for water quality and heritage are intrinsically tied to these larger issues . Climate scientists , through organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and U.S. Climate Assessment , are finding more evidence of climate change from human activities , such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation . These destabilize the climate system , producing environmental conditions that disrupt human societies , through impacts such as rising sea levels , more severe droughts and warming freshwater . The same climate science organizations also show that indigenous peoples are among the populations who will suffer more , on average , than other communities from changing environmental conditions . Some are suffering right now . One of the encampments that has formed along the banks of the Cannon Ball River in North Dakota over the past few months to protest construction of the North Dakota Access Pipeline which would transport oil under the Missouri River above the water access point for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe . This is happening in other parts of the world too . DAPL , a 1,172-mile connector of the Bakken and Three Forks fossil fuel basins to major oil refining markets , maintains the carbon energy foundation Wildcat writes of . The protectors , meanwhile , are bringing public attention to the urgency of reducing a fossil fuel dependence . Because indigenous peoples suffer the effects of climate change disproportionately , continuing fossil fuel dependence will inflict more harms in years to come . But there is more to this story , as climate change and U.S. colonialism against indigenous peoples are closely related . It also sheds important light on indigenous understanding of what climate justice really means and what solutions are required .
