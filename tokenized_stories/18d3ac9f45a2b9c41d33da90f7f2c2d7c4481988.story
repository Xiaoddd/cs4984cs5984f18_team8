Protesters have vowed to stay put . Opponents of the 1,170-mile Dakota Access Pipeline have gathered for months at the Oceti Sakowin camp , about 40 miles south of Bismarck . The Standing Rock Sioux and other Native American tribes fear the pipeline could pollute the Missouri River and harm sacred cultural lands and tribal burial grounds . The order was effective immediately and was to remain in place indefinitely . Federal officials said anyone found on the land after Dec. 5 could be charged with trespassing . Mr. Wood , who served in the Marine Corps , organized the event with Wesley Clark Jr. , a screenwriter , activist and son of Wesley K. Clark , the retired Army general and onetime supreme allied commander in Europe for NATO . Mr. Wood said he had initially hoped to attract about 500 veterans ; he had to stop sign-ups when they reached 2,000 . One veteran , Loreal Black Shawl , said the mission to support the protesters was intensely personal . Ms. Black Shawl , 39 , of Rio Rancho , N.M. , is a descendant of two Native American tribes , the Oglala Lakota and Northern Arapaho . She served in the Army for nearly eight years , finishing her career as a sergeant . Ms. Black Shawl said , referring to the protesters . The authorities have used rubber bullets , pepper spray and water cannons against demonstrators , hundreds of whom have been injured , according to protest organizers . The clashes have been highly contentious , with the police and demonstrators leveling accusations of violence at each other . Some protesters filed a class-action lawsuit on Monday against the Morton County police and others , alleging excessive use of force and seeking a court injunction to prevent the authorities from using rubber bullets , explosive grenades and water cannons , according to The Atlantic . One woman was injured and in danger of losing her arm after an explosion at the protest site this month . By spotlighting issues such as the use of force by the police , national energy policies and the treatment of Native Americans , the protests have garnered national headlines and widespread attention on social media . Ms. Black Shawl acknowledged that the operation could prove problematic because the veterans and the police both have military or tactical training . Organizers encouraged attendees to wear their old uniforms . Mr. Wood said they were discouraging active-duty service members from attending . There are no ranks , and participants will refer to one another by their given names . Mr. Wood said the early stages of the event will be logistical : setting up tents and organizing food supplies . The first arrivals are expected on Wednesday . The premise is for the veterans to be fully self-sufficient , he said . Some officials expressed the hope that the demonstrators would move on . The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , Dave Archambault II , said in an email that he had no concerns that tensions could escalate . Repeatedly . He Should Be Impeached .
