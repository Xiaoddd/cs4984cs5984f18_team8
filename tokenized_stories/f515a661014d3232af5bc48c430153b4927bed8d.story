Emboldened by the Trump administration , at least 31 states have considered 62 pieces of anti-protest legislation since November 2016 , with at least seven enacted and 31 still pending . The full scope of police support for these bills is not yet known . As in the case of Kroll , police support often takes place in private meetings , far from the public eye . That police are playing any role in this wave of anti-protest legislation is raising alarm among organizers and civil liberties advocates . Traci Yoder , director of research and education for the National Lawyers Guild , a progressive bar association , is the author of a recent report on the forces behind the wave of anti-protest bills , which include conservative groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council , corporations like as Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline -RRB- and state Departments of Homeland Security . Beyond Minnesota Following uprisings in Ferguson , Standing Rock , Baltimore and elsewhere , the policing of protests became a hot topic at law enforcement conferences and within law enforcement publications . But law enforcement like Lt. Bob Kroll are not merely discussing how to apply the law to protests , but actively lobbying for new laws curbing public action . Four are still pending , and the rest died or were voted down . In other states , top sponsors of protest suppression legislation had close ties to law enforcement . In Tennessee , for example , the main sponsor of a bill that was signed into law in 2017 was a member of Blue Lives Matter Tennessee . These state-level efforts appear to be compounding the repressive national political climate , where the Trump administration has aggressively prosecuted more than 200 Inauguration Day protesters , and the president has openly endorsed police brutality . And the cozy relationship between Minnesota state lawmakers extends far beyond anti-protest legislation .

Minnesota legislators introduced a 2017 bill to penalize highway blockage . Zerwas first introduced the bill in January 2017 , then tried to work the language into an omnibus spending bill , but was thwarted by Gov. Mark Dayton . In March 2018 , Zerwas revived the original bill . Protestors shut down highway I-94 on July 9 , 2016 in St. Paul , Minn. , in response to the police killing of Philando Castile the previous month . Minnesota legislators introduced a 2017 bill to penalize highway blockage . -LRB- TVW screen shot -RRB- Right : Minneapolis police union president Bob Kroll , who told In These Times he lobbied for a bill to penalize protests that block highways . Williams points out that in 2012 , for example , the Minneapolis Police Federation successfully pressed lawmakers to pass a law that reduces the power of a statewide panel tasked with investigating police misconduct . When he spoke with In These Times for this story , Kroll again denigrated protests against police killings of Black Minnesotans , including 24-year-old Jamar Clark and 32-year-old Philando Castile . A community member holds up a fist outside the Minneapolis Police Federation union office , following the raid eviction of demonstrators camped out in front of the Minneapolis Police Department 's 4th Precinct location , blocks from where Jamar Clark was killed by police weeks prior . In a 2016 interview , Kroll admitted he is a member of City Heat , a motorcycle club that has been denounced by the Anti-Defamation League -LRB- ADL -RRB- for its tolerance for white supremacy -LRB- the ADL often collaborates with police departments -RRB- . When asked about this affiliation , he abruptly ended his interview with In These Times . Sarah Lazare Sarah Lazare is web editor at In These Times .
