VIDEO Dennis Banks : Tomorrow is evacuation day at the camp and tonight i want to us look at if we actually might potentially repeat history during this evacuation teared that starts tomorrow . END VIDEO Chris Berg : The person you just heard that is Dennis Banks , and if you are not familiar with Mr. Banks the cofounder of AIM , the American Indian Movement which according to the History Channel is a militant political and civil rights organization for Native Americans . It was started back in 1968 . Then in 1971 Mr. Banks actually occupied Alcatraz Island saying had he a right to it under a treaty provision . Then in 1973 , ended up occupying Wounded Knee and the pine ridge reservation . They took over the Wounded Knee in protest against the tribal chairman 's administration . Also as well against the federal government 's persistent failures to honor its treaties with the Native American nations . As many people are saying this is their land because of the treaty of 1851 . Now the occupation of Wounded Knee started on February 27 , 1973 . So we are talking about almost 44 years to the day from tomorrow 's evacuation order that obviously is near the Standing Rock reservation . The occupation of Wounded Knee it lasted 71 days back in 1973 . The feds showed up , two Native Americans were shot and killed , several others were also wounded . We also had two FBI agents that showed up that were shot and wounded as well . As I have said many times on the show before what , happened at Standing Rock , this is the largest gathering of tribal nations since the battle of Little Big Horn . Put that in context . That battle took place in 1876 . Now , right before that battle there was some very famous Native words that were spoken before the Battle of Little Big Horn by Crazy Horse and what he said was and this is kind of an old saying of Native Americans , today is a good day to die . Now they used this phrase in the context of a warrior saying they want to die an honorable and brave death . This is where it started . And this is where it is going to end . Today is a good day to die . Clearly I do n't know . All I do know is that tomorrow and the next few weeks could be very critical time here in our state and for our nation . We continue American friends to go out there and ensure that people are peacefully removing themselves from this camp to ensure everybody 's safety . I mean the protesters , law enforcement , everybody that is involved because this could be a very very touchy situation tomorrow and here is why . You just saw there from Mr. Banks where he is at . I spoke with law enforcement earlier today . They posted on our Facebook page recently but the state of North Dakota is paying for these protesters to leave the campsite . They are giving them a free bus ride , offering free food vouchers , new set of dry clothes , a health assessment and also a one way bus ticket back home . I want to extend every olive branch possible to ensure that people get home peacefully and safely so if we have to spend a little bit of extra money to make sure that nobody gets shot at tomorrow , nobody gets killed over in the next several weeks , I think we can say it is probably a good investment what . I 'm asking for you tonight is please be in prayer about this situation tomorrow . Hopefully everything goes smoothly but in case it does n't , be in prayer that people get out of there safely and peacefully .
