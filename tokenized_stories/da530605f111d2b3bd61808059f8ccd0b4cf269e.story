About Trouble sub.Media is excited to announce the launch of Trouble , a brand-new monthly show offering an in-depth anarchist analysis of current struggles , tactics and movement dynamics . Trouble will broadcast first-hand accounts and perspectives from organizers on the ground , with the aim of cutting through the fog of misinformation that often clouds our understanding of the world , and provoking people into taking bold , collective action . Community events at our co-op are made possible by generous contributions from our supporters .
