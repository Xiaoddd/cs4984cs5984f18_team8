In an on-line post Gallatin County Sheriff Brian Gootkin announced his decision to not send deputies to North Dakota . I have been in protest situations in my career and fully understand that in many cases law enforcement is placed in the middle of two emotional opposing interests and we have to attempt to balance our role as peace officer and law enforcement . Many of you emailed and called the Office to voice your concerns . As your Sheriff I was very humbled by the honest conversations we had . One of the biggest differences of an elected Sheriff from other law enforcement leaders is that I am directly accountable to the people I serve -LRB- YOU -RRB- and although I am personally torn knowing that people -LRB- Including Montanans -RRB- are hurting over there , we will not be responding . Finally I am incredibly grateful that we live in a place where we can have differences and talk about them respectfully as adults without conflict . Thank you . He and his unit stood by Morton County officers for one week before pulling out and refusing to return . Thank you for listening to the true will of the people and acting in accordance with the LAW which is intended to protect the people .

I applaud with respect , those of the entire law enforcement who have stood their ground in refusing to get involved in this corporate instigated situation , and have chosen to believe in the rights of the people to their peaceful protests , over corporate-driven bullying tactics applied by those who can not see past their actions of violence on unarmed people defending their rights , and the rights of all humanity . To one and all standing with Standing Rock , Wakan Tanka kici un . Trevor Mills New Zealand . Sourceress says : 04:05 The world watches what you do to our water . Windmuser says : 12:05 The world is watching -- so is the Universe . Judy Ingram says : 12:59 I commend those public officials who have decided not to participate with law enforcement at Standing Rock . I also commend the Vets who will arrive at Standing Rock to stand in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux on December 4 . As a descendant of the Miami and Powhatan Nation , I find it very unsettling and disturbing what is happening at Standing Rock . Ken from CA says : 15:35 A few words to the police and sheriff who are still there .
