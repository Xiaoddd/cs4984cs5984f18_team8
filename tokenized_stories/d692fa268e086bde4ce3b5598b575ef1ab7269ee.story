The gathering of peoples from all over North America in defense of water and land , in the emblematic battle for the rights of tribal communities at Standing Rock , represents a significant shift toward a more prescient activism driven to defend our ability , and that of future generations , to live in an unpolluted America . Standing Rock is in North Dakota , but the spirit of Standing Rock is alive across the nation . We maintain that the Army Corps deliberately withheld critical information during a 2016 DAPL Environmental Assessment , which is only a cursory inspection of the issues at stake , as opposed to a comprehensive Environmental Impact Study . The risk analysis would demonstrate the likelihood of contamination . The Environmental Justice Considerations Memo could be so compelling that this single factor alone would disqualify the route . The route comparison would certainly reveal that the route through Standing Rock was less expensive than one 10 miles north . The more stringent Environmental Impact Study is now underway . If its results are made known , it will reveal defects in the initial easement process . It must not be swept aside by the new administration , which is pursuing the DAPL . Resistance has begun . The administration must not stop the Environmental Impact Statement , nor discount its findings . Sign up for our daily email .
