Art Berman Contributor i Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own . The decline in Bakken oil production that started in January 2015 is probably not reversible . New well performance has deteriorated , gas-oil ratios have increased and water cuts are rising . Much of the reservoir energy from gas expansion is depleted and decline rates should accelerate . More drilling may increase daily output for awhile but wo n't resolve the underlying problem of poorer well performance and declining per-well reserves . This was despite an increase in the number of producing wells that reached an all-time high of 13,520 in November . That number fell by 183 wells in December . Figure 1 .

Well Performance Is Declining Well performance was evaluated for eight operators using standard rate vs. time decline-curve analysis methods . Table 1 . Operators , Cumulative Oil Production , Total Producing Wells and 2012-2015 Wells Used for Decline-Curve Analysis -LRB- DCA -RRB- in this study . Source : Drilling Info and Labyrinth Consulting Services , Inc. . Estimated ultimate recovery -LRB- EUR -RRB- decreased over time for most operators and 2015 EUR was lower for all operators than in any previous year -LRB- Figure 2 -RRB- . This suggests that well performance has deteriorated despite improvements in technology and efficiency . Figure 2 .

Figure 3 shows Bakken EUR and the commercial core area in green . The map on the left shows all wells with 12-months of production history and the map on the right , all wells with first production in 2015 and 2016 . Most 2015-2016 drilling was focused around the commercial core area . The fact that EURs from these core-centered locations were lower than earlier , less favorably located wells indicates that the commercial core is showing signs of depletion and well interference .

Well-level analysis indicates a fairly systematic steepening of decline rates over time . Figure 4 shows Continental Resources wells with first production in 2012 and 2015 . Steeper decline rates result in lower EURs . Figure 4 . Well-level analysis shows steeper decline rates for more recent wells than for older wells .

Initially , oil is produced by liquid expansion across the pressure drop from the reservoir to the well bore . Later , gas dissolved in the oil expands and this is the mechanism that lifts oil to the surface . Rapidly increasing GOR in the Bakken probably indicates partial reservoir depletion and subsequently decreasing GOR suggests more advanced depletion accompanied by declining reservoir pressure , declining oil production and increasing water cut -LRB- Figure 6 -RRB- . Figure 6 . Increasing gas-oil ratio indicates partial reservoir depletion -- Decreasing gas-oil ratio indicates advanced depletion . Source : Schlumberger and Labyrinth Consulting Services , Inc. . The sequence of events summarized in Figure 6 is demonstrated in Bakken field production shown below in Figure 7 . Gas increased before oil production peaked in December 2014 and continued increasing through March 2016 , and then declined . Figure 7 . Bakken gas production increased as oil production peaked and then it declined . Source : Drilling Info and Labyrinth Consulting Services , Inc. . Water cut -- water as a percent of total liquid produced -- has increased for most operators over time -LRB- Figure 8 -RRB- and this provides additional support for progressive Bakken depletion . Figure 8 . Bakken water cut has generally increased over time . Source : Drilling Info and Labyrinth Consulting Services , Inc. . Company Performance , Break-Even Prices and Future Drilling Locations Well performance for the 8 key operators shown above in Table 1 above provides a framework for company performance and break-even prices for the Bakken play . Reserves were estimated for more than 4,400 wells with first production in 2012 through 2015 using standard rate vs. time methods . Decline-curve analysis -LRB- DCA -RRB- was used to evaluate wells with at least 12 months of production history for key operators . Production group DCA was done separately by operator and year of first production for oil , gas and water . Results are summarized in the following tables . Table 2 . Summary tables of key operator EUR and break-even prices and economic assumptions . Source : Drilling Info and Labyrinth Consulting Services , Inc. . There are 5,500 producing wells within the 1.2 million acre commercial area shown in Figure 9 . That equates to a current well density of 215 acres per well . Source : Drilling Info and Labyrinth Consulting Services , Inc. . Tight oil operators describe infill spacing of 40 to 120 acres per well favoring the lower end of that range . Current well density in the Bakken core of 215 acres per well suggests substantial infill locations remain yet declining EURs , increasing water cut and falling GOR do not support further infill drilling . The Bakken is unique because of the extraordinary lengths of lateral wellbores compared with other tight oil plays . Laterals are commonly more than 10,000 feet in length and often approach 12,000 feet . Figure 10 shows lateral lengths in the Bakken . It is clear that within the commercial core area , most laterals exceed 8,000 feet . Available evidence suggests that current well density is sufficient to fully drain reservoir volumes . That implies that further drilling will not result in producing new oil volumes but will interfere with and cannibalize production from existing wells . Figure 10 . Bakken lateral length map . Source : Drilling Info and Labyrinth Consulting Services , Inc. . The Downside of Technology The Bakken play represents the fullest application of modern horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies . The Middle Bakken and Three Forks reservoirs are tight , naturally fractured sandstones that respond exceptionally well to long laterals and multi-stage fracture stimulation . Field rules allowed long laterals well before these were feasible in other plays . The downside of efficiency and technology is that depletion has accelerated . Resulting higher initial rates masked underlying field decline that is becoming apparent only in wells with first production in 2015 . The evidence for depletion is compelling but pressure data is not publicly available and is needed to complete the case . The most appealing aspect of resource plays is their apparent lack of risk . Source rocks are the drilling target so finding oil and gas is given . Because the plays are continuous accumulations , there is no need to map and define a trap . Since the reservoirs are tight , seals are not an issue either . But commercial risk should be more of a concern for investors than it seems to be so far . The downside is that there is no way to stay away from water and it is produced from day one in large volumes . The Bakken has produced 1.5 billion barrels of water along with its 2.2 billion barrels of oil over the decades . Investors should be worried . Vast volumes of oil were squandered at low prices for the sake of cash flow to support unmanageable debt loads and to satisfy investors about production growth . The clear message is that investors do not understand the uncertainties of tight oil and shale gas plays . And all major Bakken producers continue to lose money at current wellhead prices . If observations presented here hold up , there may be nowhere for the Bakken to go but down . Higher oil prices may not help much because the best days for the play are behind us . Future profits were sacrificed for short-term objectives that lost the companies and their shareholders money . The early demise of the Bakken should serve as a warning about the future of other tight oil plays . Sincere thanks to Lynn Pittinger for his many useful comments during research for this post .
