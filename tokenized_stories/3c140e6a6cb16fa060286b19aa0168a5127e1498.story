This national movement has seen multiple high-profile strikes before , but this may prove to be the most widespread disruption yet , with rallies being planned in hundreds of American cities and 20 major American airports . In addition to a higher minimum wage , the FightFor15 movement is also demanding the right to unionize . This is a difficult goal , as unions have been oft-maligned in numerous states and have been painted as the root cause behind budgetary problems . Because high-wage union jobs cause non-union employers to increase their wages in order to prevent non-union employees from joining or forming a union , the presence of unions raises the household income of all workers . Everyone that joins their marches or demonstrations lends strength to their movement . This Tuesday , November 29th is the time to show our solidarity . Give The Digital Left a round of applause .
