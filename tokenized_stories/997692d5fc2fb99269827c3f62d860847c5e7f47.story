All rights reserved . FIONA MACDONALD 7 JAN 2017 Scientists have confirmed that an iceberg the size of Delaware is on the verge of splintering off from Antarctica and floating into the ocean . A huge rift has been forming across Antarctica 's Larsen C ice shelf for months , and in December it sped up at an unprecedented rate . The latest observations show there 's now just 20 km -LRB- 12.5 miles -RRB- of ice keeping the 5,000 square kilometre -LRB- 1,930 square mile -RRB- iceberg from floating away . When it splits off as an iceberg , it is expected to be one of the 10 largest ever recorded on the planet . Right now , scientists think that mass of ice might be the only thing stopping the entire Larsen C ice shelf from collapsing . The ice shelf is round 350 metres -LRB- 1,150 feet -RRB- thick , and it floats on the ocean at the edge of West Antarctica , acting as a kind of ` stopper ' that holds back the flow of glaciers into the ocean . But with a huge part of that ice shelf about to cleave away , researchers are now very concerned about the future stability of the entire region . The team have good reason to be concerned - two ice shelves have already collapse , the Larsen A ice shelf in 1995 , and Larsen B in 2002 . After their disintegration , there was a dramatic acceleration of the glaciers behind them , resulting in huge volumes of ice entering the ocean and associated sea-level rise . It 's estimated that if all the ice currently held back by Larsen C entered the sea , ocean levels around the planet would rise by around 10 cm . Because of this , researchers have been warily monitoring the growing rift in Larsen C for years . But during December , it sped up rapidly , growing a further 18 km -LRB- 11 miles -RRB- in just a couple of weeks . Currently the team ca n't say for sure whether the unprecedented rate of ice shelf calving is a result of climate change , but there 's evidence to suggest that rising temperatures have caused the ice shelf to thin . All they can do for now is continue to monitor the situation , get as much data as they can , and hope for the best . Because if this iceberg breaks off , it 's bad news from the rest of Antarctica . 5 days ago Politics & Society Semi-Automatic Rifles Really Are More Deadly , New Study Clearly Shows Numbers do n't lie . 6 days ago Politics & Society To Save Ourselves It 's Time to Rethink Our Economic System , Warn Scientists The market is killing the planet . 3 hours ago PHYSICS Single Hydrogen Atoms Could Form Eerie ` Ghost Bonds ' With Nothing , New Study Shows It should n't be possible . 14 hours ago SPACE SpaceX Has Announced The First Tourist to Go to The Moon - And Take Other People With Him Such a wild project . 14 hours ago NATURE Potentially Deadly Threats Are Now Lurking in Post-Hurricane Flood Waters Hurricane Florence is n't over yet .
