Source : Truthout The defense of water knows no borders , according to the Mayan Ancestral Authorities , the communal authorities and elders of Mayan towns across Guatemala . This reality has led the Mayan leaders to work in solidarity with the Lakota Sioux as they challenge the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline . The Sioux communities began their protest following the failure of the company to consult the tribe over the use of their tribal lands -- despite multiple requests by tribal leaders -- and a demand that the company preform an honest environmental impact report for the project . On Feb. 23 , the National Guard and police raided the Oceti Sakowin camp , evicting the protesters . But despite the eviction , the example of Standing Rock continues to mobilize Indigenous activists across the world in defense of water . Thousands of supporters had traveled to the encampment to support the Sioux and their defense of water . The international support for the resistance will only strengthen as the United States Army has given the project the green light , despite the company 's failure to consult the Indigenous populations impacted by the project 's development . Standing Rock and the struggle against Dakota Access pipeline have become the international example and rallying point for the defense of Indigenous territory . This resistance has brought Indigenous leaders together in solidarity from across the globe . Among those that traveled to Standing Rock to stand in solidarity with the Sioux were five representatives from the National Council of Ancestral Authorities of Guatemala . It was raining on October 12 , 2016 , when the representatives of Mayan political and spiritual leaders arrived at Standing Rock to stand in solidarity with the Sioux . The leaders arrived to share experiences and have an interchange between the elders , which also included the sharing of different ceremonial performances and practices . The Maya of Guatemala have a long history of struggle , which they shared with their brethren at Standing Rock . Since the end of Guatemala 's 36-year-long internal armed conflict in 1996 , the Maya communities of the highlands have resisted the increased threat of the dispossession of Indigenous communal lands by transnational capital for the expansion of mining interests , the generation of hydro energy , and the expansion of export agriculture . It is a spring of life . Others who have traveled to Standing Rock could feel this connection as well . Pamela Bond , the Fish and Wildlife coordinator for the Snohomish tribe , was present the nights of the visit by the Maya Ancestral Authorities of Guatemala , and pointed to the way in which the visitors brought the force of their own struggle to the NoDAPL camps . Interconnected Struggles The ongoing struggle against the Dakota Access pipeline is not only a struggle of Indigenous communities in the United States . Rather it reflects the struggle against the widespread neo-colonization of Indigenous lands across the hemisphere . Thousands of communities are entrenched in struggles to defend the remaining Indigenous territories across the hemisphere and the world . These struggles challenge transnational mining companies , energy generation projects , corporate monoculture , or the destruction of forests . Communities are mobilized by a concern for the impact of these development projects on their water and land . The Maya people have a long history of resistance to the colonization of their territories . As a result , during the country 's 36-year-long internal armed conflict , the Guatemalan military considered the country 's Maya populations to be part of the insurgency , which they used to justify the genocide against the Maya in the 1980s . RELATED : Tribal Dakota Pipeline Resistance the Start of Something Bigger Indigenous Maya communities have further organized in the two decades since the end of the internal armed conflict to challenge the expansion of megaprojects within their territory , and to protect their water . In April 2016 thousands marched 263 miles to demand that the Guatemalan government respect the right of the communities to water access . These struggles come at great costs to activists , who regularly face campaigns of disinformation , criminalization and even assassination . This danger is highlighted in a recent report by Amnesty International , which states that Guatemala and Honduras are two of the most dangerous places for environmental activists . Members of the other nations too see that these struggles are interconnected . The construction of the DAPL and the Keystone Pipeline have become central parts of the energy policy of the Trump administration . Meanwhile , parallel threats are playing out in Guatemala , where US policy has threatened Indigenous lands with the expansion of hydro and geothermal energy generation projects . Since the end of the internal armed conflict , the Guatemalan government has greatly expanded the construction of hydroelectric projects . The expansion of energy generation is a key part of the current Alliance for Prosperity . In fact , as the encampment at Standing Rock faces new threats and violence with the new Trump administration , the Guatemalan government has continued to criminalize the leaders of the movements in defense of territory and water . During their visit , the Mayan elders sought to share their experiences of long-term resistance with the Sioux , offering an example for what sustained organizing against the pipeline could look like . He deployed the military to the east and western parts of Guatemala . Cotiy connected this resistance to the current moment in the US , in which the Indigenous movement is facing a uniquely repressive federal government . This violence was embodied in the February 23 eviction . Jeff Abbott is an independent journalist currently based out of Guatemala . He is a regular contributor to Truthout .
