The decision is a setback for the Coachella Valley Water District and the Desert Water Agency , which had argued the tribe holds the same right to use groundwater under state law as all other landowners in California . The appeals court is the highest federal court to directly address the question of whether water rights reserved by the federal government apply to groundwater as well as surface water . The water agencies have defended their efforts to manage the supply of groundwater and have insisted that water from the Colorado River meets or exceeds all drinking water standards . Groundwater levels have declined over the years in much of the Coachella Valley as water has been pumped from the aquifer for expanding subdivisions , golf courses , resorts and farms . The water agencies have used imported water from the Colorado River to partially offset those declines , and the water table has risen around groundwater recharge ponds in Palm Springs and La Quinta . The two water agencies say they have viable long-term plans to combat groundwater overdraft . The Agua Caliente tribe , which has more than 400 members , owns the Spa Resort Casino in Palm Springs and the Agua Caliente Casino Resort Spa in Rancho Mirage , and has plans for new housing subdivisions on tribal land . The reservation spreads across more than 31,000 acres in a checkerboard pattern that includes parts of Palm Springs , Cathedral City , Rancho Mirage , and the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto mountains . The U.S. Department of Justice has signed on as a party to the lawsuit in support of the tribe . Grubbe argues the water districts have significantly degraded the quality of the groundwater by allowing Colorado River water , which has higher levels of dissolved salts and minerals , to seep down to the aquifer . He has suggested they should instead treat the imported water before allowing it to flow into the underground drinking water supply .
