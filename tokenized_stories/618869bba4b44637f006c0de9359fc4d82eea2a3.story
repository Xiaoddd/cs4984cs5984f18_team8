The crisis emerged when high temperatures led to melting snow on frozen ground , which could potentially submerge the camp because it rests on a floodplain . As a result , the governor called for federal assistance in cleaning up the campsite in the form of the Army Corps . A particular concern is of garbage and human waste flooding into the Cannonball River . The protesters are attempting to block the building of an oil pipeline that would transport 450,000 barrels of crude oil under Lake Oahe , an important water source for the nearby Standing Rock Sioux tribe .
