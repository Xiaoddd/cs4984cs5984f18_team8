Francis met with representatives of indigenous peoples attending a U.N. agricultural meeting and said the key issue facing them is how to reconcile the right to economic development with protecting their cultures and territories . The Cheyenne River and the Standing Rock Sioux tribes have sued to stop construction on the final stretch of the Dakota Access pipeline , which would bring oil from North Dakota 's rich Bakken fields across four states to a shipping point in Illinois . The tribes say the pipeline threatens their drinking water , cultural sites and ability to practice their religion , which depends on pure water . The last piece of the pipeline is to pass under a reservoir on the Missouri River , which marks the eastern border of both tribes ' reservations . The company building the pipeline , Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners , has insisted the water supply will be safe . JUDGE TO HEAR ARGUMENTS ON DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE WORK Francis did n't cite the Dakota pipeline dispute by name and the Vatican press office said he was not making a direct reference to it . But history 's first Latin American pope has been a consistent backer of indigenous rights and has frequently spoken out about the plight of Indians in resisting economic development that threatens their lands . In the waning days of the Obama administration , amid protests over construction that led to some 700 arrests , federal agencies that have authority over the reservoir said they would not give permission for pipe to be laid until an environmental study was done . U.S. President Donald Trump reversed course and last month instructed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with building the pipeline . Francis ' reference to prior consent is enshrined in the U.N. Declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples , which was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 2007 over the opposition of the U.S. , Canada , Australia and New Zealand . Francis ' strong backing for indigenous groups and refugees , his climate change concerns and criticism of the global economy 's profit-at-all-cost mentality highlight the policy differences with the Trump administration that may come out if the U.S. president meets with Francis while in Italy for a G-7 summit in May .
