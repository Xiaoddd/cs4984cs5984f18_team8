Activists from indigenous tribes from across America will set up a teepee encampment next to the Washington Monument , before marching on the White House and holding a rally in the city 's Lafayette Square on Friday morning . The protests follow a year-long battle by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and environmentalists against the construction of the controversial Dakota Access pipeline . The Washington DC protests , organised by Standing Rock along with the Indigenous Environmental Network and the Native Organisers Alliance , will ask the Government to require tribal consent when considering major infrastructure projects crossing through their lands . They will also urge Donald Trump to meet with tribal leaders to discuss indigenous rights . Alongside the demonstrations , there will be performances by Taboo from Black Eyed Peas and Gabriel Ayal , according to a poster for the event . It comes as a federal judge ruled earlier this week against a preliminary request from the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe to block the final phase of the Dakota Access pipeline on religious grounds . Both the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes have challenged the project in a lawsuit , with a ruling expected in April . Yes , submit this vote Cancel You must be logged in to vote .
