If volunteers wanted to go to the front lines , where police were using concussion grenades and tear gas , they had to get through Perez 's training . The Indigenous People 's Power Project , a group of indigenous organizers from around the world , ran the training every day at 2 p.m. . The victory at Standing Rock did n't happen haphazardly . It happened because organizers understood that effective protest is a learned skill . With a series of daily training sessions , the organizers at Standing Rock taught excited volunteers a traditional model of activism based on organization , leadership and discipline . The organizers at Standing Rock say it 's time to bring that approach to sovereignty struggles across the country . There 's always the risk that youthful zeal and righteous anger could cause things to pop off . All the police would need in order to escalate their use of force would be one good excuse . After learning how to handle an afternoon on the front lines , wash pepper spray out of another person 's eyes and deal with legal matters if you 're arrested , other trainers would lead the group outside to practice protest formations and how to form human barricades . Tweet The informal course was based on work by the Ruckus Society , an organization that helps activists with nonviolent protest training and tactics when called upon to help . The Indigenous People 's Power Project is an offshoot of Ruckus , built to visit communities like the Lakota Sioux people of Standing Rock and offer their services , which includes building custom activist training based on a community 's needs . Ruckus often holds training camps that go on for up to a week at a time , but the constant influx of new hands at Standing Rock required something more light and flexible . It 's not about sending people to jail . Oceti Sakowin Camp had a robust schedule of daily programming , updated throughout the day on white boards around the camp . At 9 a.m. each day was general orientation , where volunteers who just arrived learned the camp rules : no photographing sacred fires and ceremonies . And , the camp values : be of service , put indigenous people at the center . And at 6 p.m. were the meetings about decolonization , a word that 's bubbling up into the mainstream a lot now that indigenous struggles are back in the news . Before the declaration of victory on Sunday , the camp was receiving hundreds of new visitors a day , packing each of these sessions to the brim . By the time December came around , it was clear to the organizers the camp 's population had more volunteers and guests than it did indigenous people . The trainers at Standing Rock emphasized that this means putting indigenous people back at the center , and for white allies to ask themselves how they can be of service . Lungo said . It 's our job as outsiders to check ourselves . There were over 127 cases of hypothermia , and tribal elders asked the visitors and nonessential protestors to head home , at least for the harsh North Dakota winter . With brutal winds battering the tents and small structures at Oceti , hundreds of people evacuated for their own safety . Tweet But Standing Rock is n't the only fight , and the point of training people in organizing and tactics is building a network of leaders so that those who stood at Standing Rock can take the fight home with them . Even as the protest will likely rage on in North Dakota , activists at home focused on the banks behind the pipeline project , like Citigroup and Wells Fargo , protesting at offices and keeping bank employees from entering their buildings .
