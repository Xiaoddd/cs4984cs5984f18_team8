First Nations launching call for mass demonstration to protest Trans Mountain Open this photo in gallery : A sign protesting the path of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline expansion hangs outside a trailer in Burnaby , B.C. , on Jan. 10 . The planned action could escalate into confrontation as opponents of the project are determined to stop construction , said Chief Bob Chamberlain , vice-president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs . Opponents of the pipeline expansion demonstrated on Burnaby Mountain three years ago , and more than 100 people were arrested for refusing police orders to disperse . Smaller protests have sprung up in recent months around Kinder Morgan 's Burnaby terminal , as the company continues to obtain permits from the B.C. government for preconstruction activity . On Tuesday , the Tsleil Waututh will put out a call to allied nations and supporters of environmental organization , with organizers saying their network will reach some 200,000 Canadians . The planned pipeline expansion has sparked an interprovincial battle between the British Columbia government , which opposes the project , and Alberta , which argues its oil industry desperately needs access to Pacific Rim markets in order to receive world prices for its crude . Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was in Nanaimo , B.C. , last week defending his government 's decision to approve the project that he insists is in the national interest , while pledging to protect the coast from risks of a spill because of increased tanker traffic .

Mr. Trudeau should not leave Alberta to lead the defence of the project that Ottawa has declared to be in the national interest , said Martha Hall Findlay , president of Calgary-based Canada West Foundation . Instead , Ottawa must send a strong message that neither protesters nor the B.C. government will be allowed to derail the expansion , she told the Energy Council of Canada meeting . At the town hall session in Nanaimo last week , the Prime Minister was jeered when he defended the government 's decision . Story continues below advertisement The government is failing in its pledge of reconciliation by approving the Trans Mountain expansion project over the objections of several local First Nation communities , he said . The government has committed to respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples , which includes the principle that First Nations people be afforded the right to free , prior and informed consent over projects that impact their traditional territory . Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr has said the UN principle provides for fuller consultation and partnership over decision-making , but does not provide any one Indigenous community with a veto over a project that is in the national interest .
