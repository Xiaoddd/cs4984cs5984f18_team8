His riveting account of Herbert Baum and the anti-fascist resistance in Berlin is based on Nazi trial records , interviews with survivors of the Baum circle , and extensive reading in the major secondary works on the subject . The Baum resistance group , composed mostly of Jews who opposed the Nazis both during the Weimar Republic and the Hitler years , resisted the Nazis by circulating anti-Nazi leaflets . Ultimately betrayed by a member of the group , Herbert Baum , his wife , and members of his circle were hunted down by the Gestapo , placed on trial and many of them , including the Baums , were sentenced to death -LRB- Brothers includes a harrowing description of executions by guillotine -RRB- . Those not sentenced to death were sent to Auschwitz and other concentration camps . In the Berliner Lustgarten , a monument was erected in 1981 which commemorates the 1942 attack . They fought the Nazis because they were Communists who followed the Moscow line of the moment , not because they were defending the Jewish community , although they were aware of their Jewish ancestry . This is an important work which , better than many books on the subject , illuminates the division and complexity by which German Jews responded to Nazism .
