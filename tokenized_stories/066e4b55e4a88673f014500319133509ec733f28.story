So when Hurricane Sandy crunched into what was once known as the Las Vegas of the east coast in 2012 , some improvisation was needed . Regular drinkers helped slot a cork board through the frame of the door , wedging it shut and keeping out the surging seawater . The wild night , which severely damaged more than 320 homes and caused a week-long power blackout , was seen out by those taking shelter with the help of several bottles of Jameson . But Sandy was just the headline act among increasingly common flooding events that are gnawing away at the thin island upon which the city sits . The upstairs of the pub is replete with vintage furniture , gramophones and china dogs . These flooding events have increased seven-fold in Atlantic City since the 1950s , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , and are spurred by rainfall or simply a spring tide abetted by unhelpful gusts of wind . The casinos and boardwalk are protected on the ocean side by a network of beach dunes . But the western side of the city , where few tourists venture and poverty lingers , is more vulnerable . To compound the problem much of the mid-Atlantic coast is sinking , a hangover from the last ice age , meaning life and property is being swamped like never before . atlantic city sea level And yet with no overarching national sea level rise plan and patchy commitment from states , many coastal communities are left to deal with the encroaching seas themselves . Wealthier areas are raising streets and houses , erecting walls and pumps . Those without the funds or political will have several state or federal grants they can access but often make muddled choices in the face of this sisyphean task . Nazari is critical of outdated flood maps , risky building in areas prone to flooding and what he considers an undue haste to buy up water-ravaged houses on the cheap to compensate homeowners rather than improve ragged coastal defenses . They are losing 20 cars a month to nuisance flooding on Absecon Island . Chris Christie , the New Jersey governor , has previously said there was no evidence that Hurricane Sandy was linked to climate change . Today , it abuts the shuttered Trump Taj Mahal casino , which was sold by the president last year , as well as a tidal gauge that is quietly recording the fate of the city . Native Americans used to holiday , but never live , on the shifting sandy outcrop because they knew that it would be perennially mauled by the sea . Today , there are about 40,000 people living in Atlantic City , with the boardwalk drawing in millions of tourists to its hulking casinos . And then there are the storms . Ben Horton , a climate scientist at Rutgers University , said that a Sandy-like storm used to occur on the east coast once every 500 years , before industrial activity began loading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases . Now such a storm arrives once every 25 years or so . Should the sea level continue to rise sharply , by 2100 Sandy would visit Atlantic City every five years . Terenik is plotting new sea walls , a curb on new development in flood-prone areas and an underground canal that can funnel away stormwater . Perhaps most ambitiously , she is taken by an idea , put forward by Princeton University , that would raise the streets and houses in Chelsea Heights , a vulnerable neighborhood , and allow the water to seep into vacant land to create a sort of New Jersey twist on Venice . Should slabs of Antarctic ice start to crumble away into the ocean and fuel a 6ft sea level rise by 2100 , Miami Beach will pretty much be swallowed up . Gonzalez , a college professor , focused heavily on sea level rise when she was elected last year . It is so hard to imagine parts of Miami Beach disappearing . A lot of this island is fill . We filled it in once . City engineers admit that they are merely buying themselves time , perhaps 20 years or so , until Miami Beach will need to work the problem out again , possibly with some new technology . The seas are relentless , and rising ever further without end in sight . Much of southern Florida will eventually be reclaimed , but for now there is trillions of dollars of real estate to save . The affluent can afford to raise their homes , lobby for sea walls and water pumps , and stay in a nice hotel if it all gets a bit much . Some people may have to leave if the costs mount further . Even some of the wealthier residents are buying insurance properties in areas of the mainland , farther from the coast . Gunder is a nascent climate campaigner and resident of Liberty City , a Miami district known for its problems with crime and poverty . Gunder has been agitating , so far unsuccessfully , for some large trees to help shade the Liberty City populace from increasingly frequent heatwaves . Four hundred million dollars , yes , is needed for resiliency , but just to put it in one neighborhood I think is ridiculous . Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michel Rodriguez tries to jump to a shallow spot as he crosses a flooded street in Miami Beach in 2015 . We live here . We go to school here . We work here . Federal leadership for communities like Atlantic City and Miami Beach is unlikely to arrive before the situation escalates further . Should the seas rise by 6ft , 13 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by the end of this century , according to recent research . There will need to be a plan , beyond just cutting emissions , well before this time . In the meantime , threatened cities such as New York and Boston will mull gargantuan sea barriers , Miami Beach will hoist itself further upwards , and Atlantic City will hope a solution , or a combination of solutions , is found before the next Sandy arrives . What links these places is the reluctance to abandon them . I love this city . Back in Atlantic City , Cathy Burke , surrounded by her Boardwalk Empire-style refinements , is similarly defiant . Storms , whatever .
