I am of the opinion that use of lethal force on unarmed perps and protesters should be outright BANNED . The only time lethal force is acceptable for cops is if the perp does indeed have a weapon on him or her . We live in a country where white militias can walk around with guns and even POINT GUNS at cops -LRB- Watch videos of the 2014 Bundy standoff . They pointed guns at cops and did n't get shot . Ca n't say the same about Tamir Rice and his toy gun -RRB- and not get shot , while unarmed black children and Native American protesters are at risk of being killed . One protester may be permanently blind from being shot in the face with a tear gas canister . Yes there is . Republicans only care about vets for their votes . They have no problem with taking away their benefits or presumably berating them for this . Protesters have vowed to stay put . Opponents of the 1,170-mile Dakota Access Pipeline have gathered for months at the Oceti Sakowin camp , about 40 miles south of Bismarck . The Standing Rock Sioux and other Native American tribes fear the pipeline could pollute the Missouri River and harm sacred cultural lands and tribal burial grounds . The protesters should stay put no matter what . Hopefully more of this will come if they keep it up . The order was effective immediately and was to remain in place indefinitely . Federal officials said anyone found on the land after Dec. 5 could be charged with trespassing . One veteran , Loreal Black Shawl , said the mission to support the protesters was intensely personal . Ms. Black Shawl , 39 , of Rio Rancho , N.M. , is a descendant of two Native American tribes , the Oglala Lakota and Northern Arapaho . She served in the Army for nearly eight years , finishing her career as a sergeant . Ms. Black Shawl said , referring to the protesters . The authorities have used rubber bullets , pepper spray and water cannons against demonstrators , hundreds of whom have been injured , according to protest organizers . The clashes have been highly contentious , with the police and demonstrators leveling accusations of violence at each other . Watch videos of the protests on Youtube or livestreams . They clearly show the cops attacking the protesters , not vice versa . Some protesters filed a class-action lawsuit on Monday against the Morton County police and others , alleging excessive use of force and seeking a court injunction to prevent the authorities from using rubber bullets , explosive grenades and water cannons , according to The Atlantic . One woman was injured and in danger of losing her arm after an explosion at the protest site this month . Do n't forget the woman who may now be permanently blind from being shot in the face with a tear gas canister . Some officials expressed the hope that the demonstrators would move on . I would n't be surprised if their ancestors slaughtered the Native Americans and stole their land . My hope is that these protests cause the Dakota Access Pipeline to be either relocated or cancelled . They even talked on NPR about Texas becoming a blue state because of Donald Trump . Women . Over half of female voters view Trump negatively ... and that was BEFORE Pussygate . The reasons are obvious . Donald Trump is a misogynistic sexual predator . No self-respecting woman should vote for Donald Trump . I 'm pretty sure the majority of female Trump supporters are only voting for him because their husbands told them to . Not because they agree with him . Ten different women accused Trump of groping them . It 's highly unlikely that ALL of them are lying . The Republicans are starting to become a far-right political party thanks to Trumpolini and his neo-Nazi friends . Yes , Bernie has done well . Yes , Bernie has convinced some of the centrists -LRB- including Hillary -RRB- to move to the left to some extant . But it 's going to be rather difficult for Bernie to win . Hillary has Super PACS . Bernie has labor unions . So , I 've been looking at the third parties in America . It 's highly possible that Hillary will go back to centrism , should she be elected . Too bad they 're centrist liberals . I have to admit . Seeing someone who was backed by the usual Super PAC 's getting annihilated by Trump 's immature behavior at the GOP debates was pretty hilarious . The Republican party made it 's bed in softcore racism for decades . Now it 's getting fucked in it . Trump has none . First the company hires thugs to assault the protesters and now they want to criminalize civil disobedience . Even from a presidential candidate . A North Dakota judge issued a warrant Wednesday for the arrest of Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein , who is accused of spray-painting construction equipment during a protest against the Dakota Access pipeline . Court records show Stein was charged Wednesday in Morton County with misdemeanor counts of criminal trespass and criminal mischief . The same charges have been filed against her running mate , Ajamu Baraka . Spray-painting graffiti on a bulldozer harms no one . Flynn quit and Trump being impeached or resigning looks three times more likely than it did last week . Hold a press conference . It was terrible . Not all black people know each other . Yep . It 's Obama 's fault that some of his staff have ties to Russia . When asked about anti-semitism by a Jewish reporter , Trump pretty much told the reporter to shut up . Sally Yates : Fired for refusing to enforce the travel ban . Only lasted 10 days . Michael Flynn : Holds the record for shortest tenure as National Security Adviser in American history . Only lasted 22 days before resigning . James Comey : The official reason is that he was sacked because of how he handled Emailgate . There 's plenty of reason to believe that it was actually due to the Russia investigation . Only lasted 109 days . Sean Spicer : Bailed after 182 days . Reince Priebus : Quit because he did n't like Scaramucci . Only lasted 189 days . Holds the record for shortest tenure as Chief of Staff in American history . Anthony Scaramucci : Only lasted SIX DAYS -LRB- He was appointed on the 21st of July , but his job did n't start until the 25th -RRB- as the White House Communications Director before being sacked . I am of the opinion that use of lethal force on unarmed perps and protesters should be outright BANNED . The only time lethal force is acceptable for cops is if the perp does indeed have a weapon on him or her . We live in a country where white militias can walk around with guns and even POINT GUNS at cops -LRB- Watch videos of the 2014 Bundy standoff . They pointed guns at cops and did n't get shot .
