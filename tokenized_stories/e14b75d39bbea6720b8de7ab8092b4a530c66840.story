Abbas then turned to the United Kingdom , saying that we continue to demand an apology from the British for the Balfour Declaration , and we will continue to demand their recognition of a Palestinian state . He noted that Herzls phrase a land without a people for a people without a land was made up . He arrived here and saw a people , and for that reason , spoke of the need to get rid of the Palestinians . Abbas spoke for about two and half hours about how Jews were brought to Israel . He noted that England and the United States participated in the process of bringing Jews to Palestine after the Holocaust , seeking to solve the problem of having Jews without suffering the consequences . They told the Americans that we were ready to give up the right of return , 13 percent of the West Bank , and provide a Jewish prayer space at the Al-Aqsa Mosque . We told them that we would n't join , as long as they do n't close the PLO offices in Washington , do n't move their embassy to Jerusalem , and freeze building in the settlements . They did n't agree , and as such , we 're not obligated to any agreements . We will join those organizations . Another 46 were vetoed by the Americans . We must be careful , and for this reason we created an authority for fighting drugs , and are investing a lot in sport , mostly in soccer . We already passed Israel in FIFA . The head of the Palestinian National initiative , Dr. Mustafa Barghouti , said to Haaretz after Abbas speech : The speech made a point . Its clear that the U.S. is done in its role as the exclusive sponsor of the peace process , and the Palestinians have emphasized that they will no longer accept any external partys dictates . On Monday , we will draft the conclusion , and I personally will demand that the draft includes the position that we will work to implement a one-state solution with equal civil and national rights for all . Hamas attacked Abbas saying that his statements do not represent a consensus among Palestinians . Hamas spokesman Fauzi Barhum criticized the decision to convene the gathering in Ramallah , saying that it should have been held in a different country to ensure the participation of senior representatives from all the factions . Haaretz has learned that in discussions that were held over the weekend both by the Fatah Central Committee and by the PLOs Executive Committee , a slew of suggestions is being considered ; among them is the idea of nixing the Oslo Accords and the security coordination on the grounds that Israel has breached all agreements so the Palestinians are not committed to continue and uphold the accords . Other elements in Fatah and in the PLO are leaning toward the option of continuing international efforts , especially through the United Nations , the European Union , China and Russia in order to advance international recognition of a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders . According to Fatah officials , the next Palestinian move would be to implement their demand to make the conflict an international issue and demand that the UN set up a team to resolve it . The United States could potentially be a member of such a team , the officials said , but it can not be the exclusive mediator of the political process . Deputy chief of Fatah Mahmoud Al-Aloul said that many Palestinians have high expectations for the central councils decision . We must address these expectations , because we are currently standing at the crossroads of the Palestinian national issue . Al-Aloul added that these decisions are difficult , and will not lead to abandoning Fatahs friends . Al-Aloul told Haaretz that the Fatah Central Council makes its decisions independently , and that there are a list of recommendations to be taken into account , including freezing its recognition of Israel . Decisions made by the council are passed on to the PLOs executive committee for implementation . Haaretz has also learned that over the past several days , European and Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia have been applying pressure on the PA and on Abbas in particular not to take game-changing steps and to enable action on the international and diplomatic fronts . Another suggestion would be asking the UN Security Council to recognize a Palestinian state along the 67 borders as well as define PA lands as a country under occupation . Yet another suggestion was to turn to the International Court of Law in order to start legal proceedings against Israel . The Palestinian Central Council is an advisory body that meets when it is impossible to convene a parley of the Palestinian National Council -LRB- the legislative body of the Palestine Liberation Organization -RRB- and is supposed to provide the PLOs executive committee , which is the highest-ranking Palestinian executive body , with recommendations relating to policy . A senior member of the PLOs Executive Committee told Haaretz that despite the dramatic atmosphere Abbas associates are trying to create , there is no expectation for game-changing moves .
