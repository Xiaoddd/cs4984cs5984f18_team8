HOME COMMENTS 36 SUPPORTERS 114 MAP More Info Since October 2016 , under the leadership of the Ramapough Lenape Nation , Split Rock Sweetwater Prayer Camp has been holding space and leading the fight against the proposed Pilgrim Pipeline , a 178-mile pipeline that would carry up to 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day from Albany , New York to Linden , New Jersey endangering local water supplies , sacred sites , and essential wetlands . Unfortunately , the presence of Split Rock Sweetwater Prayer Camp has exposed deeper issues surrounding indigenous sovereignty , land rights , freedom of religion , and discrimination against the Ramapough Lenape Nation . Water and land protectors at Split Rock Sweetwater Prayer Camp have experienced harassment , intimidation , and false accusations on an ongoing basis from the Town of Mahwah and surrounding Polo Club neighbors . Now , coincidentally , three protectors have been charged in connection to alleged vandalism near Split Rock Sweetwater Prayer including Ramapough Lenape Nation Tribal Chief , Dwaine Perry . We are in URGENT need of defense funds to protect our land and water protectors at Split Rock Sweetwater Prayer Camp . Please consider donating and sharing widely .
