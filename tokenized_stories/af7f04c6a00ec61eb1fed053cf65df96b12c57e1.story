At least 39 people have been killed by police Tasers in 2015 so far , according to The Guardian . Bean bags , rubber bullets , and flying tear gas canisters have also maimed , if not killed , in the U.S. and abroad . Becker said he worried about police firing on criminal suspects remotely , not unlike U.S. Air Force pilots who bomb the so-called Islamic State , widely known as ISIS , from more than 5,000 miles away . Drones have been in use for decades by the military , but their high prices have prevented police departments from obtaining them until recently . Rost said he needs to use drones for surveillance in order to obtain a warrant in the first place . The sheriff and lobbyists assured lawmakers that drones would only be used in non-criminal situations , like the search for a missing person or to photograph an accident scene . When a few cows wandered onto his land , Brossart refused to take them back to their owner , his neighbor . The neighbor called the police and the situation turned into a 16-hour standoff . Fearful of entering his ranch without knowing where Brossart was , police asked Homeland Security to redirect a Predator searching the border with Canada . asked Rep. Gary Paur , a Republican , at a hearing . In other words , limit civil liberties so Big Drone can spread its wings . Drones in North Dakota are a profitable enterprise in a state hit hard by the oil bust . Companies that market machines for agricultural and commercial use have been popping up in industrial parks on the outskirts of Grand Forks for the better part of the last three years . The Air Force has partnered with the private sector to create a drone research and development park , too . In addition to the flawed comparison to helicopters and the milquetoast descriptions of drone use , police continually cited Federal Aviation Administration rules that require law enforcement organizations authorized to operate drones to notify the FAA when the devices are deployed as a reason why HB 1328 was unnecessary . This also appears to be an incomplete analysis . Sarah Nelson , a journalist and Bismarck native who has studied police use of drones , was also there . There , past the airport a few miles outside the western edge of the city , the landscape gives way to the prairie that covers the vast middle of North Dakota . But before civilization is left behind on a westward route , the city , its politicians , the base , and the powerful interests of the drone program at the University of North Dakota are adding a futuristic appendage : Grand Sky . Billed as a UAS research and development facility , Grand Sky will combine all the benefits of private entrepreneurship and government capital . It is certainly that : The residents of Grand Forks , like those throughout the state who have taken a laissez-faire attitude to oil companies reaping millions from North Dakota ground , appear concerned primarily with the economic benefits of drone technology . Part of the reason for this , Frazier argued , is a compliance committee keeps police use of drones in check . A body with no legal authority , the committee tracks and reviews how police use their drones and discusses possible privacy concerns . And the rest are either current or former members of law enforcement and emergency services . Drones are overwhelmingly seen as a good thing in North Dakota , which is perhaps why few noticed when HB 1328 passed with a clause allowing them to be armed with non-lethal weapons . It also may be that the pair had nothing to do with the non-lethal exception included in HB 1328 , which they say is the case . sheriff and lobbyists assured lawmakers that drones would only be used in non-criminal situations , like the search for a missing person or to photograph an accident scene .
