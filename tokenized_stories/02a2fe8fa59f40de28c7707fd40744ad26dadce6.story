Photograph : AP The US TV network FX plans to examine the fraught relationship between Prince Charles and Princess Diana in the second instalment of its real-life dramatisation series , Feud . According to the Hollywood Reporter and Deadline , Feud : Charles and Diana will air in 2018 across 10 episodes . No casting has been announced for the second , royal-focused series , but a similarly high-profile cast is likely to be recruited . The series has been created by Ryan Murphy , who has a longstanding relationship with FX , with shows including American Crime Story and American Horror Story . Speaking prior the announcement , Murphy described his ideal subjects for future series of the show . Charles and Diana married in 1981 but separated after little more than a decade , before divorcing in 1996 . Diana died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 , leading to a national outpouring of grief across the UK . Charles went on to marry Camilla Parker Bowles , with whom he had been romantically involved prior to the divorce .
