One of the greatest uses of civil disobedience occurred during the Civil Rights epoch of the 1960s , and today we are part of a resurgence with more and more people using non-violent direct action . Black Liberation activists have pushed back through acts of civil disobedience and confrontation , with major flash points occurring in Ferguson , MO and Baltimore , MD. . Similarly , water protectors and pipeline fighters have upped the ante in demonstrating their defiance of fossil fuel infrastructure . And , of course , no one will ever forget the history made by the Native-led resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock , ND . It can not be denied that these collective acts of defiance have rocked the consciousness of the country , and , in some cases , have resulted in actions that directly benefit the people and the planet . And states across the country have followed suit , with similar pieces of legislation passed or attempted from Washington State to Massachusetts . The one thing these bills have in common is that they were sponsored and largely supported by republican lawmakers . But that all changed very recently . Let us be clear : police departments across the country have justified brutality and murder by accusing their victims of assault , for actions as heinous as dodging a night stick or pushing back on a barricade that is crushing against a crowd . Outspoken Sanders supporter , Rep. Tulsi Gabbard -LRB- D-HI -RRB- , who resigned from a party leadership seat due to her endorsement , abstained her vote on the bill . In short , we have a ball game , and the opponent is putting lots of pine tar on the balls . Consider this : a water protector locks down to a pipeline utilizing non-violent direct action . If a law enforcement official is injured in the process of cutting them free , that subject could face ten years in prison . The comments drew condemnation from the ACLU and NAACP . Law enforcement officials already have a blank check as it pertains to using lethal force and unchecked brutality against unarmed citizens - the combination of this bill and this president now gives them more of an opportunity to cash it . All power to the people , and all people to the power . Give Anthony Rogers-Wright a round of applause .
