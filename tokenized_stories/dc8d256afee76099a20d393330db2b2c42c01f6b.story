Connecting to the internet in Standing Rock is a difficult task . Unfortunately , the signal has been weak and is suspected of being interfered with by unknown parties . If there is a real need for wifi , people head to the casino 10 minutes south by car . Not being a technologist myself , I spoke to Lisha Sterling from Geeks Without Bounds in order to understand what is happening and who is responsible . Sterling has a background in technology reaching back to 1993 and has degrees in Latin American Studies and Migration Studies . GWB is a merger of her humanitarian work and technology background . Upon arrival to Standing Rock , her phone crashed . I asked Sterling to help me understand what might be causing our cell phones to be acting up . People have reported having their phones misbehaving in odd ways . Sterling has personally heard from hundreds of people about their cell phones acting odd . Batteries dying without warning are the most common reports . According to Sterling , one of the reasons there is so much political change going on in the world right now , the reason that movements like the Arab Spring or Occupy were possible , is because of the power of instant global communication through the internet . Both of those movements happened in mostly urbanized areas . Standing Rock has both geography and non-urbanized infrastructure restricting it from reaching the outside world . The main camps are in a basin-shaped section of land , beneath the cell signal , and there are few internet service providers nearby . There is a climate of surveillance in the occupation camps . Overhead , an airplane circles every hour or so . As it passes over , Sterling reports there is an increase in cell phone battery deaths , and even car batteries dying . The plane flies at night without lights on . Helicopters fly over the camp taking photos . There are very likely infiltrators from DAPL and the government in camp with the water protectors . Whatever information is being gathered , it is a bonus to the scare tactic of living beneath a security apparatus . Water protectors looking north to Oceti Sakowin . There is no shortage of theories . It works by mimicking a cell tower , causing the phone to connect to it and brokering the connection to the actual cell tower . In this way , all data , text and voice traffic can be monitored if it is not encrypted . This is one theory to explain the oddities in device operation , but has not yet been confirmed . The Freedom of Information Act requests that were sent to the North Dakota State Police , Morton County Sheriff and the Nation Guard were all rejected on grounds of security . The Electronic Frontier Foundation is currently conducting an investigation . Learn how to use it for voice calls as well . - Turn off Automatic Updates in your Settings . IMSI-catchers can inject software via updates . - Backup your phone to your computer before you come out here . The contradiction between the last two is difficult to work around . You need system updates to protect from the most recent security threats . However , I myself received a message for a system update that does not coincide with any release from Apple . Catch-22s like this lend themselves to the atmosphere of suspicion . There is an invisible antagonist winking at us , but no one knows exactly what that means , but we know how it feels . When I got the message my stomach sank . According to the report , someone in Belcourt , ND , was trying to access my email . The unknown device came from Fort Totten , North Dakota , and was registered to the State of North Dakota ITD . A week later , one of my collogues at Oceti Sakowin Camp Media had their Paypal account hacked into . The perpetrator used funds to purchase goods and drain the account . The account was receiving donations to buy a winter structure . People around camp reported similar stories to me . One man had his messages to a relative deleted from their device out-of-state while he was in jail . Another girl reported her device would ask for login data for facebook and google , but if she closed and opened the programs they would work fine . One woman I spoke to reported that her phone call to her mother had been redirected to another camper in Standing Rock whom she did not know . Subtle intimidation like this is creates a train of logic that leads into darker places . Unfortunately , there is another question that is important to address . November 29th , 2016 .
