The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America The Collapse of The American Dream Click here to view the breakdown of the Fortune 500 , from how much they made compared to how many people they employ . Anyway , I road back to the camp with them from the fairy , after we held an action in Seattle that afternoon . So ... Maybe you just show up with a sign and chant and disturb the business . Maybe you all get arrested . Either case , your defenses have all been full of crap . You would plea out and take the probation , or show up for trial and tell the jury you never herd the police tell you to leave . But now , now you cooking with gas . Today , yesterday , five members from the group Rising Tide Seattle , are facing a trial as the Delta 5 , for their involvement in the September 2014 , blockade of a railroad or railway yard . If they did , and they probably did , this is a major coup . If the jury selection was anything like the first Occupy Orlando trespassing trial , the case is already lost . And the lawyers know that . They just tell you you have a chance because that is what you want to hear and that is how they make their house payments . The trick will be in convincing the jury that they have the power to vote in your favor . All defendants have to get up and testify , bring in witnesses to testify about climate change and the dangers of those oil bombs , especially one , one mile long and all speak the truth of reality . Normally , I would be looking at defending from statutory jurisdiction . The fake laws . But what is going on here is not a statutory arrest . There is a victim , the railroad company . And they complain they lost millions from this eight hour action . So , when it comes to trespassing on private property , I say , tell they jury why you did it . That was the advice I gave to Lisa Leggio , of the MICATS -LRB- Michigan Coalition Against Tar Sands -RRB- , at some hearings before her trial . They lost . Lawyers . So what the CDC has found is basically just using the truth and letting the chips fall as they may . Let me tell you how rare this defense is . I found an Insanity Defense , Justifiable Homicide , crap like that , but no Necessity Defense . That which makes the contrary of a thing impossible . The quality or state of being necessary , in its primary sense signifying that which makes an act or event unavoidable . Quality or state of fact of being in difficulties or in need ; a condition arising out of circumstances that compels a certain course of action . Bykofsky v. Borough of Middletown , D.C.Pa. , 401 F.Supp . 1242 , 1250 . See Irresistible impulse . Snider v. Smyth , D.C.Va. , 187 F.Supp . 299 , 302 . Com . v. Walzack , 468 Pa. 210 , 360 A. 2d 914 , 919 . See also Insanity ; M'Naghten Rule . See Justification ; Self-defense . Justification . Just , lawful excuse or reason for act or failing to act . A maintaining or showing a sufficient reason in court why the defendant did what he is called upon to answer , particularly in an action of libel and as a defense to criminal charges of assault or homicide -LRB- e.g. self defense -RRB- . Not that one , although , one could argue that the past explosion near your home excused you from criminal liability because you were just trying to protect your life , limb and property . All of which the de facto government is not willing to prevent . Not an immediate act of self defense , but one , nonetheless , that made you feel an irresistible need to act upon . You let them know you were willing to stay there and not let these trains pass until a law was passed prohibiting them from entering . Without that , they will say you knew you were going to be arrested . You did not . You were there to stop this train from ever passing . The danger was just too great . But do it with peace and forget about it . Justification is a procedure with common-law origins by which a surety must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court that it has sufficient ability to perform its obligations . Matthews v. IMC Mint Corp. , CA.Utah , 542 F. 2d 544 , 546 . Not that one either ... Justification means explanation with supporting data . American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines , Inc. v. Federal Maritime Commission , 135 U.S.App.D.C . 181 , 417 F. 2d 749 , 752 . As defense in criminal and tort law , term means maintaining or showing a sufficient reason in court why the defendant did what he is called upon to answer or , just cause or lawful excuse for act , reasonable excuse . Young Women 's Christian Ass 'n of Princeton , N. J. v. Kugler , D.C.N.J. , 342 F.Supp . 1048 , 1062 . Bingo , we have a winner . Term is not widely used in torts where , instead , defenses and privileges are common . See also Legal excuse ; Necessity ; Self-defense . Alabama Public Service Commission v. Crow , 247 Ala. 120 , 22 So .2 d 721 , 724 . To fulfill requirements for easement of right of way of necessity , the necessity must be actual , real , and reasonable , as distinguished from inconvenience , but it need not be absolute and irresistible necessity . When used in relation to power of eminent domain does not mean absolute necessity , but only reasonable necessity . See also Necessaries ; Necessary . Good luck folks . This is going to be a tuff one to win . Jeez , you have to convince them that your actions were necessary due to inaction by OUR government , which we defendants and jurors are all a part of . You have to convince them that the government is the people and that they and you are part of those people , and that these jurors , buy allowing this to continue , while locking up those trying to stop the destruction of the species , are just perpetuating the destruction by going along with it and not taking a stand , as the People , and sending a message to Washington that this will not stand . Like I said , good luck . Finding the right jury is the key to winning . All that means is they have been brainwashed into thinking like those in charge of the government want them to think . I truly feel these people may be beyond comprehension of why you broke the law . No . Your perfect juror is the juror that is smart . Unemployed people with above average intelligence , thinkers . The questions you ask them are paramount . You are looking for those that understand that they are the people and the people are those who make up the government and therefore they are the actual government with the power to act as such . Good . Christian guilt is another thing you might want to try on the jury . If you have a jury of all people who believe that there is a God and this God is coming back to earth to judge us all , then it is up to them to do the right thing . If they wont do it for all the people on the planet , then they should do it for their God . And opposite of that are the nonbelievers . These people will have two outlooks . One , they understand reality and will be easily lead to believe that what you did you had to do and they are the only thing now standing between survival or destruction . Now the other nonbeliever is the one that thinks like a republican . You know , every man for himself . This will be the hardest to convince . But if you have this type of juror and can convince them that they really hold the power of survival and destruction in their hands , then you have started the zeitgeist that will change the world for the better . Ask them if they remember morals . Court is poker game , played with the strategy of chess . They are going to try to bluff you into a premature guilty plea and you have to out smart them . This is hard to explain . Your lawyer should understand what I mean by all this . Anyone who has had as much experience as I have in the courtroom will understand this . Part of my writing process is a lot of pacing . I pace and write in my head . I started making this page last night . While pacing for a direction to go , I started writing in my head . I started thinking how I would tell this story to the jury . Those were true feelings coming out . And boy , that song is a very powerful song which at the time of my thoughts was very serendipitous and in sync to them . This is our last dance kids , make it count . I know the pressure is getting to us all . There is one more thing you can do to get the jury to really think of this action . But I do know this is winnable . Maybe not with the first trial , but give it a few ... dozen . No , I hope not . Before long the word will get out that it is the juries that are being held personally accountable for the destruction of our species . Give their names to the press . If a corrupt government will not stop the insanity , then it is up to an informed public to do the right thing . Remind them , that all evil needs to flourish is for good people to do nothing . Then ask the jury if they are good people . Best of luck ... and skill . Peace . It turned out like I had described above . And even though the activist community is telling everyone it was a win , that is the furthest from the the truth . In essence , the judge told the jury that they could not consider the testimony they just heard over the past week . This evil son-of-a-bitch , never had any intentions of allowing the defendants the right to speak the truth and allow the jury to decide on it . That is exactly what Tony told them in the end . That is why I was telling you this case was lost the moment you set up your tripod and got arrested . There are many reasons for this failure , the most of which is the failure to plan . I could be wrong I always reserve the right to be wrong . I doubt it very much . This is what I am speaking about in The Plan . Any legal advice you may have gotten , if you sought it , told you that there was no way you would win this case . They would have told you this because this is exactly how this court game is played . They would know that no judge would allow you to speak the truth as to why you did what you did and ask the jury to be the judges of the morality of the law , and not the facts , here . What you would be asking for at trial , is the jury to assume the position of the government and rule that they , our government , cares more about the people then they do about the capitalist hell bent on the destruction of our world . None . I knew this from the start . They are not allowed to consider any justification that could change laws . Evil exists , it is up to us to identify it . Capitalism is diametrically opposed to Christianity . If most people view Christianity as good , then anything working against it would be bad ; the evil . No . Ergo , their practice of allowing the capitalist to do what they want while locking up those trying to do the Christian thing , is anti Christian , or evil . My guess is that the Delta5 was not passionate enough to convince the jury that they would just be a cog in that agenda by convicting . So get this . Most people in this country believe there is a God and that Jesus Christ is the leader of that God . They need defendants who would not be afraid to teach the jury about FIJA . The problem is , someone is going to want a lawyer and once you have a lawyer on the legal team you might as well make plans to be convicted . The lawyers do not understand the real reason why the politicians are allowing the destruction of the species . They just do what they are told , and they are told not to rock the boat . unadulterated greed . The facts are the facts . Global Warming is real and there are other technologies out there than we can use other than oil . Car makers put the carriage makers either out of business or retooling to work with them . Same can be with the energy industry . Oil workers will either do like the carriage industry did and retool and join the new technology to produce alternate forms of energy , or go out of business . But when the conspiracy by the oil and coal companies to keep themselves in business is so strong , they either lie to gullible people , or pay them off to look the other way . In either case , they are either stupid or corrupt and this is why we must do what we must do . No capitalist , especially one who does what the fossil fuel industry does , is a Christian and neither is anyone who would work for those who killed Jesus - the government . This is why these two entities work together to ensure that the companies get to do what they do and you get to sit in jail . So it is not just capitalism , but the ignorance or more precisely the greed of the politicians to allow the greed of the capitalist . It is now up to the true Christians of this country to come to the aid of their planet . It is up to you to tell the truth of how the evil empire , aka the cops all the way up to the president of the United States , is so corrupt that they will not even allow you to speak about the truth of your actions nor allow the jury to hear them as well . You have to tell the jury that they are so evil that they will not even allow you to consider this in your acquittal . You have to tell the jury how you fought this evil all the way up to this trial and the only thing you can depend on now is them , the jury . That means every time the judge tells you you can not speak in the courtroom you file a writ of mandamus mentioning his violating the first amendment and making him . If that judge tells you to get bent , you file a petition for writ of certiori or a title 42 civil lawsuit against those two or three judges for prohibiting your right to speak . This will all be written up and placed in this section . You tell the jury you had to do this and that the government is so corrupt , including the judge and prosecutor , that you had to tell it to a jury for anyone to help . You have to show the evil to the jury , and convince them that they have the power to initiate change . They have to be convinced that the only change moves through them . I then spent the the rest of the day figuring out exactly what he meant by what he said . I will now post two of the appearances here and dissect them . One of the videos I watched is the one on the right . Here , Tim gives a lecture to a group at a Unitarian Church . Unitarians are pretty cool people . At the 2:49 mark , Tim tells the story of how the judge would not allow him to speak freely about why he did what he did . At 3:18 , he describes how the judge restricted his speech . However , Tim just took it . He never thought to file a petition for a writ of mandamus , suing the judge and making the higher court force him to do his job , which would be to follow the first amendment . Nor did he file a federal title 42 , section 1983 , civil lawsuit , suing this judge for violating his right , a violation of title 18 , USC , sections 241 and 242 , among other things . This would have really clogged up the system and began to expose the corruption of all our government employees . The reason why the first amendment is null and void in any court of law is to give the government an advantage over the people who will appear before it . By them restricting your free speech to tell a jury the real reason why you did what you did , gives them that leg up . Our founding fathers placed the first amendment in the Bill of Rights so that the government could never do what it is they are doing ; terrorizing the People for a little profit , a little kickback . That is why the court makes you take a lair ... I mean a lawyer . Tim goes on to say that he only heard of this Delta5 case within the last few months . This means that he heard about this long after the blockade in Portland , where the Rising Tide had attended . If he had met that Shannon girl , as I did , I doubt he would want to help them out . It is obvious . It was the necessity defense that he was able to get them . No . So the only reason why I can see Tim showing up for this court case was for this necessity defense . Tim seemed to have gotten an orgasm when this happened , not understanding why the judge would allow it . At 6:25 , Tim is describing how excited he became when he learned that for the very first time , a court was going to level the playing field and allow the defendants to give an excuse for what they did . They are guilty in the eyes of the law , so their only way out is by telling the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth . It was just a show for the audience . He never had the intention to allow this to be considered . Had he , he would have been disciplined , maybe would have lost all appeals made against him . That will take care of all the believers on the jury . Tim continues with describing the testimony he heard over the days of the trial . Only problem with that is that in reality , the jury did not hear any of it . He states that it was unprecedented that they were allowed to give all that testimony , yet again , not one bit of it was allowed to be used . Total time for trial , one day . But this guy wanted to make it look good - get you on his side , which he did . If you agree with him you agree with him . It does not matter that this was the finest case for climate activism , the jury was never going to be allowed to use it . Four points of the necessity defense criteria that one has to show is this : There has to be a reasonable expectation of an imitate harm . That harm has to be greater than the harm of breaking the law . That they could not have created the harm that their trying to avoid . Number one , there was a reasonable expectation of an imitate harm . There is already harm being placed on at least one of the defendants , Abby , because of the previous derailment . Two , that that harm has to be greater than the harm of breaking the law , is apparent in the first point . Third , it is quite obvious that they could not have created the harm , but that others , such as ISIS , could . But then there is the fourth criteria , there has to be no legal alternatives . I would assume that this is what Tony used to absolve himself from his participation . He had to have given an example , yet none is given by Tim . Saying there are other legal alternatives is not the same as giving example . These examples , if any , have to be exhausted first . Then he goes on to talk about how the judge was trying to save face by telling everyone in the courtroom that the defendants are commendable people . And the crowd claps at 12:15 , even though the judge tells the jury they can not consider any of the testimony . They truly are blind to this game this judge is playing . What he is telling everyone is that he knows that these people need to win , but he has chosen the dark side and will protect the destruction . Good . My face has been saved with my children as they accept the notion that I am just a nobody who can not effect change in the real world and will be forgiven by the people I lockup for my sins . He chose the government over God . He should have brought it up . He should have showed the jury how the judge is trying to stop this defense . Now the verdict . He , as well as myself , is surprised when the jury delivers a not guilty verdict for obstructing a train . I have no idea what law they were charged with , but what I found is here , where it pretty much says they are guilty . Again , seen it , told you about it before it happened . Their apologies to you were to save face with you , because they are weak and scared of the government . You were also petitioning your government for a redress of grievances you are having with the lawmakers . So you sought the help of the court . This is good though , we will use it a little later on down the page . Perhaps now Tim is seeing the truth in what I write . These people will be instrumental in the progress of your cause . Your cause , because you only care for the planet , whereas my cause is in caring for everything . At 20:46 , Tim gets into what the judge said about the fourth of the criteria not being met . But that was not the point of the action . But he tells how both the judge and the prosecution have a debate on what the defendants intent was , with out allowing the defendants to tell it themselves to the jury . The prosecution saying the intent was to block a train , the judge saying it was for attention and neither but both being the answer at all . You thought you were going to the judicial branch of government for redress , only to find out they are really under the direction of the executive branches of government . Only the appellate courts are the real judicial branch . So , if you thought you were going to get a little sympathy from a judge , ha , think again . The climate movement has been building ever since Greenpeace came to be . There is only one way to effect change , legally , and that is with the lawmakers . And that will only come with not guilty verdicts . Then there is a question and answer for the remaining hours of the lecture and the first one to speak is a defendant , Abby . Please , Abby , the judge took over a year to allow this defense and he never did . All he did was give the appearance that he was allowing it when the entire time he knew this would never fly . This was just sad to see . He is wrong . That is really one of the reasons why they lost . They made him mayor of Fall River . Maybe he too , could have become mayor . He should run , and find out . If anyone out there , a real person , is feeling guilt or shame , it is because they are still a little human . Only evil could do that job and not feel shame . The guilt comes when they refuse to leave or alter there involvement in the job . Guilt and shame . They know what they are doing is wrong , yet they make the conscience decision to to help the bad along . Those with a conscience will reflect on their actions , while those without will continue without remorse . I would like to mention one more place in the video before I move on . This begins happening at the 54 minute mark . Here , the subject of jury nullification is brought up . They speak of this for over 12 minutes and through 2 questioners . I know the lawyers are not allowed to say it , but Mazza was on his own . I wonder what happened that he never let the cat out of the bag . It is for sure they were given an opportunity to use the first amendment to state their cases , and that is a major coup , but you really need to take a look at why the judge might have allowed this . I believe this was his plan the whole time . It either was his plan , or someone put the pressure on him to not allow it in deliberations . In either situation , it was allowed and the jury heard it and from that jury came three new volunteers for the planet . Tim did give an interview yesterday on Your Call Radio.org . In it , he talked about his experiences in prison . No big surprise here . He has as much time behind bars as I do . I could tell that Tim understood what it is that I have been fighting for over 20 years now . Perhaps this knowledge of his , plus these lessons of mine , will help him with his next court case . One thing that caught my attention in that interview was when at around the 43 minute mark he explains why he was prosecuted . He says that it was because he exorcised his first amendment right and was speaking of the arrest all over the place . It was because of that . It was because he freely spoke that the government boys decided to go after him . Here is how I would handle the case of the Delta5 and their next action . First , you can appeal . I might even petition for writ of Certiori in the appeals court . I would state that the judge violated your first amendment right to free speech when attempting to state your defense . Contact me . Another action . That is what you should be planing next . Hell no , you plan another action . A better action then the last . An action and a plan better then what you thought your best was . You go back to the scene of the crime . You go back and do the same action . Only this time you do it with a plan . One thing you could do is see if any of the track is on public land and not private land , if they allow for that kind of thing . If they do , send a group to block the train at that point and take the arrests . Now before you go and do any of this , you have to have a lot of people . Five will not do . There has to be a large number of people from all walks of life . Then you divide them up and tailor each defense for each . You have to study all my stuff before you can do that , or hire me . When you get arrested you get arrested with all kinds of literature on you . You get arrested with FIJA forms , articles on the environment and oil bomb trains because when you get arrested it all becomes evidence in your case . The jury would have no other option but to go over it . Have videos of each future defendant giving a statement . Your action is not to bring awareness to the masses , nor to block a train , well , it is about blocking a train , but that is not your intent . You make sure you let the court know that your intent was for the lawmakers to make laws prohibiting these trains from traveling by populated places . You should know the rest by now . You should know if you want to bring arms , or if you want it to end this part of the action as quickly as the first one ended . Those jury members who were too scared to do the right thing and not convict you , will now be on your side . Besides them teaching you all how to be better defendants , they will be defendants themselves and will be testifying of their experience on the first jury and how they got into this and yadda , yadda , yadda , you know where to go with this . I have trust in Tim , always have . And one person will have a bench trial with Judge Howard , placing the burden of proof on him . You should all be able to figure this out . I have connected the dots quite comprehensively here . Now you know what you are really up against . Sorry bout that . But now you know and you will be able to fight more prepared . I have way too much work to get involved with these cases other then what I have written so far and that I will be monitoring the Delta5 and the Montrose9 twitter sites . I have many months of work ahead of me if we are to win this revolution , this liberation . That is if I decide to finish . It appears that you are all afraid of the truth and with that it is hard to ever convince anyone of what really needs to be done . No , but I would work with the CDC planing an action like this ... if they asked and depending on their power system - lawyers and what they could do to speed up my work . They can contact me here .
