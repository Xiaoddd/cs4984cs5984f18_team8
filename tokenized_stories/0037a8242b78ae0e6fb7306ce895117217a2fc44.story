Flanagan says the song came together quickly over the period of a week he spent learning about the situation . A day or two later , he recorded the song . Recorded and mixed by David Alan Shaw at Tungsten AV , the album was mastered by Adam Boose at Cauliflower Audio . Local singer-songwriter Roger Hoover 's Hoover Design Co. did the artwork . To celebrate its release , Flanagan & the Authorties perform at 9 p.m. on Friday , Dec. 9 , at the Happy Dog . Daniel is a great songwriter and Gretchen Pleuss is great too . One of the goals of this show that the three of us agree on is to try and start blurring the lines between the Akron and Cleveland scenes a little more . Gretchen writes these poetic , at times socially conscious songs . She treats melody and harmony differently and her guitar playing is special . The show will also represent the official debut of a new lineup for the Authorities .
