Throughout my career , I have been committed to working alongside tribes to uphold our trust responsibility . The U.S. Senate has a duty to support tribal communities in their work to build sustainable economies and good schools , provide quality health care , maintain access to clean air and water , and protect the deep Native American connection to culture and tradition .

Sounds good to me . Among these necessities are clean air and water preservation , the perennial health care problems , power in the form of electrical lines that running over reservations and reasonable internet service . Many do not realize that every home that is hooked up to the electrical grid has the ability to encode and decode digital information using digital technology upon those same wires . A second point on this subject . Therefore , putting theses two concepts together we have not only power but the capability of using hardwired internet service potential . In other words there is much to be investigated and many opportunities pursued . As always , devil is in the details . Choose wisely and focus on the objectives . Well , who has a chance to speak , who gives it and gets it is as always seems to move mostly on who shows up and can never taken for granted . THERE ARE PRECEDENTS for this and there should be dollars still available . It will be in diversity and creatively that we shall survive . Kill the black snake before it gets a chance to strike . To say otherwise is to deceive yourself . So , I wish both gentlemen good hunting . In the end , my faith is with the Creator , not Mannon . Thanks for the forum ... Drink no poisoned water , eat no poisoned food and breathe no poisoned air . Love and cherish each other and your animals every day . Know who you are , where you are and what you are doing . Be generous , honest and vigilant in your dealings . May the spirit of peace that you hold in your heart quell the fears and ghosts of your mind . I stand with The People of Standing Rock . I stand with The People of Puerto Rico . I stand with The People of the Aleutian Islands . izopnyde Lena Toledo 2 years ago The agenda topics under this new leadership should include 1 -RRB- Tribal Sovereign status i.e. either we are truly Sovereign which we are not as our tribes are desperately dependent on the federal dollar , we do not have our own military , or our own money power . IV , Sec . Please , elucidate us about point 2 -RRB- as to the obstruction to progress . I , quite frankly , still fight with my post traumatic almost 50 years later . From the records , it was shown that it was a complete surprise to him when he was arrested since his stated objectives were that of a peaceful nature . Ask him yourself what he believes and his motives . What I do know is that the Chairman closed the camp and extinguished the fire and told everyone that they were free to go back home . This is part of the prelude to that interview from Amy Gooman . Thousands of water protectors remain at the resistance camps at Standing Rock . Last month , the Department of the Army denied Energy Transfer Partners , the company behind the pipeline , a permit necessary to drill underneath the Missouri River . Jasilyn Charger , You are are a true leader and a beautiful person . So , I thank you for your comments but believe your pursuits are on the wrong track . Drink no poisoned water , eat no poisoned food and breath no poisoned air . Let the peace you hold in your heart quell the fears and ghosts of your mind . Thank you .
