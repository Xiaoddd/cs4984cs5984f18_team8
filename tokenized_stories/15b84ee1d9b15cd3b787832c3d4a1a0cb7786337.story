A member of the North Dakota Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party , she is the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from North Dakota . She served as the 28th North Dakota Attorney General from 1993 to 2001 and as State Tax Commissioner from 1986 to 1992 . Heitkamp ran for governor of North Dakota in 2000 and lost to Republican John Hoeven . She narrowly defeated Republican Congressman Rick Berg on November 6 , 2012 , in that year 's closest Senate race . Heitkamp was raised in Mantador , North Dakota , attending local public schools . She also became active in politics , joining the North Dakota Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party . In 1986 , Conrad decided to resign as Tax Commissioner in order to run for the U.S. Senate . She served in that position until 1992 . Heitkamp ran unopposed in the Democratic primary . On the Republican side , John Hoeven , CEO of the Bank of North Dakota , also ran unopposed . During her campaign for governor , it was announced that Heitkamp had been diagnosed with breast cancer , which later went into remission . Heitkamp 's brother , Joel , is a radio talk-show host and former North Dakota state senator . Heitkamp was attacked in commercials for accepting campaign contributions from Jack McConnell , Jr. , a trial lawyer assigned by her , when she was state attorney general , to help North Dakota implement its settlement with tobacco companies . In response , Heitkamp said on the radio that she would likely refuse any such offer . She spoke of the importance of legislation regarding infrastructure , tax reform , and energy and farm policy . Heitkamp announced in a campaign press release in 2012 that she supports the Buffett Rule . Heitkamp was one of the chief architects of a bank deregulation bill that rolled back provisions of Dodd-Frank . After her election , however , she voted to filibuster a bill that would have made abortions illegal after the fifth month of pregnancy except when the mother 's life is endangered . When people look at her , they do n't see male or female . They see a very accomplished , qualified candidate . She 's very collaborative , very open to a different way of looking at things , uber smart . Heitkamp was less enthusiastic about Clinton by 2016 , in light of her email controversy and what Heitkamp perceived as Clinton 's turn to the left . And thank you very much , senator . About 1,330 of them opposed it . Heitkamp then announced her opposition to DeVos , attributing her decision to this overwhelming public reaction . In an April 11 , 2013 , interview , Heitkamp said that she intended to vote against the Manchin-Toomey amendment , which was introduced in the Senate after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting . ... in the end it 's not what any other senator believes . In December 2016 , Heitkamp told CNBC that although the Army Corps of Engineers had refused to approve permits needed to complete the Dakota pipeline , that would change under President-elect Trump . I would have a hard time figuring out how I would not say what I really thought at this point in my life . The Hill . The Hotline . Archived from the original on July 8 , 2012 .
