The Administration has failed to offer the federal assistance necessary to help law enforcement officers keep our communities safe and protect our families , workers , and ranchers . Protestors should be able to exercise their First Amendment right peacefully and lawfully , but in many cases now , that is n't what we 're seeing . For the past several months , Heitkamp and her staff have been meeting regularly with local law enforcement , land owners , workers , and residents about the Dakota Access pipeline protests . She has had continued conversations with the White House , Army Corps of Engineers , U.S. Department of Justice , and U.S. Department of Interior to push for a final decision on the easement going under Lake Oahe . She has also been working in a joint effort with the federal delegation and Governor Jack Dalrymple to push for federal funds to provide law enforcement with needed resources to support public safety during the ongoing demonstrations . powered by Disqus ga -LRB- ` send ' , ` event ' , ` Story Category ' , ` POVnow ' , ` Sen.
