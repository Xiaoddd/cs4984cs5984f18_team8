Sacred ground Inside the Dakota pipeline protests Story by Benazir Wehelie , Special to CNN Photographs by Larry Towell , Magnum Photos Photographer Larry Towell feels that what 's happening at the Oceti Sakowin Camp in North Dakota is about more than just an oil pipeline . People have been gathering at the camp for months now , demonstrating against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . Native Americans from across the United States have flocked to the Oceti Sakowin Camp to show their support for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe , which is protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . The Dakota Access Pipeline is a 1,172-mile underground conduit that would transport some 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day -- stretching across North Dakota , South Dakota , Iowa and Illinois . One of the main reasons it 's seeing such resistance is because the pipeline would run near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota . People are directly demonstrating against the federal government , mainly the US Army Corps of Engineers , which is the agency responsible for approving the pipeline . Photographer Larry Towell spent two weeks at the protesters ' camp in September . The Standing Rock Sioux say the pipeline would not only endanger their main source of drinking water -- the Missouri River -- but also their sacred tribal grounds . They feel they have not been properly consulted about the pipeline . Native Americans from across the United States , as well as environmentalists and activists from around the world , have all flocked to the camp in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux .

It seemed as if there were around 5,000 , he said . Solar panels are set up for those living at the protest camp . There are rules at the camp : no alcohol , no weapons , no drugs , for instance . And the majority of those demonstrating refer to themselves not as protesters , but as water protectors . In Native American tradition , a water protector is responsible for making sure the tribe has water . Towell said he did not see any violence , but there have been flareups . On November 20 , for instance , there were clashes between law enforcement and about 400 protesters , authorities said . Protesters march to the pipeline construction site . It 's no secret that the United States has battled Native Americans throughout history , taking tribes ' lands and forcing them into other areas . They 've been pushed out West , to the desert , to badlands , to desolate places , Towell says . It was only in 1924 that Native Americans were granted citizenship , and up until 1957 , some states had barred Native Americans from voting . The Standing Rock Sioux say the pipeline would not only endanger their main source of drinking water but also their sacred tribal grounds . Debates over lands , the destruction of sacred sites and the disrespect for Native American traditions are now coupled with issues of climate change and a heavy reliance on oil . Towell adds that there 's more than simply a physical clash taking place . There 's a clash of mentalities , too . Sweetgrass is a sacred plant for many Native Americans . One of the main arguments for the pipeline is that the oil produced will boost the economies involved . But while many people say oil is good for the economy , because it allows us to make cars and buildings , for example , Towell says Native Americans do n't think in this way . Cars and buildings are n't possible because we have steel for parts and cement for walls . They 're possible because we have iron ore and sand -- both of which come from the ground . It does n't come from the grocery store . It all comes from Mother Earth . A farm storage bin in Eagle Butte , South Dakota . The construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline , which water protectors refer to as the Black Snake , offends the character of the Native American people deeply , Towell says . That 's why even though North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple has ordered protesters to clear out before Monday -- citing harsh winter conditions -- demonstrators have no plans to do so .
