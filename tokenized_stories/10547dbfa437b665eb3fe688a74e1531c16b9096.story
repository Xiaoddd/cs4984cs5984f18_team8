This might seem long if you scroll through without reading to check how much commitment it will take to finish it , but I am writing my life story in a single document , and it might be just the medicine that you need on this day . If you want to find happiness and fulfill your destiny , I implore you , please read on . My life began as a poor painter . Not to discount my first 27 rotations around the sun . They , like the lives my spirit has lived before 1989 , were the perfect foundation for me to become who I am today . I was blessed in those 27 years with more than I can name in pages upon pages of writing . I will mention the most important blessing of my past life though : my family . A grateful heart is a happy heart . Photo by Matt Halvorson , November 2016 . It was Nov. 6 , 2016 . I had spent three months following the Water Protectors camping out in the Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota on social media , and listening quietly to the intellect of my heart -LRB- Thank you , Paul , for teaching me the words to express what I felt -RRB- . I can not name the amount of people who supported me in my endeavors to gather supplies for the Water is Life movement , but I can name Ricky , Shaina , and Candace as the three people who were willing to step away from the hustle of life and join me . As we gathered to leave and measured the immensity of the supplies , and the people that I offered a ride to in Missoula , MT -LRB- without having properly thought out the space in the vehicle -RRB- , Shaina and Candace offered to stay behind . Many thanks and my apologies for that lack of discretion . This article is not exclusively about Standing Rock , so I will resist going into detail of my time there , but I will say that after that first trip , I returned to Seattle to tie up loose ends , and returned to Standing Rock in mid-December with a caravan of people and supplies , prepared to live there as long as it took to defend the river from the continued disregard of its well-being demonstrated by the oil companies and the EPA . Photo by Matt Halvorson , November 2016 . Simply put , during my time there , I was shown the way . I was shown love just for being me , I was shown gratitude just for following my heart , and I was shown that love and gratitude are literally the basis of everything that matters . To me , it is no coincidence that while living outside , connected to the Earth , I came to know what matters in life , what the soul needs to thrive , and how to change the world . Inside , in the first chapter , I found much of the wisdom I have learned in the past year and a half reiterated from a different perspective . I came to this knowledge from connecting with elder natives and other loving beings , letting their wisdom sink into my soul ; Inside or outside of the Inipi , the sacred sweat lodge where the Lakota were taught to pray and communicate with their ancestors . I was brought to tears the first time I sweat -LRB- gratitude to the stones , Nate , and Mike for that experience -RRB- . In sub-zero temperatures , I began going to pray in the Inipi multiple times a week . Put simply , I came to know what I know from the ancient ways . Masaru Emoto came to this knowledge from a laboratory . It is serendipitous and revealing that the same lessons can be found by the old ways , or the new ways . The culmination of all knowledge and the answer to every question in life , I will reveal to you with no further ado : Mitakuye Oyasin , or We Are All Related . Mni Wiconi , or Water is Life . In recognizing those two truths , I find it to be of the utmost importance that we collectively take a stand for all of our relatives , and the sacred waters . Too long have we allowed greed to flourish . Too long have we ignored the warnings of those that have come before us . Our hearts will respond if we listen to them . We will feel infinite joy when we live in a good way . This is the era of living our fullest , highest truths . Welcome to paradise . When Masaru talks about happiness in his books , he talks about aligning ourselves with the Hado of happiness . He says three words that help to understand the Hado of happiness are Frequency , Resonance , and Similarity . All beings have a frequency , all things have a frequency . Modern society is built to withstand the pressure of spirit . It is designed , intelligently or not , to suppress your spirit . It is no wonder to anyone who meditates on it that we are unhappy , that we feel unfulfilled . I am not writing this to be discouraging , I am writing this to encourage all of us to be the change we wish to see in the world . I want us to all know that we matter , that we are loved , and that no matter where we are in our lives , it is never too late to begin anew . You can be happy , you can feel fulfilled , and you can make a difference in the lives of the generations of people who will come after you . Negative thinking breeds negative emotions . Positive thinking breeds positive emotions . I have personally found my calling in Permaculture , which is a regenerative system otherwise defined as Permanent Culture , and can be applied as a system to replace modern cultures , such as society , food , community organizing , etc. . You can grow food in a good way if you listen to the intellect of your heart and stay connected to the land you are working with . This is the topic of a book that I have been writing in my head for a couple of months : Natural ability is overplayed . It takes dedication to master anything . However , if you wake up one day knowing your calling , and pursue that calling with a dedication that is hard to come by at the speed that life whizzes by us , you will master it in much less than 10,000 hours . The same goes for all things , including growing food , cooking food , or drinking water -LRB- yes , I said it takes mastery to properly drink water -RRB- . That dedication can be found within the passion you feel for the ability you wish to master . Do not attempt to master a skill for the purpose of making money . That will likely take you 10,000 hours , and all you will have at the end , if you play your cards right , is money . In order to begin healing the Earth , we must first turn inwards and heal ourselves . There is much to unpack . We have been programmed . Programmed to believe that the Earth is simply a place that we live . I know neither of these things are true . Photo by Matt Halvorson , November 2016 . The American Dream never existed . Pulling oneself up by the bootstraps is misunderstood . None of us would exist if the cycles of Earth , Air , Fire and Water stopped suddenly . These are the things that matter . We are not on this Earth to survive . We exist on this Earth to thrive , to be beneficial organisms in the cycle of life . When we collectively realize these truths , we will have come to know a new era of human existence , and it is awakening within us in this very moment . How lucky we are to get to be the generations standing on the precipice , about to open up a whole new world and frequency of love . I believe that the volatility of the human soul is relatable to anyone . This means one must be empathetic towards those who have not reached the level of understanding that you have . When the movement at Standing Rock was dispersed , and I had time to reflect on the lessons I learned while continuing the labor of love of scraping the fat from Tatanka Oyate -LRB- Buffalo Nation -RRB- , I realized something that I had fought in my mind since being raised , more or less against my will , going to a Christian church : Prayer is Intention is Energy is Manifestation is Reality . The first thing that means is that prayer is real . The second is that your thoughts and intentions will transform into the energy , physically , emotionally , intellectually , that you put forth into the world . The third is that change always comes from within , and to change the world we live in , we must first have clear minds and strong hearts . What Masaru teaches is that water forms crystals of varying beauty based on different emotions , phrases and pictures put forth to the water . The most beautiful crystals are those that were shown love , while crystals that are shown ugliness , contempt , or the like are deformed . One of the hidden messages of water is to be the most beautiful embodiment of love and understanding in all things that you do . I am not a religious person , but I have found my spirituality thanks to the guidance I have received from the intellect of my heart . When we recognize ourselves and all beings as Gods and Goddesses , we will start to revere ourselves and our surroundings in a way that makes it possible to begin healing . My hope is that we collectively recognize that independence from the system and unnatural things is the beginning of healing ourselves . Food , Water and Community are the most important medicines in life . I implore you to stop drinking the tap water , there is free spring water not far from you , regardless of your location , and you can find it on findaspring.org . Do not feel guilt for being put into a position that requires you to drive a car , but consider the places you drive , and how much you can accomplish each trip in order to drive less . Do not feel guilt for being hungry for meat , but consider the amount of resources it takes to produce a pound of beef compared to what it takes to produce the same amount of food in vegetables , fruits or nuts , and eat less meat . Do not feel guilt if you have supported the chemical agriculture industry with your money , but do consider voting with your dollar for cooperative food organizations , farmers markets , Community Supported Agriculture deliveries and your lawns transformation into a garden . Do not feel guilt for having ignorance , but consider learning more . Do not focus your attention on the oppressors , but consider reaching out to the oppressed to offer a hand up . Do not focus on hate , but consider the intellect of your heart in all things . It will guide you to the connected nature of all beings .
