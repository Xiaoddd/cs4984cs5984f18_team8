The gathering culminated in a predictable communique , endorsed by Iran , which aims to strengthen a nominal ceasefire in place since 30 December . But other , more enduring , themes emerged from the gathering . Second , although the Assad regime is winning on the battlefield with the robust backing of Moscow and Iran , it has a relatively weak diplomatic hand . The long predicted moment when Russia will need to declare its intentions towards Bashar al-Assad is closer than ever . So too is a reckoning for the Syrian leader with his other patron , Iran , against whom Russia and Turkey have increasingly sided since Iranian-backed forces led the recapture of Aleppo . For the first time , Russia broke ranks with the Assad regime at Astana , chiding it for claiming that al-Qaida was leading an assault on the Wadi Barada area near Damascus , and suggesting that Iranian and Syrian forces , not the opposition , were breaching the ceasefire . It also overtly legitimised two groups that Syrian officials had long labelled as terrorists , the conservative Ahrar al-Sham and Jaish al-Islam , both significant components of the armed opposition . The collective messaging is clear : having secured the country and bombed the opposition to the negotiating table , Putin now wants a result that he can trumpet . And to do that when the US had tried and failed would be doubly satisfying . Russian officials believe Donald Trump will frame his Middle East policy solely through the lens of protecting Israel and defeating Isis , the latter of which he is likely to do in partnership with Putin and others . They also calculate that Trump has little interest in what drove the conflict originally and has sustained it since , leaving a resurgent Russia to impose its terms . They also kept the Kurds away and gave ground on Assad , saying his immediate removal was not central to a solution . This is a view that Russia still holds , despite its wavering language of late , the thrust of which was to put him on notice that he is dispensable if he wholeheartedly sides with Iran , which has a very different view of what postwar Syria should look like . Iran , in return , continues to accuse Turkey of fuelling the fighting and of supporting jihadis who have taken a central role in much of northern Syria . The optics of these talks were important to everyone involved . This was the first get-together for the warring parties in more than two years and , more importantly , the first time Syrian officials and opposition leaders have sat across the table from each other . The choice of venue was also instructive , away from the ordered calm of Nato-aligned western Europe and deep in the heart of the former Soviet bloc . The communique is largely aimed at the ongoing Wadi Barada fighting , which is taking place in an area that supplies water to Damascus . A trilateral mechanism , led by Turkey , Iran and Russia , is supposed to secure the ceasefire . The opposition and the regime refused to sign , but that matters less than its backers having done so . After an 18-month battering there is little fight left in the opposition and even less will among its backers to continue to support a conflict that is losing intensity . The opposition knows its bid to control Syria has failed . And Assad is on notice that having led efforts to save him , Russia now wants a solution in its name .
