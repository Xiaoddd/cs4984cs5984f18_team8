Following are additional resources on Native American history and resistance . But then the population began to grow again , as if a plant left to die refused to do so , began to flourish . By 1960 there were 800,000 Indians , half on reservations , half in towns all over the country . I learned to read from school books , newspapers , and the Bible . But in time I found that these were not enough . Civilized people depend too much on man-made printed pages . A Hopi Indian named Sun Chief said : I had learned many English words and could recite part of the Ten Commandments . I knew how to sleep on a bed , pray to Jesus , comb my hair , eat with a knife and fork , and use a toilet .

This became unpopular as the white population grew and wanted the fishing areas exclusively for themselves . A local judge the following year ruled that the Puyallup tribe did not exist , and its members could not fish on the river named for them , the Puyallup River .
