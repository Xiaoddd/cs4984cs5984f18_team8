Standing Rock : US denies key permit for Dakota Access pipeline , a win for tribe Army Corps of Engineers will not grant the permit for the Dakota Access pipeline to drill under the Missouri river , handing a major win to environmental activists by Julia Carrie Wong , The Guardian , December 4 , 2016 The Army Corps of Engineers will not grant the permit for the Dakota Access pipeline to drill under the Missouri river , the army announced on Sunday , handing a major victory to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribeafter a months-long campaign against the pipeline . The army corps will undertake an environmental impact statement and look for alternative routes , the tribe said in its own announcement . While the news is a victory , Jan Hasselman , an attorney for the tribe , cautioned that the decision could be appealed . For months , they have protested over their fears that the pipeline would contaminate their water source and destroy sacred sites , and over the weekend hundreds of military veterans arrived at the camps in a show of support for the movement . Sally Jewell , the secretary of the interior , praised the decision . The 1,1720-mile pipeline is slated to carry 470,000 barrels per day from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to a refinery in Illinois . Members of hundreds of other indigenous tribes answered their call to join in the struggle , resulting in the largest gathering of Native American tribes in more than a century . On Sunday , congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard joined the veterans at Standing Rock , where they planned to hold a prayer ceremony at the main encampment . Bookmark the permalink . 1 Comment .
