The announcement comes only two weeks after President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum instructing the Corps to expedite the permit . Your ongoing pressure has been essential in this fight so far . Act Today : Call Secretary of Defense James Mattis and urge him not to grant the easement without a full Environmental Impact Statement that properly consults the Standing Rock Sioux Nation and upholds treaty obligations . As a person of faith , I am deeply concerned about the well-being of the Standing Rock Sioux people . Granting an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline without first completing an Environmental Impact Statement circumvents an important legal process and jeopardizes the health and human rights of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . Because the Department of Defense has direct jurisdiction over the Army Corps , I urge Secretary Mattis to ensure that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers abides by the processes they set forth in December by completing a full Environmental Impact Statement , while properly consulting the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and honoring treaty obligations . Thank you . NOTE : As of 10 pm ET Tuesday , we heard the DOD voicemail box was full . Once you 've made your call to the Department of Defense , consider following up with a message to the Army Corp and Congress . You can use our tools to send them an email , Tweet or Facebook Post .
