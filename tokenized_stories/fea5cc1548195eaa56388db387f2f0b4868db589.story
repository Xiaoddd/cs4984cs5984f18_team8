The tribes had argued that having oil in proximity to their water supply interferes with their religious beliefs . Judge Boasberg said a later injunction to prevent oil from flowing through the pipeline was still possible but he would not block the pipeline itself while the lawsuits are pending . From the Associated Press : The tribes say the pipeline would endanger their cultural sites and water supply . They added a religious freedom component to their case last week by arguing that clean water is necessary to practice the Sioux religion . The next hearing in the case is set to take place on Feb. 27 . The developer of the pipeline , Energy Transfer Partners , had initially estimated the completion of the work would take 2-3 months . Meanwhile , about 300 protesters at a camp near the drilling site have refused to leave . However , the Army Corps of Engineers announced earlier this month that the land where the camp is located would be closed as of February 22 : The Corps issued notices today informing protestors of the closure of Corps-managed federal property adjacent to the Cannonball River . Soil erosion from a lack of vegetation cover will be exacerbated if flooding does occur , and could result in contaminated sediment runoff into the Cannonball River and Lake Oahe . Of course the protesters have been told to leave before . That was never going to happen under the Obama administration but now things have changed . Next week should be the final showdown at the protest camp , while the final showdown in court could come a week later . Stop bothering us . Perp shoots cop .
