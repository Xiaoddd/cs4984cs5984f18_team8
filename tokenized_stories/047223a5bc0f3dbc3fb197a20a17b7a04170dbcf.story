But a member of the Dineh Nation and the Yankton Dakota Sioux finds occasion for hope . An AlterNet Thanksgiving classic . Our people , she said , had been here much longer and taken much better care of the land . It was enough for me to know the difference . At six , I felt I had learned something very important . When Squanto , a Wampanoag man , found them , they were in a pitiful state . He spoke English , having traveled to Europe , and took pity on them . Their English crops had failed . They had already experienced European slave traders raiding their villages for a hundred years or so , and they were wary -- but it was their way to give freely to those who had nothing . Among many of our peoples , showing that you can give without holding back is the way to earn respect . It was believed that by giving there would be enough for all -- the exact opposite of the system we live in now , which is based on selling , not giving.To the Pilgrims , and most English and European peoples , the Wampanoags were heathens , and of the Devil . They saw Squanto not as an equal but as an instrument of their God to help his chosen people , themselves.Since that initial sharing , Native American food has spread around the world . Nearly 70 percent of all crops grown today were originally cultivated by Native American peoples . I sometimes wonder what they ate in Europe before they met us . Within 20 years European disease and treachery had decimated the Wampanoags . Most diseases then came from animals that Europeans had domesticated . Cowpox from cows led to smallpox , one of the great killers of our people , spread through gifts of blankets used by infected Europeans . Some estimate that diseases accounted for a death toll reaching 90 percent in some Native American communities . The story of that heart is the real tale than needs to be told . We have seen the evil that it caused in the 350 years since . I believe it must be each of us . Indeed , when I give thanks this Thursday and I cook my native food , I will be thinking of this hidden heart and how my ancestors survived the evil it caused.Because if we can survive , with our ability to share and to give intact , then the evil and the good will that met that Thanksgiving day in the land of the Wampanoag will have come full circle.And the healing can begin .
