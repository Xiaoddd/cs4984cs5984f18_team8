The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America The Collapse of The American Dream Click here to view the breakdown of the Fortune 500 , from how much they made compared to how many people they employ . The activist communities have a lot of problems with them and it is now time to talk about that 900 pound gorilla in the room . There are problems with most of you that there are solutions for . These stories are recent , yet ones that have happened throughout the history of protesting against capitalism . Hopefully you will see some solutions here . I say pleasure because those activists are just like all the other activist groups all over the country : young , dumb and full of you know what . The reason why I was at this yearly Action Camp , is another story . They were there to stop the Shell Oil ice breaking ship Fennica , from making a journey to the Arctic region to become the first and only oil company to attempt to drill for oil in that area . That aggravates me , and it should you too . Anyway , I was there as well . This was to be my first action in a year . and brought it to different flea markets up and down the West Coast . I lived for many months in Las Vegas . Not that I gambled , but it is a very inexpensive city to live in with a lot of entertainment to go around . Plus people I know were always coming through town . Business was getting busy . I spent 30 hours a week at market , while spending another 40 hours a week just producing the product . So I mostly just ate , slept and worked . Those things are as unCON-stitutional as they come . I came home from market one Friday night and their they were . Lucky for me -LRB- I say lucky because any interaction I will have with a cop will end up in my arrest -RRB- the roadblock was set up on a one-way stretch of the road and it was set up on the other side of the entrance I had to enter into . I have never had to stop at a DUI checkpoint , but I know it will be ugly if I ever do . I knew what they wanted , me . Not so much to catch me driving with something wrong , because there would be nothing wrong , but to get me to go out there and live stream it , which I would have done if not serious about my retirement . And yet , even though I was enjoying a retirement far removed from the risks of being arrested for doing the right thing , I still kept up with what the world was up to . Most of the people I know look at me as if I am strange for watching the news , but I tell them , knowledge is power . I was 250 miles away , so I blew it off , but sent a reply telling the Backbone Campaign that if I maybe had another 24 hour notice I probably would have went . I met Bill and some of his group from the Backbone Campaign when I was at the Occupy National Gathering in Kalamazoo , Michigan , in 2013 . I have been on their mailing list ever since . With all that in mind , I pulled up stakes and drove up to Portland . The main reason for my going to Portland was that my body was rejecting my retirement , in that , I could not enjoy myself no matter where I was or whom I was with . No matter where I was , or what I was doing , I could not enjoy life as it should be . So with that in mind , I considered coming out of retirement for the betterment of the world . I was retiring on the west cost and this seemed like a novel idea . I spent a lot of time avoiding women to focus on the revolution . Now , I was feeling lonely enough to the point that I was telling a good friend that I would probably end up marrying the next -LRB- or first -RRB- girl to talk to me . Whatever her pleasure , I was in . If it was to sit it -LRB- the shit hitting the fan -RRB- out and travel as lovers till the end , then so be it . If it was to fight for this revolution and she was to be a big part of it , then let it be written . And even though I have the fuck palace from hell , I never used it to get with the many ditzy , and awestruck , women who go to these events . Let me ask you something . That is the truth . We were so into our egos that we -LRB- brothers and sisters -RRB- acted upon them , forgetting why we were all there in the first place . You can add to that the confusion started in the ranks by the COINTELPRO infiltration . And even though we of that generation know that to be the reasons of our defeat , whenever we tried to educate Occupy about that , those voices fell on deaf ears . I saw a lot of it and I saw it mess up plans that were made but never carried out because of one of those three things . Those were not the only reasons . Those were just results from the egos that helped to deteriorate the movement . There was one other ; the 1970 shootings at Kent State University , in Ohio . That really killed the movement . It really was at that point that we threw up our hands and surrendered . And Pat laughs about it . That is exactly how they put down the Occupy movement . They attacked 15 cities with violence in one night , arresting everyone including news reporters and stealing everything they could find . After that it was like , see ya later . I also saw the same thing at Occupy Orlando . It was the violence portrayed on the Occupy protesters that really broke up the movement . So for the first time my intentions were to maybe hook up with a female that could travel with me as a lover for either reason and to see how far these activist groups were willing to go to do what really had to be done to save the planet . I was at that time thinking that the activists were never going to get together to do what really has to be done . I was at the point where I was indifferent to it all . I had finally embraced futility , so I was game for either personality -LRB- attitude -RRB- any lover would have , should I meet her . I wanted to meet a like minded woman to share the little time left on this earth with , or to start the revolution with . I had to see where they were in the revolution . The real reasons , the root causes of all this is capitalism , greedy children and corrupt governmental servants . There has been so much thrown out there about ending both the government and capitalism . Like those in politics were just going to listen to people too scared to even try to throw them out of office and replace them with more humane people . If that were the fact there would be no need for the Stock Act . There is no such thing as a nonviolent action . ALL governments are violent . They have to be to be a government . A government does not exist until the people making up the so-called government take a pledge to use violence to get their way . Without that there is just anarchy and no one can get another to do what they say . It is at that moment you must realize that any one , or group of people , who would tell another person -LRB- or entity -RRB- what to do or not do has to be willing to back that up with the threat of , and final use of , violence , a.k.a. force . Otherwise , all their demands come down to are idol requests . The one that is willing to use violence , force , Shell Oil via the United States Government in this case , wins . It is business as usual , until the groups again find something to bitch and complain about and so on and so on until the planet is dead . They may come as nonviolent , but those that come to stop them will use violence , a.k.a. a show of force , to stop them . You activist groups know what the real problem is and the solution to it , yet you are all afraid to admit to yourselves and each other what the root cause , the real problem that brings you together , is and what yo have to do to stop it . Name the cause you are fighting for and what you just read in the previous sentence is the reason the problem exists . In order to get rid of your problem , the only solution , the only thing that will make it go away for good , is all out revolution against capitalism and those in the government . They did a big one in Seattle , known as the Paddle in Seattle , earlier in 2015 . Not my exact type , but very cute and close enough . After smiles we began to talk . Her kayak partner and mine both wanted to be on the red team and this was not my cause , as I wanted to just do the revolution and be done with it , so I was yella . We just switched them and us around and would go out on my kayak together . After naps , we were all getting ready to go out around 3 am , when much to our surprise , we noticed people repelling from the bridge - eleven in all . There were about 5 or 6 different activist groups there from Green Peace to the kayaktivists . We came in after sunrise and then hung out together for a while , but not before she actually shot this pic from our boat , which later went viral . She was really cute , but with tattoos and a child . I feel very sad for the children who have to go through life without a father , because , is often the case , the mother and father were together for lust and not for love . These feelings continue to manifest as long as the two parents have to deal with each other when dealing with their children . And the kids pick up on this . The resentment they must feel towards everyone . Not me . So , rule number one of being my type is to not have any children living at home . She had one , and an ex , so I proceeded with caution . The tattoos I could overlook and even not being a redhead I could live with . I know my maximum happiness . Her daughter needs to be with both parents . Unfortunately for her , the child comes first and the world will just have to wait for it to grow up before we see more of her . Friends would be fine with me . I wanted in , but not at the expense of breaking her heart . She sure did leave me a lot of lines to run with ; places where I could have gotten her to fall as sweet on me as I was on her . But I held my tongue . Soon , though , she had to leave for home to get a quick nap and retrieve her little girl and the child she was a nanny for . I meat a lot of the local activists there - people who are even running for mayor of Portland . The see was electric . People really thought they were there for the right cause , even though they got there by burning oil and oil products . They had an oversized banner that was floating near the shore . It was in two sections and had to be 10x60 when together . The Kayaktivist , an idea of the Backbone Campaign , had figured out that the only way to stop the oil was to use the same oil in its campaign to stop the oil . Some of these local activists , however , are still a little lost . -LRB- Even Steven Molyneux , feels the same way as me . But this little girl seemed well behaved and slightly enlightened . Then they all disappeared . Children , always getting in the way . We would text each other often . Earlier that morning , before she got the children , she was throwing down some hints for me to grab on to , but I was weary about the circumstances of her single mother status . I let them slide by . But as we texted in the afternoon , she told me her appointment was an overnight one and that she would see me tomorrow . A change in plans , sort-of . That evening the action had exploded . We were about 300 strong , the lead on the national news and talk of the cable news networks . The ship approached the bridge , but then turned around . They were calling it a blockade . I had to inform my special love interest . I sent her a text telling her the news . and to go there . She had problems getting that with her phone . She told me how beautiful the moon looked -LRB- it was almost full -RRB- that night and thanked me for keeping her in the loop . She loves to do word play , so I did one using her name in it . A couple of hours later , things started to heat up . The police were now prohibiting cars and boats from entering the parking lot . I was already there camping out , but that morning the mayor put his foot down . Everyone was running around . I sent a text telling her about that and how I was thinking of going to city hall to give a speech on the action that I was up all night writing . She was very disappointed that she was not there . I asked her if she was going to be able to get to the action . She seems nice , everyone seems nice when you first meet them , but the child . Okay , if it is going to happen it is just going to be a moment in time shared between two adults . A couple of hours later she sends me two more texts wondering if there was anything we could do to get more people there and keep them there . Whoa , a project . I responded by stating that the police had stood down and we were taking back control of the park . She was excited . The Coast Guard had given their first warning . I relayed that message to her . She responded in a very excited way , with the help of emocons , that she was on her way . When I told her we would go out as soon as she got here , she stated that she was bringing along a few people for the action and asked if there were any loaner kayaks around . I told her there was the last I looked and that I was going to my bus to take a quick nap in the air-conditioning . It was over 100 degrees outside . We delayed this ship from leaving by a couple of days . They later gave up searching for oil , stating that they could not find anything of profitable quantity . But I think that is a lie . No . I think they might have found a lot , but the price at the moment is too low for the profit , so they said there was nothing there so no one else tries to explore and will return when it is more profitable . But then it happened . The repellers on the bridge were all tied together in a fashion that if anyone tried to pull one of them up , the rest of them would fall . That would render a very dangerous situation for the other ten and the crime of being culpable for what ever happens to them for whoever did that . There was one catch , however , there was one person in particular that the authorities could pull on , that the others would be safe . That afternoon the fire department , under the orders of the mayor I would presume , got a couple of the Green Peace repellers off the bridge and physically held two others back so the ship could get under them and go through . I was asleep when it started . I was taking a quick nap in my RV . The ship was approaching and stopped about 100 yards from the bridge and Greenpeace activists . I looked for my boat , but someone ganked my pfds out of it . There were only one or two other boats on shore , but no PFDs in either of them . The river was filled with kayaks , Coast Guard and county police boats . I took out my hand held computer and began to live stream . The sister had asked if she and a friend could use the boat since I was running around . I told her sure , as long as she could find PDFs for her and the friend . I also told her I was going on the local news , live , for an interview . She wished me luck and I went running around some more . I was on the other side of the bridge from where the activists were gathered and from were we launched the boats from . Over there was also a dock , but no boat launch . This dock was loaded with well-wishers cheering on the Kayaktivist and Green Peace repellers . There was also a couple there from Alaska . They were cheering for the other side . People , including myself , were asking them questions . I wanted to know how they could cheer for the destruction of our planet . They said Shell gave them one thousand dollars . So , the money talks and bullshit walks . Only what we are doing is not bullshit . This is a very serious problem . That couple was driving me crazy and the dock was leaning into the water from all the people on it . It was four , four thirty . I left to find the news people and do the interview . Now when they first asked me if I would be willing to do a live on camera interview , I was hesitant . But then I thought . I was having a tiff with a compatriot from Occupy San Diego . So I thought about it . If I did this interview , I could slip in www.usatakeover.com . That was why I agreed . The interview went fine and I left to go to the other side of the bridge , by the kayaks , to see if my special lady friend had gotten there yet . When I got there my boat was missing and she sent me a text that they had found some PFDs and were on the water evading the police . Her daughter was on the beach with her sister . The ship broke through , however , and she was coming ashore as the action was now over . Ouch . Well , there goes that idea . Wonder what happened . Soon , I sort of found out . Just Chris . I thought her rush to get out to be a little strange . Oh , it gets worse . She and the guy brought the boat over to the launch where I met up them . Chris went to her car and we walked back to where they came ashore to meet up with her sister and daughter . As we were walking together she came out with it . No way , if that were the fact she would have mentioned him from the start . My response should tell me . I explained that I was hoping to hook up with her . All she did was reiterated that Chris was her man . We came upon her daughter and said see ya later to each other . Walking up to where the crowd had been gathering and where all the news vans were , I began to wonder . Okay , a little confusion . If she came back empty handed I would have never known that this man existed and then maybe who knows what might have happened . She had quite the twinkle in her eye . But the tattoos , single motherhood , great body though , I could tell she was trying to second deal her man for someone richer to take care of her and her child . And she thought that I would fall for it . I should have asked her wtf she was thinking . Back at the news vans , I began to get a little aggravated . What B had just done put me over the edge . I had also let down my friend from OSD . There were hundreds of people just waiting around to see the police clash with the protesters . The activists who were really trying to make a change were on one side of the bridge , while the spectators were on the other , off the dock . I got mad . I yelled out to the group of people sitting on the grass , news cameras included , that this was not a victory for the activists as the ship got through the barricade . I screamed out how Bernie Sanders is going to do nothing to stop this and he could either suck my d or c , not sure which , and yelled out the url for USA TAKEOVER . I was pissed . One camera focused in on me . After that , I put it to rest and went back to wallow in our defeat , which everyone was calling a victory . Later that day and into the evening , B and her man disappeared . That was beat , I thought we made a fine connection . Plus I was suspicious . But within ten minutes they were gone and without a good-bye . I later sent her a text talking about her man and telling her how great it still was to have met her and that in our circles we will probably see each other again . I kept it very friendly even though I know she was trying to second deal her man . He helped to put the defeat into perspective when he came ashore with B. I was bitching about how they gave up too easily and I was willing to stay 6 weeks if necessary . He put it another way . I thought his words of the reasons to be true and thanked him through B for that . Loser . The next day it was quite . Most were gone as the action was over . It was time to clean up . One thing I did was to go out with two others on the Backbone motor boat and bring in the giant plastic banner that was floating nearer to the shore . It took nearly ten of us to pack it up . During the clean up I asked those helping if anyone wanted a cold water . One of the activists there , a bull dyke who drove an American gas-guzzler , asked me if it was in a glass or out of a plastic bottle . This action was taking place in Portland , during the hottest days of the year . I told her that until some genius comes up with something to replace those plastic bottles with , the bottles were here to stay . I explained how very convenient they were . I know there are islands of those plastic bottles the size of Road Island , floating around the Pacific Ocean , but with education and research , we should be able to handle the problem a little better then we are now . We need smarter people in the government to make all this happen . I asked her what the solution was . Rather than answer , she just threw another attitude my way . This woman had been avoiding me all day long and now she was yelling at me for inquiring about a solution . Come to think of it , most of the folks there were giving me the cold shoulder . Night before too . Anyway , I asked her what her solution was for the oil burning cars like the one she has . Now I got a solution if anyone ever asked me that question . I just wanted to see if she is serious about solutions and knew of any , or if she is just bitching and protesting due to her white guilt . Now I know bull dykes are all made by the men , usually their fathers , who raped them as children and possibly through high school . That girl was transformed into a bull-dyke . They hate all men , so much so that they try their hardest not to look attractive to any man . But I have been doing this shit for 25 years . I asked her how old she was and she said 33 . Too bad , I tell it like it is . She even told me to leave , like she had some kind of authority over me . I laughed at her and told her no . If you ask me , she just needs to get laid . After leaving the area , I went to the Oregon coast to camp out in my RV and complete repairs that needed to be undertaken . It was very nice and located directly across the street from the beach and hardly a half-mile from Haystack Rock . I took a picture of it and sent it to B , to see if she wanted a vacation . I wanted to show her there was no hard feelings . But I guess she was embarrassed beyond belief . I mean , she was busted cold trying to second deal her man . But she never answered me back and that bummed me out . What bummed me out was that she ignored me like we never met . I had my RV to repair . So the vacation offer was for her , for whatever she wanted . I know , foolish of me , but we really had a connection before the boyfriend and I wanted to see how far she wanted to go . So I wanted to see if that was her thoughts as well and if she also wanted to hook up . I guess I found out . I spent the week repairing the RV with another camper at the park and then left for Portland , to pick up an activist for a trip up to Vashon Island , west and across the river from Seattle . It cost something like 2 or 300 hundred bucks to attend . plus it cost me around 130 or 40 dollars just to get my rig on the ferry for the rid over to the island . There are no bridges , but they are building a tunnel . You activists are all full of shit . Every revolutionary is an activist , but not every activist is a revolutionary . But your biggest Achilles Heal , is your reliance on lairs ... I mean lawyers . You guys and your scam that you want to do good in the world . Either way , I see too much scheming going on at these actions - both by the brothers and the sisters . Activism for Sex : A few days into the camp , while I was at one of the teach-ins , I saw B sitting in the crowd . She looked so cute . After the lecture I called out to her , but she just kept on walking out of the barn . But there was no reply . I thought I saw her later that night and next day , then I figured out the following day that it was her , she was there , and she was getting very friendly with the other guys there while ignoring me . This is an old Cointellpro trick from the sixties . This aggravated me so much that I had to make a call out to find myself some indica . At least to me . Not cool . I just ignored her as she did me . So when you people show up with the intentions of getting promiscuous with different people every night to the point where there are disputes , and I have heard of some and saw another argument over this , you really confuse the fuck out of us people just there to work . And you make me think about Mark Kennedy . There was talk going on all night at the fires about people doing just that ; I forget what they called it . It just sounded like another name for swinging to me . It was the mucky mucks just trying to impress the newbees with even more shit to get them into bed . I did hear that at the fire . Perfect for people not in monogamous relationships . She is just going to be with Chris until something better comes along . This poor guy spends his time at sea working , adding to the pollution , to give this girl money to buy the planet with and she is playing him of a fool . This has to end so we can tell whom the real Cointelpro agents are amongst us . I wanted so to tell the brothers that were talking to her about how I knew her , but I just kept quiet while in the camp and vented only at my bus . And I never told anyone who it was . I sat him , bitch , on the back of my motorcycle and headed for the get-together . He kept wiggling his way up front , pushing his man parts into my back . I had to tell him to chill out , sit back and enjoy the ride , which he did , but here he is and there is now a new twist . There was this other sister there , a member of the Backbone Campaign , that I kind of had my eye on , but quickly dismissed thinking she was either too young , not available or not interested . Plus I am very shy . I do let people be activists . But I still had an eye on her . I thought maybe we could hook up on the last night of the camp . I watched her to see whom , if anyone , she may have been with . I never let it distract me , I just kept notice of things . I am after all a cultural anthropologist . Then I see this guy I thought was gay kissing on her . Come to find out , they had been dating off and on for over five years . While speaking with her , I look at her hair and saw some gray strands . She was obviously older than I thought and this made me even more interested in her . But again , would she , blah , blah , blah . This brother was moving into town and I think he expected to hook up again with this sister . He sure tried his hardest to cock block anyone else from being with her that week . The way you guys depend on the lawyers makes me realize that we might as well just get on with our lives until the day the earth shows her dissatisfaction with us . This is a major reason why I went into retirement . When I was in the park at Occupy Orlando , there were lawyers there that everyone looked up to . There was one guy there that made everyone feel he was on their side . You run to these lawyers and they appear to help while at the same time keeping the wool pulled over your eyes . This particular OO lawyer mentioned above , Shayan Elahi , was a democrat running for state office . He was just there to campaign and get some folks to work for him ; probably for free too . Most of the activist at the Occupy Orlando encampment were democrats disillusioned at the job O Bomb A was doing with prosecuting banksters , which was nothing . Most of these folks never protested anything ever in their lives . This lawyer handled our first trespassing trial in the Orange County Court . As if that really made a difference . The others soon learned . At trial was an 18-year-old college student . Her crime , being in a public park between the hours of 11 pm and 7 am . The courtroom had a large crowd . After jury selection we broke for lunch . After lunch the courtroom was packed and the scene looked completely different . Local news crews came out for the Occupy Trial . It was big news . They set up the cameras during lunch , after which the courtroom filled up , especially with other lawyers that were going to be defending some of the other defendants for the same arrest at a future date . This was just the first of them . They were all there to take notes . When the jury was brought in their eyes opened wide . They thought this to be a simple misdemeanor trespass case , but when they came back from lunch they knew then and there just how important this case was to everyone . Some of the jury never heard of the Occupy movement , so this was to be an education . During the trial the bailiff kept telling people to be quiet for whispering and even ejected a few of them from the courtroom . Someone sitting next to me started whispering in my ear and this same jerk came over to me and quietly told me to leave the court . This guy was pissing me off with his attitude towards the others . You could go back and listen to the trial or they even got it on the local news . The trial stopped and I was escorted out into the hall and told not to come back . No way . This case was lost before lunch . There was no way I was gong to be made to feel guilty for this . Testimony continued the next day . A few others and myself were bared from the courtroom , plus there really was no room for anyone to get in . One of the OO members was a member of the press . He sometimes writes articles for the Huffington Post or INFO Wars . He knew the combination to the media room . There were other members of the press in there as well . We all watched together . The trial was bullshit . I knew it was lost yesterday before lunch . That would add a nice twist to the proceedings . I brought something like that up at my jaywalking trial . The judge and I had a 20-minute debate over that subject . Scared her so much it took her three and a half weeks to render a decision and only at my nagging . He has to hide the bullshit that the government does or be disbarred and prohibited by them from practicing law to make a living . Not only that , but we heard him lie to the jury . I forget what it was he said , but when he said it , myself and the others looked at each other in disbelief at what had just said . Again , a liar ... I mean a lawyer , does his job . But his bullshit defense was that she could not hear the officer give the order to vacate the park . Bull crap . They all knew what they were doing , but rather then take the arrest and stand on their first amendment right to do so , they get this liar to represent them at trial and blew it . This law that everyone was arrested for should never have been a law . It was right next to interstate four , in-between that , an abandon radio station , a very large hotel and the chamber of commerce building . There is no one living around there for blocks . And second , these people who were arrested were there exorcising their first amendment guarantee to peacefully assemble and petition their government for a redress of grievances ; right in a public place , out of view of any neighborhoods . And the lawyers would not argue that . After the trial we were gathered at the courthouse entrance , when a juror walked by and stopped to talk to us . They acquitted on one of the charges , but convicted on the city trespassing charge . This juror stopped and thanked us for the work we all were doing . She had no idea that this movement was even happening and said she would plug in . I asked her why she convicted . How stupid . I knew during voir dire , a.k.a. jury selection , that this case was lost using the lawyer . More like dictating to them . I knew it was lost before lunch , but I stayed for the dog and pony show anyway . Yeah , Elahi knew I blew it for him . Asshole . You activists , rather then fight the law , you fight the facts . Of course she was in the park . Everyone in that park held hands and vowed to take all of the arrests to trial . That fact was not in dispute . What was in dispute was a law telling the public they can not peacefully gather on public land for first amendment protected activities at certain times . The first amendment says there is no law they can make to prohibit that . But you guys are just scared . The judge sentenced this convicted trespasser to six months probation with the promise to take this off her record if she is a good girl for six months and pays her probation . And it was that fact that had everyone pleading out ; that , and an NLG lair named Roger Weeden , this guy was my nemesis ... well , one of them . Weeden was a liar ... I mean lawyer , given to us by the National Lawyers Guild , NLG . They are not there to teach you of the fraud and help you fight it . The Occupy movement had and still has many NLG lawyers working for them . Hell , we took over 9,900 arrests nation wide in 2011 alone , two of which were mine . No one , the other was in 2012 . This guy though ... He was in the audience at least on the first day of the first trial . In fact , even that particular brother took a deal rather than fight the good fight . Weeden , just talked them all into surrender ; all but one . A friend of mine at the time , Krik Root , had Roger as a lawyer . He was the only one pushing for a trial even after this young girl was convicted . Everyone else was taking deals to avoid trial . Not my buddy though , he believed in my methods , yet continued using Roger for other aspects of the case . And the city was in no hurry to take Kirk to trial . After the hearing , Weeden and I had it out in the hall . He started yelling at me saying I knew nothing of law and he would have me arrested for practicing law without a license . I invited that to happen . He knew I was the one behind trying to get everyone to argue the law and not the facts and the reason why Kirk would not take a deal . I left the building with my friend , but I knew Roger had it out for me . Kirk had to be back in court for his trial in a couple of days . We drew up a Power of Attorney contract , got it witnessed and notarized , then went to the trial together . I had a feeling that Roger was going to do something to try to stop me from representing Kirk . In that couple of days , I think they were emailing each other and Roger may have been talking about withdraw . Definitely not the first or second or even third time that has happened to me in a courthouse . Just part of the job description . I was there to represent Kirk . He had the paperwork to file with the court and was called in immediately following my ejection from the hall . Inside , Weeden quit and Kirk fired him . He told the judge that he had something he wanted to file with the court . He gave a copy of our signed POA contract to the prosecution and the original to the court and it was filed . After more questions from the judge , the trial was put off for another month . Outside the courthouse , I had grabbed a spot on the curb by the side of the road , directly in front of the courthouse since I was now prohibited from going on the property . I was there for about 15 minutes , in full view of any and all cameras . One of the OO members saw me half way through and asked me if I wanted anything from the coffee shop . I said no and she left for the store . After standing there for 15 minutes I was met by three officers who worked for the court . One started asking me questions I told them I was not on the courthouse property , I was on a sidewalk , a thoroughfare , just off and above the street . A couple of minutes later , as I try to walk away , these jerks arrest me -LRB- view here -RRB- for trespassing . I am arrested , brought in and sent to jail where I had to pay a ransom in order to get back to my things . I had to get out of jail . Myself and a couple others , one of which was Krik , were taking a trip up to D.C. in the morning to meet with other activist . I was going there to personally meet with an activist after seeing him get arrested on the steps of congress . I had to go make sure he had his fighting strategy correct . I had to stop him from getting too involved with the NLG . We were staying at the Peace House , an activist house founded by an old friend and mentor of mine , William Thomas , or just Thomas as he was known . He was the man who lived in that tent directly across from the White House , for 30 years , doing apeace vigil in protest of nuclear weapons . Al Jazeera even did a documentary on him . The activist I went to meet was actually staying there for a few months . But I was in jail . My friends were there to bail me out hours before I got there . As soon as I arrived and processed through I got to leave , but the process was not that easy . At the jail , the officer who processed me in was saying how proud he was of what Occupy was doing . It was my second time there , but he was really talking about the Tim Osmar case , which I was a very large part of . Tim had done everything as orchestrated by me . He was following my advice , while others were voicing opposition to it . His liar wrote up a complaint , I rewrote it , he rewrote my rewrite , I rewrote that one and the next one as well before the lawyer kicked myself and three others off the suite . We chuckled over what Occupy was doing . I was later told to sit in a common area . We had to sit there until we got check by medical and shit like that . Something was going on though , these guys were jerking me off , trying to provoke me . What assholes . Bail was probably already posted , but they just kept me in that cold cell , alone , just to piss me off . I got out , went to D.C. with my friends and that changed my life as I was asked to be a running mate for president in the 2012 election , but another page with that . These lawyers are going to keep our movements down . No matter what these causes are the root reason that they exist is capitalism and those in the government . They know if they did that the joke about what you call a hundred lawyers at the bottom of the ocean would no longer be a joke . Because it might happen when you all wake up and realize they have been fucking you and our causes over for a very long time . He was a man who is a heavy hitter in the activist community . They must make a lot of money off it too . It was only set up in 2013 , riding off the backs of the Occupy movement . He has a real big ego over it as well . He was this and that for this and them since 1980 . In fact , I think I may have met him during the nineties at The Compound , when I was living and working there on the pot issue . He may have even been involved in one of our Atlanta Pot Festivals for all I know . One afternoon , at lunch , he decided to lay into me . His name was Kevin Zeese . We were sitting across from each other at lunch and he and his ego were talking it up with the crowd . He started talking about the TPP . I had just heard that day from a contact , someone that knows and had worked with Kevin Zeese on the TPP , that the TPP was dead in the water . When I mention what I had heard that morning he almost went off . He started saying that she was wrong . I figured he would know more than her , and sometimes she does repeat things that have been confirmed , so I told him I would contact her and tell her what he just said . When I did , she did say it was one thing and not another , so I knew she was incorrect in her assertion to me that morning . Kevin turned to talking about the Trump campaign , saying that it was nothing but a joke only there to give Hillary a boost . I told him that he sounded like a Fox News pundit , that Donald was for real and he better start checking on history for that . Everyone in 2007 thought Hillary was the winner . All the pundits were saying she was . No matter how much support O Bomb A gained , Hillary was still going to win . Ray-Gun was a movie star . Trump is little considered an outsider by the politicians , but to the common folk , he is . The republicans put Bush Jr. into office ... twice . The writing is on the wall . Anyone could see it . But he took offense to all that stating to me and all who were listening to us that Trump was a joke and would be out soon . The next day we were sitting in a lecture when the person speaking asked everyone to raise their hands if they thought that the Trump campaign is a joke . No one raised their hand . You can view it here . He started telling me that I have had an attitude all weekend long . Same shit I heard from Roger Weeden . What a jerk . Like Weeden . But I just kept my cool , took it all in , then went back to my rig to disappear and find some pot , indica , to calm me down with . You activists are all following the wrong game plan . In every cause , be it pot , oil , Monsanto , banks , Black Lives Matter , the whales , the baby seals , no matter what , there are people who are suffering because your causes exist . That makes no sense . If you had just gotten arrested and clogged up the courts with trials on each and every one of your causes the world would be a better place by now - especially if the Occupy movement took all 9900 arrests to trail . But you guys fall short in the real battle . The arrest is just a squirmish , the court battle is the real fight . That is where you make that stand . He had committed a felony by buying land at auction he could not pay for . The feds were auctioning off some BLM land that was being sold off for oil exploration . Millions of acres of our national forests up for bid . Tim outbid all the oil companies to win all the lands . This was a fraud and fraud is a felony . But he saved the forest . They had to send him to jail and they never got to sell the land . He did two years . Now , the feds have stopped the sail of the lands . That is how you really win at saving the earth , or your rights , or even your dignity . This is a brother with guts . Just hope he brought it to trial . Let me show you another instance of how these lawyers will screw us all over . Take the MICATS , The Michigan Coalition Against Tar Sands , case . Back in 2013 , four MICATs were arrested for locking themselves to a bulldozer . Now , the biggest frustration with this case , for me personally , was that one of arrestees wanted to use this lair ... I mean lawyer , who screwed me out of exposing the government of the City of Hazel Park , Michigan ; an NLG lair and federal title 42 lawyer . Get it . It was uncomfortable seeing her there in court . Bird , the basest for Rare Earth . He and his wife were in trouble for fighting with their neighbors . I even said something like that when he was in ear shot and got a reaction from him . Anyway , the four pledged to take this all the way , but when it came time for trial the line up changed . A brother by the name of William Michael Lawrence , decided that he wanted to go it alone . Because his parents were both lairs ... I mean lawyers and he is either going to , or in , law school . Yuck . I think they were corporate lawyers . Lawyers ... humph . He never showed up for anther courtroom preceding . Not even for support . You guys need to stop being so high and mighty , as you all seem to be . Even the lawyers are using these causes to get laid . The lawyers are the new rock stars . Rock and Roll baby . If you can all accept that fact that the real reason why pot is illegal , or they kill baby seals , or they genetically modify our food , is capitalism and those running our government , then you can begin to heal . So get with it . Stop trying to fuck everything that comes along when there are those of us who just want to stop something bad from happening . Join the revolution and this New World . You need to get your heads out of your asses and start teaming up with each other . Now the fight here is for the tax rates , products or quantity you can sell or buy or what time the stores can be open . So the fight continues . And the lawyers allow it . Only then will we know true peace . Activism for Dollars - The Drug : There was something that I realized at the camp , which I embarrassingly have to admit I really had no grasp of . That is the fact that a lot of these guys do this full time . Not like me . They really get paid to do this type of work full time . For some this is their regular job . This was all something that had totally slipped my mind and it made me start to realize things about a lot of these groups . At the Compound , in Atlanta , during the nineties , no one paid us . We paid for it to survive . Even when we were the International Artist Guild , Inc. and I was vice president , I never got a salary from the organization . We threw large house parties with multiple kegs of beer to raise money for rent and supplies . But everyone at the house had a job in the private sector . All the work we did there was volunteer . There was one person who worked for Jimmy Carter at the Carter Center , located directly behind the Compound . She worked personally with him on the NAFTA bill . This practice had an adverse effect and the film ran into a little production troubles . In fact , one scene took two or three days to shoot . On the first day of shooting one of the house mates was standing in one position on the set . In this scene the union soldiers were having a trial inside a confederate prison . He was a union prisoner . This is a true and horrifying story . The next day of shooting he was sitting in another location , after they were all told to take up the positions from the day before . So as you watch the scene he seems to jump from one spot to another . Ha . Anyway , everyone there , other then me at first , had employment . I had to feed myself , but often ate in the house with the group . In that school bus I had my brand new 286 computer and I wrote and did research anytime there was nothing else that needed to be immediately done around the house and I was awake . Not on your life . The Backbone Campaign , the people who were hosting this event , have no real backbone at all . It is just one of those organizations where the folks that run it , well , that is their full-time job . I have no idea where the money comes from . Probably donations from rich people who want to start some trouble . All I know is that there are several people on the payroll . I believe one of them to be that sister who dates that brother that hit on me in 2013 . Not only that , but also another observation I had was that these people are not the starving artist types . Yuppies , most of them , impostafarians all of them . I heard some making long term plans . They even have a very large warehouse where they keep their truck and signs and other protesting paraphernalia . They are an organization , a government . One that restricts peoples freedom of speech as well as any tyrannical government . They took offense to this word even though most of us adults use the word unisexually when referring to a group of people . This person actually got upset over it . This person needs to grow up . The Backbone Campaign was making people not say that word , all to satisfy one very young adult . Problem is , the Backbone Campaign really has no backbone at all . But lucky for everyone , feelings , unlike beliefs , can always change easily . I think you really get off on belonging to these groups . My guess ; you will become part of the non-working class and take to social media for your physical needs . It was driving me crazy . I wanted to make a comment to her , but never texted her since the last one telling her that I thought I saw her in the barn . I just ignored her , but I wanted to let her know how right I was about us seeing each other again in life and how she blew it with a friend of mine . After a couple of weeks , I let one rip . It was at the end of the week long Action Camp , when the brother I had brought up with me was looking for a ride back to Portland and found one with B . Now I had talked to this brother about this evil , as I put it , girl . He knew the entire story and would find pot for me when her presence or the presence of the lawyer bothered me . But when he got his ride set up with B , he said she had a bit of an attitude problem . He and another person , who was getting a ride back with her also but never heard the story , were coordinating with her when all of a sudden she made a comment about some drama and then motioned towards me . She knew he was staying with me . The one brother had no clue what she was talking about , but the brother who stayed with me that week , he figured it out right then and there and knew she was the one that I had been talking about playing games with my head . Too bad , it might have been a nicer ride home for her if she had just kept ignoring me . So a couple of weeks later , after feeling very aggravated over the entire treatment by this women , not knowing if she was a government plant or a fortune hunter , I sent her a text telling her how I told her our paths would meet again . Then I told her how that brother she took back to Portland had no idea she had a problem with me until she opened her mouth and gestured towards me . A week or two after that was sent , I got a reply . The reply was not from her ; at least , it was not from her phone number . It was from the boyfriend , and he , it turns out , is not the peaceful loving hippie activist type he wants everyone to believe . How valiant . First off , I have no idea what he is talking about when he says I misrepresented myself to his girl . Two , her boyfriend read her text messages and either ... you know what , there are a dozen scenarios as to who , what , why , when or how that message had been sent . My intentions were , by this time and it should have been obvious , to write this girl out of my life . Like I did when I was in the barn working on this website and talking to someone and she approached the table and stood there like she wanted to say something . I just kept talking to a serious revolutionary . She just gave a quick wave and walked away . It was pretty much understood , I wanted nothing to do with her . I have dated many strippers in my life and if this girl is not a stripper then she is an ex-stripper . I might even be willing to bet my life on that . And the only thing strippers are interested in is money . Strippers are made from people giving them money as children to take off their clothes or even molested them . I only spoke to a select few about this problem I was having with my feelings and insight and that was only in the privacy of my RV . Of the dozens scenarios I have one thought that it could really be . In fact , it is quite conspiratorial . I guess it really sucked for her when she showed up for the camp and I was there . That would really be a tyrannical thing for one person to do to another . How humiliating if she did this to me on the word of a stranger . I figured that to be the fact and this action by her , told to her to do by them , has gotten her in a position she never wanted to be in . So they come in and try to take care of it for her because she went to them and told them this all blew up in her face . I am trying to end money and the spewing of diesel everywhere . Maybe B picked up on that and knew that I was not the type to slave for her to give her money just because she shakes her tail feather at me . Chris might fall for that , but I have too much self-respect to be used by anyone for an evil such as that . My money is for the cause , not for gifts for some sinister sister and her child . B knew where my money came from and I think that mesmerized her . I think she also caught on to the fact that my money is used as a tool to just further the cause and that might be why she ignored me . To all the activists and your separate groups : come together . Pull your forces . If you all know what the problem is and you are all working together to win all your causes , then who you are , or what your tactics might be , should make no difference . Just because they may be willing to use a tactic you are not , does not make them above nor beneath you . You are all brothers and sisters for this final action and beyond . You are all looking for the same end result . So get your heads out of your asses and do the right thing . Plan a few at first to get used to the logistics , then make the last call for the weekend of November 5 , 2016 , Guy Fawkes Day . Namaste . If you were born after 1945 , click here for a message to humanity . Chris Hedges on Occupy , Black Bloc , conservatives and more . Click above , or here , for a short video on what Chris has to say . He stated that those 40,000 bodies could have been used better if they gathered at the sight rather then complain abut it in Washington . I wish I could find that video .
