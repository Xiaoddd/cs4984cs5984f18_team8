Dillon will take the clothes to North Dakota to support the no-pipeline protesters . The 1,200-mile project is opposed by the Standing Rock Sioux and other Native American tribes who have joined the standoff because it crosses under the Missouri River , the tribe 's main source of drinking water , and threatens to disrupt culturally significant areas . When the teachers decided to join together , their commitment was bigger than health , fitness or meditation . Dillon originally planned a trip in early December , but she decided to head out immediately after another clash with security and law enforcement caused tribal officials to put out a call for media coverage , medical support and help warming those doused by water cannons in below-freezing temperatures . Dillon said the main objective is to offer support to people who feel overlooked on issues that are easy for many to ignore . There were so many other faces in the crowd . Dillon said the studio will accept donations of blankets , sleeping bags , rain gear , boots and shoes , as well as warm clothing , through Wednesday evening . At the request of tribal organizers , the group is also collecting natural products , such as ointments , herbs and other medical supplies . Read this . All rights reserved . All rights reserved .
