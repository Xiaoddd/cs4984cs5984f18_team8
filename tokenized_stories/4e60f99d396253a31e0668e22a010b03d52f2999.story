The purpose of the week of action is simple : to come together and push back against a wave of repression that has been growing in the United States and accelerated by the coming to power of the Trump administration . Meanwhile , several states have also been trying to push through a set of laws which would further criminalize protest and make it easier for protesters to be fined , face greater charges , and in some cases , even be killed if they block roadways . This wave of repression can not also be divorced from the deadly acts of terror being carried out by the far-Right . Now is the time to come together , discuss how we can support each other , and continue forward on the path ahead . Now is the time to make our friends across the country know that we have their backs . Now is the time to remember that in the face of everything , we as a movement support each other , we back each other up , and we all know that an injury to one of us , is an injury to all of us .
