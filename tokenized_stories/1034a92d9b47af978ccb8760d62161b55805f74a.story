The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals did not issue a decision after more than 90 minutes of arguments on Wednesday morning . Indianz.Com on YouTube : Chairman Dave Archambault II of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Inside a packed courtroom , a panel of three judges posed difficult questions to attorneys representing the tribe , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Dakota Access LLC , the partnership behind the controversial and costly project . They all wondered whether they have the authority to extend a termporary injunction that has halted construction , for now , in a key area of North Dakota . But one judge also questioned why Dakota Access started building in the first place . The Army Corps has yet to authorize construction on federally-owned land along the Missouri River , and without that easement , the pipeline ca n't go forward . asked Judge Thomas B. Griffith asked . If the partnership had waited for the easement , he said that would have delayed completion of the 1,172-mile pipeline . Dakota Access has previously said it needs to start shipping oil by January 1 , 2017 . James A. Maysonett of the Department of Justice argued on behalf of the Army Corps at the hearing . But he offered some fresh details about the process . The Army Corps is reviewing environmental , treaty law and other claims not only raised by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe but also by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the Yankton Sioux Tribe , he said . It 's possible that both cases will be consolidated as proceedings continue in a lower court . Jan Hasselman , an attorney from the non-profit Earthjustice , represented the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . Although he had only been allotted 15 minutes for arguments , the judges kept him on his feet for 35 minutes as they sought to gain clarity about the sacred sites and burial grounds that are at risk . The pipeline is being built on treaty lands that were taken from the tribe , he noted . In addition to Judge Griffith , the panel that heard the case consisted of Judge Janice Rogers Brown and Judge Cornelia T.L. Pillard . They could issue a decision on the tribe 's request for a more permanent injunction at any time . Regardless of the outcome , the tribe will still be able to pursue its appeal in the case . It arose after Judge James Boasberg refused to block construction of the pipeline in a September 9 decision that was essentially a victory for Dakota Access . Immediately following that decision , the Obama administration issued an extraordinary joint statement addressing the lack of an easement at Lake Oahe on the Missouri River . A week later , the D.C. Circuit issued its administrative injunction and ordered a hearing . Both actions were unprecedented in an Indian law case .
