The Resistance Begins The Dakota Pipeline is back , but for Standing Rock , it never left . Yesterday , President Trump signed an executive order to advance both the Keystone XL pipeline and the much-disputed Dakota Access Pipeline . The Executive Order In A Nutshell Former President Obama was well-known as a vocal defender of environmental issues . He championed climate causes and restrained dangerous gas-guzzling practices , such as the construction of deeply destructive fracking pipelines through America . As a result , the Keystone XL pipeline was never given the green light , and the Dakota Access Pipeline was halted in the wake of mass protests in late 2016 . Trump has depended on smoke and mirrors for many things , but his unadulterated commitment to the oil and gas industry is not something that requires alternative facts . It was always known that once Trump came to power , he would roll back on decades of climate science and policy to clear the way for the titans of big oil . Trump himself had personally invested in ETP before he announced his run for president in 2015 . Scary Anti-Protest Law On The Table On Jan. 15 , lawmakers in the state of North Dakota introduced House Bill No. 1203 . Your eyes are not deceiving you . Imagine living in a country where a crowd of peaceful protestors have assembled across a highway , protesting the construction of a pipeline . Then imagine a 10-wheeler truck ploughing them down . Imagine the faces , hands , hearts , and bones of women , children , and babies being turned into a swamp of gore under the wheels of a truck . Kempenich said he was worried about drivers panicking after coming across a group of people standing in a public roadway . If you are still confused about the location of your gas pedal in proximity to your brakes , or you randomly stamp on them to find out which does what , I would deeply implore you to retake your driving test and refrain from operating a motor vehicle until you figure it out . It feels like a gateway to legalizing murder . And not just for protesters . There are no exceptions when it comes to responsible driving . If you can not safely operate a vehicle in a myriad of circumstances , you have no business being on the road . Period . Even with Trump helming the ship , opportunistic senators often use a lame duck Congress to try and stuff through some extremely troubling bills . Although the news can seem increasingly bleak in the dawn of this new era , this is not The Purge . In fact , many never left Cannon Ball , North Dakota . Roughly a thousand people refused to leave throughout the winter , anticipating this recent chain of events . Shailene Woodley , who has been a devoted supporter and ally of the Standing Rock movement , was asked what was next on MSNBC . Source Last night , demonstrations swept the nation , from New York to Los Angeles . Do n't forget that . But it is far from being over . Show up and protest . Always come in peace . Use Your Voice Call your Senator . Call up your local environmental charity . Call the President . But get involved , and be vocal about your feelings . Never , Never , Never Give Up We are facing undeniable dark days for nature lovers , environmentalists , and humanity in general . Be like the social media manager of the Badlands National Park -LRB- or shall we say Badasslands National Park -RRB- and resist . It belongs to us .
