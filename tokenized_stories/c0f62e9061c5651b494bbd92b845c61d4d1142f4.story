Writers and poets including John Vaillant , Patrick Freisen , Eve Joseph , Deborah Campbell , Bill Gaston , Shaena Lambert , Caroline Adderson , Brian Brett , Briony Penn and Ronald Wright took part in the reading on Burnaby Mountain . I was part of the group . I read wonderful poems by Joelene Heathcote and Dorothy Field . With other protesters , including a 71-year-old artist , I violated the Trans Mountain court injunction against civil disobedience . The protestors , most of whom were women , all risked going to jail for 14 days .

So there were no arrests Saturday , although 220 people have been arrested since protests began . These duties , as Albert Camus often reflected , can be arduous . More than 50 years ago he argued that writers can not serve those who make history ; they must serve those who are subject to it . I am here today to defend liberty and freedom , and I am here to defend the rights of Coast Salish people and the residents of Burnaby to protest an egregious pipeline . To defend its purchase the government has lied about the economics . There is no Asian price premium for bitumen and there never will be . Bitumen is junk crude and it is priced as cheap refinery feedstock around the world . Our government has also lied about its abilities to clean up bitumen spills in the ocean . And it has lied to the Canadian people about the consequences of expanding fossil fuel production , which now directly feed the wildfires that are consuming our treed landscapes and poisoning our watersheds . Politicians who think they can solve the climate change crisis by expanding hydrocarbon production have become terrorists in our communities , anarchists in our oceans and arsonists in our forests . They are behaving like crazed firemen who think they can fight fire with gasoline . Our children , who can see the moral hazard clearly , are now living with the flames and carbon-filled skies . On Being a Sentenced Sinister Senior read more Yet our political leaders can not recognize the dishonesty of their decision-making . Each day the insults grow . Our government now thinks it is serving justice by arresting and jailing a 75-year-old citizen and recipient of the Order of Canada who merely exercised her civic duty to protest the construction of an unnecessary pipeline .
