Go listen to any mother who understands the gravity of what half of voters , including people I love , just did to our children and our land . And then , through those tears , gaze toward a place more powerful and empowering than electoral politics : Standing Rock , where something new is being born . If Donald Trump expresses the ideological cancer in which white males dominate social , environmental , economic and sexual experience , then Standing Rock expresses the antidote to this disease . When I traveled there with my wife and daughter the week before the election , we encountered what so many centuries of white supremacy has failed to kill , convert or colonize out of existence , and which might yet save so many wretches like me . We will remain blind to all of this if we read about Standing Rock through the usual filters with which we consume news , for what is happening there is not one thing nor anything common . It is a fight to protect the waters , yes , but it is also a fight for climate justice , to honor treaties , to take responsibility for the lives of our descendants , to heal intertribal wounds , to heal wounds between tribal and non-tribal peoples , to model a renewable energy path , to display how decentralized collectives can be extremely organized and effective . Things that have never happened are happening there . Prayers are being shared that have never been shared . People are praying together who have never prayed together . People who have never put their bodies on the line are engaging in nonviolent direct action . Of course , there is the other side of the story . Private security and police have attacked unarmed protesters with dogs , pepper spray and rubber bullets . Then on Election Day , Energy Transfer Partners , in blatant defiance of the regulatory process , not to mention treaties and the health of millions whose waters are threatened , announced it would begin drilling beneath Lake Oahe in two weeks . Trump , not surprisingly , stands to profit . We whites unhappy with a Ku Klux Klan-endorsed president have some soul-searching to do . My 3-year-old daughter put these questions more directly . I looked across the river where the pipeline was being laid , where a militarized force was securing the desecration of waters , where thousands were camped to protect those waters , and I hesitated . There were tears in my eyes then and they keep returning . He recently returned from five days at the Standing Rock encampment in North Dakota . Stop watching this discussion .
