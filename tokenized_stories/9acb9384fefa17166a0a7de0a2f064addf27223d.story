Another victory came for demonstrators against the Dakota Access pipeline this Friday when a federal judge denied the company 's request to force the federal government to approve the controversial 1,172-mile pipeline 's final easement . But while U.S. District Judge James Boasberg denied Energy Transfer Partners any help in overturning the Army Corps of Engineer 's decision to halt construction , he left the door open for revisiting the issue next year . While the decision certainly helps the thousands of demonstrators who have poured onto North Dakota in the last few months to stop the project , which would traverse Standing Rock Sioux tribe 's ancestral lands , many are taking the announcement with cautious optimism . This is not the end . As we have seen , they will do anything to get their way . I hope we can go into court and ... that justice will prevail . It 's also not the first time the company turns to the courts for help . That ruling is still pending . While the Friday decision does not put a final nail in the coffin , it still is of advantage to the demonstrators . Of course , that is also not set in stone , as the incoming Trump administration - which has already announced its support for the pipeline - could overturn the Army Corps of Engineers ' decision . Standing Rock Sioux tribe members and the Army Corps of Engineers have until Jan. 6 , 2017 to hand in their reasons for opposition . ETP has until Jan. 31 to respond to those claims , after which the government and tribes will have 10 days to come back with their arguments . A full hearing on the motion will likely come in February , the judge said . Still , whether it 's inside or outside of the courts , and despite freezing weather , demonstrators at Standing Rock are remaining strong . I hope they understand the world is watching now . They have to learn to live a better way in protecting the water , the land the resources .
