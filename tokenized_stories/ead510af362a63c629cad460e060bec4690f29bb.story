They have breached our sacred ground . It is unclear when the final phase of construction could finish , but native activists on Sunday said it appeared the project was within a few miles of the water and that the construction crew seemed to be working at a fast pace . The North Dakota portion of the 1,172-mile pipeline was originally scheduled for completion by November . And even as supporters rally in solidarity worldwide and human rights observers descend on the area to observe the police , Indigenous water protectors still find themselves constantly on guard against hostile forces . Indeed , this weekend saw water protectors fearing a mysterious brush fire near the camp as well as new footage of an armed security contractor with Dakota Access who appeared to infiltrate the water protectors during last week 's clashes with law enforcement . All signs point to the pipeline company being linked to both threats , said Indigenous Environmental Network organizer Dallas Goldtooth . The security officer , who had a DAPL security ID card and whose truck was insured by DAPL , was apparently attempting to infiltrate the camp . The man was eventually arrested by Bureau of Indian Affairs police officers and turned over to the FBI . We do n't know what his intentions could have been . Their reason for using rubber bullets and pepper spray and concussion grenades on our water protectors was so that they could have access to deliver emergency services , ambulances and fire equipment , if needed , to the main camp . Despite the sense of constant threats and still reeling from Thursday 's mass arrests , water protectors staged a peaceful march and prayer circle Saturday on a bridge that government officials had closed , demonstrating their commitment both to their cause and to peaceful means of protest .
