Let him know what you think of his despicable behavior -LRB- the meme was created before the use of water cannons -RRB- . Many of the water protectors have been using Facebook to vent , to journal , to process what happened last night . Here are some excerpts from firsthand accounts . I encourage you to click the links and read the full statements . From Eryn Wise : I thought the day we lost Sacred Grounds was the worst day . I thought that watching them drag my friends from their homes and inipi was enough . I thought that them re-breaking my sister 's wrist was enough . I thought them forcing their way to the bridge using tear gas and mace on us like we were roaches to be exterminated was enough . I guess , for these men , there is no line that ca n't be crossed . From John Bravebull : Watched as tear gas containers exploded mid air raining down smoking fragments that were still burning . Watching as people were being soaked with a water cannon . Shots . Some one was hit we ran to her scooped her into our arms and ran her back to medics . This was our role for the next five hours , pulling about forty people out . Some cause of shock . Some cause of breathing issues from the gas . Some just because they needed someone to tell them it was ok to pull back . Chad never left my side . That 's important for you to know cause we did n't know each other four months ago and we had each other 's backs like we were childhood friends . From Jen Deerinwater : I 'm full of anger and confusion over how any human being can lack compassion for a living soul that they would unleash these horrors on unarmed , peaceful people who want nothing more than to preserve their water and way of life . I 'm angry that President Obama made a promise to us that he 'd do right by Native People , but he 's been virtually silent on this issue . He 's sleeping comfortably in the house that resides on stolen Indigenous land while hundreds of our people are being injured by the widespread , indiscriminate use of mace , tear gas , rubber bullets , long range acoustic devices , and water cannons in subzero temperatures . I 'm angry that our only two options to replace him were two racists in the pocket of big oil , albeit one was slightly more restrained , but being restrained in genocide is of little comfort to me and other Native People .

Fake Friend to the Working Class . Real Asshole . Unfortunately , it 's REAL This is where the phone number to the man who could , if he really cared about his legacy , should be posted . The amount of suffering he allowed the people in this country to endure is unfathamabe . He sat back and did nothing while 4 million people lost their homes even while the banks continued breaking the law . The amount of suffering he brought to the people in the Middle East is also unfathamabe . I remember the tears of joy that people had on their faces the night he was elected and could never in my wildest dreams imagine that he would betray them and us the way he did . What an empty suited POS president he has been . up 12 users have voted . Beyond inhuman . People die if these sort of things all the time .

Ok , things I 'd like to point out that these MRAPs they are using do n't use . They do n't use Rhinos . The Gunner 's Cupola does n't have a chickenwire Grenade deflector . Are traveling in a very exposed , packed formation to scatter crowds , but is a prime target for IEDs . Essentially , they 're doing everything the US forces did at the start of the war , before the Iraqi and Afghan civilians and Irregular forces started fighting back .

It does n't matter who we elect to be the president because that person is just the face of the Deep State and the now militarized police forces is just one face of many . We have been saying that the police are the elite 's enforcers and since OWS was brutally taken down by another fascist department , DHS we can see how right we were . Thanks to federal grant programs allowing the Pentagon to transfer surplus military supplies and weapons to local law enforcement agencies without charge , police forces will continue to be transformed from peace officers into heavily armed extensions of the military , complete with jackboots , helmets , shields , batons , pepper-spray , stun guns , assault rifles , body armor , miniature tanks and weaponized drones . Notice how few members of our government have come out and said anything about the cops meeting the Ferguson protesters with riot gear and every protests since has been met with overwhelming force which is what makes the protest seem violent . They were peaceful UNTIL THE COPS SHOWED UP and they are the ones who created the violence . The people who scream the loudest about their 2nd amendment rights are some of the ones who cheer the loudest when the police brutalize the protesters . On my right wing Mormon sponsored website in Utah , every comment about the police brutality against the DAPL protesters were in favor of the police . They basically said that the Native Americans deserved to be treated that way . I still feel that the powers that be wanted Trump to be the president because he is going to divide this country even more and eventually both sides are going to fight each other which will give the reason to declare Martial law . up 12 users have voted . up 5 users have voted . The difference between now and then is since I am so much older now , I do n't think things will ever change in my lifetime . Always such senseless suffering . For now , the good thing I try and reflect on is how very brave these water protectors are . up 0 users have voted . The point is that this is happening everywhere although it 's just starting to worsen in the US , home of a number of such ruthless corporations , and it must be stopped everywhere . Women and men around the world who stand up to corporate power to defend their land rights face grave danger . Many are forced to pay with their lives . She 's also in danger . In April , her courageous efforts were recognized with the Goldman Environmental Prize , one of the most prestigious awards for defenders of the environment . Yet the threats and violent intimidation have not stopped . The situation is urgent . She is engaged in an ongoing legal battle with the US and Peruvian owners of the Yanacocha mine , one of the largest gold and copper mines in the world . She has braved violent attacks for refusing to leave and believes that campaign of intimidation and harassment , perpetrated by both local police and Yanacocha security personnel , is an organized attempt to drive her from her home so the mining company can use her land . But she will not give in . In other attacks , police even beat her children . They damaged her house and took away vital belongings , including crops , food , cooking pots and beds . Women and men around the world who stand up to corporate power to defend their land rights face grave danger . Many are forced to pay with their lives . We must join them . And our stinking-corrupt governments are fine with such as this being done by corporations based in our countries , now at home as well as abroad where little is heard of this by citizens . This must be fought , tooth and nail by any country these corporations wish to do business in . -LRB- This one is older , past deadline now . It will form the basis for an appeal to governments demanding respect for Indigenous rights , safety for those who are fighting mega-projects in defense of land , water and life , as well as an end to impunity for North American corporations and investors implicated in repression , violent evictions , corruption and impunity abroad . The attack occurred just after midnight . Four bullets impacted the walls of her home where Angelica and two children were sleeping . We are deeply concerned about the rising number of attacks against human rights and land defenders throughout Latin America , particularly at the hands of multinational extractive companies , as recently reported by Amnesty International . An alarming number of these victims are Indigenous women . We hold responsible not only the companies implicated in these acts of violence but also the home countries for supporting in multiple ways the expansion of corporate and investor interests while turning a blind eye to repression , human rights violations and environmental harms linked to those same economic interests . The serious threats against Angelica and others involved in the case have been repeatedly denounced both nationally and internationally . We continue to support her courageous and dignified struggle for justice in the murder of her husband . As a respected member of his community , Adolfo went to the area to restore calm . Adolfo was beaten , attacked by machete and shot . He died from his injuries . The criminal trial against Mynor Padilla , accused of murdering Adolfo and causing serious injury to German Chub , has dragged on for more than one and a half years in Guatemala . The trial has been riddled with procedural and substantive irregularities , as well as allegations by the plaintiffs of racism by the judge . The long and arduous proceedings have caused serious personal and economic hardship to Angelica , her family and supporters , and lawyers . This is not the first attack against Angelica and she has denounced others since the criminal trial opened in Guatemala in March 2015 . Nicinha , a leader from the Movement of Persons Affected by Dams -LRB- MAB -RRB- , was part of a fishing village that was trying to protect the river and their livelihoods . As a result of her leadership and struggle , she was tortured , bound and murdered before being tied to a rock in the river . Threats and attacks against COPINH for their resistance to multinational hydro-electric dams and mining concessions in their territory continue . The World Bank is a longtime investor in the Yanacocha mine . In Mexico , Esperanza Salazar , the coordinator of Bios Iguana A.C. , and a member of the Mexican Network of Mining Affected Peoples , was recently forced to abandon her home and work in the state of Colima because of constant threats and intimidation . Esperanza and other members of Bios Iguana have faced stigmatization and threats from businessmen and state actors over the last few years as a result of their work with the Indigenous Council in Defense of Territory in Zacualpan , Colima . The Indigenous Council faces serious ongoing threats and aggression as a result of their opposition to mining and hydroelectric concessions on their land . On this day , we reiterate our solidarity with Angelica Choc and her family and express our grave concern for her and the many others who are courageously defending their lives and territory against large-scale extractive projects despite the serious risks they face for doing so . We wholly reject the use of threats , intimidation and violent attacks by governments and companies to repress and try to deter legitimate resistance to their projects . We demand that justice is served for attacks against land and rights defenders , and that the intellectual authors of such attacks are also prosecuted . Furthermore , we call for all necessary measures to be taken to ensure the safety of Angelica Choc and all the brave women and men who are fighting to defend their land and the wellbeing of their communities . Rights Action is sending on-going funds to the families of Berta Caceres and COPINH and the families of Angelica Choc and German Chub , so they can take extra measures of family safety , and continue to seek justice for the repression and crimes .
