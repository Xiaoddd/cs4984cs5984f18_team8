The defense of water and assertion of Indigenous sovereignty did not end yesterday as law enforcement violently evicted Water Protectors from the unceded land we have called home for months . The struggle against the black snake and its world continues . We also remind our relatives that this violent eviction is only one part of a well-coordinated and multi-dimensional strategy of repression by local , state , and federal law enforcement that seeks to crush our resistance . Over 750 people face charges , and we are fighting back in the courtrooms . Grand juries are active and issuing indictments , and we are resisting . Federal agencies are knocking on the doors of our loved ones , and we are remaining silent . It is critical that we do everything in our power to protect ourselves , our comrades , and the struggle for liberation . Here are some practices we strongly encourage : Avoid the spreading of rumor and gossip , as that only serves the agenda of the State in its efforts to divide us . Triple-confirm information from primary sources . Use social media with great care and always assume that your account is under heavy surveillance . Social media content has been used repeatedly to bring both state and federal charges against Water Protectors . If you or your loved ones are approached by law enforcement of any kind , exercise your right to remain silent . Remaining silent means you do not speak at all except for those words . Anything you say can and will be used against you and your comrades . If you or your loved ones are approached by law enforcement or harassed in any way , contact WPLC Legal Support at -LRB-701-RRB-Â 595-0737 . Continue to act in the spirit developed at the camps , one of graciousness and solidarity . Do not publicly condemn the tactics or choices of others . Keep our internal debates internal , and accept disagreement . When we air our criticisms publicly , we open up our movement to further state repression . Maintain security of your phones and computers as much as possible . Use Signal Private Messenger for encrypted texts and calls whenever possible . Switch to encrypted email services like Riseup.net or ProtonMail.com . But remember that no tech security is foolproof , so always be mindful of what you say and how it could harm yourself or others . Visit our websites -LRB- links below -RRB- for lots more legal information , resources , and support . Relatives and comrades , be vigilant but unafraid . We have stood together in this movement through many battles . We will continue to hold one another through the trauma of forced removal from Oceti Oyate . Care for yourselves and one another . Make space to mourn but also to celebrate our victories . This is what solidarity truly looks like . We will face the next battle stronger than ever .
