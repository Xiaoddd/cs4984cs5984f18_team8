Experts say the report should be a red flag to public health officials that protective regulations and policies need to be improved to help prevent exposure . The wells contaminate the quality of the air , water and soil and increase harmful toxins such as benzene and formaldehyde . People living within a mile of these toxic fumes have an increased risk for getting cancer , heart disease , dementia or a neurological problem . Residential proximity to these operations has also increased adverse birth outcomes , including pre-term birth , lower birth weight , neural tube defects and congenital heart defects . So pregnant women living near these wells could be putting their fetuses at an increased risk to have one of these defects . In the US , 17.6 million people live a mile or closer to oil and gas wells . This is a picture of oil workers in Tioga , North Dakota . ` When one in two members of a population are potentially exposed to a health risk , that 's a significant public-health concern , ' Czolowski said . Other notable figures included 24 percent of Ohioans living near active wells and Texas having the highest number of residents near these harmful sites at 4.5 million people . Researchers also looked specifically at children aged 5 or younger because of how vulnerable they are to environmental exposures . Acute exposure to these air pollutants can cause irritation in the eyes , nose , throat and lungs while causing chronic conditions for people around them long term . The study states that protective regulations and policies are necessary considering the large number of people exposed to these chemicals daily .
