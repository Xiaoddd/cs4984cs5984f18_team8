Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Council Chairman David Archambault II , however , has a different take : He wants anyone who is n't a member of the Standing Rock tribe to pack it up and leave the Oceti Sakowin -LRB- Seven Council Fires -RRB- Camp . Citing inclement weather as his primary concern , Archambault also warned that any water protectors committing a crime , such as hurting law enforcement or destroying equipment , could undermine all of their efforts to stop the pipeline . The water protector from the Bronx , N.Y. , may lose her arm after being hit by a concussion grenade . As stated all along , ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe . Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way .

I can see Morton County Sheriff and DAPL Private Security currently in the hills across the Cannonball River riding around . The monstrous militarized concrete barricades blocking the highway where police laughed as they aimed Water Cannons in below freezing temperatures at innocent people remain . We sit on a previous military fort and we have survived that . And we have rebuilt on what was taken from us . We survived Wounded Knee , a massacre . We are survivors . We are fighters and we are protectors of our land . Obama 's apparent lack of knowledge , and continued silence on the issue as terror rained down on water protectors , is notable for several reasons .

While there , the president promised to uphold treaty obligations , respect indigenous sovereignty and give all children the future they deserve . This was your word . Our protectors had no lethal weapons , but we were met with an army of lethal weapons .
