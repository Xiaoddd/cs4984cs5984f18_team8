US Supreme Court Justice William Orville Douglas During an especially heated primary debate with Senator Bernie Sanders , Secretary Hilary Clinton made an interesting admission . As an advocate for community rights and local self-government my ears perked up . Of course the Palestinians have the right to govern themselves , but I had to wonder if Clinton , or Sanders for that matter , or any of the presidential hopefuls would agree that Coos County , OR or Pittsburgh , PA have the right to say no to harmful projects that violate the fundamental rights of their citizens . Last October I had a heated albeit brief debate of my own with a lawyer who , like me , opposes the proposed Jordan Cove LNG project here on the Southern Oregon coast . We disagreed on just what are fundamental or unalienable rights . Fundamental rights , however , require no validation from a governmental authority . My granddaughter has an inarguable fundamental right to clean air and water and not to be trespassed upon by toxic chemicals . So too do I have an unalienable right to my blue eyes and the ninth amendment allows for the protection of un-enumerated rights . Yet , when a small rural farming community in Pennsylvania says NO to a fracking waste injection well because it risks contaminating groundwater and therefore the very health and livelihood of the inhabitants , state and federal regulations preempt these people from protecting themselves and their children . The lawyer argued that property rights are fundamental rights rather than a privilege granted by government . And , just like gun rights can be taken away from felons , property rights can be taken away from landowners . Fundamental rights such as due process and the right to be healthy can not . In short , industry regulation is legalized harm . The regulatory agencies permit industry to violate fundamental rights and in so doing shelter the offenders from civil liability for the environmental damage and health issues they cause . The industry itself helps write the very regulations it is supposed to comply with . The regulatory agencies effectively set a cap on how clean your air and water can be . There is a plausible view that the only thing the regulatory agencies regulate are environmentalists . The amendment will confirm our right to local self-government and prohibit the state from preempting local ordinances protecting the fundamental rights of citizens . The Coos County Right to a Sustainable Energy Future Ordinance is one such local law that when passed will prohibit non-sustainable energy projects like Jordan Cove and will run up against state and federal preemption . State and federal regulators believe they are more expert about our communities than we are and we have inexplicably empowered them to make decisions for us instead of making them ourselves . The law firm of Davis Wright Tremaine has targeted rights based ordinances filed in Columbia and Douglas Counties . Oregon Constitution This same firm filed a comment to the statewide initiative , this time using pro-gas booster Keith Tymchuk , Mayor of Reedsport as the qualifying resident . Anyone laboring under the false belief that we operate under a representative democracy take note that an elected official opposes direct democracy allowing communities to be self determining . Tymchuk is representing the industry , not the electorate . State Senators Arnie Roblan and Jeff Kruse who coauthored a preemptive state law dubbed the Monsanto Protection Act are representing the industry . They are not representing their constituents who want protection from GMO and chemical encroachment on their organic farms . Justice Douglas supported the rights of nature to thrive and flourish . He believed that an ecosystem is not a slave to mankind existing only to be plundered and exploited to the benefit of corporate shareholders . He believed they are living breathing things independent of man and at the very least deserved standing in a court of law . We can choose to do nothing which is an ethical choice and leave our children and grandchildren with the consequences . Doing nothing will not stop Jordan Cove or any other industrial harm . We can continue to abide by and validate the regulatory fallacy . We can submit comments to the regulatory free speech zones and ignore the fact that what is regulated is allowed . Doing so will also not stop Jordan Cove , although hopefully the market has done that for us . We can declare that a government that does not protect the fundamental rights of its people is illegitimate and revoke our consent to be governed by amending that government . Community rights is about making corporate privileges subordinate to the rights of a community . In so doing we legalize sustainability and make it possible to protect the health and welfare of our children and our environment . MGx has matured since those early vents and ramblings and now covers relevant and important local and regional matters in addition to national and global affairs . I live in the fascist state of Wisconsin where they are extracting everything . Our legal community seems unable to do anything about it . They are currently destroying one of the top 10 Universities in the country , the University of Wisconsin .
