However , several legal challenges to the pipeline on behalf of local communities are still making their way through the courts . Similarly , advocates filed a letter with FERC requesting that it deny this and any future requests to place the pipeline into service . The pipeline should not be allowed to begin operating until the legal issues around it are resolved . This pipeline faced overwhelming public opposition , including dire warnings by experts on the dangers it posed . The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental protection issued permits for the project anyway , violating its own water and air quality standards in the process . Meanwhile , Catholic Sisters , Amish families , and Indigenous people all have their religious rights and cultural heritage trampled underfoot . In Lancaster County alone , more than 50 friends and neighbors have been arrested for resisting the ASP .
