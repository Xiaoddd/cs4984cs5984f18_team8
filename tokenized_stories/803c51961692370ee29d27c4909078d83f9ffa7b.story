Washington , DC Five environmental activists disrupted a Senate hearing on Thursday as Senate members of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources met to consider two nominees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -LRB- FERC -RRB- . Beyond Extreme Energy -LRB- BXE -RRB- activists disrupted the hearing because they say the nominees , if appointed , would continue a trend of approving every fossil fuel project FERC reviews . The Committee met to consider the Trump Administration nominations of Neil Chattergee and Robert F. Powelson . Both are fossil fuel energy supporters . There have been three commission vacancies at FERC since February . The agency can not vote on new energy projects without a quorum . The five BXE activists were quickly removed from the Senate hearing by Capitol police . Among them was Lee Stewart , an organizer with BXE , who had chained himself to a chair and was dragged out still attached to it . It took three Capitol police officers to remove him . An activist simultaneously set off a sound device nearby , stopping the hearing . The dramatic incident was caught on video and continued into the hallway outside the hearing room . Cathy Strickler , another activist who sounded off , also stopped the hearing . As she was led away a Capitol police officer videotaped her arrest . by John Zangas Four of the protesters were arrested , while one was detained . The others were held over night . Ellen Barfield from Baltimore and Randy Fenstermacher from Massachusetts were also arrested . All four were initially charged with disrupting a Senate hearing . But at their arraignment on Friday , the charges were dropped for all but Lee Stewart . Stewart was also charged with destruction of government property , involving his attachment to the chair . His court date is set for June 26 . Strickler spoke from her home in Virginia Thursday evening . Strickler is concerned that energy policy can not begin to change toward renewable options as promised in the Paris Climate accords , while FERC and the fossil fuel industry lobby controls Congress . BXE has been battling FERC over its approval of virtually every fossil project put before it by the gas industry . The activists also say FERC has totally disregarded the impact its approvals are having on families , farms , businesses , and communities while the gas industry rolls out a massive methane gas infrastructure across the country . BXE also takes issue with an established cause and effect relationship between pipelines , compressor stations and the environment and the second order effects of methane emissions on global climate . FERC Commission nominee Neil Chattergee was a senior energy adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell . He opposed green energy initiatives and fought to eliminate EPA carbon standards enacted by the Obama administration . Robert F. Powelson served on the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission and is largely seen as a supporter of the fossil fuel industry . They have also hounded commissioners from state to state to disrupt or cause cancellations of meetings wherever they hold engagements . They have disrupted over two dozen FERC monthly meetings in one way or another since 2014 , resulting in hundreds of arrests . Strickler said that BXE is not ending its protests anytime soon .
