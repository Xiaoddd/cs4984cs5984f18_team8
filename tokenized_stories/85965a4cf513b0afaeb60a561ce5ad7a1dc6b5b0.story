Two protesters , Nicolas Segal-Wright , 26 , and Karrie Kay Ford , 29 , were arrested Wednesday after placing themselves 250-feet into a segment of the Sabal Trail Transmission pipeline , a joint project between Spectra Energy Corp. , NextEra Energy Inc. , and Duke Energy . Ford claimed police aggressively attempted to remove her from the pipeline . So just hold tight and , like , spread the word . Spread the word far and wide . Nicolas was removed first , and Ford warned in her video that rescuers were coming for her next . Ford was also previously arrested , along with 13 others , for protesting the pipeline in November . In the same vein , multiple protesters were arrested Wednesday in North Dakota as they peacefully resisted police encroachments on their camps .
