The people and families protesting at Standing Rock are Americans struggling for their rights , safety , integrity and future of their land . Their stance is a Vital cause for every American . I am Dedicating this song to all The Brave Women , Men , and Children peacefully protesting and enduring atrocity at Standing Rock and everywhere around the World . I believe with all my being in protecting the environment and human rights efforts . Places like Standing Rock are Ground Zero for our collective present and future generations . I could n't stand knowing what kind of future lies ahead for our child , for the children she was going to teach , for the children , women and men who are standing up to the cohersion at Standing Rock . I am already a father of two children in Maine and have been witness to terrible events like this for decades . As well , I am a Veteran of the US Navy . I would like to imagine a progress life , a progressive World filled with empathy and love -RRB- . Any donations towards this song will go to relief efforts at Standing Rock and towards recording a proper studio version of the song .
