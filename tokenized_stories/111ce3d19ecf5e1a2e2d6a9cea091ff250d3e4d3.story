The 1,170-mile -LRB- 1,885-km -RRB- line will move crude from the shale oilfields of North Dakota to Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico , where many U.S. refineries are located . Public opposition has drawn thousands of people to the North Dakota plains , including high-profile political and celebrity supporters . Large protest camps popped up near the site , leading to several violent clashes and some 600 arrests . The opposition sensed victory last year when the administration of President Barack Obama , a Democrat , delayed completion of the pipeline pending a review of tribal concerns and in December ordered an environmental study . But those fortunes were reversed after Trump , a Republican , took office on Jan. 20 . Trump issued an order on Jan. 24 to expedite both the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- and to revive another multibillion-dollar oil artery , Keystone XL . The Obama administration had blocked that project in 2015 .
