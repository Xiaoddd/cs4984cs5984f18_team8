About 60 workers were at the location where the leak happened on Monday , and the clean-up efforts were going at about 90 meters per day . Some of the oil is still trapped beneath the creek which is now frozen . Over the past decade , True Companies has declared 36 other spills , leaking some 320,000 gallons of petroleum products , according to AP figures .

The area where the latest leak happened is about 240 km from the site where the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their allies have been protesting against the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline . The building of the pipeline could put under threat the indigenous population 's only water source , Lake Oahe , with the tribe also saying that the construction could damage lands they view as sacred . The plan has now been halted , with the Obama administration having announced last week that it would n't grant an easement for the Energy Transfer Partners to build the final section of the pipeline .
