Share163 Tweet Email Image : AP Image : AP FOR THE PAST four months , Native Americans , environmentalists and celebrities have been gathering in North Dakota against a decision to place an oil pipeline under the Missouri River and the man-made Lake Oahe .

The sit-in protest , which began in earnest in August , has gathered more than 100 Native American tribes to the campsite near Cannon Ball to protest against and try to stop the final leg of the oil project being implemented . Former US Vice President Al Gore , Democratic presidential nominee Senator Bernie Sanders , Hollywood actors Murk Ruffalo , Shailene Woodley and Leonardo DiCaprio have all criticised the proposals . The camp , called Seven Council Fires , began growing in August as it took in the overflow crowd from smaller protest sites nearby . It now covers a half square mile , with living quarters that include old school buses , fancy motorhomes and domelike yurts . Hale bales are piled around some teepees to keep out the wind . The number of inhabitants has ranged from several hundred to several thousand . It has been called the largest gathering of Native American tribes in a century .

Violence The protests were peaceful and unobstructed until mid-October , when local police moved in to break-up encampments on public roads and on private land . Protest organisers said 167 people were hurt , including three Native American tribal elders , and that seven people have been hospitalised for severe head injuries . People have been hit with -LRB- tear gas -RRB- canisters in the chest or the leg and that sort of thing . Mountains of donated food and water are being stockpiled , as is firewood , much of which has come from outside of North Dakota , the least-forested state in the nation . A collection of army surplus tents with heating stoves serve as kitchen , dining hall , medical clinic and a camp-run school . Many of the smaller tents have become tattered by the wind . Tribes from the Great Plains states are adept at surviving brutal winters , he said . Others from warmer climes are being taught how to endure the frostbite-inducing temperatures that are sure to come . Reddog said she has confidence in the camp community . The latest Source : David Goldman The latest development occurred last night , when the Army Corps of Engineers refused to grant the company permission to extend the pipeline beneath a Missouri River reservoir . The best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing . Other reasons are much more personal . Carla Youngbear of the Meskwaki Potawatomi tribe made her third trip from central Kansas to be at the protest site . They need water .
