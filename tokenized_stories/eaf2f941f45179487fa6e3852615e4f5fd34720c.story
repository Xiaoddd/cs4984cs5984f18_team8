Frank Ackerman The final link of the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- can now be built , thanks to a recent decision by the Army Corps of Engineers -LRB- although the Cheyenne River Sioux have filed a last-minute suit to stop it -RRB- . In light of the disappointing but unsurprising federal approval of the pipeline , it is worth pausing to ask who and what DAPL is good for . There are four main answers : three are silly and one is dangerous . I do hope the people of Standing Rock are at least offered some form of insurance for when their water supply becomes spoiled . I really wish that the pipeline was sent by Bismark as it had originally been planned . So if oil is going to be transported from North Dakota I would say a pipeline is a safer way to do it than using trains or even trucks . But there is a big environmental justice issue . The route was changed to avoid polluting the drinking water of a much more populated area but the present route raises environmental justice concerns that should be addressed . The United States Army Corps of Engineers will play a big part in making sure we are prepared for this war . Not only will the Dakota Access Pipeline create a few jobs before we go to war but we will have our own oil and can ship overseas any surplus oil . Once engaged in this war many more people will have jobs build planes and helicopters , guns and ammunition , hospitals and training schools , food and uniforms . Private military companies like Blackwater , no XE , no Academi will put our hard earn tax dollars to work again . This is why building the Dakota Access Pipeline make such good sense . This must be a very difficult decision for the United States Army Corps of Engineers who mission is to protect our most valuable natural resource , water . Pipelines leak oil so very often that the United States Corps of Engineers has gained great expertise in managing the despondent water protectors and has the engineering know-how needed to clean up oil spills around bodies of water . The data is not in yet on the need for clean water , but the data is in on the need for jobs . Think jobs and war , not clean water . Put your faith in wars , no water . Right . Right . And Right again . And yes , expect war to break out anytime soon . for instance consider something as simple canned fruits and vegetables . so many other great time-saving inventions might not exist had war not required more effective killing tools . if whirlpool had not made its fortune in war manufacturing , we might not have state of the art washers and dryers . we might still be living in an agrarian society had not these great concerns brought people in droves out of the country side flocking into the cities for employment opportunities . now , one operator and one maintenance man can do the work of hundreds . okay , that does create a system where we have way more job seekers than job openings . young job hunters can join the military , putting their lives on the line killing brown skinned people across the globe . Also , when more and more people DEMAND the use of clean energy and stop just being turned off by any higher price , then oil for energy will be cut down . The US for the last forty years or so has been fighting wars of choice . The latest one is the forever war on terror . The use of tech and robots replacing humans is insane and the use of a smart genius type designer gone mad . My late dad served in WW2 . Besides , the US HAS been at war for the last fifteen plus years . Unfortunately , the conditioning of war versus a sustainable economy has been in the psych of our government for many decades . However , think about this : in the fifties and early sixties we had relative peace and our economy for the middle class greatly increased especially with the increased building of our highways . Our infrastructure is falling apart and states can only take care of so much . so , i responded tongue in cheek . March on Christian soldier marching off to war with the cross of Jesus marching on before . You have great faith in The Mammon Corporate Empire . Be careful with your karma . i thought your post was satire so joined the fun . Have fun vacationing in the Hamptons .
