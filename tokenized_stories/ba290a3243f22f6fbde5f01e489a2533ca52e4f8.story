Slight chance of a rain shower . Low near 45F . Winds NW at 10 to 15 mph . Next week , the Hamilton man will join with others from Missoula and the Bitterroot who made the same pilgrimage to share their stories and thoughts about the continuing protest in North Dakota . A panel discussion will be held at the Ravalli County Museum from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Jan. 4 . When Gras returned to Hamilton from Standing Rock , he heard from a lot of people who wanted to know what he had seen and learned during his two-and-a-half week stay at the makeshift camp . Initially , he thought he would host a small gathering to tell folks about his experiences there . But when he started to spread the word about that idea , he discovered there were a fair number of other people who had gone or were going to Standing Rock to offer their own support to people gathered there . Most recently , Dustin Monroe of Missoula has offered to take part in the panel . An enrolled member of the Assiniboine Tribe of Montana and an Iraq War veteran , Monroe served as the Montana United Indian Association executive director and outreach coordinator for Wounded Warriors Brigade at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington , D.C. Monroe made the 11-hour trip to Standing Rock several times to bring supplies to the thousands protesting the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline . He was also part of the 4,000-strong contingent of military veterans who converged on Standing Rock to support the protesters . Other panel members include Saladin Frank Pelfrey , a Hamilton resident who delivered supplies during one of the recent blizzards and Victor resident Bill Lacroix who brought a truckload of donated supplies to the camp . Panel members will share their experiences of spending time in the camp . Gras expects there may be discussion of the issue of Native American sovereignty and treaty rights . Gras expects that the panel will accept written questions . Stop watching this discussion .

You do n't get a bunch of people together and protest the pipeline when one mile is left unfinished . You come to the table when the route is in the planning stages , air your concerns , and take legal action before construction starts , if you feel that your concerns are not met . Suppose I was an organic farmer , and I invested in a tractor , seed , fertilizer , planting equipment , a computer , and software , and was all ready to plant in the spring when some nitwit files a lawsuit saying that I do n't have some permit or other just as I 'm ready to plant . He knew what I was doing , but waited until the last minute in order to force me to come to unfair terms , or worse , just wanted to bankrupt me . Yes , it is pretty much the same thing . I 've seen cultural sites that certainly deserve protection , but it is pretty easy to negotiate them when given enough heads-up . Coming in at the last minute is activism at it 's finest . Report Add Reply Bob Schubring Jan 3 , 2017 9:20 am A genuine water-protector would volunteer to patrol alongside all pipelines , looking for leaks , and arresting anyone who taps into the pipeline to steal the contents . Texas has thousands of miles of pipelines criss-crossing the state . Water is scarce . Oil leaks are a rarity . Nigeria has a few hundred miles of pipelines and oil leaks are common . The difference between Texas and Nigeria , is that there 's guerilla warfare in Nigeria , run by gangsters who steal the oil and sell it . This stealing-and-selling business has made the abundant water supplies in the Niger River delta unsafe for humans and livestock . Report Add Reply Welcome to the discussion . Log In Keep it Clean .
