This amidst a highly controversial move by the White House to suspend all actions of the EPA , all dollars , all research and effectively suspending the use of science on a go forward basis . First , Trump is silencing the scientists and protectors from within the EPA . Luckily , and the only reason we know this , is because someone from inside when they heard that all communications were being shut down leaked to a member of congress who leaked to the media and the information found a way to us . Here they are : These are all informative , factual , and truly important details that we hold on to and continue to share because the new regime would like to rewrite history . Secondly , and back to Scott Pruitt : he has a long standing track record of playing into the pockets of oil and gas companies and has effectively changed the role of Attorney General . Well , until the following . Here are the official communications , to Scott Pruitt , where he receives the bodies of letters BY THE OIL COMPANIES filled with the information they felt was factual and true which he then sent to the EPA : This is all very important because Scott Pruitt is responsible for what we are seeing happening on a climate change level in Oklahoma . Oklahoma , prior to fracking , never had any earth quakes . Living in Southern California earth quakes are something we are accustomed to due to tectonic shifts but in Oklahoma the earth quakes happen because when the oil companies pull oil from the ground they need to offset the space in the land with something or else the ground will cave in . None of this is normal . Meanwhile , Scott Pruitt was providing the EPA with data and statistics fabricated by the Oil and Gas companies to favor themselves so as not to halt their fracking : Trump is pulling the voice from the EPA , he has frozen their projects , devalued their research , silenced anyone who opposes , and seeks to appoint a terror whose sole purpose is to continue to bleed our resources and mother earth dry . On the same day that Trump put the gag order on the EPA a pipe line in Canada ruptured spilling into their agricultural lands and leaking over 54,000 gallons of oil into their food supply . This is real , this is happening , we must insight change and do as much as we can to fight to prevent Scott Pruitt from taking office . We have no choice but to Stop Scott Pruitt and everything he is a part of , we must organize and we can not give in . This is my journey . account . Privacy & Cookies : This site uses cookies .
