They are not merely against pipelines . If they were , there would be a way to reason with them . Compromise would be possible because governments and pipeline builders could agree to thicker pipeline walls , real-time leak detection and diversion around sensitive waterways and forests . But activists are not simply worried about damage during construction , about ruptures and spills during operation or about the intrusion of pipeline rights-of-way through First Nations and provincial parks . They have convinced themselves that oil and other fossil fuels threaten the very existence of life on earth . In their opinion , if the oil in the pipelines is ever converted to energy the emissions given off will cause catastrophic climate change . Eco-activists believe pipelines must be stopped because the oil in them must be prevented from ever being used in factories , power plants , petrochemicals and vehicles . This week , University of Alberta mechanical engineering prof Amit Kumar published a study in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology . His research shows that pipelines are not only the safest means of transporting vast quantities of oil , they are also the most environmentally friendly . Kumar looked at the environmental impact of everything from manufacturing pipe versus making tanker railcars to constructing pipelines and pumping oil through them versus hauling oil by train . Since the pipeline announcement on Tuesday , many observers -LRB- me among them -RRB- had assumed the federal Liberal government lacked the guts to use force against pipeline disrupters . The Libs approved the two pipelines but would never see their construction through . Yet there was Carr saying Ottawa was prepared to call out the RCMP and even the army if environmentalists chained themselves to bulldozers or vandalized pipe and equipment . Carr and other Liberals walked back his statement a little on Friday . People who attempt to halt the construction of an approved pipeline will be dealt with by law enforcement .
