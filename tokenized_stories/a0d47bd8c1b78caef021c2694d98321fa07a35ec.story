AP February 9 , 2017 , 11:11 AM Dakota Access pipeline legal challenge filed to stall construction Police vehicles idle on the outskirts of the opposition camp against the Dakota Access oil pipeline near Cannon Ball , North Dakota , Feb. 8 , 2017 . Workers had already drilled entry and exit holes for the crossing , and oil had been put in the pipeline leading up to the lake in anticipation of finishing the project . Work was stalled for months due to opposition by the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux , as well as a prolonged court battle between the developer and the Army Corps of Engineers that oversees the federal land where the last segment of the pipeline is now being laid . President Trump last month instructed the Corps to advance pipeline construction . The Cheyenne River Sioux on Thursday asked a federal judge to stop the Lake Oahe work while a lawsuit filed earlier by the two tribes against the pipeline proceeds . The Cheyenne River Sioux on Thursday told Boasberg that it also wants to make a claim on freedom-of-religion grounds . An assessment conducted last year determined the river crossing would not have a significant effect on the environment . However , the Army decided in December that further study was warranted to address tribal concerns . The Corps launched an environmental impact study on Jan. 18 , but Mr. Trump signed an executive action six days later telling the Corps to allow the company to proceed with construction . Legal experts have disagreed on whether the Army can arbitrarily change its mind because of the change in White House administrations . An encampment near the construction site has drawn thousands of protesters since April in support of the Standing Rock Sioux , leading on occasions to clashes with law enforcement and hundreds of arrests . Granado said she was not aware of any incidents involving pipeline opponents in the area . The tribe fears a leak in the pipeline could contaminate drinking water at its reservation that is just downstream from the proposed Missouri River crossing . Protesters rallied in several cities across the country Wednesday . Demonstrators in Chicago targeted a bank . Others went to an Army Corps of Engineers office in New York City but were asked to leave when they started filming without a permit . Several people were arrested for blocking public access to a federal building in San Francisco . The tribe maintains the decision violates its treaty rights , and its attorneys have vowed to keep fighting in court . The Corps has notified protesters still at the encampment that the government-owned land will be closed Feb. 22 . But according to Harris , a new camp is being established on private land . We are here to stay . An assessment conducted last year determined the river crossing would not have a significant effect on the environment .
