Following a brief confrontation with police , in which military vehicles were reportedly set alight and ultimately cleared from the roadway by water protectors , heavily armed police in riot gear kettled water protectors on a bridge and began brutalizing those trapped . As Gilbertt repeatedly noted , it was the water protectors who snuffed several fires which erupted after police fired tear gas cannons . While the activists worked quickly to put out the fires , police ignored their efforts and proceeded to inundate them in below freezing temperatures . According to Gilbertt and other witnesses , those trapped on the bridge had no means to escape the barrage of rubber bullets , water , LRAD sound cannons , tear gas , and mace . In live video , the sound of rubber bullets being shot occasionally punctuate the obviously chaotic and desperate situation . This situation is rapidly unfolding , and this article will be updated as more pertinent information becomes available .
