I wrote about the upcoming crash of the Bakken oil field in my article -LRB- click here to read article -RRB- -- Published , NOV. 2013 : I ended the article with these sobering words : There are only so many drilling locations available and once they run out , the Great Bakken Field will become a BUST as the high decline rates will push overall oil production down the very same way it came up . As a result , companies started to lay off workers , and over the following months caused a massive exodus of people as jobs were eliminated . Nobody is exactly sure how many people have left the state , but some put estimates as high as 25,000 . This represents a 44 percent decline of the rental price in the market . This is much quicker than the U.S. Oil Industry or the Mainstream Media realize . And ... it 's much worse than that . Most are negative , heading lower . This is without making any profit . Additional wells will add to what price is required to retire the total debt . More about this in an upcoming interview . I am surprised how many individuals still do n't believe in Peak Oil even though I explained the Falling EROI - Energy Returned On Investment quite clearly . There just is n't the available High EROI - Energy Returned On Investment energy supplies to allow us to continue the same lifestyle we enjoyed in the past . This can only come via the best sources such as physical gold and silver . If individuals and countries have been acquiring physical gold and silver , they will be in better shape and will be able to enjoy more options than those who have been selling their gold and accumulating lots of debt and derivatives .
