Live-streams from across the Cannon Ball River showed police , including state troopers from Wisconsin , and what looked like National Guard troops entering the mostly abandoned encampment on Thursday morning , accompanied with armored vehicles and construction equipment . About 100 protesters remained in the camp on Wednesday , defying the deadline for evacuation ordered by North Dakota 's governor . The protest camp was set up north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation . The tribe has tried to stop the construction on the segment of the Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe , on grounds that it endangered their water supply . Thousands of environmental activists , Native Americans and even US military veterans have taken part in protests that began in March 2016 . All rights reserved . This website uses cookies .
