Wednesday 's deadline for the protesters to leave also may not spell the end of heavy law enforcement presence near where the Dallas-based developer is finishing the last big section of the pipeline , which will carry oil from North Dakota through the Dakotas and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois . The protest camp is on federal land in southern North Dakota between the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and the pipeline route . It has at times housed thousands of people , though it 's dwindled to just a couple hundred as the pipeline battle has largely moved into the courts . Governor Doug Burgum listed the same time and date in an emergency evacuation order last week . Large-scale arrests are possible at the camp Wednesday , said Morton County sheriff 's spokeswoman Maxine Herr , but she insists that 's not want authorities want . Though law enforcement and state officials in the past said they would n't forcibly evict protesters , they now cite the coming threat of spring flooding as a safety issue that requires clearing the camp . Morton County sheriff 's deputies can arrest people who wo n't leave . More than 700 protest-related arrests have occurred since August , though activity has waned recently . Other camps are popping up on private land in the area , including one the Cheyenne River Sioux has set up about a mile from the Oceti Sakowin camp . Officers in riot gear clashed again Wednesday with protesters near the Dakota Access pipeline , hitting dozens with pepper spray as they waded through waist-deep water in an attempt to reach property owned by the pipeline 's developer .

Once the main camp is cleared of people , cleanup of trash and debris that 's being coordinated by the tribal , state and federal governments will continue . More than 1,000 tonnes of waste had been removed by contractors as of early Tuesday , though dozens of semi-permanent structures remained , according to Herr . Dozens of abandoned vehicles also remained , according to George Kuntz , vice president of the North Dakota Towing Association . Law enforcement for months has maintained a staging area just north of the protest camp . With cleanup continuing , construction ongoing and protesters still in the area , it 's unclear when the operations centre will be shut down .
