On a distant planet named Pandora -LRB- Standing Rock -RRB- in the Alpha Centauri system -LRB- Dakota -RRB- , the Resources Development Administration of earth -LRB- See Graphic -RRB- , mines for a valuable mineral named unobtanium -LRB- Pipeline for Oil -RRB- . In the process they destroy sacred sites and victimize the indigenous Na ` vi -LRB- Sioux -RRB- . This brief plot summary of Avatar , the most money making movie of all-time , is indeed a story that has been lived again and again by indigenous people throughout the world . None have felt it as consistently as the Native American community in the United States . Time and time again , in trails irrigated by tears , where the pieces of countless broken treaties act as breadcrumbs for historians to find mass graves filled with the victims of genocide , Native American remain the victim . Victims of biological warfare enacted by diseased blankets , cultural rape masterminded by the machinations of laws like the Dawes Act , and an outright Holocaust , which best describes the systematic perfection of the killing machine by the time gold was discovered in California . Professor Klein at U.C. Berkeley once told me that he found use of the word Holocaust appropriate in two instances , namely what happened to the Jewish community during WWII and the wiping out of Native American nations in California specifically . This is sadly not a story of the past , because the genocide in many ways continues , beyond the sight of mass media coverage or of the average American 's consciousness . The Native-American individual in American has one of the lowest life expectancy rates . The ways in which administration has worked with corporations in and around reservations has further divested these communities . Outright abuse of the judicial system has targeted its leaders , just ask Leonard Peltier who still wallows in prison for a crime that most of the world knows he did n't commit . Finally cultural assimilation forced on by standardized education , discriminatory laws and practices have caused the final extinction of many cultures under the Native American umbrella . All of this is happening , and continues to happen and in this Standing Rock , not the Thanksgiving turkey , is a symbol for the plight of Native Americans . People have now died at Standing Rock , protesting a pipeline that has been planned to cut through sacred land . This is just like the plot of Avatar , and while the film is the best selling movie of all time , there has been a near media blackout of coverage for Standing Rock . And ignorance loaded in gun chambers , wielded by ignorants are deemed solutions . Hear the thunder , as the buffalo pound their fists into the earth causing your confusion . So your holiness is to be protected , while ours demolished , while its hidden from view . A graphic which shows who stands to gain from the Dakota Pipeline through Standing Rock . Many of my extended fam have been out in the protest , kept the prayer circles and have stood as human shields to impede the process of the machinery of sacred defilement . The police have been called in to enforce the pipeline and in the process have used water hoses in sub-freezing temperatures , rubber bullets , and other techniques to torture peaceful protestors . There have been many a sign for the people who stand as well , such as the return of the buffalo during a part of the protest and a joining of arms of many peoples from different nations as well as non-native stock , who stood together in solidarity against this defilement . People have used social media to try and check into Standing Rock , to show their solidarity as well . These are questions and the above graphic provides the answers . As always , in solidarity and peace . Mitakuye Oyasin .
