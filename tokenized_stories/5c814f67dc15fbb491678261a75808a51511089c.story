Tribal Council voted 8-1 in a staff directive approved on Oct. 13 to end the financial relationship . Tribal Council member Jack Giffen Jr. voted against the decision . The Tribal government is currently going through a transition period and the transferring of accounts should be accomplished by early 2018 . The Tribal government first employed Wells Fargo for banking services from 1996 to 2005 and then rehired the bank starting in 2013 . The Tribe started re-assessing its relationship with Wells Fargo earlier this year when the Finance Department issued a request for proposals for banking services . However , the statement is more important than the lost revenue . In late 2016 and early 2017 , the Dakota Access Pipeline project galvanized Indian Country as the Standing Rock Sioux Nation and volunteer water protectors protested the installation of an oil pipeline near the Sioux Reservation . Wells Fargo provided investment funding for Energy Transfer Partners , the owner of the project . She said she was happy to hear the news during the General Council meeting . Bank officials told Leno that the problems Wells Fargo experienced were on the retail side with personal accounts and that there was not an overlap and that individuals responsible for those problems were not involved with commercial account oversight . A bigger financial issue , however , still is being decided as Spirit Mountain Casino is currently reassessing its banking relationships on its regular four - to five-year schedule .
