All my relations . I honor you in this circle of life with me today . I am grateful for this opportunity to acknowledge you in this prayer ... To the Creator , for the ultimate gift of life , I thank you . To the mineral nation that has built and maintained my bones and all foundations of life experience , I thank you . To the plant nation that sustains my organs and body and gives me healing herbs for sickness , I thank you . To the animal nation that feeds me from your own flesh and offers your loyal companionship in this walk of life , I thank you . To the human nation that shares my path as a soul upon the sacred wheel of Earthly life , I thank you . To the Spirit nation that guides me invisibly through the ups and downs of life and for carrying the torch of light through the Ages . I thank you . To the Four Winds of Change and Growth , I thank you . You are all my relations , my relatives , without whom I would not live . We are in the circle of life together , co-existing , co-dependent , co-creating our destiny . One , not more important than the other . One nation evolving from the other and yet each dependent upon the one above and the one below . All of us a part of the Great Mystery . Thank you for this Life . It comes from the Lakota Nation and means all my relations . It is spoken during prayer and ceremony to invite and acknowledge all relatives to the moment . To most of us today , relative means a blood relation or another human in the family lineage . We have not been taught that an entity , other than human , could be a relative . Understanding this simple statement and contemplating it , could change your outlook on life forever . Sit with this statement , see the Truth in it . Everything is related because it all emanates from one source and has purpose . Truth can be found in Native philosophy , Buddhism , Christianity , Judism , Islam , all belief systems , because they are all related . I have studied Buddhism and found Christ . I have studied Native philosophy and found Buddha . I have studied Mother Nature and found self . Truth does not owe homage to humans . Humans owe homage to Truth . Thank you .
