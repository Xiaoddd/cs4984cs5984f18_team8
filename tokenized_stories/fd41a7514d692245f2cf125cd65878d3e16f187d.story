Every dollar you donate will go to supplies I am going to personally buy and deliver . A lot of you have asked me what I am doing for my 40th , well this is it . I may be able to get some people plane tickets if you 're short on resources , please let me know . My grandmother always told me if you want something done right , do it yourself - so do it myself I will ... We live in America . THIS DOES NOT SIT WELL WITH ME . I will not begin to act as an authority of the enviromental impact of the pipeline . Citizens who have had their rights stripped away for hundreds of year . I 'm going to visit the camps , find out what they need , and go get it for them . I hope you will help me on this trip , and that I will inspire others to help even more in the future . We are on our way to make one last delivery of supplies that we will give to the Tribe to use as needed . We are super thankful for all of the donations to date but we are n't stopping here . We will be at Standing Rock until at least Tuesday so every donation we get until then can be put towards helping the camps . Please try again . The consequences of their actions will be squarely on their shoulders . Not 1 cent of taxpayer money should be spent for this misdirected cause .
