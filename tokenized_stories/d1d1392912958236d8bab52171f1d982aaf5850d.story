Noah Kirsch Forbes Staff I mainly cover global wealth and entrepreneurs . Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin Demonstrators rally against the Dakota Access Pipeline in February in Chicago , Illinois . Warren , 61 , is the billionaire chairman of Energy Transfer Equity , a Dallas-based oil and gas heavyweight he cofounded in 1995 . Through a complex web of subsidiaries , the firm is the principal owner of the Dakota pipeline . The project has drawn considerable public opposition in the last year , most famously at protest sites near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota . Warren , for his part , blames the upheaval on underhanded environmental organizations with well-coordinated social media campaigns . Warren also contests the most serious allegations leveled against the pipeline , namely that it infringes on tribal territory and irresponsibly threatens the water supply of communities alongside its path . Protesters , meanwhile , have contended for months that the oil line , which passes beneath a lake relied upon by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , could leak and contaminate a critical source of drinking water . They also maintain that the project traverses sacred Native American burial grounds . Demonstrations against construction gained momentum and scale early last year . In November , public awareness further expanded as activists at Standing Rock accused local law enforcement of employing excessive crowd control tactics ; the use of water cannons in sub-freezing temperatures on November 20 drew particular scrutiny . That decision was reversed last month following an executive order from President Donald Trump on January 24 , four days after his inauguration . The project , an Energy Transfer representative says , is now nearly complete . Warren , plainly upset over the nagging political maelstrom and resultant construction setbacks , is relieved to be done with bureaucratic impediments and is confident that his company will soon recover from any public relations damage . The firm currently boasts more than 70,000 miles of pipeline gridded across the country . As a result , his net worth has nearly tripled . Sometimes , controversy pays .
