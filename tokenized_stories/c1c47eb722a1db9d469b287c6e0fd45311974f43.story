Clay Masters of Iowa Public Radio reported diesel leaking from a 12-inch underground pipe was initially spotted in a farm field in north-central Worth County , Iowa , on Wednesday morning .

Vansteenburg said the diesel had not reached nearby Willow Creek or a wildlife protection area . The Two-Way Utility Giant PG&E Convicted of Violating Gas Pipeline Safety Laws Maps of the pipeline were redacted from the public version of the report . The leak occurred when the pipeline ruptured and diesel sprayed out , a spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources told the Register . More than a foot of snow has fallen since Monday in some parts of north-central Iowa . Another pipeline operated by Magellan leaked near Decatur , Neb. , last October , according to the Omaha World-Herald , which reported that a ruptured pipe carrying anhydrous ammonia killed one person and led to the evacuation of 23 households . In November , the company temporarily shut down its pipelines in order to inspect them after an earthquake in Cushing , Okla. , damaged several buildings , as we reported . The project also created a map of all the pipeline spills reported since 2010 . That works out to around one inspector for every 5,000 miles of pipe .
