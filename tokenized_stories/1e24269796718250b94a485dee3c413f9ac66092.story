RELATED : US Court Rules in Favor of Chevron in Ecuador Pollution Case In the Ecuadorean Amazon , one of the most biodiverse areas of the world , the energy titan poisoned 5 million acres of pristine habitat and destroyed the health and livelihood of tens of thousands of Indigenous people . by biologist Paula Carrera , Martin investigates how oil accumulates on the soil , creating a film on the surface of the water , until volatile particles evaporate and go to the atmosphere when the temperature rises . During the process of decomposition , the crude separates from the heavy metals , which go directly into the water below , while the oily part remains on the surface .

Martin also visited one of the open pits supposed to have been cleaned up over two decades ago , but which are obviously still filled with crude . Worse , Chevron built pipes that were directly dumping the waste into the natural water ecosystem of the Amazon in a bid to maintain the level of the pool , and thereby maintain the illusion that the system of evacuation of the pools were under control . However , the overflow has been contaminating the rivers and swamps below . The contamination did not only affect the vegetation but also the many Indigenous communities living in the area , which were left with no water to drink , no food to eat and no land to cultivate . The area records abnormal high rates of stomach cancer , birth defects , leukemia .
