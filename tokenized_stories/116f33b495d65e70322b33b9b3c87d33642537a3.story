Many of us see how trauma-informed care and mental health first aid play a role in healing . It is important to understand that many people have experienced trauma in the past that play a role in their beliefs . It must be mentioned that Natives bring a whole new need for trauma-informed care , information that is needed at the table , as they and their ancestors have experienced historical trauma for generations . Much as those in Europe whose relatives suffered through the Holocaust , trauma can be passed on genetically from parent to child . Native Americans have experienced not only trauma , but circumstances that also hinder the healing that is needed for recovery . So , as we move forward in developing programming and care , we must also remember to make decisions that will benefit all peoples instead of pushing others , like the American Indians and Alaskan Natives , out by not understanding what they and their ancestry have experienced . While at Standing Rock , I made several observations that I want to share with you . September 8 , 2016 I had come from Fargo after a presentation , traveled through Mandan , SD , South N. Highway 6 , onto 24 East to 1806 , which was just a few miles from the Sacred Stone Camp . The drive was nice , but on Highway 6 , while I was getting close to Highway 24 , I noticed a large dark line across the land , stretching diagonally from the NW to the SE . The Dakota Access Pipeline Project -LRB- DAPL -RRB- will run a 1,172 mile pipeline carrying crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois . The pipeline will travel across the sacred sites and traditional lands of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribes in North and South Dakota . It will also travel under the tribe 's primary source of drinking water , the Missouri River . As I saw this dark line through the land , it reminded me of the railroad long ago , crossing Native lands for the first time as an Iron Horse . Metal brings war , I thought , as it makes sense . I began to feel sorry for Mother Earth and what people were doing to her . Oil has leaked in many places , I thought , polluting the lands of our descendants to come . I wondered what they would say to the builders , politicians , and leaders of the U.S. , when that comes . I could swear I smelled sickness in the air , so pungent and overwhelming . The image of a black snake popped into my head , as I remembered a dream . As I crested the hill on Highway 1806 , I saw a spectacular view , which quickly made me think of the long history of Native American blood that was spilled , trying to protect the land from the conquering Europeans . I quickly set my mind again to take in the site and memories to tell my children , grandchildren , and family . As I crossed the river bridge , I thought , this is like a large pow-wow grounds . I saw the first gate and tried to enter , but they told me to go through the other gate , so I turned around and went a bit further down the road . As I pulled in , I asked where I could park for the rest of the day . They pointed and said , right over there , but be careful , as some areas are muddy . I said thanks and went to park . I got out and heard the beautiful songs playing , and every once in a while , heard a speaker on the mic , stating for all to be careful near the trees and warning people to be careful near the river . I told myself , this is much like a pow-wow . I began walking towards different flags blowing in the wind , which were attached atop a pole or campsite . I ran into an older man , making Medicine Wheels . I greeted him , in which he looked up , then smiled and answered me warmly . After a bit of talk , I wandered on to meet others and was in awe at how many different flags were flying . Real American flags , I thought . Oh , how so many have spilled blood in the name of peace and freedom for this country . The red stripes represent blood , I thought . In my culture , dark blue can represent things that are backward , or not right . I made my way towards a large campsite , and as I approached , I realized the people there were from Canada . I then began to scan around and see all the colors of man , black , white , yellow , and red , just like our Medicine Wheel . These people had so much more in common that one might think . If only more people would stop putting the wants of the few over the needs of the many . I stopped by some young adults from California who had come in support of stopping the pipeline . They were not Native , so I spoke to them and let them know that I was happy to see them here . We are all brothers and sisters under one Creator , I thought , as I smiled to them . I then heard someone singing a Native song not too far away . One of the Californian companions expressed how beautiful the songs here sound . I nodded in agreement and asked if they sang a lot here . Thousands have joined the Standing Rock Sioux and other Native Americans in opposing the construction of the pipeline . I walked to where I heard the singing and found some horses were there . The horses just looked up while they were eating and came a bit closer . I said hello . I remember riding horses and breaking them as a young boy . Sand kicked up , mane swaying , hair swaying behind , foot and hoof digging in the sand , and the beating of two hearts , as they both cross the finish line , with the fast walking man ahead . Stories told to me in my youth still wander in my memories . I turned , thinking how nice this place looks , the clouds , the sky , our standing brothers and sisters , the trees . I began walking towards the main area , where the speaker was . I looked at the cook shack , with women working on food . It smelled great . As I inhaled the smell of cooking food , my face turned , smelling the aromas . Then I spotted a Veteran from Michigan I knew . Another two Veterans came closer , as we began telling short war stories , and making fun each other . Then laughter . We are the only people required to have pedigrees . We laughed . We all agreed . We may be from different tribes , but we are all still related . Time has a strange way of making people forget that very important point . They said that they had left . Many were here having ceremonies and prayers , but later left . They said the pipes are brought out each morning to pray , though . I told them of the land I had seen where they had already gone through and the land lay upturned . They said , yes , the black snake is going through the land . They mentioned that this land was once where Natives camped long ago . This is where ancestors were buried , along that whole ridge , pointing up above the river , then across this whole area . I remembered a teaching I learned as a young boy . Artifacts should never be taken out of a burial site , unless the land falls apart on its own , like next to a river . Then one person said , long ago , after people were dying from blankets given to them with sickness on it , many were buried here . I remembered the tall heaps of buffalo skulls so high like a pyramid , after Gen. Philip H. Sheridan ordered Maj. All Veterans were called to a meeting , in which we walked into an older military tent . All the Veterans gathered in a circle ; then the oldest one said a prayer and we began introducing ourselves to the others . We were told the history of how this camp came to be , as the leader had been there from the start . He said that every morning the Veterans and pipe carriers bring their pipes to the gathering place outside , with smudging of sage to smoking and prayer . Yet , security people said they had pipe bombs , and were lighting the fuses . I remembered a teaching I learned as a young boy . Artifacts should never be taken out of a burial site ... It 's so disrespectful that people would do this to our ancestors . He went on and told of and elderly woman who was approached while she was guarding a gravesite , and thrown to the ground , as the security said she was interfering . When things like this happen to those who have harmed her and their families , karma will likely not even come to their minds . He told us how the security dogs were . A young girl had been bitten in the face by a security dog . She had just returned from the doctor that evening and was speaking . It was explained that as the security sprayed people with pepper spray , the wind picked up and blew it back at the security and dogs , making the dogs bite their masters . The Creator and Mother Earth are helping , I thought . He then told us of long ago when people were given blankets with sickness on them ; people here got sick , and this spot is where many were brought . There are ancestors buried all along the hills and around this area . Long ago , a tribal man had asked a person to document this , as one day , it would be needed . A local person has that record , and we are prepared to show it . Probably thrown back into the ground with the pipeline , we guess . This reminded me of colonial-era germ warfare . To think that Hitler learned his tactics from early colonial European-Americans ' tactics against Native Americans . Our people watched as the pipeline people put poison in and around the holes of the prairie dogs . There is an area of trees near , where the eagles come each year . Those prairie dogs are part of their natural food source , and we found many eagles that were very ill after eating the poisoned prairie dogs . We gathered them up and found a veterinarian who could help them . Some were held at a zoo till they were better , and we released them the other day . Now , we are seeing the local buffalo over there grazing . This is our national bird being poisoned by Americans . We Natives consider them sacred . But even these other relatives are our sacred relatives , as all life is sacred . The politicians have never taken our concerns seriously , and it is the same today . Our ancestors have died protecting this country , and if needed , we will do the same . I recalled the horrible smell . This reminds me of a paradox that has come to mind lately . As we left the tent , we walked out to people dancing , much like a pow-wow . A group from Washington state was singing , while people were dancing , yet many were not dressed in their fancy regalia . Just then a Veteran brother came up and said how he loved the feeling he had experienced since he arrived . He said that he had never known how seriously the Natives took spirituality and practiced it in everything we did . He seemed to have found this inner spirit waiting to be uplifted from the darker thoughts , feelings , and emotions one may carry after being discharged from the military . In the end , we parted , and as I walked to my car , I stopped , looked up into the stars and began to pray for the people . When I was finishing , a man was standing beside me and then began to speak to me . He introduced me to an elder woman , who did not look her age . She spoke of how she grew up here , as she and her family had been there since the beginning of the protests . She said that many of the surrounding farmers came by in support of the natives here . They had said that even though they did not have the courage to stand against the pipeline , they were happy we were . They apologized at how we and our ancestors were treated and recognized that this was really our lands . They said that they would be praying for us all . This was so great to hear , as I thought about people of the past who did not share the same compassion for our people , like some did long ago . As I drove away , I still kept praying , and as I passed over the hill , looking into the mirror , I felt as if I was leaving friends and family behind . This felt so much like when I left the military and different people in my life . As I sit here ending this , I say a prayer , as I do at each night . Thanks for sharing from a native perspective .
