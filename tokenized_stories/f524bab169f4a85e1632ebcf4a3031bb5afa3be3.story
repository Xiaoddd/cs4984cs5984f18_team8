With a light-touch regulatory attitude in Washington , D.C. , under President Donald Trump 's business-friendly administration , stars had aligned for Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners to turn the corner . Yet , with a little over four months left on the calendar , billionaire Kelcy Warren 's empire that owns at least 71,000 miles of pipelines is still trying to emerge from the chaos . Trump introduced a new wrinkle by saying pipelines should be built with U.S. steel . Warren , Energy Transfer 's chairman and CEO , was not available for an interview request for this report . A large spill , tainted well water and demolition of a historic house have been among the problems accompanying the projects . Among the good news , Trump is pushing for U.S. energy independence and borrowing remains cheap . Martin also highlighted efforts to get banks to stop lending money for pipeline projects . Protester Robert Solache prays in front of Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren 's Dallas home , upset about the Army Corps of Engineers ' approval of the final section of Dakota Access pipeline on Feb. 7 , 2017 . They described a rosier second half of the year , in which new pipelines would soon be transporting natural gas and liquid fuels , and a Dakota Access that will continue operating while under federal review . Energy Transfer shares have fallen 18 percent this year and about 34 percent in the past 12 months . Here are some issues the company faces . Dakota Access pipeline It took just a few weeks for Trump to deliver on his pledge to expedite the Dakota Access project that was tangled up in regulatory red tape . Federal officials cleared the way for completion of the final segment of the pipeline that cut under Lake Oahe in North Dakota . Supporters and opponents are submitting briefs to the judge , who is scheduled to decide in September whether to allow Dakota Access to continue transporting oil from North Dakota to pipelines leading to the Gulf Coast . Supporters of the project argued that several pipelines were already going under the lake without environmental effects . This year , there also have been minor leaks in the pipeline that opponents say prove their point . And there has been small-scale sabotage by opponents . Made in the USA Trump emphasized fossil fuels and infrastructure as priorities while on the campaign trail . That was welcome news to Warren , a major GOP donor who backed Trump . What he is n't too happy about is Trump 's insistence that pipeline builders use U.S.-made steel . In March , Energy Transfer pushed back in a letter to the Commerce Department . The company has gotten a pass on its current projects . Steel had already been purchased for the Rover and Mariner East 2 pipelines . And Dakota Access was complete , aside from the controversial short segment in South Dakota . Anne Keller , a pipelines analyst for Wood Mackenzie , said it 's hard to know what to make of the White House 's announcement because there have been few details to parse . You have to publish them , get comment and go back and forth . Pennsylvania environmental regulators ordered an Energy Transfer subsidiary to stop some work on Mariner East 2 , a 350-mile natural gas liquids pipeline through Ohio , West Virginia and Pennsylvania . Last week , the company , opponents and regulators agreed to allow work to continue . But some sites will get re-evaluations and need new approval after pipeline work tainted some Pennsylvania water wells . Environmental groups also documented dozens of spills on the project . In West Virginia on Thursday , state regulators lifted their order stopping construction of two sections of the 713-mile Rover pipeline , after several environmental violations were fixed . State authorities found that the project had created erosion problems in some creeks . The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also stopped construction on parts of the pipeline after about 2 million gallons of drilling slurry leaked into Ohio wetlands . The Rover pipeline was designed to deliver natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shales to the rest of the U.S. and Canada . The Associated Press contributed to this report .
