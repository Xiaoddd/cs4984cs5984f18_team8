She was raised in Denver , CO which she permanently resides . She is a human rights advocate , an organizer , and community leaders with in the Oglala Lakota tribe . She was raised by her beloved mother Troylynn Yellow Wood . Her mother raised her children in traditional Lakota values , grounded with a deep connection to Mother Earth . Troylynn was also an advocate for social and environmental justices , and taught her children to stand up for The People . As a result Red Fawn was drawn to Standing Rock to Standing up for 1st Amendment Rights . While there she worked as a trained medic , continuously rescuing and caring for fellow Water Protectors . Red Fawn always taught others the importance of standing peacefully and prayerfully . Thousands of other Water Protectors stood in prayers to defend the rights of her people , our Mother Earth , and all things sacred . Unfortunately , Red Fawn was identified as a leader amongst the Water Protectors . She was targeted and unjustly arrested . Initial state charges were replaced by three federal charges . Based on these charges , Red Fawn has now been incarcerated in North Dakota jails for over 20 months . During this time , much was revealed about the tactics of the corporate and government forces which had targeted Red Fawn and were working collaboratively against her and other Standing Rock Water Resisters -- forces which included pipeline owner Energy Transfer Partners , its private security force TigerSwan . All evidence which linked a close person to Red Fawn as being an informant was denied by the judge . In January , 2018 , feeling pressed into a corner by these efforts and facing the possibility of life in prison following a trial in which she did not believe justice would prevail , Red Fawn reluctantly entered into a plea agreement . Through this agreement , the most serious charge was dropped and her sentence was capped at no more than ten years , with the prosecution recommending seven years .
