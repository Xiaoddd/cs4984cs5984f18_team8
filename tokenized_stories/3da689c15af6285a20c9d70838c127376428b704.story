The Army Corps of Engineers declined to grant the permit needed to finish the Dakota Access Pipeline earlier this month , but the decision has left many activists unconvinced the fight is over . Young Peoples Action Coalition , which was co-founded by Northfield local Cliff Martin in an effort to organize high school students around various causes , presented its case at Northfield High School Tuesday and took a group of students through what they called dangers of pipelines . The tribe argues it was not adequately consulted in the historical surveying process . Chase Ingraham , a ninth-grader at Arcadia Charter School , told the group about the militarization of police forces he saw during his three trips to Standing Rock . After helping set up one camp , he told the group of how he gained respect and admiration for the conditions Native Americans lived in , enduring years of maltreatment by the federal government . Some who attended had not heard the details of the controversy surrounding the pipeline , like 10th-grader Diana Montero . Martin ended the presentation with ways they could help , though traveling to to Standing Rock was not one of them due to current temperatures and potentially being a burden to those there . Wells Fargo and Bank of America are two of the banks investing in the pipeline and are now facing added scrutiny . The coalition also has connections with Arcadia Charter School and more than 10 other high schools around the Twin Cities metro , made while attending protests . Martin said that organizers tend not to invest in high school students , perhaps assuming apathy . The group at NHS , which might join with other high school students , is planning to drop banners in some of the banks investing in the pipeline in the next couple days while the coalition continues to keep the conversation going .
