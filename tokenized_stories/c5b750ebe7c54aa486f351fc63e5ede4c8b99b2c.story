I write this having seen and heard the airport TV reports of the trauma that continues to dominate US politics , as well as those in many other countries . They came down from their mountain hideaways to meet us and to spread their message of the need for change . We were surrounded by breathtaking scenes : the emerald Caribbean and palm-fringed beaches , the Sierra Nevada mountains that rise 18,000 feet up from the ocean to glacier-covered peaks , the rain forests , and the sparkling rivers that cascade from the glaciers into the Caribbean . These up-til-now illusive people totally opened the doors to their homes and hearts to us . Their Mamos told us of how their ancestors had fled up the valleys of the glacial rivers into the mountains . Choosing to remain isolated for centuries , they developed a new dream of the Earth , a revelation that balances the brilliant potential of the human mind , heart and spirit with all the forces of nature . They have shared their history with others . What was unique this time was their enthusiasm for embracing this group on very personal levels . We traveled many miles down from their community and stood with them on the bank of a glacial river where it meets the Caribbean while the young man gently offered the river the commitments we had all made and blown into tiny pieces of cotton from a local plant . The Kogi message , although similar to the one I received more than 40 years ago when I was a Peace Corps volunteer living with the Shuar in the Amazon and then again 20 years later from the Achuar , is more urgent now than ever . It is the message that birthed nonprofits , including Dream Change and the Pachamama Alliance . It is the message of the North American indigenous people and all those who join them at Standing Rock . Now , flying back from the Kogi , I feel rejuvenated and recommitted to spreading the message that is the underlying principle behind that economic shapeshift that needs to happen . We know we are facing severe crises . We know the climate is changing and that we humans are devastating the air , water , and land that support all life on this planet . We know that our government is incapable or unwilling to turn things around . It is easy to be discouraged . EXCEPT we also now know what our Elder Siblings understood long ago , that We the People must transform ourselves and our institutions . That is the message of the Kogi . It is the message of the Shuar , the Achuar , the people at Standing Rock and all our brothers and sisters around the globe .
