As the youth and their support crew approached the camp , buffalo came over the hill in their direction , in what appeared to be a greeting , as Kandi Mossett of the Indigenous Environmental Network said in a Facebook video . For 18-year-old Ricky Sanderson , one of the Canadian walkers , this walk is also about his local battles . Canada also has two pipeline projects , the expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline and the replacement of the Enbridge Line 3 Pipeline . Oceti Sakowin youth did at least three runs in 2015 . Their longest was to Washington , D.C. , from Standing Rock in July to deliver a petition demanding an end to the pipeline . is published by Race Forward , a national organization that advances racial justice through research , media and practice .
