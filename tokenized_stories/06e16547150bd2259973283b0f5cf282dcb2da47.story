Blake NicholsonAssociated Press A federal judge said Tuesday that he 'll decide within a week whether to temporarily halt construction of the final section of the Dakota Access pipeline over claims that it violates the religious rights of two Indian tribes . U.S. District Judge James Boasberg told lawyers at a hearing that he wants to issue a ruling before oil begins flowing in the pipeline , which could be weeks away . Boasberg is considering a request by the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes to order the Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw permission to lay pipe under Lake Oahe in North Dakota . The pipeline has prompted months of protests and hundreds of arrests . Ducheneaux said the judge appeared to be questioning the sincerity of the tribes ' beliefs and stressed there was no other source of clean water available near the tribe 's reservation . Authorities cleared a protest camp where opponents of the Dakota Access oil pipeline had gathered for the better part of a year , searching tents and huts and arresting dozens of holdouts who had defied a government order to leave . When they filed the lawsuit last summer , the tribes argued that the pipeline threatens Native American cultural sites and their water supply . Their religion argument is new , however , and both the Corps and the company building the pipeline , Energy Transfer Partners , argue that the delay in raising it is a reason for Boasberg to reject the argument . Most of the Dakota Access pipeline opponents abandoned their protest camp Wednesday ahead of a government deadline to get off the federal land , and authorities moved to arrest some who defied the order in a final show of dissent . The camp has been home to demonstrators for nearly a year as they ... Representing the pipeline , lawyer David Debold noted that the lake has only existed since the 1950s and questioned how the purity of its water could be part of longstanding tribal religious beliefs . Earlier this month , Boasberg declined the tribes ' request to order an immediate halt to the pipeline construction , ruling that as long as oil was n't flowing through the pipeline , there was no imminent harm to the tribes . Boasberg 's decision on the matter wo n't be the end of the court battle , as no final decision has been made on the merits of the tribes ' overall claims . Both tribes also have asked Boasberg to overturn the federal permission for the Lake Oahe crossing and to bar the Corps from granting permission in the future . The judge wo n't rule until at least April . Hundreds and sometimes thousands of pipeline opponents who sided with tribal opposition to the pipeline camped on federal land near the drill site for months , often clashing with police . There have been about 750 arrests in the region since August . Authorities last week closed the camp in advance of spring flooding season and set up roadblocks to prevent protesters from returning . Work under Lake Oahe had been held up in the courts until President Donald Trump last month instructed the Corps to advance construction . The Army is involved because its engineering branch manages the river and its system of hydroelectric dams , which is owned by the federal government . Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners began drilling under the lake Feb. 8 . The pipeline could be operating as early as Monday and no later than early April , according to Scherman .
