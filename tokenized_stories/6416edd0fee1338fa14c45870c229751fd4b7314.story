Bakken shale-focused producer Oasis Petroleum -LRB- NYSE : OAS -RRB- rewarded investors handsomely last year . The company rode the crude oil rally for most of the year before breaking away in the late fall : OAS data by YCharts . Fueling that sharp rebound was a transaction that set up the company to grow at an accelerated rate over the next few years , even at lower oil prices . As a result , the company expects to deliver robust production and cash flow growth this year , which could fuel even more gains in the stock as long as oil prices do n't falter . Oasis Petroleum took a very cautious approach entering 2016 . That lower spending rate meant that the company would not be able to drill enough wells to keep its production from declining . Oasis Petroleum , however , beat those expectations due to stronger well performance and lower costs . Oasis was able to buy the acreage because SM Energy needed the cash to acquire more land in the Permian Basin . Image source : Hess . As a result of its drilling momentum last year , and the SM Energy acreage acquisition , Oasis Petroleum expects to ramp up its drilling activities in 2017 . That is a compelling growth rate , especially for the Bakken , where drilling returns are not quite as high as some of the other shale plays . However , the company could make up more lost ground by pushing its costs down and well productivity up , so its drilling returns can rival those of the Permian Basin or STACK and SCOOP plays . That would enable the company to grow even faster , which would certainly catch the eyes of investors . Investor takeaway Oasis Petroleum enjoyed quite a run last year , as the company 's ability to cut costs and improve well productivity put it in the position where it could restart its growth engine at lower oil prices . As that growth materializes this year , it should provide the stock with the fuel needed to continue its recovery . Meanwhile , if the company can get a combination of even higher oil prices and a further improvement in drilling returns , it would have enough lighter fluid to ignite another big rally in 2017 .
