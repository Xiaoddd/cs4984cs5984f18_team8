` script ' , ` twitter-wjs ' -RRB- ; Dear Water Protectors , Relatives and Friends : Let me introduce myself . My name is Jean Roach , of the Mnicoujou Lakota from the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe . I am a board member of the International Leonard Peltier Defense Committee -LRB- ILPDC -RRB- . I have introduced myself to many representatives who have been to Standing Rock in support of our fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- . There are many Leonard Peltier Supporters staying at the Standing Rock camp called Oceti Sakowin . We are asking all Water Protectors and allies who supported the FIGHT against the DAPL to send tribal resolutions , or letters of support to President Obama . Many Water Protectors have witnessed the destruction of our sacred sites by DAPL . Twenty-six ancestral grave sites and numerous religious alters have been desecrated by their bulldozers . This sacred site is where we remember and honor Leonard Peltier . For generations , the Oceti Sakowin Nations -LRB- Seven Councils of Fires -RRB- and their allies have been and still are under attack by colonizers which include both private corporations and government policies . In the past , tribal Nations have fought Railway systems , Mining companies , the United States federal government , and their representatives over land , and natural resources , which were promised through Treaties . Today , we are fighting the same colonial battle , but now it is against a billion-dollar corporation -LRB- DAPL -RRB- , vigilantes , and US officials who continue to break these treaties to steal land . For these reasons Amnesty International has labeled him a Political Prisoner . The genocide of Nations has created criminal acts which include targeting people , or persons and imprisoned them based on political views , and or revenge . The FIGHT is bigger than the DAPL pipeline because it is associated to generations of genocidal attacks for land and resources . Understanding genocide and political prisoners like Crazy Horse , Sitting Bull and Leonard Peltier and their fight for JUSTICE includes 1800s fight against gold mining and the 1970s fight against Uranium mining both in the Black Hills area that are in violation of both the 1851 and the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties . During the late 1800s , they were targeted for their participation at the Greasy Grass Battle -LRB- Battle of Little Big Horn -RRB- which included eliminating the 7th Calvery . Many Warriors suffered in US Prisons where they were severely beaten and or killed . DAPL has hired numerous agitators who come into the camps to cause trouble and spread rumors . The mainstream media served as an arm of genocide to confuse the general public on the TRUE issues . Definite understanding of the vital importance of freeing Leonard Peltier by Executive Clemency will HELP promote a sense of Justice and start to neutralize an uneven justice system . Today , Leonard Peltier has suffered for more than 40 yrs in prison and has been incarcerated based on his beliefs as a member of the American Indian Movement . His participation at Oglala 75 and for other actions that demanded equal treatment for Indigenous Nations . Leonard is a 72-year-old elder who suffers from diabetes and has an aortic aneurysm and in need of specialized medical treatment . We can help Leonard come home to his family and meet his grandchildren and other family members he has not ever met .
