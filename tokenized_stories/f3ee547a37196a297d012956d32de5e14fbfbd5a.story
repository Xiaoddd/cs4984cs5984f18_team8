View this email in your browser IMPACT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP 'S DAPL ACTION TAKEN YESTERDAY Yesterday , Tuesday , January 24 , under the pretense of serving the nation , President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum telling the Secretary of the Army to take several actions related to the DAPL pipeline . This was not an Executive Order , as some initially thought , but rather a Memorandum that carries less force . That 's why we 're calling on pipeline fighters everywhere to continue our campaign to flood the Army Corps with calls asking that it not only completes its announced Environmental Impact Statement -LRB- EIS -RRB- , but expands the study to include the entire pipeline route through Iowa . It does NOT grant immediate approval . The remaining questions are 1 -RRB- how fast will the Army Corps act and 2 -RRB- will the Standing Rock Sioux act to block any action with a temporary restraining order . Coalition members gathered last summer at Sylvia Spalding Rodgers ' family farm along the South Skunk River near Dakota Access ' Bakken pipeline crossing .
