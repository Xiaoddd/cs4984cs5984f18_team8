Matika Wilbur On Tuesday afternoon the Canadian government approved the expansion of a pipeline that will triple the flow of tar sands oil between Alberta and an export facility on the Salish Sea . There 's good reason to say so : the pipeline expansion will carry 890,000 barrels of oil per day . That 's 420,000 more barrels than the Dakota Access pipeline and 60,000 more barrels than the proposed Keystone XL pipeline . The new pipeline expansion will also increase the number of oil tankers in the Salish Sea by a factor of seven . And those tankers will be carrying a type of oil that is particularly destructive to marine environments . Tar sands oil , unlike the type of crude fracked from the Bakken , is heavy and sinks to the ocean floor . It 's nearly impossible to clean up , and environmentalists say that the traffic from the oil tankers alone will further endanger Puget Sound 's resident killer whale populations . But the Standing Rock North characterization holds true for another reason , too . Tribes in British Columbia and Washington State are on the front lines of this fight , and they may be the only people with the standing to stop the continued destruction of a body of water stewarded by both Canadians and Washingtonians . The Tsleil-Waututh Nation in British Columbia has been fighting the Kinder Morgan pipeline for years . The pipeline terminus is located directly across a waterway from tribal land , just north of Vancouver , and tribal leaders say that approving the pipeline infringes on Aboriginal rights . Three years ago , all four tribes stood in front of Canada 's National Energy Board and explained that expanding the pipeline would threaten their fishing livelihoods . Swinomish Indian Tribal Community chairman Brian Cladoosby , who told the board that an oil tanker had once plowed through a Swinomish fisherman 's net , said that he was n't just there on behalf of Native communities . US tribes do n't have the same legal standing with the Canadian government that First Nations do . But Earthjustice attorney Kristen Boyles says that the Canadian government 's pipeline decision still ignored US treaties between tribal nations and the US government . Fred Felleman , whale biologist and Port of Seattle commissioner , says he believes tribes are the only groups left that have the power to challenge the Canadian government 's decision .
