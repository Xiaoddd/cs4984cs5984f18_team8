The protestors say the project endangers the climate . Members of First Nations communities are contesting the pipeline in court , because half of it crosses their unceded territory . The arrests were mostly peaceful . Among the protestors arrested and charged was Romilly Cavanaugh , a former environmental engineer who once worked for Trans Mountain , which is now part of Kinder Morgan . Cavanaugh strongly disagrees with this . Tanker spills pose an additional risk , Cavanaugh says . Kinder Morgan says the company has robust technology for preventing and cleaning up spills , but this is simply not correct , Cavanaugh maintains . Very little has changed since then . It was n't very well known at that time , certainly amongst people in the public . If we want change , we have to stand up .
