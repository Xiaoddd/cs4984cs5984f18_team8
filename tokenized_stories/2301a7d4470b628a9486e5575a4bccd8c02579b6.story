Antifa Cracked His Head Open With a Bat . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said on Sunday it turned down a permit for a controversial pipeline project running through North Dakota , in a victory for Native Americans and climate activists who have protested against the project for several months . A celebration erupted at the main protest camp in Cannon Ball , North Dakota , where the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and others have been protesting the 1,172-mile -LRB- 1,885-km -RRB- Dakota Access Pipeline for months . The line , owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP , had been complete except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe , a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River . That stretch required an easement from federal authorities , which delayed a decision on the permit twice , in an effort to consult further with the tribe . In a statement , Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II thanked activists for their support in the protest effort . It is unclear what the pipeline route will be , however , and any route would still likely need to cross the Missouri River , probably upstream of Lake Oahe and closer to the state capital of Bismarck . Many pipelines travel under U.S. waterways already , and pipe is considered a safer way to transport crude oil than rail . This is big-government decision-making at its worst . I look forward to putting this anti-energy presidency behind us . Contributed by Tyler Durden of Zero Hedge . On a long enough timeline the survival rate for everyone drops to zero .
