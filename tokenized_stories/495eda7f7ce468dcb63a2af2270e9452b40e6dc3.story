Since Unicef has only included verified reports of injury , death and recruitment , the actual figures are likely to be far higher . Coping mechanisms for Syrian children and their families are also deteriorating rapidly , warned the report , whether they are in Syria or beyond its borders . Families are increasingly taking extreme measures just to survive , often pushing children into early marriage and child labour in order to attain financial security . Children in more than two-thirds of households are working to support their families , some in extremely harsh conditions unfit even for adults , said Unicef . I want to leave my house . Nearly half knew children working at checkpoints or barracks . Almost 300,000 children are living under siege and are largely cut off from humanitarian aid , according to Unicef . More than 2.3 million child refugees are in Turkey , Lebanon , Jordan , Egypt and Iraq . Meanwhile , refugee children in Lebanon can work up to 10-hour days selling gum and flowers , or simply begging , a report last year found . Nearly 2 million children in Syria are out of school , with roughly one-third of all schools unusable due to destruction , damage , or use for shelter or military purposes , according to Unicef . An additional half a million Syrian children are out of school in neighbouring countries , said Touma . Syrian children are nonetheless united in their thirst for education , according to Touma , who pointed to the hundreds who study Arabic , maths and English in an underground cave in Idlib province . School infrastructure has been devastated , teacher-flight is widespread , and students are at risk of being targeted on their way to school . I dream of a Syria without a war so we can go home . Unicef has called for a political solution to the conflict in Syria and an immediate end to all grave violations against children , with those committing such violations to be held accountable .
