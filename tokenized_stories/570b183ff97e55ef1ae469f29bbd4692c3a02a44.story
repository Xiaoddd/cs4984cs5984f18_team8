A connection between Casitas and Calleguas districts would need a much longer , more costly pipe . The need is clear . But other water agencies said they also needed some help .

Instead , they likely would need a dedicated pipeline that would be about three times longer than the proposed connection to Ventura . In the meantime , Mulligan said , the smaller project could help the drought-stressed Casitas and Ventura areas could make use of their shared state water allocation . The project basics Calleguas buys water from the Metropolitan Water District in Los Angeles , which has a pipeline that runs from Castaic Lake north of Santa Clarita through the San Fernando Valley . The district has its own pipes to carry water the rest of the way to its service area . About seven miles shy of Ventura , the Calleguas system ends at a hydroelectric generator station near Camarillo . He and the other general managers involved in the project spoke at a crowded Casitas board meeting . The imported water could go into Ventura and the city then would not take water from the lake , he said . Another option may be to build a pump station to move water uphill into the rest of the Casitas service area . But those details and how the state water would actually be used still to be worked out and negotiated , the agencies said .

While the initial analysis of the Casitas-Calleguas pipeline likely will wrap up in the next several weeks , the entire study likely will take a couple years .
