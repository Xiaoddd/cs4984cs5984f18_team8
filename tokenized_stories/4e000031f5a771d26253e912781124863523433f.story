The NIWRC submitted comments on the Environmental Impact Statement -LRB- EIS -RRB- on January 26 , 2017 , eight days after the Corps initiated the EIS comment period on January 18 , 2017 , and thirteen days before the Corps terminated the EIS process on February 8 , 2017 . In its submitted Comments , NIWRC provided the Army Corps with its views on : the unconsidered risks that would result from the Army Corps granting the easement without adequately considering the public interest implications of the proposed pipeline . Specifically , the Army Corps must consider the increased levels of violence Native women and children in the Bakken region will face if the pipeline is permitted to cross the Missouri River at Lake Oahe and commence operations . Today , North Dakota produces more oil for export than any other State . From 2005 to 2009 alone , the Bakken oil boom brought in 100,000 new workers to work temporary jobs in the oil field .
