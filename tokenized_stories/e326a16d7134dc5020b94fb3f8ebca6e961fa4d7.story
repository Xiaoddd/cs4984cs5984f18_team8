By Georgina Gustin , InsideClimate News Jan 27 , 2017 A report says World Bank financing pushes countries like Indonesia toward more coal infrastructure and away from clean energy projects . Credit : Getty Images A watchdog group has issued a new study saying the World Bank , which distributes billions of dollars to developing countries each year with a goal of reducing poverty , is pushing those countries toward fossil fuel projects despite acknowledging that climate change poses a threat to its mission . The study , released late Thursday , said one of the bank 's primary lending programs has steered investment toward coal , gas and oil , while blunting efforts to advance renewable energy sources , including wind and solar . It said the program pushed countries toward coal projects and transmission in Indonesia , new coal plants in Egypt , three natural gas pipelines in the Peruvian Amazon and oil exploration in Mozambique , among other projects . Those policies , the Bank Information Center says , supported tax breaks , subsidies and public-private partnerships that enabled these projects , despite the World Bank 's intention that the program would help countries hasten their transition to low-carbon economies . The money from the program goes directly toward a government 's budget and is not earmarked for a specific project , unlike other World Bank distributions . The World Bank has long been criticized for financing coal plants and other new fossil fuel infrastructure in developing countries . In 2008 , the bank issued a policy document saying climate change posed a major threat to its goal of reducing poverty . In April , it announced that all future spending would take climate change into account , and that nearly 30 percent of its investments would go directly to projects related to climate change . That includes a goal to bring enough renewable energy online to power 150 million homes . While the Development Policy Finance program does n't fund specific projects , the Bank Information Center maintains it influences policies and institutions and can steer investment . In this case , it funneled investment toward carbon-intensive development . The study looked at these particular countries , Sinani said , to get a diverse geographic distribution , and its authors found similar practices . These countries had untapped potential for solar , wind or geothermal energy development , the report said , but the Development Finance Policy program failed to create the right legal framework or incentive for exploration .
