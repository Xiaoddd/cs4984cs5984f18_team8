Dissidents Ramp Up Direct Action Against Climate Destroyers . In the New York case , the six activists blocked a construction site for a Competitive Power Ventures natural gas-powered electricity plant . Courtrooms Now Battlegrounds in Struggle Against Fossil Fuel Status Quo These trials are part of a growing wave of climate protest cases in which activists have taken their on-the-ground resistance into the courtroom . Being blocked from presenting the necessity evidence then results in nearly unavoidable guilty verdicts for activists who have admitted to the charged conduct . There are two important contexts to consider when assessing the importance of these verdicts . This shared exposure to government repression will likely strengthen the bonds of solidarity between climate activists and other social movements , and will underscore the point that climate change is as much a political issue as it is a scientific one . As bad as the withdrawal was as a symbolic rebuke to the idea of coordinated international action to cap emissions , it was also a clarifying moment , a clear signal to anyone still in doubt that the federal government generally works at the behest of the fossil fuel industry and that climate action must be undertaken against , rather than within , the system . Activism Offers Radical Critique of Conditions That Created Climate Crisis Climate necessity activists have pushed their cause away from wonky , inside-baseball environmentalism and toward grassroots , social justice insurgency . The idea that such a system should be challenged is actually relatively new for the climate movement , which for decades eschewed direct action and looked for salvation in mainstream policy solutions . By directly targeting harmful fossil fuel infrastructure and challenging the legal prohibitions against such action , activists like Ward call into question the institution of private property , which allows oil companies to recklessly pollute the atmosphere as a matter of right , as well as our system of political representation , which encourages politicians to serve moneyed interests and short-term goals over the long-term interests of the public . Finally , climate necessity activism forces an official reckoning with climate science , which is sadly still necessary at this advanced stage of the climate crisis . Those changes were often significantly nudged along by courtroom experiments . Climate necessity activism is a rejection of such complacency . In his speech announcing that the federal government had stuck its head in the climate sand , President Trump declared that he represented the people of Pittsburgh , not Paris . Lucky for us , then , that there are individuals out there willing to do the actual work of representing the public interest , of ignoring the strictures of short-term gain and encrusted doctrine to do what needs to be done . One person argued fairly convincingly that this action was dangerous , could have resulted in a massive spill . So the idea that direct action is necessary is incontrovertible . We need to educate the public meanwhile , though , a tricky matter which will only get harder if the bastards succeed in undoing net neutrality , as seems likely . If people can not put on their true , honest defense , then immediate the court becomes a farce and ought to be declared as such right then and there .
