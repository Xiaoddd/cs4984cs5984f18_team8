Environmentalists have objected to the construction of the 875 mile line , which would carry up to 830,000 barrels of oil a day . White House press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted that Mr Trump , who claims the pipeline will create many thousands of jobs , would discuss the pipeline later . The State Department said it determined that building Keystone served the US national interest . Under the Obama administration , the same department reached the opposite conclusion . It said it had considered foreign policy and energy security in making the determination . The permit was signed by Tom Shannon , a career diplomat serving as undersecretary of state for political affairs . He did so , because Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recused himself due to his previous work running Exxon Mobil . The announcement on Friday morning would appear to at least for now close the uncertainty that had hung over the project , which will carry oil sands petroleum from Alberta , Canada , to Nebraska , in the US . From Nebraska , the oil will be sent by already existing lines to refineries on the Gulf Coast . Environmental groups also say the pipeline will encourage the use of carbon-heavy tar sands oil which contributes more to global warming than cleaner sources of energy .
