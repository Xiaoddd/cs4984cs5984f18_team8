The police repression occurred at the bridge only 500 metres from the North entrance of Oceti Sakowin Camp . The force of the explosion blew the bone out of her arm and all of the arteries and all of the muscles that support her arm were blown out . There were reports of water cannons used in sub-zero temperatures , rubber bullets , tear gas , sound cannons , and both stinger grenades and compression grenades , one of which hit Sophia directly in the arm . Medical updates are being released regularly by Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council , including on their Facebook page . I died a thousand deaths today and will continue to do so for quite some time . I am left without the right words to describe the anguish of watching her look at her now alien arm and hand . In Minneapolis a vigil was also held Tuesday night after the press conference at Hennepin County Medical Center for Sophia and her family . A gofundme has been set up online for Sophia Wilansky here . Support this experiment in crowdfunded news by becoming a member today .
