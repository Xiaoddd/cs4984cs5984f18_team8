Three people were arrested as part of the action . ETP is one of the most reckless corporations on the planet . Across the continent they have desecrated waterways and used violence and intimidation to try and silence opposition . ETP must be held accountable for their actions . We need more financial institutions to do what Citizens Bank has done and cut their ties with ETP . At the time , Energy Transfer Partners partially owned Sunoco Logistics , and in April 2017 the companies fully merged . The line of credit was replaced by two new loans , which Citizens Bank elected not to contribute to . In addition to the lock-down action at the Citizens Bank headquarter building , the Shame on Citizens campaign organized public demonstrations at Citizens Bank locations and also recruited community members to publicly close their Citizens accounts . Around the world , banks that finance ETP have been targeted with direct actions and demonstrations inspired by the surge of resistance at Standing Rock in the fall of 2016 . Popular Resistance provides a daily stream of resistance news from across the United States and around the world . We also organize campaigns and participate in coalitions on a broad range of issues . We do not use advertising or underwriting to support our work . Instead , we rely on you .
