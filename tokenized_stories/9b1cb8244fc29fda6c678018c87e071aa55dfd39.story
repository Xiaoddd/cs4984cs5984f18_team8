We Call It a State of Emergency for Civil Rights . Something historic is happening in North Dakota . People are protesting an oil pipeline . The protectors , as the protesters call themselves , are defending the land and water using little more than the right to assemble and speak freely , a long-standing protection afforded by the U.S. Constitution . Unfortunately , there is another kind of history happening here . And by declaring a state of emergency in response to peaceful protests , Gov. Jack Dalrymple allowed law enforcement to erect concrete barricades on a major public highway 30 miles north of the protest sites and encampments . People heading south toward the protest and the reservation were stopped by police and told they could not drive toward the protest on the highway . A detour on a separate highway took travelers south toward the reservation and the protest area , adding unnecessary distance and time to the trip . The road closure added significant distance and travel time to and from the rural reservation to Bismarck , the nearest large city . We hoped this would begin to ease the tension between the state and the protesters , but Gov. Dalrymple immediately activated the National Guard to enforce the checkpoint so that people now face armed soldiers when they are stopped and required to report their destination before traveling further down the highway .

Leave this field blank Anonymous of course the ACLU is going to side with lawlessness and Anarchy and chaos or any liberal left-wing radical group . dad met in the first half of this article that there was Violence by the protesters and then they say in the second half that there was no need for the National Guard . You ca n't have it both ways unless you are a radical left-wing group yourself just as the ACLU is . I bet you if a conservative group were to come and cause the same trouble as these Indians have or as have the black lives matter or the radical left-wing group Occupy Wall Street , and if this conservative group work to protest in front of the ACLU 's headquarters I bet you they would have the police throw them out immediately . reply September 13 , 2016 5:44 PM Anonymous There is nothing lawless for standing up to a greedy corporation to protect our childrens water supply . I 'm sure you 'll respond with name calling and unfounded talking points but that 's the difference between you and most of the country . The thing that amazes me though is people like you with the ability to articulate never ceases to amaze . I 'm amazed at how well you avoid thinking . You should really get a life . Maybe get a job at the casino . I heard they are hiring . September 14 , 2016 12:27 PM Anonymous i imagine if it was YOUR property that DAP was trying to cross , gunfire would be involved . Make up your mind , you ca n't have it both ways .
