A faulty pipeline caused this leak to go completely undetected and straight into the countryside and creek just 2.5 hours away from where the protests are happening in North Dakota . By that time , it had spread an astonishing 5.4 miles away from the original site of the leak . In fact , it is still unclear as to what caused the pipeline to leak in the first place . It is now known , however , that the leak happened on December 5 , which means the oil spill has continued unabated for quite some time now . By now it should be crystal clear to all that those at Standing Rock do indeed have just cause for concern over their fears of the Dakota Access Pipeline , especially in light of these recent events . The Spill Investigation Program Manager for the North Dakota Department of Health , Bill Suess , has said that whenever oil leaks into water it is considered a very serious matter and is something that is thoroughly investigated . With this recent oil leak that spilled into a nearby creek and countryside grounds , you can well imagine that building another line directly beneath the Missouri River could only be fraught with peril . And when that location just happens to be right next to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation , where it could affect drinking water , it is only going to be a recipe for disaster . Pipeline 150 miles from Dakota Access protests leaks 176,000 gallons of oil . In a strange twist of fate , on the exact day that the permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline was stricken down , this recent oil spill in Billings County was also discovered . Oil leaks take an incredibly long time to clean up . Even now that the recent oil leak from the Belle Fourche Pipeline has been contained , it will still take awhile to continue the clean up process , as Bill Suess affirms . Even the electronic monitoring equipment that should have alerted the pipeline owners to the mess near Standing Rock failed to do its job . But even with technology , oil spills happen much more frequently than you might think . Since 2006 , they have had 30 leaks . In fact , one of their pipelines even dumped 30,000 gallons of oil straight into Yellowstone River . Because of this , a town of 6,000 people had their drinking water service totally shut down . To put this all into perspective , the company that would have operated the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Standing Rock reservation , Sunoco Logistics , has more oil spills than any of its competitors as Reuters has reported . Since 2010 they have had more than 200 leaks . While the December 5 oil spill in Billings County is a tragedy of epic proportions , both for the land and the wildlife that have been lost , it is a harsh reminder that we need to be very careful where we build pipelines . Thankfully , the brave souls that protested at Standing Rock have made their point , and Standing Rock appears , for the time being at least , to be safe .
