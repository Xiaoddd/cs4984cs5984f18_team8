Getting the Story Right : I had been at the CBC working for about six years when I decided to pitch a story that was close to my heart . A young First Nations girl I knew had gone missing . She was just one of hundreds of missing and murdered Aboriginal women who I felt were being ignored by mainstream media and I wanted to try to change that . Unfortunately , that was n't the first time I 'd encountered that attitude at work or in life . It was a sad reminder of the state of the relationship between Aboriginal people and the rest of Canada and how much work we all need to do to improve it . I never got to tell that story but I have been able to tell many other Aboriginal stories in my ten years at CBC . And I 'm happy to say that the vast majority of my colleagues have always been open and encouraging of my interest in covering Aboriginal issues . Projects like 8th Fire renew my hope and optimism and I think are a reflection of the growing desire and commitment to telling those stories . This is why I jumped at the chance to be a part of this series . Four hours of television sounds like a lot , and it is , but when your goal is to examine the relationship between Aboriginal and non Aboriginal people in Canada and be inclusive of First Nations , Metis and Inuit people from across the country , it can seem like a very daunting task . It 's not hard to find the stories ; almost any Aboriginal story you can tell in Canada has been shaped or impacted by this relationship and while the struggle to improve the relationship is a common theme in communities across the country , the perspectives of those involved vary drastically from region to region . For example , I grew up in Saskatchewan where the First Nations population is very visible and the conflicts in the relationship are well documented and ongoing . The people who live there have a lot at stake when it comes to improving this relationship and it was extremely important to me to ensure that their perspectives are included in our series . I 'm happy to say they are . Connie Walker is from the Okanese First Nation in Saskatchewan . Buy this series This series is now available for educators at CBC Curio .
