A few short days after that disastrous decision , the White House cancelled an environmental review and then approved the permit for the Dakota Access pipeline , which threatens the drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux and millions more people downstream . Here in Appalachia , where our streams have been ravaged for decades by coal mining , we were eager for the same basic , common-sense water pollution protections that the rest of the country takes for granted . As I said in my recent column , the Stream Protection Rule sought to tackle the decades-old practice of coal companies dumping tons of dangerous mining waste from their mining operations into nearby waterways that were frequently used for drinking , farming , and fishing by local communities . This practice contaminates local water with dangerous heavy metals like mercury , selenium , and arsenic , which can cause severe mental development problems and stunted cognitive growth in children exposed to these toxins . Those long-overdue standards were finally put in place last year , and now as one of its first votes , the new Congress not only threw them out , but is also trying to prevent any similar protections in the future . From Appalachia to Standing Rock , water is life . If you think this could never happen in your community , to your water , remember that we all live downstream . So raise your voice .
