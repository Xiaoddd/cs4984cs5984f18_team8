In a press release , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe says the temporary restraining order will prevent destruction to sacred areas . The desecration of these ancient places has already caused the Standing Rock Sioux irreparable harm . Archaumbault says that Dakota Access Pipeline workers continued construction during the early morning hours on Sunday . The release states that the motion would put a stop to additional work on the pipeline about two miles west of Highway 1806 until the judge issues a ruling on the previous motion to stop construction .
