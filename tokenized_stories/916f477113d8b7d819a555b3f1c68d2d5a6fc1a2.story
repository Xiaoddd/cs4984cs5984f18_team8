Nebraska regulators approved plans for Keystone XL to cross the state , though the approval did n't cover TransCanada 's preferred route through the state . The commission voted 3-2 to move the project forward . TransCanada itself still has to decide whether to build the pipeline , an economic question that is far from settled . TransCanada said in a brief statement that it is evaluating the Nebraska regulators ' decision to approve the pipeline route that the company did not favor . Keystone has long been a flashpoint for anti-fossil fuel activists , who have rallied environmentalists , tribes and local landowners against the pipeline . TransCanada plans for the pipeline to transport oil from Alberta , Canada , to existing infrastructure in Nebraska , where it will then travel to refineries . That decision effectively stalled the project . But Trump revived the pipeline earlier this year , signing an executive order fast tracking its reconsideration . In March , he approved the presidential permit , kickstarting a new debate over the project . Trump often highlights his decision to revive the project as a key accomplishment of his first year in office . Regulators in Montana and South Dakota , the two other states Keystone XL would cross , have already approved the pipeline , making Nebraska the last major backstop . The Public Service Commission held a series of hearings on the matter this year and considered more than 500,000 comments on the proposed route across the state . Only one commissioner spoke for or against the project on Monday . Crystal Rhoades , an Omaha-area commissioner , questioned the economic impact of the pipeline on Nebraska and warned that a spill from the pipeline would impact environmentally sensitive areas of the state . She also said it could violate the rights of landowners in the state . Developers still need to secure approval from two federal agencies , and permitting decisions in South Dakota and federally are the subject of environmentalist and tribal lawsuits . Environmentalists hammered TransCanada for the spill and warned that it previewed potential spills from the larger Keystone XL project . But Nebraska law bars commissioners from considering the threat of an oil spill when permitting pipelines , because spill prevention and cleanup is a federal issue rather than a state one . Despite the Monday approval , TransCanada still has not made a final decision to build Keystone XL . Sign up for our daily email .
