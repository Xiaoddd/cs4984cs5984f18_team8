The DAPL threatens to cross under the Mni Sose -LRB- the Missouri River -RRB- , which is the fresh-water supply for millions of humans and countless nonhuman relations . The essays are accompanied by images taken by photographers Jaida Grey Eagle and Vanessa Bowen . Jaida Grey Eagle is an Oglala Lakota photographer born in Pine Ridge , South Dakota and raised in Minneapolis , Minnesota . She has been photographing since she was a young child , often using disposable 35 mm cameras , and she received her first digital camera at eighteen as a birthday present from her parents . Her work mainly focuses on historical events in the Indigenous community , but also includes naturally lit portraits and landscapes . Her work from Standing Rock is rooted in her concern for access to clean water and her desire to help provide coverage in the fight against environmental racism . Born and raised in New Mexico , a proud member of the Navajo Nation , Vanessa Bowen began creating art in childhood . Since then she has expanded her creativity from design into photography . The photographs from Oceti Sakowin camp will be featured in her documentary Water Is Life , which aims to educate viewers about the many fossil-fuel disasters on tribal lands and about why it is essential to protect the Missouri River from the Dakota Access Pipeline .
