Paramilitary gangs terrorizing the opposition , the incompetence and opportunism of German conservatives , the Reichstag Fire . And we learned about the critical importance of propaganda , the deliberate misinforming of the public in order to sway opinions en masse and achieve popular support -LRB- or at least the appearance of it -RRB- . Post-war scholars of totalitarianism like Theodor Adorno and Hannah Arendt asked that question over and over , for several decades afterward . Their earliest studies on the subject looked at two sides of the equation . Adorno contributed to a massive volume of social psychology called The Authoritarian Personality , which studied individuals predisposed to the appeals of totalitarianism . The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that , under such conditions , one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day , and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood , they would take refuge in cynicism ; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them , they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness . The epistemological ground thus pulled out from under them , most would depend on whatever the leader said , no matter its relation to truth . Arendt 's analysis of propaganda and the function of lies seems particularly relevant at this moment . We might begin to think they are an irrelevant sideshow . This , she suggests , would be a mistake . To support Open Culture 's continued operation , please consider making a donation . Pinging is currently not allowed .

Reply Sandy says : January 24 , 2017 at 12:25 pm I understand why we have people calling Trump Hitler etc. . Just by reading these articles and accepting what they say , not because they are accurate , but because they are in the academia . It is the perfect snooty rooty cazooty snobazooty . This kind of philosophy , as in this article , has appeal to the scholar snobs of the world . Reply Lab Guy says : January 24 , 2017 at 4:17 pm Randy is right . Look at press recently Trump . The major media networks and print to push these nonsense narratives like Russian hacking or some other theme . The public is dumb but not that dumb . Pretty laughable those with any brains overlook the totalitarianism of the left . Reply Russell Scott Day says : January 24 , 2017 at 6:02 pm The USA has been first in many things . The Confederate States of America was Stalinist before Stalin got around to robbing banks . However , your implication that Obama somehow represents a totalitarian left is laughable . Reply Snowball says : January 25 , 2017 at 9:36 am Sandy is part of the US version of the Red Guards of China during the Cultural Revolution . Thousands died , and China has spent the past century trying to recover . That is where you pathetic and self-defeating anti-intellectualism gets you . And the minions that follow are quick to act on that emotion due to their susceptibility . Wake up . Save yourself . trump may not be Hitler , but trump is toxic . Using silly made up words to diminish the possibility further . Not sure if she believes this , or if she is acting out sarcasm with that remark . Reply E says : January 25 , 2017 at 4:08 pm The comments section on this article is so ironic I might throw up . Reply Dave says : January 26 , 2017 at 3:59 am Randy is putting forth just the kind of gaslighting the article refers to . The facts defy his statements . Reply Ed Crist says : January 26 , 2017 at 6:34 am Humans have a long history of forgetting most of history . Over and over totalitarianism has thrived because otherwise good people yearn for safety and comfort promised by charismatic figures . I am not optimistic that our species will ever purge itself of the need and desire of despots . People move . They act . Their acts have consequences . When people act together , the consequences of their actions multiply exponentially . People move . People act . Their actions have consequences . When people act together , the consequences of their actions multiply exponentially . If you want people to act together most efficiently , you need to find a target , Jews being perfect in 1930s Germany . If you want people to live in a just society , people have to stop moving and acting , and do yoga . Reply Evan Hadkins says : January 26 , 2017 at 8:27 pm Great article . It gets gaslighting slightly wrong though . But what good con men do is make you stop thinking . Repeat endlessly . Reply charlotte says : January 28 , 2017 at 2:33 am I really appreciate this kind of re-orientation after one frightening week of the Trump presidency . It means you have to constantly go back to what you know is true and question what will become the norm . After 9-11 the Patriot Act allowed the constitution to be enforced arbitrarily . Women were given a heavy , ugly iron cross for making babies who would become cannon fodder , an insult added to their injury but which was considered an honor . Reply Someone says : July 10 , 2017 at 4:28 pm The comments here indicate a dislike for the person of Donald Trump . In reading the following article , be aware that Hopkins is not an enthusiast either despite his observations on the nature of the reporting on the man . So good luck with that , I hope you manage to successfully stop the oppression of men by oppressing men . That would be one hell of a trick if you ever menage to pull it off . Reply Mike Flores says : April 30 , 2018 at 9:51 pm Interesting but flawed article . Propaganda just means , persuasion . It is part of psychological warfare . The best propaganda is the truth . Anyone who looks up Hitler on the internet will quickly discover there is no comparison . No private paramilitary group , no forced sterilization of enemies , etc. . It is very hard to argue against that . It has enough truth to make it hard to argue against . There was no propaganda that could hide what was being done . Word would get back to families in Germany . No propaganda could cover that up . Word did trickle back to Germans from guards , but the guards were mostly ex communists who had joined the SA and then were folded into the SS . As communists they had read Marx and Engels on the necessity of wiping out the Slavic race and to kill practicing Jews . Marx and Engels wrote this material for years , for example saying all Slavic people should be killed to make way for the German worker . They had these beliefs before they became nazis . German society already had laws aimed against Jews . Propaganda did not create that . Religion did . Jews were blamed by the Catholic Church for killing a God . So this was taught people as children long before Hitler came to power . It was taught to Hitler too . Hitler by the way , was both Catholic and a follower of Hegel . Marx and Engels promoted the idea . The mindset was already there . Yet he refused to meet with Jesse Owens , the Project M files have been revealed so we know he believed in eugenics and the inferiority of Jews . Let me explain . Woodrow had strokes and was in various forms of incompetence which his wife , Edith our first female President , hid from everyone . You broke the window , you pay for it . Had Edith told advisers what Woodrow was going through I doubt that would have been included . Had Germany won World War 1 , there would be an Irish Republic . No treaty so no economic collapse . No collapse no rise of the left in Germany . Franco would not have been put in place by the British . No World War 2 so no 70 million dead . an irony of history . Propaganda does not create history . Saying it does , is bad propaganda . Reply Thom McCann says : July 19 , 2018 at 10:43 am Be afraid . Be very much afraid . Not one in which those in power issue orders but one in which those at the lower end of the hierarchy initiate policies themselves within what they take to be the spirit of the regime and carry on implementing them until corrected . He famously joked in a college commencement address in 2009 at at Arizona State University that he could use the IRS to target political enemies but of course he never would . Not a single written document signed by Hitler has ever been found authorizing the SS murderers to wipe out Untermenschen or to killing foreign slave workers or Jews in concentration death camps or by starving them or working them to death . No direct order was given , but the courtiers sensed what would please their king . Just curious . I know people like you and it will not gon na happen . Buy a book , kid , and try to learn something instead . Reply Leave a Reply Name -LRB- required -RRB- Email -LRB- required -RRB- Message Click here to cancel reply .
