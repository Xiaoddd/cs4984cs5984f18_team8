We want to build our capacities for strong movement defense against state repression . Strong movements and interdependent relationships make attempts to shut down our struggle obsolete . This two-hour workshop is open to all who have participated in the movement at Standing Rock , those who have supported the efforts on the ground from their homes and territories elsewhere , as well as all those who wish to continue fighting on the many frontlines that continuing emerging across Turtle Island . The grand jury convened against water protectors continues as does the resistance to it . As extraction becomes the norm and the government ramps up its repression against those who stand in resistance , this workshop holds valuable information for those who struggle for Indigenous sovereignty , earth liberation and a future without oppression . Our mission is to provide a resilient platform to publicize and promote revolutionary theory and action . are using a browser that does not have Flash player enabled or installed .
