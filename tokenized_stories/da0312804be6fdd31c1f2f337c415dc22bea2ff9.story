They support job creation , mobility , modern agriculture , homes and hospitals , computers and communications , lights and refrigerators , life and study after sundown , indoor plumbing , safe drinking water , less disease and longer lives . Hydrocarbons make plastics , pharmaceuticals and synthetic clothing . They create fertilizers and pesticides , to improve crop yields , reduce food prices and improve nutrition . They block leasing , drilling and fracking . They block pipelines that transport oil and gas to refineries , power plants , factories and homes . Hydraulic fracturing and Canadian oil sands development made North American petroleum production soar , created millions of jobs , sent oil , gasoline and natural gas prices plunging , and provided some of the few bright spots in the 2008-14 Obama economy . But , when the Keystone XL segment was proposed , intense opposition suddenly materialized . The facts do not support their claims . They are , in reality , being bankrolled by billionaires , fat-cat foundations and foreign oil interests . The Indigenous Environmental Network also funds Honor the Earth . These tax-exempt foundations do not simply give money to pressure groups . They serve as puppeteers , telling protesters what campaigns to conduct , what tactics to use . The cash ultimately went to selected pressure groups that led campaigns against Keystone , Sandpiper and other projects , Morningstar and Arnold found . By donating the market value of greatly appreciated Berkshire Hathaway shares to NoVo , the Omaha billionaire avoided income taxes on his gains . In fact , oil-by-rail skyrocketed from 9,500 carloads in 2009 to 450,000 carloads in 2014 . The anti-pipeline campaigns blocked thousands of jobs and increased risks of tank car derailments , like the Lac Megantic , Quebec spill that destroyed much of the town and incinerated 47 people . He now says the pipeline would be good for both Canada and the United States , and it is a mistake to jeopardize trade relationships with our northern neighbor . But , the campaigns rage on . Mr. Buffett helped unleash a beast he can not control . The campaigns are not grassroots , or even Astroturf . Legislative investigations are needed , especially since the Justice Department is hardly likely to look into what its key allies are doing . They dug in their ideological heels and shouted insults . One red-faced protester walked away . Others intensified their chants or shouted racially tinged epithets at the multi-ethnic CFACT students . His scheme is simply devoid of any factual merit whatsoever . Cuomo has been relegated to the partisan , manipulated conniver that he is . Beware of Cuomo and any New York City dweller calling themselves environmentalists . Sometimes it seems the truth is in your face , but cognitive dissonance and the constant self-aggrandizing by essentially ignorant people that crave soapboxes is becoming so destructive that only folks like yourself are what keep the line together between sanity and madness . So many people so why not start the drama first . Notify me of new posts by email . Powered by Max Banner Ads Sign-up for our Sunday updates .
