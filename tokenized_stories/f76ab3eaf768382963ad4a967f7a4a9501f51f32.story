On Tuesday , President Donald Trump ordered the re-authorization and rapid completion of the Dakota Access and the Keystone XL pipelines , two controversial infrastructure projects that will make it easier to transport fossil fuels across North America . Whether it will be a successful attempt is another story . But lawyers warn that the fights to come could mire Trump in years-long court battles over regulatory law . In the mid-morning , the White House announced that the president had signed orders reviving the two controversial pipeline projects . This also meant that the national press reported the news for hours without knowing , exactly , what it entailed . Finally , by dusk , hundreds of people assembled outside the White House to protest the orders . The cheer echoed off the U.S. Treasury Building . It is indeed interesting that , on his fourth day , the new president would choose to move forward on the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines . It is interesting for other reasons , too . In many ways , the two pipelines can be seen as mirror images of each other . President Trump , surrounded by staff , addresses reporters after signing an order expediting the Dakota Access pipeline . Almost a decade ago , the TransCanada Corporation proposed Keystone XL as a 1,200-mile pipeline connecting the oil fields of Alberta to the refineries of Nebraska , and the company began the approval process for the international project . He and other activists successfully turned the idea of Keystone into a rallying point for the larger cause of fighting climate change . What was at stake , they insisted , was not the fact of the pipeline itself , but the continued commitment of U.S. dollars to fossil-fuel infrastructure . It worked . People rallied against Keystone , insisting on its significance as a symbol even if they admitted its emissions might be insignificant . A newfound army of climate activists demanded that Obama reject the pipeline and finally take climate change seriously . In November 2015 , the president did . Keystone XL was dead . Until Tuesday . Novey showed up to the White House protest on Tuesday night ; she said it was only the most recent of countless protests she attended against Keystone . Since Keystone languished in federal review for years , almost none of it is built . The Dakota Access Pipeline , on the other hand , is more than 80 percent complete . And it is constructed almost entirely on private land leased by Energy Transfer Partners . In fact , the entire pipeline only needed one major federal permit : permission to construct beneath Lake Oahe , a reservoir constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers in the early 1960s and controlled by them ever since . The tribe complained that the pipeline had been sprung on them , and that the pipeline never received a site-specific environmental review . Many members of the Sioux feared that if the pipeline leaked and poisoned their water , there would be nothing they could do about it . And in early December , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that it would undertake a full environmental review for the pipeline , a process that could take two years . The move was chalked up to the Obama White House , though legal experts told me that President Obama himself could not easily have made the directive . Now it may have its chance . In the first , Trump invited TransCanada to resubmit the Keystone XL pipeline proposal to the State Department . He also gave that department a 60-day deadline to approve or decline the project . His other two memos were less interesting . One asked the Secretary of Commerce to figure out how to require materials for American pipelines be made in the United States . This resembles orders issued by other Republican presidents , including George W. Bush in 2001 . She added too that the executive orders seemed to be written in a typical way . Instead of commanding agencies to ignore congressionally passed law , the orders request that they expedite or reconsider previous judgments . The decision maker can say no , and then the president can fire them and replace them with someone who would . Earthjustice , the environmental-law nonprofit leading the Dakota Access suit , said that they are studying the orders and waiting to see how the Army Corps reacts . Experts seemed to think the Keystone XL pipeline would be easier to restart , at least from a legal perspective . The obstacles to that pipeline originated in the federal government and not an ongoing legal challenge . The Dakota Access pipeline , meanwhile , sits idle at 80-percent completion . It is closer to being done . It also has , legally , much further to go . Dakota Access seems also to have captured an aspect of the public progressive imagination that Keystone XL never did . Most of the protesters I saw on Tuesday carried signs about that pipeline . Dakota Access has engaged the parts of the left concerned about the environment and concerned about social or racial justice . And not only will blocking the pipeline help the climate -LRB- at least a little bit -RRB- , it will also protect the water supply of a long-oppressed and abused community . Tuesday was one of the first protests Rahman had attended while living in D.C. . While we talked , she frowned at the White House . Right now , he indeed seems to be reveling in the power of that office . Soon he may discover its limits . On January 22 of a different inauguration year , 2009 , another revolutionary and change-making president made good on a campaign promise . In an executive order signed in front of a similarly large press junket , Barack Obama promised that the Guatanamo Bay detention center would close within a year . Human-rights advocates around the world praised the decision . But on January 22 , 2010 , the facility was still open . An executive order may make headlines today . Whether it shapes reality is a different question . We want to hear what you think about this article .
