That was the phrase used over and over by law enforcement from North Dakota and Morton County . It was supposed to serve as a box to limit First Amendment and civil disobedience actions by water protectors opposing the Dakota Access oil pipeline crossing under the Missouri River . This statement was and still is nonsense . The Constitution of the United States declares treaties to be the supreme law of the land . And weightier than the claim of a property right on federal property . And significantly more potent than the urgency to construct an oil pipeline before the price of oil drops . To enforce the so-called rule of law , virtual armies were sent in to arrest hundreds of people for speaking out . Protesters march at Standing Rock in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline . All the company , the county , and the state , had to do was to be patient . Accommodate the camps . Learn from the community . Take heart from any lessons that might surface . Perhaps , even then , there would be disagreements , but at least there would also be respect . And there would have been an honorable place for the rule of law . Instead the company , state , and county , opted for might makes right . This week a federal court had its own interpretation of the rule of law . The lake is also the primary source of water for the Cheyenne River Reservation . In other words : Water is life . There will be a continued legal back and forth . Some rulings will favor the tribes , others the pipeline company . And perhaps there will be a new Environmental Impact Statement . This is a moment for the Dakota Access pipeline partners , the state of North Dakota and Morton County , to change tactics , too . The company and state can start over , too , building on this court decision to start a new chapter . So many lessons came from what happened at Standing Rock . Let respect for the rule of law be one lesson learned . Look for it in your email each Saturday .
