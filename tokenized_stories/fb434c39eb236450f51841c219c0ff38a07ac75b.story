Manufacturing & agriculture growth strategist . Follow for news at the intersection of tech , biology , business , and squishy people stuff . Among them : Virginia and North Carolina received seven-figure payoffs from the pipeline company , Dominion , immediately before final state permitting approval . The legality of these payments is dubious at best . In fact , cheap , 24-hour renewable energy installations to replace coal as a baseload power source are already in the bid and build process . ACP has been marketed to local stakeholders as a jobs project that will bring manufacturing . There is little support for these claims . ACP has presented no evidence that energy costs are in fact a limiting factor for industrial development in Virginia and the Carolinas , or that the pipeline will truly address any industry needs . ACP partner Duke Energy has a history of manipulating natural gas supplies to drive up prices , when market structure has allowed them to do so . It has also abused this monopoly status to avoid accountability for coal ash spills , up to threatening to withhold power from federal military installations if fined . As a business strategist , I began looking into the ACP in mid-2017 so I could advise clients on what it would mean for their businesses . What I found was unconvincing . Findings and conclusions are summarized in the following report . These calculations do not include subsidies , tax credits , or externalities -LRB- e.g. damage from accidents , pollution-related costs such as increased healthcare , damage from accidents , etc -RRB- . These figures are simply the bare cost of generating electricity by different methods . Wind and solar have been the true , unsubsidized , lowest-cost source of power in North Carolina for nearly two years . This is despite natural gas prices being at historical lows during those last two years . However , solar and wind are still competitive with natural gas even after accounting for firming . This is shown in detail in Figure 4 . The remainder of the brief will focus on solar energy ; with the understanding that many of the cost computations and local economic benefits of solar apply to wind as well . Storage technology has lagged behind generation technology . As a result , firming remains the main obstacle to adopting local energy . However , recent advances are making 24-hour renewable coverage competitive with conventional energy . Vanadium batteries have existed since the 1980s -LRB- 2 -RRB- , but recent manufacturing advances have made them competitive at grid scale . Unlike lithium ion technology that uses intricate and damage-prone parts , vanadium batteries are extremely simple : two tanks of electrolyte and a membrane . This simplicity makes them safer -LRB- 3 -RRB- , more robust -LRB- 3 -RRB- , and much more affordable -LRB- 2 , 4 -RRB- on a utility grid scale than lithium ion . Grid-scale vanadium battery use began with a 4 MWh installation in Japan in 2005 -LRB- 5 -RRB- . A wind generation site in Dalian uses an 800 MWh vanadium battery for firming -LRB- 2 , 4 , 6 -RRB- . China is also adding massive battery manufacturing capacity in anticipation of future demand . II . New technologies have lowered the breakeven cost . Figure 2 shows a history of US natural gas prices -LRB- generally set by the price at Henry Hub distribution point in Louisiana -RRB- . Figure 3 . Energy cost comparison , table , 2025 projection Important note : the variation in solar prices -LRB- shown by light blue caps and multiple bars for solar -RRB- are caused by different installation systems and types of financing . In other words , once a solar system is built and a payment system established , its price is set . All-weather reliability and stable prices allow businesses and homeowners to plan ahead with confidence . In contrast , electricity based on natural gas means unpredictable prices during good weather and outages during bad , hindering business operations , planning , and expansion . The result is drastic price spikes -LRB- 12 -RRB- . A natural gas-based energy future for North Carolina is a hostile environment for business growth . These price shocks bring extreme unpredictability into business operations that can be devastating . Businesses can not plan for expansion , hiring , investing in new equipment , or opening new locations without a stable cost outlook . IV . Figure 6 . ACP outlook : natural gas cash outflows from North Carolina at different price points . A natural gas strategy takes advantage of this ingrained habit . Again , this strategy is a losing one for North Carolina as it has no sources of natural gas . These opportunities are especially strong in less urbanized areas with affordable land and simple permitting processes , which have historically struggled the most to find opportunities for growth . A brief example of statewide and local economic gains from a local energy is shown below . Figure 7 shows economic gains from solar for Cumberland County from generating its own solar energy ; from exporting solar electricity for the Triangle market ; and total revenues retained within the North Carolina economy from a statewide local energy strategy . VI . This is in line with the NC Clean Path projections -LRB- 8 -RRB- , and is substantially higher than job growth possible with a gas-and-pipeline strategy . Figure 8 . Construction and permanent full-time jobs in North Carolina , solar vs gas base power strategy . Actual solar job figures are likely to be higher due these factors . PV , wind , and batteries have both one-time installation and ongoing maintenance costs , just like pipelines and power plants . However , gas plants must also be fed fuel to operate . In contrast , once installed , local energy needs no inputs other than maintenance by workers -LRB- 18 -RRB- . For this reason , a higher percentage of renewable installation costs go to salaries compared to gas . Operations and maintenance jobs for renewables are tasks like cleaning , preventive maintenance , repairs , grounds-keeping to prevent brush overgrowth , etc. . These are abundant , accessible , permanent blue-collar jobs . Natural gas is a poor generator of employment in all regions , but especially for North Carolina . With no natural gas resources within its borders , this state has no base of natural gas construction workers . Welders , fitters , inspectors , manufacturers of pipeline parts , etc. , must be brought in as contractors from natural gas-heavy areas like Texas and North Dakota . A solar strategy will engage skills and resources native to North Carolina , and build wealth that will stay in and continue to drive economic growth . VII . However , this was not always the case . The deregulation process was poorly designed , and by 2000 power shortages led to rolling blackouts and extreme hikes in power costs -LRB- 15 -RRB- . Investigations found that generating companies , including Enron , had deliberately gamed markets to create artificial shortages and maximize profits through the resulting price spikes -LRB- 13 , 22 , 23 -RRB- . Cheap natural gas needs an infrastructure of a few large , arterial pipelines . This raised gas prices in California , on top of the US-wide price increase . Gas power plants can shut down and restart fairly quickly compared to coal and nuclear . This is typically an advantage , as it allows gas plants to respond quickly to changes in demand . Recorded phone calls demonstrated an OPEC-like collaboration between energy suppliers to drive up prices -LRB- 13 , 22 , 23 -RRB- . After agreeing to take the plant down , the Nevada official questioned the reason . Rich asks . These efforts succeeded in exaggerating natural price shocks . Deliberate price inflation through temporary plant shutdowns is not possible with coal , nuclear , wind , or solar . This type of market interference requires a power source that can be brought on - and offline at will . 1 . An energy strategy that depends on imports is a poor strategy . Meanwhile , North Carolina has no gas fields . In other words , Duke Energy threatened national defense readiness to get out of cleaning up its own mess . However , it appears history is about to repeat itself . The rate payers , workers , and businesses of North Carolina will not benefit . VIII . IX . Industry requires intense heat and has traditionally used fossil fuels such as coal , coke , and natural gas . The state is positioned for success in several industries , including glass , semiconductors , ceramics , secondary metal processing , forestry , agriculture and food , high-tech textiles , composite manufacturing , and biorefining . These include raw metal production due to lack of ore resources , and the petroleum and chemical industries , due to lack of petroleum fields or refineries to provide raw materials -LRB- 40 -RRB- . Imported natural gas can be used for process heat in petroleum and chemical refining , but it can not be used as a feedstock -LRB- 41 -RRB- . This brings high labor costs , which is more prohibitive than energy costs for most industries . These are costly to remediate . Glass , ceramics , and semiconductors : Require high-intensity heat to melt raw materials and control cooling . These methods all use electricity rather than combustion . Improved equipment now available means new pulp mills can generate steam entirely from their own waste -LRB- 61 , 62 -RRB- . Melting metal for casting is now done by electric arc furnace -LRB- invented 1879 -RRB- or electric induction -LRB- invented 1903 -RRB- -LRB- 63 -RRB- . Melting steel and aluminum by electric induction takes about 600 kWh per ton -LRB- 68 -RRB- . To be competitive when made US , metal manufacturing must be highly automated and make products for high-value end uses that need quality and precision . Combustion heating is incompatible with these end uses . However , biotechnology is opening up new opportunities in high-tech textiles where highly-skilled workers will be needed . North Carolina is poised to excel in this industry . Examples include biosynthetic production of spider silk for fashion and ballistic purposes -LRB- 72 -RRB- , smart uniforms that camouflage their wearers from night-vision goggles -LRB- 73 -RRB- , and more . Lab-grown biosynthetic fibers only require heat to warm incubators . Other high-tech fibers derived from glass , plastics , carbon nanotubes , etc require precise , clean conditions that are not compatible with combustion heating . Electric methods like induction , arc , microwave , vapor deposition , etc are required in this industry -LRB- 74 -RRB- . Advanced resin curing methods currently in use for this industry include a variety of electromagnetic technologies including UV -LRB- 45 , 75 -RRB- , microwave -LRB- 76 -RRB- , infrared -LRB- 75 -RRB- , etc depending on type of composite . Energy needs for many facilities may be limited to warming incubators , and can be provided by burning waste biomass -LRB- 77 -RRB- . Since energy use is drastically lower than traditional refining competitors , energy costs are not an important factor in this industry . Key to success in this industry are a high-tech worker population and low-cost agricultural feedstocks like cellulose , starch , oils , and protein . Industries that are competitive in North Carolina have process heat needs that are better met by biomass and electric sources such as induction , electric arc , laser stamping , electromagnetic curing , etc. . These industry needs are better served by local wind and solar generation than by imported frack gas . One issue cited by solar and wind opponents is fear of obstructing training operations and pushing defense installations to relocate out of state . DoD has approved the vast majority of renewable energy projects that have applied , clearly demonstrating that local energy and military operations are compatible -LRB- 78 -RRB- . Furthermore , fears of interfering with military operations ignore the fact that much of the world is adopting local energy . Farms that add solar power typically do so on only part of their land . Most farms have some acreage that has always yielded poorly . Works Cited 1 . Dyer , James ; Beach , Fred ; King , C . The Full Cost of Electricity -LRB- FCe - -RRB- . -LRB- 2015 -RRB- .

There is little support for these claims . partner Duke Energy has a history of manipulating natural gas supplies to drive up prices , when market structure has allowed them to do so . It has also abused this monopoly status to avoid accountability for coal ash spills , up to threatening to withhold power from federal military installations if fined . What I found was unconvincing . Findings and conclusions are summarized in the following report . 1 : Lowest-cost energy sources in each county of North Carolina . These calculations do not include subsidies , tax credits , or externalities -LRB- e.g. damage from accidents , pollution-related costs such as increased healthcare , damage from accidents , etc -RRB- . Wind and solar have been the true , unsubsidized , lowest-cost source of power in North Carolina for nearly two years . However , solar and wind are still competitive with natural gas even after accounting for firming . This is shown in detail in Figure 4 .

Investigations found that generating companies , including Enron , had deliberately gamed markets to create artificial shortages and maximize profits through the resulting price spikes -LRB- 13 , 22 , 23 -RRB- . Most notably , then-Governor Gray Davis was ousted in a recall election for his perceived role in the crisis . Often neglected is that regardless of who drove the crisis , it was only possible thanks to a market structure dominated by natural gas . Fragile supply chains . Cheap natural gas needs an infrastructure of a few large , arterial pipelines . Gas power plants can shut down and restart fairly quickly compared to coal and nuclear . This is typically an advantage , as it allows gas plants to respond quickly to changes in demand . This is in contrast to coal and nuclear plants , which once online must stay running .

Rich asks . efforts succeeded in exaggerating natural price shocks . price inflation through temporary plant shutdowns is not possible with coal , nuclear , wind , or solar . This type of market interference requires a power source that can be brought on - and offline at will . An energy strategy that depends on imports is a poor strategy . Meanwhile , North Carolina has no gas fields . A natural gas strategy locks the entire state into dependence on one or two pipeline arteries carrying imported gas . A single incident can spark months of supply shortages and elevated prices . In other words , Duke Energy threatened national defense readiness to get out of cleaning up its own mess . North Carolina would be wise to think twice before entrusting its energy future to an entity with this track record . However , it appears history is about to repeat itself . Industry requires intense heat and has traditionally used fossil fuels such as coal , coke , and natural gas .

Imported natural gas can be used for process heat in petroleum and chemical refining , but it can not be used as a feedstock -LRB- 41 -RRB- . Therefore metal refining , petroleum , and the conventional chemicals industry will not be considered in this review as they are not competitive in North Carolina for fundamental market reasons . Natural gas introduces defects and contaminants into the product -LRB- 42 , 46 -RRB- . This adds costs to metal processing , and makes silicon manufacturing -LRB- computer chips , solar cells , etc -RRB- impossible . Natural gas requires long heating times . ceramics , and semiconductors : Require high-intensity heat to melt raw materials and control cooling .

Since energy use is drastically lower than traditional refining competitors , energy costs are not an important factor in this industry . Key to success in this industry are a high-tech worker population and low-cost agricultural feedstocks like cellulose , starch , oils , and protein . North Carolina is already well-positioned to succeed in biorefining using an all-renewable power grid . Industries that are competitive in North Carolina have process heat needs that are better met by biomass and electric sources such as induction , electric arc , laser stamping , electromagnetic curing , etc. fears of interfering with military operations ignore the fact that much of the world is adopting local energy . No use of rural land is needed . Farms that add solar power typically do so on only part of their land . Most farms have some acreage that has always yielded poorly . Supply interruptions , price spikes , outages , and even deliberate price manipulation are all established consequences of reliance on natural gas . Renewable local energy creates more jobs per megawatt-hour than imported natural gas , bringing better economic growth than natural gas without additional costs .
