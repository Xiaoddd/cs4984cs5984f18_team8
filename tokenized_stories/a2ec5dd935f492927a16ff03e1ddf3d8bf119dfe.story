Yesterday morning everybody was crying of shock and horror ; and by night we assembled one of the most beautiful protest that brought me to tears . Trump would , could never make me cry . But the solidarity of humans sure did . It was a night I doubt any of us could forget . And when emotions fly high of course we get a poem . Animosity , adversity there is still unity in diversity do n't waste your hate gather it and create create a movement the leads home those who 've strayed do n't forget every vessel has had stowaways It matters not what stand you took it matters not who won or might have won because in all honesty both ways we loose and , lets be frank raw bold insanities are much better then sugar-coated profanities for an open fight I will welcome any day over a game of chess where pieces have already double crossed humanity It 's much better to face the naked truth then the lies that hide behind frosty looks . Sometimes it 's good to be shaken thoroughly , because alarm clocks where definitely not waking humanity by themselves . Powered by Blogger .
