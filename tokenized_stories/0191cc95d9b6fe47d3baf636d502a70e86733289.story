Eliseu Lopes , the leading indigenous voice in Brazil , campaigns for the recuperation of Guarani ancestral land and to bring national and international attention to his people 's plight . We have to face up to this life ; there 's no alternative : we have to fight for what is ours . Eliseu Lopes In November 2011 , masked gunmen appeared at a camp set up by around 60 indigenous people in Guayviry , close to Brazil 's border with Paraguay . According to news reports , there were up to 40 gunmen . They ordered the camp dwellers to lie face down on the ground and , when some resisted , they opened fire . Many of the Guarani escaped into the surrounding forest ; some were wounded and others were reportedly kidnapped . But it was clear that the gunmen had come with a specific target in mind . Multiple witnesses saw the masked men shoot Gomes in the head , chest , arms and legs before carrying away his body -LRB- which has never been recovered -RRB- . Eliseu Lopes , also a Guarani leader and today Brazil 's best-known campaigner for indigenous people 's rights , has been actively campaigning for indigenous land rights -LRB- and thereby risking his life -RRB- since 2003 , when he went to work as a teacher in the indigenous village of Taquapiri , Mato Grosso do Sul . After Gomes ' murder , Lopes and other Guarani leaders organised a campaign to bring the guilty to justice . Nineteen men were eventually charged in relation to the murder but , of the seven jailed in 2012 , none served more than two years . Today , the only man convicted and still detained is Aurelino Arce , a retired military police officer and owner of the private security business for which many of the gunmen worked . He is kept under house arrest . Fifteen indigenous leaders were killed ... police investigations led nowhere ... Around 100 years ago , the Brazilian government took their lands and handed them to ranchers and farmers for development . The indigenous people were placed on reservations - often the poorest , least productive land . Nowadays , the Guarani find themselves crammed into small patches of land like Dourados , a stretch measuring 12 square miles and home to more than 12,000 people . The lack of space and services leads to poor health and malnutrition . And it 's not just the Guaranis ' physical health that suffers . Having to live in these conditions , risking violence from local ranchers and seeing family members shot places an extraordinary strain on their mental health . As a result , the Guarani have the highest suicide rate in the world . Children as young as nine have taken their own lives . The Guarani people face an uphill battle for justice , land and better living conditions . They organise protests and bring legal cases to local courts , where , due to the enormous influence of rich landowners , they invariably lose . Since 2007 , Lopes has been the spokesman for the Aty Guasu Movement , an organisation that fights for the recuperation of the Guaranis ' ancestral lands ; he is also a leading figure on the Board of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil . Every month I had to relocate to another village . This contributed to the breakdown of my marriage ... . It 's a difficult , frightening situation because we have nowhere to run to .
