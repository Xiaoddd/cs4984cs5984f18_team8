The North Dakota Supreme Court partially granted a petition that will open the door for out-of-state lawyers to represent the more than 600 people who have been arrested amid the ongoing resistance . Also on Wednesday , a federal judge rejected an attempt by the Dakota Access pipeline company , Energy Transfer Partners , to block the Army Corps of Engineers from beginning a lengthy environmental impact statement on the section of the pipeline slated to cross the Missouri River .
