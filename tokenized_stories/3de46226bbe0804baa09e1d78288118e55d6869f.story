It was after sundown on a cold night at the Backwater Bridge at the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . Dundon , 31 , a Navajo and mother of four , had arrived two months earlier to join thousands of others in their battle against the Dakota Access pipeline . Now pipeline foes wanted to clear them and open the road for emergency vehicles . The men moved onto the bridge . Police in riot gear fired tear gas canisters and rubber bullets from behind barbed wire . As Dundon took cover , she heard a woman yelling for help . She looked up . A flaming canister was headed her way . It was too late to duck . I figured , it 's coming . Dundon closed her eyes . Hours after Dundon was injured , 21-year-old Sophia Wilansky , a recent graduate of Williams College , nearly had her left arm blown off by an explosive device . Dundon faced obstacles at every turn as she sought medical help , but Wilansky was flown to a Minneapolis hospital in the hours after the explosion . And Dundon 's injury received a fraction of the attention given to journalist Erin Schrode , whose Facebook post of her injury from a rubber bullet received nearly 2.5 million views . He said he suffered severe bleeding from a wound that required seven staples to close . His injury also received little attention . Wilansky recognized the disparity in a recent Facebook post . She offered to donate some of the funds she has received to lesser-known victims of police violence . Dundon said , smiling . But it was n't until September when she saw a video of dogs from a pipeline security team biting protesters that she decided to join them . She found a ride and traveled north to Standing Rock . Vanessa Dundon in October at the Dakota Access oil pipeline protest . She swapped her skirts and moccasins for the Marine and Army uniforms her veteran sisters had brought her from Arizona . Instinctively she covered it with a bandana . She tried to run but almost immediately felt a rubber bullet pierce her skin . She fell . No , they told her , you 're just bleeding a lot . But Dundon 's eye had been damaged , and in the crucial hours she had to save it , she found herself in a healthcare nightmare . After camp medics applied sutures to halt the bleeding , a Standing Rock ambulance took her to a clinic in Mandan , an hour 's drive away . As she waited for attention , Dundon said , she overheard nurses talking about a Native man who 'd been injured on the bridge . An hour later a doctor arrived and gave her stitches . He told her she needed to see a retina specialist immediately , but there were only three in the state . He recommended one in Fargo , 200 miles east . But they were unavailable over the Thanksgiving holiday . The next day , Dundon went to a retina clinic in Mandan . Clerks there refused to accept her Indian Health Service insurance card from Arizona . She called her mother , trying to connect the clinic with her Arizona benefits coordinator . This is 72 hours to save my eye . Vanessa Dundon Share quote & link Desperate for money , she returned to camp , where a drum group sang and a woman danced for her at the sacred fire . Her cousin then drove her four hours to Fargo , where she checked into an emergency room . But there was so much bleeding in her eye that it was impossible to determine the extent of the damage , she said . The next day , an ophthalmologist told her she probably had a detached retina . I 'm on the front lines . I am very passionate . Morton County officials would not comment specifically on Dundon 's case because of the lawsuit . However , they have consistently defended police tactics . Duncan said her anger goes far beyond the police . Injured , she was unable to get the quick medical help she needed .
