Tribes including the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux are fighting the Dakota Access project because they fear it will harm drinking water and cultural sites . Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners says the 1,200-mile pipeline through the Dakotas , Iowa and Illinois will be safe . The agency previously had said it would not evict protesters due to free speech reasons . North Dakota officials contend the Corps should not allow people to be on the land without a permit . More than 525 people from across the country have been arrested since August . In a recent clash between police and protesters near the path of the pipeline , officers used tear gas , rubber bullets and large water hoses in freezing weather . Organizers said at least 17 protesters were taken to the hospital , some for hypothermia and one for a serious arm injury . One officer was injured . Standing Rock tribal members and other Native Americans believe the land with the encampment is rightly owned by the Sioux through a more than century-old treaty with the U.S. government . The pipeline is projected to move a half-million barrels of crude oil daily to an existing pipeline in Patoka , Illinois , for shipment to Midwest and Gulf Coast markets . The Standing Rock Sioux , whose reservation straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border , are suing federal regulators for approving the pipeline . A federal judge in September denied its request to block construction of the entire pipeline . An appeal is pending . Since then , the Corps has called for even more study and tribal input . The company responded by asking U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to declare that it has the right to lay pipe under Lake Oahe .
