The bill is one of several being introduced across the US that seek to penalize protesters . Both critics and supporters of the controversial bill agree on one thing : it is a response to Black Lives Matter-inspired protests in the Twin Cities area over the last two years , particularly after an officer shot and killed Philando Castile in July . The officer who shot Castile , Jeronimo Yanez , has since been charged with second degree manslaughter . Rosa Parks sat in the front of the bus . The bill , which passed a Republican-controlled committee in the Minnesota house of representatives on Tuesday , would give state agencies , cities or counties the authority to bring civil lawsuits against people convicted of unlawful assembly or public nuisance . If you look at the civil rights movement , people were beaten , they had dogs on them . The proposal is part of a broader trend of bills that punish protest in US state legislatures . In North Dakota , the site of protests over the Dakota Access pipeline , a new bill would protect drivers who inadvertently hit protesters blocking the road . And in Iowa , a proposed bill would create five-year prison sentences for protesters who block highways . None of those proposals have become law . Teresa Nelson , the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union -LRB- ACLU -RRB- of Minnesota , warned that the bill could empower the government to pick and choose which kinds of protesters to pursue in civil court . According to Zerwas , making civil disobedience harder was exactly what he had in mind . Patience Zalanga , a photographer known for documenting the Black Lives Matter movement and who testified against the bill , said she feared that if it became law , both she and the people she photographs could be targeted .
