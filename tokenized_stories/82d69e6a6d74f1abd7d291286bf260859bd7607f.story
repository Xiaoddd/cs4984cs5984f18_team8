A subcontractor drilling a hole for Charter-Spectrum on Monterey Road , near the intersection of Wellsona Road and Highway 101 , hit the 3-foot pipe around 1 p.m. and created a 3-inch hole , said Mark Hutchinson , deputy director of San Luis Obispo County 's Public Works Department . The crews notified county staff immediately , and they were able to shut off the water remotely . Even so , about 4 acre-feet of water , or 1.2 million gallons , spilled out of the hole , Hutchinson said . Crews had to wait for water to drain before pumping out mud and debris that had gotten into the pipe , which is located 7 feet below ground , he said . Workers then patched the pipe and began repairing the roadway . SIGN UP Be the first to know . No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do .

After it was shut off , the city began pumping water from Whale Rock Reservoir near Cayucos until repairs were completed about 9 a.m. Thursday . Repairs to the road were expected to be completed Friday , Hutchinson said . The county and the company still need to work out how much each party will pay , Hutchinson said . The Nacimiento Water Project has been delivering Lake Nacimiento water to customers throughout the county since 2011 . A decades-old agreement with Monterey County gives San Luis Obispo County rights to 17,500 acre-feet of water per year . The county rarely uses all of its water , so Hutchinson said the 4 acre-feet that was spilled should n't have too much of an impact .
