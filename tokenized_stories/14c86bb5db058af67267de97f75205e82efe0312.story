Stover , 54 , likes living out here in the country on U.S. Highway 51 , between the tiny villages of Vernon and Patoka . His closest neighbor is the tank farm , a sprawling complex of enormous white steel tanks that are nearly 4 stories tall . Each can hold upwards of a quarter of a million gallons of crude oil . Business had been good on this grey winter day . Somewhere , on the other side of tall security fences , that infamous pipeline will join a busy underground hub . Crude oil already flows into the tank farm through the Keystone , Enbridge and Capline pipelines . The oil leaves through outgoing pipes that transport it north and east to about a dozen refineries in Illinois , Ohio , and West Virginia . One pipeline heads west , to the Phillips 66 facility in Wood River . Thousands of demonstrators joined with the Standing Rock Sioux to protest the location of the pipeline in North Dakota . In September , a small group protested at the tank farm . Loading ... But Stover has seen few demonstrators . He says the tank farm has been a good neighbor . I know they maintain it well . Stover has little interaction with the tank farm workers , but at Christmas , they bring over a gift basket . Or , the heavy trucks that rumble past on their way to the tank farm . Shortly after taking office , President Donald Trump signed an executive order that lifted a previous order by former President Barack Obama that had called for a review by the Army Corps of Engineers . Construction in North Dakota resumed last week . In Illinois , where the pipeline crosses nearly 180 miles and 12 counties , construction was met with little opposition , though Illinois conservationists have expressed environmental concerns . A report by the nonprofit Prairie Rivers Network , for example , found that the pipeline crosses under more than 50 rivers , big and small , in the state and could put the water supplies of nearby towns at risk should there be a spill . And spills do occur . The village , founded as a railroad town in 1854 , has a population of about 560 , according to the U.S. Census . Everyone knows everyone . Country singer Drew Baldridge , a rising star in Nashville , was one of 17 graduates in the Class of 2010 . He filmed a video in town a few years ago . And the oil companies and their employees contribute time and money to community projects . Once construction is complete , tank farms operate with small workforces . So , many Patoka residents commute to jobs in larger nearby towns , like Vandalia , Salem or Centralia . Like many small rural towns , Patoka has lost population and businesses in recent years , Brumfield said . ADM has a grain elevator in the village . Our grocery stores are gone . We used to have an auto body shop . We used to have pizza places . We had a flower shop . An exception is Foltz Welding , a Patoka business that began in the 1990s . Foltz is a pipeline contractor that builds pump stations and does maintenance work for various pipeline companies . The company works all over the country , but it does not lay pipeline cross-country , said Jeff Lauritzen , operations manager at Foltz . He said his company has built a large portion of the tank farm . Foltz keeps about 50 or 60 people employed , he said , adding that his company employed over 400 people last year , when seasonal and temporary construction workers are included . Tank farms help move the volume of oil that Americans use in products ranging from gasoline to hair products , Lauritzen said . People expect to see lots of farmland in Illinois , so the tank farm is a striking sight , even on a Google satellite map . From the air , the 60 or so tanks look like white buttons on a crazy quilt of corn and soybean fields . According to Genscape , a company that monitors oil inventories , Patoka has a storage capacity of more than 18 million barrels . During World War II , the federal government divided the nation into five Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts , or PADDs . Patoka is the second-largest oil storage site in PADD 2 ; the largest is Cushing . Well , it helps to know that a century ago , oil was king in Marion County . In January 1938 , oil was discovered on the Glenn Merryman farm , a half-mile south of Patoka . Soon there were derricks all over the countryside , and by the end of the year , Illinois was producing 7.5 million barrels of oil . Jim Watson of the Illinois Petroleum Council says that geography had a lot to do with it . You have a major tank farm and switching point in Cushing , Oklahoma . Then you have the one in Patoka . He believes that , because oil was being produced in Marion County , there was already a storage footprint there , and from there the tank farm grew . Treffert lives in Vernon , where the population was 129 in the 2010 census . Lots of grain farming . Your soybeans . Your corn . Some milo . The little park has a life-size statue of a Union Army soldier , playground equipment and picnic benches . From her back door , Treffert has an unobstructed view of the storage tanks , about a half-mile away . People around here , we just sort of stick to ourselves . To see more , visit KWMU-FM .
