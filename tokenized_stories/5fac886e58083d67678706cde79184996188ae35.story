Dakota Access Pipeline protestors . Since the blockade against the DAPL began 10 months ago , dozens of Native Hawaiian community leaders have traveled to Standing Rock in a show of solidarity . Despite pressure from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , the U.S. Department of the Interior and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation , the pipeline builders failed to consult tribes and conduct a full environmental impact statement . Led by native tribes , a peaceful global movement of over 2 million people is currently blocking the construction of the pipeline in order to protect this vital water source and its surrounding sacred grounds from destruction . We have won a battle but not the war . The builders are willing to do anything and everything it takes to see this project through the end . It is as important now as it has been over the past few months to stand our ground and continue to fight to ensure this pipeline and future pipelines are never constructed . We must continue to pressure our banks and corporations to divest from fossil fuels and end our dependency on crude oil . It is clear that First Hawaiian Bank -LRB- FHB -RRB- is dedicated to helping our community thrive by the amount of time and money they donate to local causes , the Sierra Club release stated .
