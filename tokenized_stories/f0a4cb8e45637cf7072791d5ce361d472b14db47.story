Standing Rock . Standing Rock became a ghost town last week after police raided and razed the prayer camp that once hosted thousands of water protectors . Earlier this month , the Trump administration fast-tracked approval to build the final section of the pipeline and cancelled the environmental impact statement ordered by President Obama . Construction is nearing completion and oil could flow through the pipeline as early as March 6 . It may be a long shot , but a legal win is still possible , some advocates say . A legal challenge filed by the tribe on Feb. 14 charges pipeline builder Dakota Access , LLC , and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with a range of environmental , cultural , and treaty-based violations . It asks a federal judge to rule on whether the Army Corps broke laws and treaties by allowing construction of the last leg of the pipeline under Lake Oahe , a reservoir along the Missouri River in North Dakota . Tribes like the Sioux are independent , self-governing nations like any other in the world . And the sovereignty of tribal nations preexists the United States , just like the nations themselves . Many Native Americans believe that this sovereignty is now under extreme threat . The administration of Donald Trump may be the most hostile to Indian tribes since that of Andrew Jackson , who caused the Trail of Tears in the 1830s , argues Matthew Fletcher , a professor of law at Michigan State University and a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians . If the current legal motion fails , he says the tribe will appeal in federal circuit court . Even if oil starts flowing in the pipeline in the interim , it could still be shut off down the line , Hasselman told the Bismarck Tribune . And tribes are waging other legal battles against the pipeline too . On Feb. 9 , the Cheyenne River Sioux filed a motion to temporarily halt construction on the grounds that the pipeline would violate their right to religious freedom by desecrating the sacred waters of Lake Oahe . The Oglala Sioux Tribe joined the fray on Feb. 13 with its own lawsuit claiming that the pipeline threatened its treaty rights to safe drinking water . Still , it could take months , if not years , for all of these cases to move through the courts . Powys Whyte urges non-indigenous environmentalists to get educated about Native American history and tribal rights , and to consult with tribes and incorporate their concerns into campaigns . To learn more , he recommends reading the Native Appropriations blog and the Standing Rock syllabus . Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections : For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S. , particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election .
