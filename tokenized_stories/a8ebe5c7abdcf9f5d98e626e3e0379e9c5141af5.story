Something strange has been happening in the last month or so : Members of Congress -LRB- MoCs -RRB- from all over the country are going missing . Odd . That means MoCs are enormously sensitive to their local image , and they will work very hard to avoid signs of public disapproval from constituents . Some MoCs have clearly made the calculation that they can lay low , avoid their constituents , and hope the current storm blows over . This toolkit describes how local groups can make missing MoCs more accessible . MoCs are gambling that out of sight means out of mind . It will take some work , but their constituents have power win at this game . This works -- and this brief describes the nuts and bolts of getting it done . Town halls are a basic part of our democratic heritage and every Member of Congress should have them . Town halls are a time-honored tradition for listening to constituents . In addition to allowing constituents to communicate their views directly to a MoC , rather than through staff , it gives MoCs the chance to take the temperature of their constituents and discuss their positions in greater detail . Now , some MoCs find the prospect of a town hall , or even a large group meeting , pretty scary . If they handle a controversial policy question or a heartfelt personal story poorly , a whole lot of people are going to hear about it . As a constituent , you deserve opportunities to share your views and personal stories about how policy affects your lives with your representative . And you also deserve opportunities to hear directly from your MoC about where they stand on the issues you care about . Check if your MoC has a calendar of events on their website . Some MoCs will use their own channels or other mailing lists to advertise public events so that only their supporters will know about them . Other good mailing lists . Check out open-source listings . Connect with local media . To do this , research on Google News what local reporters have written about your MoCs . Find and follow those reporters on Twitter , and build relationships . Before you attend or plan a town hall , reach out and explain why your group is going , and provide them with background materials and a quote , including how many members your group has and how many times you have called your members to ask for a town hall or public event . Reach out to organizations with civic missions and ask them to weigh in or invite MoCs to community forums or events . MoCs might be willing to dodge your Indivisible group but hesitate to alienate a local civic association , PTA , or church group . Collect data . Try to find out when your MoC last held a public event . So , your next step is to draw attention to the fact that your MoC has gone into hiding . If the drumbeat gets loud enough , they may back down . Here are some ways you can creatively press for them to come around : Gather RSVPs . Demonstrate the demand for a town hall by collecting a list of interested constituents who want to come . You can do this via Facebook , or whatever platform is easiest for you . Get the attention of the press . Call or write local political reporters and explain the situation to them . Be concise , clear , and as specific as possible . Draft and distribute a statement about the lack of opportunities for constituents to engage with your MoC . Take it to Twitter and Facebook : post about your experiences trying to get a public meeting with your MoC . Tag local reporters for additional visibility . Find prominent people to amplify your message . If you know any local celebrities or prominent people , ask them to help spread the word . Do some research to find out what else they might be doing . If your MoC is attending a fundraiser -LRB- you can check here for a partial list -RRB- , meeting with lobbyists , or being interviewed by friendly press , this can reflect poorly on them . Asking whatever it is your MoC is doing with their time instead of meeting with the constituents they represent . Finding out what public meetings other MoCs are having , and highlighting that as a point of comparison . This requires some additional preparation , but it can be extremely effective in drawing attention to your missing MoC . Explore holding your event at a local school , library , or conference or convention center where a space can be obtained for low cost . Find out if basics like chairs and audio equipment are already available at the venue . Invite your MoC . There are a couple of ways to invite your MoC to an event : Official invite to the office . You can also hand deliver an invitation to a district office . To drum up extra excitement about the event , document the process and post about it on social media with photos and video . Begrudgingly accept staffers instead . Your MoC very well may not come , and they might even hide from you entirely . Publicize widely that your MoCs are keynote speakers who have been invited . Think about the visuals and get creative . For instance , be prepared with a cardboard cutout or an empty chair . This is a classic political campaign tactic for when your opponent refuses to debate . It also works well for highlighting an absentee MoC . Plan a segment of the event where participants highlighting the fact that your MoC is acting cowardly and hiding from constituents . Plan for other speakers . Ask for attendees to plan to come prepared to speak out on specific policies that they care about , or that have personally affected them . In addition to individuals from your own group , these speakers could include : Advocacy and community groups that work on behalf of those threatened by the Trump administration -LRB- e.g. , your local immigrant rights group -RRB- , and ask them to come speak . Other local public officials who are happy to speak to their constituents . This is a great way to start a discussion with your own local leaders about ways local action can be part of pushing back against the Trump agenda . Publicize the event . Get in touch with press ahead of time . Issue a media advisory and send it to local reporters . Old-fashioned advertisement work . Put up flyers at coffee shops , bus stops , community centers , etc. . Write an op-ed for your local newspaper making clear why your group is holding this event . Social media works too . Spread the word on Facebook and start inviting your friends , allies , and other constituents . Tell people on Twitter , and come up with a hashtag for your event . Post the information on your neighborhood listservs . Get ready to cover the town hall live . Assign people in your group to livestream the event via Facebook Live or Periscope and to live-tweet . Remember : the more attention , the more pressure on your MoC ; and the more pressure , the more impact . Always remember : be polite , be respectful , and be persistent . In all your actions , you will do best if you model the respect and thoughtfulness that you want to see from your MoCs . For more information , contact Jane Doe at 222-222-2222 . We will win . The tactics for making your voice heard at these events are similar but a bit different from the public town hall events : Optimize visibility . Unlike in town halls , you want your presence as a group to be recognizable and attention-getting at this event . Be prepared to interrupt and insist on your right to be heard . Agree beforehand with your group on a simple message focused on a current or upcoming issue . Coordinate with each other to chant this message outside , or during any public remarks that your MoC makes . This can be difficult and a bit uncomfortable . Identify , and try to speak with , reporters on the scene . Be polite and friendly , and stick to your message . You may want to research in advance which local reporters cover MoCs or relevant beats -LRB- e.g. , politics -RRB- , so that you know who to look for . Emphasize that all of you are constituents . Give your hometowns and emphasize your roots in the community . Hold organizational hosts accountable . Reach out to them directly to express your concern that they are giving a platform to pro-Trump authoritarianism , sexism , racism , and corruption . If they persist , use social media to express your disappointment . This will reduce the likelihood that these organizations will host the Trump-friendly MoC in the future .
