Because It Sure Seems That Way . Because It Sure Seems That Way . by Scott Faith What a difference a few days makes . After responding to a -LRB- fundamentally misguided -RRB- call to action to support the Standing Rock protest , hundreds and perhaps thousands of US military veterans were left without basic necessities , without leadership , and now -LRB- after being asked to leave by the protest organizers -RRB- , without a mission . Yeah bro , I know your heart was in the right place , but you got played . At any rate , you can watch the whole sorry apology display for yourself here . Maybe vets should take a tactical pause and direct their efforts to causes that benefit veterans and the nation as a whole , and not allow themselves to be used by people who obviously care so little about them .
