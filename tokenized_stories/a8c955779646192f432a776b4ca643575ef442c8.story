The report found there were dangerous levels of chemicals in the underground water supply used by the 230 residents of Pavillion , a small town in central Wyoming . Levels of benzine , a flammable liquid used in fuel , were 50 times above the allowable limit , while chemicals were dumped in unlined pits and cement barriers to protect groundwater were inadequate , the research found . Dominic DiGiulio worked with Stanford academic Robert Jackson on the research after the EPA decided to ditch its own study into the situation at Pavillion , which came to light after residents complained about the smell and taste of their water . Using publicly available information and freedom of information requests , DiGiulio and Jackson have published a report in Environmental Science & Technology that examines what went wrong at Pavillion . The research finds that workers were drilling at very shallow depths , as little as 700ft underground , placing the fracking operation uncomfortably close to the drinking water aquifer that supplies the wells used by Pavillion residents . The water contamination caused by the fracking was compounded by questionable practices going back to the 1960s , before fracking took place , such as the dumping of chemicals into unlined pits . The legacy of this pollution was evident several years after fracking finished in 2007 , with the EPA starting its investigation in 2010 before turning it over to Wyoming . What happened there could happen elsewhere . Hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , is a process where water and chemicals are injected underground in order to draw out gas or oil resources from rock formations . The practice has proved controversial in some communities and has become a point of contention between the Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders . Fracking is lightly regulated in the US due to its exemption from Safe Drinking Water Act restrictions . But in the instances where something goes wrong , we need to know and we need to learn from them . Please choose your username under which you would like all your comments to show up .
