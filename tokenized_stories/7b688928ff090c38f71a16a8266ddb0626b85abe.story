Like Norway , some the largest funders and supporters of the Dakota Access pipeline and other fossil fuel developments in the U.S. and across the world are based in Switzerland . In Zurich , the Delegation met with Credit Suisse and UBS , and held a press conference , public event and interview sessions with leading media outlets . That said , I think it was very powerful for them to see our faces first hand and to hear the experiences of people at Standing Rock and to know that their money is invested in the company that is creating this pipeline project causing destruction to real people . We are in the era of renewable energy , we have alternatives to the fossil fuel industry . We are asking the Swiss people to stand with us and to recognize that the actions they take affect others around the world and that simply because it 's out of sight and out of mind does not mean that this is not actually happening . Yet they are still in denial about their direct financing of the corrupt Energy Transfer Partner corporation and its role in the Dakota Access pipeline project . Credit Suisse is attempting to distance themselves from these violations of indigenous rights and human rights abuses . The Indigenous women leaders spoke truth to power at the Credit Suisse meeting and are calling for justice . The bank representatives who heard the women speak will not be the same again after hearing first hand experiences of rights violations and their demands for no more fossil fuel extraction on their lands , respect for Indigenous Rights , Indigenous sovereignty , human rights and the rights of nature .
