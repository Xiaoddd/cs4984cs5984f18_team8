-LRB- Courtesy Bill O'Brien -RRB- They came . They saw . They started a lacrosse game . Native American lacrosse players and activist athletes , Lyle Thompson , Bill O'Brien and Albany head coach Scott Marr drove 27 hours from Upstate New York to the front lines of the Dakota Access Pipeline protests this week , making good on a social media campaign they 've waged to spread awareness about the controversial standoff . And then they played a game of lacrosse . Thompson organized games and some light instruction for newcomers Tuesday afternoon . About half the participants were Natives , and most had never played the game before . Bill O'Brien -LRB- l. -RRB- and Lyle Thompson -LRB- c. -RRB- use the ancient game of lacrosse to uplift the spirits of peaceful protestors in Cannon Ball , North Dakota . -LRB- Courtesy Scott Marr -RRB- Thompson , a professional player , said every spring , his community back home on the Onondaga Reservation outside Syracuse plays a medicine game to coincide with the spring renewal . Traditional wooden sticks , which are said to hold the actual , soulful medicine , are used . So they played hard on the Dakota plains , too , he said . The pickup games played near the pipeline protest camps were meant to bring a different community together and offer some relief , distraction and healing amid the tough , peaceful fight they 've been waging . Lyle Thompson , the all-time NCAA in points , is a Native American . His ancestors created the game of lacrosse as a ` medicine game ' to heal communities . The 1,172-mile project will snake through four states , but the point of contention is a tract of Sioux land protected under a treaty signed in 1851 . There are also concerns the project could pollute the Missouri River , which it will travel underneath . For the last few months , Thompson and other Native athletes like O'Brien and Cody Jamieson , have been using their social media platforms to spread awareness about the controversial pipeline and the mistreatment of peaceful protestors by a militarized police force . Lyle Thompson -LRB- c. -RRB- explains how to play lacrosse to Native protestors . -LRB- Courtesy of Scott Marr -RRB- Thompson Brothers Lacrosse has taken an active role in promoting awareness about injustice towards Native Americans . In the last few weeks , they have also spoken out against insensitive names and logos in sports like the Washington football team 's -LRB- the Daily News no longer uses the D.C. football team 's name -RRB- and the Cleveland Indians ' Chief Wahoo . Marr coached Thompson and his brother Miles at Albany , a program that will have eight Native American lacrosse players on the roster in the spring and he 's supported their activist endeavors . Lyle graduated from Albany as the NCAA 's all-time leader with 400 points and 225 assists and won two Tewaaraton Trophies , the equivalent of the Heisman . As a pro athlete , he 's taken on social issues this year because he says it 's his calling to educate and inspire other Native youth who face oppressive conditions on reservations across the country , including deep poverty , drug addiction and high suicide rates . Even greater , and more meaningful , was seeing their ancestor 's game played in a place that 's been ravaged by politics and to feel the true healing powers of lacrosse shine through .
