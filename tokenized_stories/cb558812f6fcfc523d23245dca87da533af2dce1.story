She said she is also concerned about how protests of the pipeline were met with aggressive police force . She was invited to the US by Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault , AP reported . Her visit to the US included concerns over the Keystone XL pipeline , as well . In November , acting on a request from the tribe , Edward John , a member of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues , visited the Oceti Sakowin protest camp and other areas near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball Rivers in North Dakota . He also met with local law enforcement , he said . Tauli-Corpuz previously called on the US to halt construction of the DAPL . The protests camps eventually attracted more than just Standing Rock Sioux Tribe members and those of other Native American tribes . In addition to tribal water supply concerns , the Missouri River is a source of drinking water to millions in the US . The DAPL also represents a continued dependance on fossil fuels , opponents say , which contributes significantly to global climate change . Thousands of people flocked to the area to support the DAPL opposition , leading to hundreds of arrests by at times aggressive , heavily-armed law enforcement . The Standing Rock Sioux has sued the Army Corps of Engineers and Energy Transfer Partners in federal court . The tribe has argued that the DAPL also threatens its sacred cultural and religious sites in the area . The defendants in the lawsuit dispute these claims . Via RT. .
