Now , Jack follows up with second , more action-oriented installment of post-election guidance and encouragement . An ordained tree in Thailand . Photo by Peter Hershey . As long as a society holds regular and frequent assemblies , meeting in harmony and mutual respect , can they be expected to prosper and not decline . As long as a society follows the long held traditions of wisdom , and honors its elders , can they be expected to prosper and not decline . As long as a society protects the wives and daughters and vulnerable among them , can they be expected to prosper and not decline . As long as a society cares for the shrines and sacred places of the natural world , can they be expected to prosper and not decline . To stand against hate . To stand for respect . To stand for protection of the vulnerable . To care for the natural world . Do not believe that meditation and contemplation are the fulfillment of the Buddhist Path . Inner peace , freedom and joy develop only when paired with the outer teachings of virtue , respect and mutual care . The foundation of Dharma is relational , built on generosity , virtue and loving-kindness . The Path to human happiness and liberation requires Right Intention , intentions that are free from greed , hatred and cruelty ; Right Speech , speech that is true and helpful , not harsh , not vain , slanderous nor abusive ; and Right Action , actions that are free from causing harm , killing , stealing and sexual exploitation . In his life , the Buddha intervened to try to stop wars . He counseled kings and ministers , and guided those around him with teachings of peace and respect . In modern times , Maha Ghosananda of Cambodia joined the United Nations peace process and led years of peace walks of loving-kindness through the war zones and killing fields of Cambodia . Thai abbots have taken their robes and ordained the oldest trees as elders of the forest to protect whole ecosystems from logging . Burmese monks and nuns marched in the streets to protect citizens from the harsh military dictatorship . A.T. Ariyaratne in Sri Lanka enlisted hundreds of thousands in a 500-year peace plan . Vietnamese , Chinese and Tibetan monastics have stood up for peace , justice and compassion , even immolating themselves to stop the harmful actions around them . This is not about red or blue . It is about standing up for the most basic of human principles , for moral action and the prevention of harm . It is embodying Dharma amidst the troubles of the world . You are not alone . You have generations of ancestors at your back . You have the blessing of interdependence and community . You have the great trees of the forest as steadfast allies . You have the turning of the seasons and the renewal of life as your music . You have the vast sky of emptiness to hold all things graciously . With peacefulness and mutual respect , our Buddhist communities can become centers of protection and vision . You have been training for this for a long time . With practice you have learned to quiet the mind and open the heart . You have learned emptiness and interdependence . Now it is time to step forward , bringing your equanimity and courage , wisdom and compassion to the world . The Bodhisattva shows the way to alleviate suffering amidst it all . But if even one person on the boat remained calm and centered , it was enough . Since the election , storms of uncertainty and fear have arisen . It is time to collectively stand up , calm and clear . With peacefulness and mutual respect , our Buddhist communities can become centers of protection and vision . Protection can take many forms . Protection can be providing sanctuary for those in danger . Protection can be skillfully confronting those whose actions would harm the vulnerable among us . Protection can be standing up for the environment . Protection can be becoming an active ally for those targeted by hate and prejudice . Now a time of change has come . We must listen deeply , bear witness , honor everyone , and choose our actions wisely and courageously . Do not worry if the Right Action is not yet clear to you . Wait in the unknowing with mindfulness and a clear heart . Soon the right time will come and you will know to stand up . I will meet you there .
