Leery of such official decisions after a string of disappointments , however , many water protectors immediately questioned whether ETP CEO Kelcy Warren had contingency plans to ensure completion of the pipeline . Indeed , to attain the desired path for Dakota Access , Energy Transfer Partners was able to take land from reluctant private property owners through eminent domain . However , it was becoming increasingly clear he was punting this issue down the road . Roads , bridges , transmission lines , pipelines , wind farms and water lines will be very difficult , if not impossible , to build when criminal behavior is rewarded this way . In my conversation with Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy today , she was unable to give any legal reasons for the decision and could not answer any questions about rerouting the pipeline . I feel badly for the Corps of Engineers because of the diligent work it did on this project , only to have their Commander-in-Chief throw them under the bus . Others quickly joined the tirade . The pipeline still remains in limbo . For the immediate future , the safety of residents , protesters , law enforcement , and workers remains my top priority as it should for everyone involved . We have seen nothing but foot-dragging and unhelpful directives from the Obama administration . With water protectors vowing to stay camped at Standing Rock until the Dakota Access Pipeline is halted for good , and Energy Transfer Partners openly dismissing the Army Corps of Engineers decision , a confluence of polemic circumstances has crafted a powder keg near the Missouri River . Winning this battle is as simple as choosing to abstain from the violent corrupt old system and participating in the new and peaceful system that hands the power back to the people . We feel that PIVX is this system . PIVX takes the control the banking elite has over money and gives it back to the people . It is the ultimate weapon in the battle against the money changers and information controllers because PIVX is the only cryptocurrency in existence that allows for completely anonymous storage while simultaneously paying interest .
