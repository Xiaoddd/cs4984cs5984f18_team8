The files have been traced back to TigerSwan , a North Carolina-based private security firm . But in a statement on Saturday , TigerSwan implicated TalentPen , a third-party vendor apparently used by the firm to process new job applicants . We take seriously the failure of TalentPen to ensure the security of this information and regret any inconvenience or exposure our former recruiting vendor may have caused these applicants . During conversations with Gizmodo , TigerSwan repeatedly refused to provide any documentation showing TalentPen was at fault . Found on an insecure Amazon S3 bucket without the protection of a password , the cache of roughly 9,400 documents reveal extraordinary details about thousands of individuals who were formerly and may be currently employed by the US Department of Defense and within the US intelligence community .

Between 15 and 20 applicants reportedly meet this criteria . Many of the files are timestamped and indicate that they were uploaded to the server in mid-February . Founded in 2008 by former a Delta Force operative , retired US Army Lt. Colonel James Reese , TigerSwan has operated on behalf of the U.S. military and State Department as a paramilitary force in Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as domestically on behalf of corporations . The firm reportedly employs a staff of roughly 350 with offices across the Middle East , in North and West Africa , Latin America , and Japan .

Some of the applicants were apparently involved in very sensitive and highly-classified military operations . According to UpGuard , at least one of the applicants claimed he was charged with the transportation of nuclear activation codes and weapons components . Others , who provided their home addresses , as well as personal email accounts and phone numbers , were employed and may be currently employed by US spy agencies for work on Top Secret surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations .

A Gizmodo investigation into the potential consequences of the breach was interrupted on Saturday after TigerSwan went public with a statement on its website . This article will be updated as more information becomes available . Update , 7:45 pm : Additional context concerning the resumes and remarks from UpGuard added . Advertisement Update , Sept. 3 , 8:40 pm : On Sunday afternoon , TigerSwan forwarded Gizmodo an email which appears to contain a discussion between TigerSwan and a former TalentPen employee . The account was setup to only give access to you and I. I even had to provide you with security credentials to access the information . Advertisement Gizmodo has reached out to the former TalentPen employee identified in the email and will update again if we get a response . Update , Sept. 4 , 12:00 pm : TigerSwan forwarded Gizmodo a second email over the weekend .
