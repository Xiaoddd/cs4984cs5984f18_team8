The Oceti Sakowin camp was the largest of several temporary camps on the northern edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota . Protectors have been living on this land for months , in support of members of the Standing Rock Sioux . The North Dakota Joint Information Center reports that 46 people were arrested . Others left the camp voluntarily throughout the day , according to a news release from the center . Lt. Tom Iverson of the North Dakota Highway Patrol said that 200 police officers were on site , with officers from various North Dakota agencies , and others from as far as Alabama , Wisconsin , and Indiana . A line of officers , prepped with riot gear and supported by about a dozen Humvees , made their way slowly through the camp as the day wore on , checking every standing shelter , and arresting the people who remained . The Morton County Sheriff 's department tweeted that camp was completely cleared by 2:09 p.m. local time , though afterward approximately 100 people stood on the opposite bank of the Cannonball River , singing and praying as police set up barricades to block off the site that had been the Oceti camp .

Thanking the Protectors Regina Brave Women She was also at Wounded Knee 73 The Old Ones say the Native American women will lead the healing among the tribes . Inside them are the powers of love and strength given by the Moon and the Earth . When everyone else gives up , it is the women who sings the songs of strength . She is the backbone of the people . I am one with the Earth . All around me my land When a man moves away from nature his heart becomes hard . - Lakota Coyote is always out there waiting , and Coyote is always hungry . - Navajo The hurt of one woman is the hurt of all women , the honor of one woman is the honor of all women . All of you are true warriors , we have n't lost a thing , but no truly where are heart is . Mother Earth knows our soul . It would do no good to fight , the police and army are only doing their jobs . Hurting them does not effect the monsters that let this happen , that signed the papers to take our rights and health away . Our right to protest will be taken away soon , along with the rest of our rights . We need to fight the way they do , with laws and loop holes , we need to learn the language of the snake with it 's forked tongue . Start taking the fight to the courts and political system . indigenous people often uphold the idea that a person is morally responsible for who they are , what they do and how they conduct themselves . The European system - built on the principle that the minimum amount of people can own everything their eye falls upon - that relegates everything to property - is built on a value system that uses force to apply a system that values nothing . That real , tangible things like earth or water or even the air can be traded for an artificial and fictitious commodity called money - a system that immediately creates deficiency and inequality as soon as it is applied . People say the court systems have been brought but as long as property truly is nine tenths of the law , indigenous peoples who will never uphold the belief that land can be owned , will always be disadvantaged and preyed upon by white society . Police at Standing Rock are complicit by their actions . They are the strong right arm of a regime that seeks to commoditise the American people and are actively preventing Americans from reclaiming their national authority . And they do it for nickels and dimes in their bank accounts . And a good many of them know it . June says : 00:10 Thank you all for being true and strong . You have my greatest admiration and love and have inspired and comforted those who could n't be there but were there in Spirit .
