Laney is sitting down . Standing , from left to right , are Mandan Police Chief Jason Ziegler , Lt. Rich Reichenberger with the Wisconsin Highway Patrol and Cass County Detective Tonya Jahner . Special to The Forum . There are some things the commissioners need to be aware of as they open this can of worms . Early on the state was getting assistance from other states through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact . Law enforcement from states like Minnesota , Ohio , and Wyoming , have come to the state to help patrol the protests . But law enforcement agencies in other states are no longer answering the requests due to political blow back from those supporting the protests . There are thousands of protesters in south central North Dakota and just a few hundred law enforcement personnel pulled from departments around the state to try and uphold the law . If Fargo pulls their support , the situation will be dire . The Obama administration is already hanging North Dakota out to dry on this matter with their delay in issuing the easement and refusal to send law enforcement resources to support Morton County . On top of that , coordinated protests in other states have cut off another avenue support .
