Dave Archambault II , chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe , waits to give his speech against the Energy Transfer Partners ' Dakota Access Pipeline during the Human Rights Council at the United Nations in Geneva , Switzerland , on Sept. 20 . But Little Dave , the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , now has a big platform as a leading opponent of the now-stalled Dakota Access Pipeline . Last fall Archambault addressed the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva , Switzerland , to rouse international opposition to the project , its progress frozen by the lack of a permit to cross beneath the Missouri River just upstream of Standing Rock . Then again , say those close to him , it 's not surprising at all , given Archambault 's dedication to helping others and serving his community . Surviving elements an enduring challenge for F-M homeless Cannon Ball , a village of 875 people located at the confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri rivers , has become the epicenter of opposition to the 1,172-mile Dakota Access Pipeline , which would cross upstream nearby , threatening Standing Rock 's drinking water supply . Although the pipeline 's route would cross the river outside the reservation boundary , as established in 1889 , the path lies within ancestral territory once promised to the Standing Rock Sioux under treaties . Treaty rights and tribal sovereignty have been at the core of Archambault 's argument against the legality and legitimacy of the pipeline , a point he made clear at the start of a meeting in 2014 with representatives of Energy Transfer Partners , the company building the Dakota Access . Archambault went on to say the tribe had been on record opposing any pipeline within the treaty boundaries . So far , at least , Little Dave and his legion of followers have beaten Big Oil . ` True to himself ' Dave Archambault 's path to Cannon Ball followed a winding road . He was born in Denver and spent his early childhood living on South Dakota 's Pine Ridge Indian Reservation . There he spent a lot of time with a grandfather and spent his free time learning to hunt and fish . He cut wood , helped tend the family garden , and accompanied his grandfather to scrounge for copper and aluminum from dumps . He grew up in a family of eight children . His life changed when Big Dave moved the family to Bismarck , where his father took a position with United Tribes Technical College . Archambault found adjusting to junior high in a small city outside a reservation difficult . With a friend , he took off , headed for Pine Ridge , but did n't get far before they were picked up by a state patrol officer and brought home . During 7th and 8th grade he attended the Circle of Nations School in Wahpeton , an off-reservation boarding school for American Indian children , and completed his secondary education in Fort Yates , N.D. . After two years , Archambault left Bismarck State College , where he played basketball , and took a job driving a school bus at Standing Rock while he contemplated his future . To vax or not to vax : Spreading truth on vaccinations remains struggle for experts At his father 's suggestion , he studied business , earning a bachelor 's degree from North Dakota State University and a master 's degree in management from the University of Mary . He saw running the convenience store as a way to provide access to food , gas and convenience items for his remote community , he added . Archambault , whose Lakota name is Tokala Ohitika , Brave Fox , has embraced traditional Lakota culture and spirituality . In his talks against the pipeline , he often talks about the importance of prayer . During the panel discussion in West Hollywood , which was streamed online , he said he at first felt daunted taking on a corporation worth billions of dollars . But the elder told Archambault not to underestimate the power of prayer . Scott Davis , executive director of the North Dakota Commission on Indian Affairs , the state 's liaison with the tribes , is a Standing Rock member who grew up with Archambault . Archambault 's embrace of traditional faith is integral to his leadership , Davis said . He really highly values his traditional ways . In meetings with officials from Morton County and the state , Archambault asks to start with a prayer , offered by a spiritual adviser , in Lakota and English . In those meetings , Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said , Archambault is polite but rigid in his assertion of treaty rights and opposition to the pipeline 's route across the Missouri . Although the meetings so far have made little headway , the parties are building a relationship , Kirchmeier said . Friends describe him as personable and easygoing , but purposeful . Both Davis and Jeanotte said he is devoted to his family , including his wife and two children . He has a passion for horses , which he raises on family land near Cannon Ball , including Nokota horses , a mustang breed from the North Dakota Badlands with ancestry includes ponies surrendered by Sitting Bull and his followers . In August , as the camp 's numbers mushroomed and tensions escalated , Archambault was arrested for disorderly conduct in a confrontation with police . Archambault 's arrest displayed his dedication , and helped propel the story , Trahant said . But then Archambault stepped back and let others occupy the spotlight , focusing on organizational matters , said Trahant , who blogs about Native American issues and has visited the camp , where he briefly met Archambault . One of Archambault 's greatest strengths , Trahant said , has been his effectiveness as a spokesman for his cause . She has participated in the protests against Dakota Access and has met Archambault and seen him on the front lines . Standing Rock faces many challenges apart from the pipeline threat , including chronic high poverty and unemployment . Yet the tribe has hosted protesters as guests , stepping in after the state withdrew portable bathrooms and drinking water last summer , LaDuke said . Trahant predicts the next stage of the opposition to the pipeline will play out largely in courtrooms . The tribe is waging a legal challenge to try to block the pipeline 's river crossing . Donald Trump , who becomes president Jan. 20 , has said he supports the Dakota Access Pipeline , which could lead to a reversal of the Obama administration 's easement denial . Archambault , who met with Obama when he visited Standing Rock several years ago , has asked to meet with Trump . Since the Dec. 5 federal decision to deny the easement , he has also asked protesters who are still camping near the proposed river crossing site to leave . Despite his urging , hundreds of protesters remain . The fierce opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline , led by an unprecedented coalition of more than 300 tribes , has put energy companies on notice that their infrastructure projects will face intense opposition if they threaten ancestral or tribal lands , he said . Still , as long as society remains addicted to fossil fuels , there will be more pipelines , the chairman said . And they now will face Native American nations that are newly emboldened and determined to be heard . He can be reached by calling 701-241-5522 .
