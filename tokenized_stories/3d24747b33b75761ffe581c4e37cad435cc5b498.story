Today in New York City there is a seminar on how professionals can confront vaccine resistance - pharmaspeak for how to deny vaccine exemption rights to Americans . The presenters include Dorit Reiss , a California law school teacher who spends 25 hours a day attacking parents of vaccine injured children as a media pitbull , Dr. Richard Pan , the pediatician -LRB- not a typo , read it slowly -RRB- from California behind SB277 , which removed vaccine exemption rights for millions of schoolchildren . And Dr. Paul Offit , the Philly doctor who does n't see or treat kids with autism , but has written numerous books defending vaccine injury as necessary for the greater good . Please meet at 11 am at 550 First Avenue in Manhattan to greet the speakers and attendees . The meeting is closed to the public but will feature three of America 's leading proponents of forced vaccination : Paul Offit , California State Senator Richard Pan and anti-vaccination rights Internet troll Dorit Reiss . Joining the Demonstration will be leading health advocate Gary Null , and VAXXED producers Polly Tommey and Del Bigtree . Bring friends , families and cameras . And bring a poster with a picutre of any vaccine-injured loved one , along with their name , the date they were injured and the vaccine -LRB- s -RRB- that injured them printed on the poster . Similar to 27 other states the vaccine industry unsuccessfully attempted to repeal religious exemption rights in New York this year . We fully expect them to be back in the next legislative session to try again . We believe that this event is related to a renewed effort in New York and other northeastern states to repeal exemption rights . Speakers include : State Senator Richard Pan , Pan is the sponsor of California 's Senate Bill SB 277 , which eliminated personal belief exemptions from vaccine mandates in California . Dorit Reiss , despite not having a law license in any state Reiss is a faculty member at the University of California 's Hastings Law School . Her production of scholarly work is limited to promoting forced vaccination . She is also noted for a prodigious output of comments online , sometimes hundreds of comments in a single day , all focused on promoting the vaccine industry and forced vaccination . Paul Offit , vaccine developer and proponent of seizing children and vaccinating them against parent 's wishes , censoring media that includes information critical of any aspect of the vaccine industry , and revoking the license of any physician whose practice or opinions vary in anyway from those currently promoted by the vaccine industry . A panel will include : Art Caplan , Director of Bioethics -LRB- sic -RRB- at the NYU Langone Medical Center , Bernard Dreyer , President of the American Academy of Pediatrics , a trade association which recently adopted a policy opposed to all exemptions to vaccine mandates for religious or issues of conscience . Adam Ratner , an associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics at NYU Langone Medical Center . David Oshinsky , a historian and Director of the Division of Medical Humanities at NYU Langone . The event is underwritten by William Berkley , NYU Trustee , NYU Langone Medical Center , and Chair of the NYU Board of Trustees . Stay tuned for news as events are organized . Please plan on attending . Spread the word , bring friends and family . The vaccine industry is determined to win control over your body , and the bodies of your children . Only you can stop them . Forrest Maready strikes again . That ABC did n't coverage this particular PROTEST . . after days of reporting on an NYU plan to allow students to live in apartments occupied by senior ... is telling . Might still be going . Dr. Humphries attended the meeting at NYU , and is reporting back . Unbelievable stuff said by the presenters , and I mean that in both the figurative and literal senses . Who would you want to consult for medical decisions regarding your child ... Dr. She has only put up three short comments in the last week . I think the physician commenter Mike Stevens was hired three years ago to replace her : he gradually commented more and more , while she commented less and less . I think her primary purpose now is to write papers and proposed legislation and give talks . He could have gotten some more footage for his Pan Ran series . Offit just sued up their position in on thirty second clip . Thank you , Josh , for providing proof of what we here on AoA know ... that Offit is a deplorable person who is incapable of defending his evil nonsense . When he was challenged by Mary Holland - with questions he certainly could not answer - he suddenly slipped into the background and the great new vaccine mouth , Dorit Reiss , was unveiled . Caplan needed to address the ethics - he was supposed to be an ethicist - while Reiss was not even a bar registered attorney , and was accountable to no one for her incompetent , lazy and outrageous performance . All one can say is that these people are the surrogates of an industry which never has to answer , has no liability , and has been massively protected by a bought-out , intimidated mainstream media . Art Caplan never told the young man or his family of his own conflict of interest , that he was working with the head researcher , Dr. James Wilson . They are safety studies . They are not therapeutic in goal . Your comment has not yet been posted . Your comment could not be posted . Error type : Your comment has been saved .
