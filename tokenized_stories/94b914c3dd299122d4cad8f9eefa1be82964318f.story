First let me say that the next few blogs will be about Standing Rock and the brutality going on there . I am passionate about supporting them and using my blog since my posts seem to be hidden on Facebook . My Facebook is Dani Deb Oliver and I hope people will go and look and see if they see the posts on Standing Rock as that is all I have been posting for a good while now with all the info . I used to get responses from people I did not know as I am posting it all public but now I see nothing even when I ask people to like to let me know they got the info . I have no claim to any of the links or videos made . I am just sharing them for public information . This is what it looks like in Standing Rock . I thought at first this was a picture from Iraq . I have spent all day getting all the links ready to share with you all . I am just appalled at what has gone on . And now I learn that a mercenary group has been pulled in to fight the Indigenous people . And our government does nothing.The Army Corps has just notified the leaders of the Indigenous people that they are closing the area off and it will no longer be public and moving them back inland . So , in other words they will not be near the water and the pipeline company can go ahead and drill . Here is the map . Click on the link to see it . Dapl moves pipeline south to avoid white populations . The Indigenous Peoples are always being taken advantage of . The so called Law enforcement has called them the scum of the earth . It has been a long day so I am going to put some more video links on here so you can see the truth of what has been happening . Please stand by Standing Rock . Cheers and onward with spirit , courage , and hope . I am hoping for better things this year . I am going to start blogging again but I think a little differently . Am doing some better . Still waiting on the neurosurgeon . account . Notify me of new posts via email . And now I can add author to that list for my first book has been published and is on Amazon for sale now . my blog . If you want all fou fou and fluffy sweet . . it is not here . We are either survivors or we are victims . I am a survivor . Survivors focus on the solutions and ways to have a better life while victims are still talking about all the problems . I will not lie and tell you life is all roses because it is not . Some days I can not move and lay on this bed in agony and some days I am able to sit in my power chair for a little while . Just remember it is how you think that determines what life is like . I will be 67 this May of 2016 . Life has been a journey of health issues since before I was 31 . I have a warrior attitude . Being a warrior does not mean you always win . I am blessed in that my oldest son is my caretaker and a great one at that . He has given up much to take care of me . He is an awesome caretaker and is always looking for ways to make life easier for me . I truly am thankful for his care . My name is not chronic illness or disability . I hope you see me and my spirit . Our baby Daisy . And Daisy is such a joy and makes us smile and laugh . Son and Daisy My one room world from my hospital bed-it is filled with warmth and love from so many . Necessity is the mother of invention . My room looks into the kitchen where I can see son puttering around cooking as he is master of the kitchen now . Ever since I was a little girl , I was told I was a dreamer . I think dreams are what keep us going . Follow Your Dreams , The Siren Called Out To Me As I closed my eyes and fell deep into lovely sleep . I remember Laverne on Laverne and Shirley saying her dream was to have a purple cashmere sweater . Well , our dream is to own land in the country and have a simple life style unencumbered by so much of what is in the world today . We have accomplished that dream in that we live on the outskirts of small town America in a much smaller and compact house but it has all we need : a cottage that visitors say they love because it is so serene here . And hopefully will continue to write for many more years . This blog is about our journey getting here , our life after we reached the promised land and different middle of the night ramblings , posts to inspire others to keep fighting and keep living . And even plain ole everyday people get dreams that come true . Email check failed , please try again Sorry , your blog can not share posts by email . but there was an error posting your comment .
