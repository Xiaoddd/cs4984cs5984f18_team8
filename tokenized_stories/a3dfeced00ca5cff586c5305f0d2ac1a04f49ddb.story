In the spirit of our loved ones , we dedicate this sacred journey to join our relatives in Standing Rock and stand in unity to protect our sacred medicine water . We carry the message of Indigenous knowledge from our ancestors that clearly states , WATER IS LIFE . As the 7th generation Indigenous Youth , we claim our inherent Indigenous responsibility given to us by our Creator as , KEEPERS OF THE EARTH . A call out to our Indigenous OKIHTCITAWAK : Worthy Young Warriors -LRB- Water Protectors -RRB- . We invite our brothers and sisters in the northern isolated First Nations reserves , that have gone through the same experience in the tragic death of our loved ones through youth suicides or other senseless death through alcohol because of the culture of poverty that we exist in . Our only weapon will be our prayers and our songs . However , that does not mean we will needlessly risk our lives as we have the highest respect for grandfather Winter . Each community representative should have their own vehicle with family support . Again depending on our funding raising efforts on GOFUNDME , these funds raised will be dedicated to the safety , food , shelter or any emergency situations that the challenges the youth may be confronted with in their healing journey . Funds raised will go towards the safety of the youth caravan in terms of food , shelter , transportation including emergency medical , judicial , and other unforeseen financial circumstances in the convoy of the youth caravan to Standing Rock , and to ensure their safe return home .
