Roll it . Just saying . This is clearly seen and expected by any individual knowledgeable in the financial system . DAPL was either at the right place at the right time or wrong place at the right time . The unity of opposition to blatant corporate greed was exposed as never before throughout the world by over 300 distinct tribal governmental entities and visibly supported by 8,000-10,000 on-sight supporters from across America and other countries , alternative media reporters , celebrities and letters of support from foreign governments , city councils , unions , teachers , anthropologists and all other professionals clamoring for the same goal . Tribal nation flags bordered the roadway into the encampment , the long colorful line resembled the entrance to the United Nations building in New York . Tribal groups from various parts of the countries traveled long distances to make their commitment to this casue via their sacred rituals , songs , dances and awesome distinct tribal paraphernalia displayed .

This totem carried a unifying spirit into the encampment . Patricia Smith Olmstead 2 years ago Weeping , now , and forever . Lakota pi ki cante tinzapi . Obama and Clinton never intended to block this development .

But nobody listened to what Hitler was saying in 1933 , everyone wanted to appease him , never believing he was as rotten to the core as he was . One thing that we know for sure : Trump is invested in the pipeline , and his other policy proposals are going to make life a living hell for a whole lot of people , and the entire planet . We are all in trouble now , for at least the next 4 years , and his actions will take years after that to undo . Your reply about Hitler applies to the last 8 years of Obama . It is great that you already know the future . Help support Native News Online by clicking on our sponsors ' advertisements .
