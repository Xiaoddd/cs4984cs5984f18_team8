Since the project was first proposed in 2014 , community activists , indigenous leaders , and environmentalists have called it a boondoggle that would threaten the fragile ecosystems , endangered species , and tribal lands in its path . Today , they are celebrating after North Carolina announced it was requesting more information about the water impacts of the project . The Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions -LRB- FERC -RRB- is responsible for making sure there is an environmental impact statement -LRB- EIS -RRB- for projects like the Atlantic Coast Pipeline . DEQ held a public comment period on whether to permit the 401 certification . Ryan Emanuel , an associate professor in the Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources at North Carolina State University and a member of the Lumbee Tribe , was among the thousands of people who responded . However , in a letter published in Science , Emanuel identified flaws in the method used to arrive at that conclusion . Over 30,000 tribal members would be affected . While Chavis would have preferred that the DEQ deny the 401 certification outright , she was relieved that it was requiring more answers from pipeline stakeholders .
