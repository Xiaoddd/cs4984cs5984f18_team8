TOM STROMME , TRIBUNE Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save North Dakotans came together Saturday at a Native American cultural event to start rebuilding relationships strained by the Dakota Access Pipeline protests . Reconciliation was the theme of a discussion featuring leaders from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , an official from Morton County , a landowner on the pipeline route and representatives of the Bismarck business community . Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II said the pipeline controversy exposed racism that previously had been under the surface . But the pipeline demonstration that brought together tribal nations from around the world also had positive consequences , tribal leaders said . The event , hosted by the Native American Development Center , was a daylong experience with North Dakota tribal nations , focused on education and building understanding . Gov. Doug Burgum attended the event and recently visited each of the four tribal nations that have headquarters in the state , including a meeting Friday at the Spirit Lake Nation . Morton County landowner Doug Healy spoke about his experience with the pipeline crossing his land and being affected by the protest . Although the events led to some bitter feelings , Healy said he thinks landowners want to move on . Archambault said this might be a pivotal point in history for tribal nations . Rissa Williams , a member of the Bismarck Human Relations Committee who attended the event , said Caucasians should take an active role in building relationships with Native Americans . Chaska Moore , a senior at Standing Rock High School , said he hopes someday people learn to see past race . This can be removed when origin is fixed . Trigger the set to pull in again .
