Energy and Environment Army Corps ruling is a big win for foes of Dakota Access Pipeline By Brady Dennis and Brady Dennis Reporter focusing on environmental policy and public health issues Email Bio Follow Steven Mufson Steven Mufson Reporter covering energy and other financial matters Email Bio Follow December 5 , 2016 Protesters celebrate after an announcement Sunday that the Army would not grant an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline to be built under Lake Oahe in North Dakota . Officials in November had delayed the key decision , saying more discussion was necessary about the proposed crossing , given that it would pass very near the reservation of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , whose leaders have repeatedly expressed fears that a spill could threaten the water supplies of its people . Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch , worried about violence , had sent mediators to the area over the weekend . The victory for the Standing Rock Sioux and its allies could be short-lived , though . President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to support pipelines such as this one . The Army announced on Dec. 4 that it will not grant an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline . Protesters and environmental groups celebrated the news . Hundreds of veterans arrived in recent days . A procession of tribe members and activists marched along the main dirt road at the Oceti Sakowin encampment set up by protesters . Activists acknowledged that it was only one step forward in a larger fight over Native American rights . Denise McKay , a member of the Standing Rock Sioux standing by the sacred fire Sunday afternoon , said she expects Energy Transfer Partners to push back on the decision . Nearby , Bruce Gali took drags from a cigarette and watched the festivities . He made his second trip to the camp last week and said he would keep returning from his home in northeastern California until authorities left the area and the pipeline was shut down . The steel pipeline , developed and majority owned by Energy Transfer Partners , would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal and pipeline terminus in Illinois . At 30 inches in diameter , it could transport an estimated 470,000 to 570,000 barrels of oil per day . The company says the project , which traverses four states , is 92 percent complete overall and 99 percent complete in North Dakota . Army officials said that the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an environmental-impact statement with full public input and analysis , a process likely to take many months . Ordinarily , the Army Corps , which has jurisdiction over domestic petroleum pipelines , does not require a detailed environmental-impact statement but it does require environmental assessments of the impact on water crossings . The company said it remained committed to the project and would complete construction without rerouting the pipeline . The company also said that it had complied with Army Corps requirements , including an environmental assessment rather than an environmental impact statement . He said it would prolong a dangerous situation by having protesters camping out on federal land during the brutally cold winter . During a call with reporters Monday , Jason Miller , a spokesman for President-elect Donald Trump , was asked whether the incoming administration would seek to reverse the decision .
