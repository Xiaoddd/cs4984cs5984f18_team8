CANNON BALL , North Dakota -- Hundreds of water protectors were injured at the Standing Rock encampments when law enforcement blasted them with water cannons in freezing temperatures Sunday evening . The attacks came as water protectors used a semi-truck to remove burnt military vehicles that police had chained to concrete barriers weeks ago , blocking traffic on Highway 1806 . Some flares shot by law enforcement started grass fires which were ignored by the water cannons and had to be extinguished by water protectors . Law enforcement also shot down three media drones and targeted journalists with less lethal rounds . National Lawyers Guild legal observers on the frontlines have confirmed that multiple people were unconscious and bleeding after being shot in the head with rubber bullets . One elder went into cardiac arrest at the frontlines but medics administered CPR and were able to resuscitate him . The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe also sent Emergency Medical Service vehicles to the Oceti Sakowin Camp to assist . Hundreds are receiving treatment for contamination by CS gas , hypothermia , and blunt traumas as a result of rubber bullets and other less lethal ammunition . Despite the obvious public safety risk , and despite promises from Morton County that they would clear the road , law enforcement has insisted on keeping the vehicles on the bridge for weeks . This obstruction of Highway 1806 threatens the lives of the water protectors and residents of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation , as emergency services have been needed but unable to reach camp quickly . The blockage also unjustly restricts the free movement of local residents and hurts the Tribe economically by cutting off travel to and from the Prairie Knights Casino . Images of the burned vehicles have fed negative , distorted , and sensationalist media portrayals of the encampment . Stop the Dakota Access pipeline . We are asking for clean water , we are asking for the right to live , we are asking for our children to live . Instead they attack us , because they protect oil . Tribal EMS are stepping up and providing services that should be the responsibility of Morton County , this is ridiculous . Because of the police enforced road block , ambulances now have an extra 30 minutes to get to the hospital . Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest 55 comments : Lisa Savage said ... Weaponizing water to be used in attacking water protectors marks a new low in the history of corporate wars against the continuation of life on our planet . If law enforcement had done this to animals , they would have been charged with animal cruelty and put in jail . November 21 , 2016 at 6:25 AM James Nason said ...

I know violence is what the corporate and state fascists want . Even still , use of water in that weather is clearly attempted murder . Use of lethal force in return by the protectors would have been justified . Police have no special rights . The only real crime involves a victim , or property damage , all else is fraud to call a crime , such as a parking ticket . The courts are criminals commuting fraud and they know it . The police are the criminals now , as they create victims of violence and property damage . November 21 , 2016 at 8:41 AM Pam lane said ... I 'm from England and am horrified by the violence shown by law enforcement officers to the peaceful water protectors at Standing Rock . November 21 , 2016 at 9:33 AM Challis Coulston said ... I do n't understand why you are having to fight alone . The Missouri is a huge river that provides water and irrigation of agricultural and ranch land for many thousands of people and even more heads of livestock . Pollution of the environment and a valuable water source will affect people regardless of their race . No mention of the pipeline was heard until the water protectors blocked it , and very little since , because the government and corporations want to keep it quiet as they continue this outrage against humanity . We need new government badly . Human biengs that dwell on this earth . We were here first willing to share this earth . But we were slaughtered and bribed . Now this is where we stand . Still fighting for what we believe in ... our land and it 's elements . The government has been trying to rid of us since day one . This is our land . We will do what is right for it .

Yes , that 's the answer . Let 's just turn off any rationale that is the best in humanity , lock and load and get down to the business of killing each other . To hell with the collateral aspect measured in Human lives , as blood spilled on sacred grounds . There has to be a higher road for history teaches us each time we take the lower road it ends in disaster . Problem solving that resorts to violence is born in the branches of hatred , growing from the tree of fear , rooted in ignorance . But it was n't below freezing then . November 21 , 2016 at 7:42 PM birdpond said ... There are groups and individuals fighting them but , just like here , they are getting little if any press . These pipelines are pushed through in secret so as to avoid the publicity that would stand in the way of their greedy activities . Our precious country is being sacrificed to the Gods of Oil and Money , and the Hell with the people , the planet or life itself . What a sad , sorry , sordid state of affairs for this nation . Please know , I stand with you in my heart and soul , and send my love , appreciation and support . I should be standing with you physically as well and am ashamed and sorry that I am on the other side of the country . But I am sharing your story , trying my best to show the world your brave fight , and working every day to gather more support for you . Thank you , hero water warrior heroes . You are on the right side of history .

Your president will not do a thing to stop this . He is doing the very same thing in Syria and Libya and Iraq . He supports and funds the terrorist to harm the land and kill anyone that gets in the way . He wants that pipeline thru both Syria and Dapl . Its oil , it greed , it 's Disgraceful . These PeacevOfficers , I use the term as it is intended to be . A joke , a slap to the face to wake the fuck up America but you ate the she disgusting misguided racist pieces of filth that elected Donald MotherFuckinPieceOfCapitalistCombedOverShit as your President . Then Again Obama just sits by and watches this go on while enjoy Sunday Football . These people are Peacefully Praying that this Oil Corporation does n't own through their relatives graves and poison their land and water YES Their OWN land . I left last night after my car threw a piston rod after somehow it was drained of all oil . I have personally seen grinds hurt from tear gas pepper spray rubber bullets and now the set fires to the campground on one end while blasting these water cannons in subfreezing temp from the other direction . I have had no contact today with my friends whose camp would of been right where those fires were started . I have no idea if anything I help build us still standing . I pray my friends are okay but I sense that some are not at all . These cowards waited til after dark on s Sunday night to declare war . They fired at medics and the medic tents . Yet Obama the Governor of ND allows and encourages it to go on . They want their kickbacks from the oil giants who fund them . So this is the beginning of the end . This is war . That fine with me kill me out me in jail I 'm going back to Pittsburgh to restrategize s way to end this . If you sit idly by and wait for you corrupt politicians to do this it will never end . I hate it all so much . I am sick I was in Bismark last night when this was going on . If I had been there I 'm sure I would be dead by now . The peaceful protests make the camp sitting ducks all lived up to be shot gassed beaten abused and arrested . This is sick . These cops are sick test water cannon guy I would if driven my car at him and plowed him straight to hell with my car had it been running and I was there . My ticket to go home was purchased by my friend Saturday morning . I am 100 percent sure she saved my life . Stop this madness this assault on all that is right any way you can . I call in rogue warriors to join me and help me send these Nazi cocksuckers to their grave . Ill give all I have every ounce of energy down to my final breath . THIS HAS TO STOP NOW . I laugh at you Obama , you neutered impotent lap dog to the oil companies . You sick you powerless fool . FO something you spineless gutless coward . Do Something you chicken shit loser . Happy Thanksgiving . Yeah Right . This country makes me sick . I 'm out if here as soon as this comes to its conclusion . I pray for you Americans because you are so evil . This country is about to explode from within . Last warning . Kevin Morgan Pittsburgh Water Protector til the End . . Which looks like it more every day . I will be back STANDing with STANDing Rock .

I do n't understand how they can justify doing this to people protecting the water that countless people use but not even come close to the people protesting an election because their person did n't win . They are destroying property and hurting people . Apparently it 's okay to protest for that but not for the protection of a basic need . For the record I was worried about either person becoming president . But I pray for our country and our new leaders to make the right decisions . God be with everyone involved with the fight up there . I do n't really believe these officers wanted to do what hey did . But unfortunately sometimes as with our troops they are forced to follow orders no matter if they agree or not . God Bless you all . November 22 , 2016 at 5:36 PM Anonymous said ...

I share with you - with some reservation and fear - the truth of what is happening at Standing Rock . I 've spent weeks talking with the people at the front . I say to you now human rights violations are occurring . I say to you now unequivocally it is . People are being shot in the face and groin with rubber bullets . Even though the bloody photo is in your face . Yes . Peaceable protesters are being blasted in the face with water cannons in 20 degree weather . Yes . You hear rumors of lrad and chemical spray and you say to yourself that ca n't be happening not in my America . Yes it is . Yes . just ask Sophie Whitaker who was hit with a grenade in the arm and might likely lose it . this non-lethal grenade was taped so that it would have greater impact upon the body so that it would do devastating damage . I say to you to wash that apathy from your face just as the water protectors wash the mace and blood from their face . Take action as you sit on your warm couch and write an email to your congressman and demand that they get involved . add Sacred Stone Camp to your Christmas list and send winter supplies to those that are suffering on the ground .
