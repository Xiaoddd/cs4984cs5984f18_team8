It could be by accident . It could be part of a plan to establish his independent credentials . Or it could simply be an early attempt at framing Republican policies in terms palatable to his working-class supporters . Whatever the reason , Mr Trump has staked out positions that are not exactly in harmony with Republican orthodoxy or the policy direction in which the Republican-led Congress seems to be heading . Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan may not see eye-to-eye on universal healthcare coverage . The yet-to-be announced plan congressional Republicans are currently formulating is more likely to be a blend of the measures floated by various conservatives in the past . For instance Congressman Tom Price , Mr Trump 's nominee to be health and human services secretary , suggested a system that leaned heavily on tax credits and an expansion of existing health-savings accounts , where individuals could put aside untaxed money to pay for future medical needs . Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has proposed the creation of federally funded high-risk insurance pools that would enrol individuals who could n't get insurances elsewhere because of pre-existing medical conditions or other complicating factors . None of these would come close to approaching universal coverage or even Mr Obama 's uninsured mark over the past few years , however . As if that were n't enough , Mr Trump also advocated using the buying power of the federal Medicare prescription-drug programme for the elderly to drive down the cost of pharmaceuticals . While this has long been a goal of Democrats , conservatives have opposed the idea for more than a decade . It 's enough to make rank-and-file Republicans reach for their antacids . Looming over this entire discussion is a Congressional Budget Office report released on Tuesday that predicts a straight-up repeal of Obamacare without any kind of a replacement would result in a doubling of premiums in the individual insurance market by 2026 , at which point a total of 32 million Americans would have lost their coverage . Mr Trump , in his comments this weekend , has essentially laid down a marker that repeal will be quickly followed by a replacement that will do a better job advancing Democratic goals of lower drug prices and more universal coverage than the Democrats ' own best attempt . It is , to put it bluntly , a high bar to reach . A simple tax plan If reshaping the US healthcare system turns out to be a challenge , at least tax reform was considered a low-hanging fruit for Mr Trump and his party . Even here , however , the president-elect has made comments that undermine Republican efforts to achieve legislative consensus . This would allow the US to give preference to businesses based in the US - one of Mr Trump 's key goals during the campaign . Mr Trump appears to support a more direct border tariff , not the more complicated congressional work-around . The problem this presents for both the president-elect and congressional leaders is it runs directly against his party 's long-standing free-trade positions - principles many in Congress have campaigned , and won , on for years . They might be able to dance around the issue with border adjustments and corporate tax reform , but Mr Trump seems more like a bull than a ballerina . ` Congress ca n't get cold feet ' It 's possible to imagine that Mr Trump 's recent comments were just , to put it delicately , rhetorical missteps and that he , in fact , is actually on the same wavelength as his Republican colleagues in Congress . Then again , when pressed by the Washington Post on how he could get his healthcare priorities advanced despite an apparent conflict with current Republican plans , Mr Trump dug in his heels . I wo n't tell you how , but we will get approval . That was an apparent reference to Mr Trump 's Twitter-based effort to force House Republicans to back away from a plan to weaken an independent congressional ethics investigation office several weeks ago . And if it 's this way on tax law and healthcare reform - areas where Republicans and Mr Trump have a fair amount of ideological common ground - imagine what might happen when the president tries to advance his more controversial ideas on immigration or trade . Candidate Trump was a political wild-card , willing to buck conventional wisdom and his own party seemingly on whim . Early indications are President Trump could do more of the same .
