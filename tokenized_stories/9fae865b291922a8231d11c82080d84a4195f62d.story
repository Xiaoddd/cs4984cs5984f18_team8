Shively was taking the unusual step of opposing Assistant Morton County State 's Attorney Brian Grosinger 's motion to dismiss the case against her client , Mary Redway . She wanted to go to trial on Friday . Twenty-one hours before Redway 's trial , Grosinger moved to dismiss . Judge Allan Schmalenberger granted it . Redway 's case closely resembles dozens of other cases from Oct. 22 that have been dismissed in recent weeks , often shortly before trial . Grosinger then re-charges the protester with a more serious offense and issues an arrest warrant . Redway , who traveled to Bismarck this week from Rhode Island to stand trial , now faces three new charges , which were filed with an arrest warrant on May 24 . Shively said Grosinger never alerted her to the new case . Rather , he issued an arrest warrant , which she found by searching the court records . Grosinger did not respond to a phone and email request for comment on Thursday or Friday . On Oct. 22 , several people locked themselves to Dakota Access Pipeline equipment in Morton County . In solidarity , a group of more than 200 people marched towards the site across private property . Police allege the protesters ripped survey stakes from the ground and yelled at law enforcement when they were told to leave . A total of 126 protesters were arrested and charged with criminal trespass and engaging in a riot , when police surrounded the group . Police have characterized the incident as a riot , but Redway said people thought of it more as a prayer walk or even a picnic , and some brought their dogs along . She said police used mace and batons , causing panic within the group . Many people from out-of-state have taken guilty pleas . The state has offered deals , which include no jail time and forfeiture of bond . Recently , they have also offered pretrial diversions , according to Shively . The six-person jury found Dakota Luke , 27 , guilty of criminal trespass and engaging in a riot and co-defendant Emmalyne Garrett , 33 , was just found guilty of criminal trespass . Jury members made up their minds in less than 20 minutes , according to Harris , who is Luke 's attorney . Harris said the state argued that walking together in the group constituted participating in a riot . Both are re-charged with three new misdemeanor crimes from the same date .
