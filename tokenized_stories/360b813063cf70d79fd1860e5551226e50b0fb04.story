BRONTE WITTPENN , Gazette Staff Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Cory Bryson , 32 , has known about the Dakota Access Pipeline since 2013 . He attended public hearings in 2014 , when he spoke with landowners , residents , legal staff and representatives of Energy Transfer Partners , the parent company building the pipeline . Bryson has worked on projects of this size before . To Bryson , this was just another ordinary project . Three years later , Bryson told a different story . Bryson knows the pipeline industry , he 's worked in it since he was 23 , and his father was a pipeliner for 32 years . Born and raised in Mandan , N.D. Bryson continues to live there with his wife and three kids . He represents workers across all industries and labor unions . He enforces contracts and looks out for the safety of workers . The pipeline stretches through about 375 miles of farmland starting in Stanley , N.D. , to outside the northern border of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . He makes sure they are treated fairly and that work is carried out properly . Together both men represent 750 laborers from Minnesota and North Dakota working on the pipeline . Bryson said he remembers the first protest . It was in early July . About 200 people gathered on Highway 1806 . Local police showed up , not in riot gear . There was no aggression , he said , but police were mingled with protesters . Some even shook hands . And workers were thrown into the middle of it . The amount of money lost for workers due to halting parts of pipeline construction is well into six digits , he said . For some , workweeks went from 85 hours to as few as 24 . Some people have left the project , and part of Dekrey 's job has been trying to get people to stay . BRONTE WITTPENN , Gazette staff A lot of the violence is coming from people who are from out of state bringing their own agendas , Bryson said . Too many groups are involved , he said . However , the people who live in Standing Rock have to stay , and the two communities will have to fix their relationship . Drill pads are built and secured . This step is by far the most contentious between the two sides .
