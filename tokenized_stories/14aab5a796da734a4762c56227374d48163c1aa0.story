PAUL , Minn. -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A Minnesota regulator on Thursday approved a certificate of need for Enbridge Inc to rebuild its Line 3 oil pipeline , angering environmentalists but offering hope to Western Canadian oil producers that have struggled to move crude oil to refiners . An activist opposing the Enbridge Line 3 oil pipeline , dangles from a steel structure erected outside the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission office in St. Paul , Minnesota , U.S. , June 28 , 2018 . Shares of Calgary , Alberta-based Enbridge closed up 3.7 percent in Toronto . Pipeline bottlenecks have steepened a price discount for Western Canadian heavy crude this year . Refiners in Minnesota and surrounding states say Line 3 is necessary to increase crude supplies . Shouts from Native Americans and environmental activists interrupted the meeting . Environmental groups and some indigenous communities oppose the project over concerns about spills and impact on tribal wild rice harvesting areas . The Standing Rock tribe led opposition in 2016 to the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota , one of the most bitterly contested energy projects in years . It was eventually built . The coalition of Line 3 opponents is likely to formally request that the commission reconsider its approval , said Joe Plumer , lawyer for White Earth Nation . He said he continues to expect the rebuilt pipeline to begin service in the second half of 2019 . Line 3 , which began service in 1968 , operates at half its capacity . Its replacement would allow it to return to approved capacity of 760,000 barrels per day . Several commissioners voiced doubts that demand for crude oil and refined products such as gasoline would grow enough to warrant the pipeline . The rebuilt Line 3 will follow the existing pipeline path partway through Minnesota , before veering south to bypass Leech Lake reserve and avoid a need to shut down the pipeline for up to one year during construction . The path of a short stretch near Fond du Lac reserve will be determined by negotiations between the tribe and Enbridge . Fond du Lac lawyer Seth Bichler told the commission that the tribes preferred a longer route to the south that would avoid more sensitive land . Recognized parties , including Enbridge , environmental and indigenous groups , have 20 days from the time a written order is issued - likely in a couple of weeks - to ask the commission to reconsider . Line 3 also requires 29 additional permits from local , state and federal levels , Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton said in a statement .
