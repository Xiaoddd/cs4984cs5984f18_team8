If there was any single event that would cause the Republican elite to openly revolt against the ongoing Trumpification of their party , it would be the nomination of Roy Moore for U.S. Senate in Alabama . Even prior to the allegations of child molestation , Moore had discovered innovative new realms of extremism that had never occurred to even his most ideologically fervent colleagues . He proposed banning Muslims from serving in elected office , called for the criminalization of homosexuality , and defied court rulings and declared his own biblical jurisprudence the sole valid legal authority . And if that revolt was going to begin anywhere , it would likely be in Utah . But even in Utah , there were forces at work to make Hatch reconsider . He was facing a potential primary challenge from a Trumpian candidate who had met with party insurrectionist Steve Bannon and Citizens United president David Bossie . Trump rewarded Hatch by endorsing him . As recently as a few weeks ago , Republicans were debating whether to shun Moore or , should he win , vote to expel him from the Senate . They have settled on a course of action that had initially been off the map altogether : endorsing their lecherous ayatollah and providing financial support from the Republican National Committee . What mattered most was that Donald Trump has contempt for any standards of conduct . And no Republican who wishes to stay in office can afford to offend the president , who commands overwhelming support among the party base . Reince Priebus urged him to quit ; Mike Pence reportedly offered his services to the RNC as a substitute . Then the incomprehensible became inevitable . The same thing happened in May when a Republican House candidate , Greg Gianforte , assaulted a reporter and then lied about it . It turned out they would do nothing . The next step in the sequence is almost insultingly obvious . His alleged crime is a series of text messages criticizing Trump . The notion that a law-enforcement official should be disqualified for privately expressing partisan views is a novel one , and certainly did not trouble Republicans last year , when Rudy Giuliani was boasting on television about his network of friendly agents . Yet in the conservative media , Mueller and Comey have assumed fiendish personae of almost Clintonian proportions . When Mueller was appointed , legal scholars debated whether Trump had the technical authority to fire him , but even the majority who believed he did assumed such a power existed only in theory . Republicans in Congress , everyone believed , would never sit still for such a blatant cover-up . In August , members of both parties began drawing up legislation to prevent Trump from sacking Mueller . By early autumn , the momentum behind the effort had slowed ; by Thanksgiving , Republican interest had melted away . In fact , the risk has swelled . Trump has publicly declared any investigation into his finances would constitute a red line , and that he reserves the option to fire Mueller if he investigates them . Earlier this month , it was reported that Mueller has subpoenaed records at Deutsche Bank , an institution favored both by Trump and the Russian spy network . It is almost a maxim of the Trump era that the bounds of the unthinkable continuously shrink . The capitulation to Moore was a dry run for the coming assault on the rule of law .
