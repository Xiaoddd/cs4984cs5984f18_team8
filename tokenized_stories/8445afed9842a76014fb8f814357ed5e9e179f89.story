A man in fatigues and gun drawn gave us directions to turn around to and take highway 6 to 24 to get to the casino where we were staying ; an hour and a half detour . We counted at least 45 Sheriff vehicles that sped past us on the pitch black two lane road . Show Full Text Due to our delayed arrival , the casino gave away our room . The wait list was 45 people deep . A friend had told us that the rooms were being bought up by the company that owns the NDPL . When we arrived at the camp , we found out the blockade we had encountered the day before was literally a few hundred feet from the camp . When people ask me if it was what I had expected , I tell them I was not surprised by the militarized police or the helicopters and planes circling the camp . What had surprised me was the sheer scope of the thing . There are easily over thousand people there cycling in and out . More before it got cold . A man on a P.A. calls out constant announcements . The medical bay has a chiropractor , herbalist , midwife , acupuncturist , therapist , and chemical weapons decom . The media tent sits on top of the only hill that gets cell phone reception , next to that is the legal tent . There are daily trainings on codes of conduct , and what will be happening that day in camp . Down the road from that a coat share where you can get winter clothes . I was never asked for anything . The north hills are scorched black . A fire was set just right so it would catch the wind and spread . Flood lights just to the right of that . Men on top of hills just outside of camp . There are groups of men that act as security for the camp , others that ride horses and patrol the area . I walked pass them breaking a horse in camp . I noticed one of the security guys was wearing a camera tucked in his vest . I got back to the hotel room , and put on the local news . The next day we followed an action into Bismarck . The helicopter and plane followed the convoy the whole way there . We drove very carefully not to give the police any excuse to pull us over . There was a line of police in riot gear in front of the Wells Fargo bank . The march was up the street . They were preemptively protecting the bank . A young man was singled out and arrested . They put a bag over his head , an officer on scene said it was a spit guard . The protest moved to the federal building . The anti protesters followed . The demonstration ended . I witnessed no protestor disobeying the law . The next morning the temperature dropped . The scramble to winterize expedited . More tee-pees and permanent structures were going up all over camp . There was a march toward the blockade . Many people dressed in red and sat in formation to spell out her name on the river bank . There was some stirring across the bridge . An officer with an MRAD and a riot patrol truck came and left . Two days later there was massive violence against the protesters . At camp , I heard a story about a young man who was building stone stoves to heat the structures there . His response was , he was the only person that knew how to install them and that if they wanted to last the winter , he needed to be there .
