Unfortunately , in recent weeks there have been rumors that the Standing Rock Sioux has entered into a secret deal with the owners of the pipeline . The statement seeks dispel those false rumors . Here is the complete statement released today : Dear Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Members and Allies : We would like to take this opportunity as a council to address our community and assess where we are in our efforts to defeat this pipeline . We assure you that the council is fully aware and united in our efforts to do what is right for our people . We stand by our leadership as we begin the difficult task of developing new relationships with the incoming administration , with the goal of sharing our perspective . The concerns that are obvious to us are foreign to many , and we must try and educate and explain in the hopes that they understand , or at the very least grant us the benefit of the doubt . We will not win any arguments if we go in completely oppositional to this administration . Our only path forward to protecting our water is to spread awareness and be heard . We are not giving into the proposed route and never will . But we are using every social and political tool in our power to help those who may oppose us to work with us and not against us . As soon it is announced , we will work to have scoping sessions as soon as possible to determine the area that will be examined . Please be assured that we continue to stand united against the completion of the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline .
