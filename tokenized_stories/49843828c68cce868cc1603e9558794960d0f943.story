We love coffee . We also love our water and lakes in the world , and find that we are in a pitched battle over a set of Koch Bros. and Enbridge pipelines intended to head across the heart of our ricing territory to Lake Superior -LRB- Gichi Gummi -RRB- . We join with others around the world opposing extreme fossil fuels and these pipelines . Winona LaDuke , founder of Spotted Horse - Rez Roasted Coffee blends Company . Profit Proceeds go toward our initiatives to protect sacred lands , stop extreme fossil fuel extraction at the source by supporting frontline Native communities , and to cultural revitalization initiatives . Beans are specially selected and blended from El Salvador , Chiapas and Costa Rican . Beans are farmed and produced by women . We have always been water protectors . Once you could drink all of the water here , but the folly of the Wiindigo Economy has changed that . We continue to protect our water - from mining , logging and nowthe Enbridge pipelines and proposed mines . Over the past four years we have joined with other Indigenous allies and local citizens to oppose the extreme mining extractions in our region and the extreme pipeline proposals - whether Enbridge , with new lines proposed for our wild rice territory , or Trans Canada and the Keystone Pipeline ; we continue our resistance . Shipping out in December 2017 in time for the Holiday gifting season . We featured beans from Indigenous communities around the world and we feature fair trade and organic coffees . The result is a truly distinct line of rich and diversely flavored coffees , small batch roasted , balanced and full bodied . We roast in the midst of our trees and lakes , and we do it because we love good coffee , and did not want to travel a hundred miles for a good roaster . We are also one of few Native American roasters on the continent , meaning that this coffee comes from Indigenous communities , and is roasted and packaged by our own people here , all of us intending to create exceptional offerings and sustainable economies for our people . We are able to provide varietal roasts , but specialize in blends , which reflect our community and history . These are our initial offerings , and in that , provide an amazing coffee , and an opportunity to learn about our people , history and work to defend our land through the generations . sold out Water Protector Coffee Cup - Love Water Not Oil 15.00 Honor our Water Protectors .
