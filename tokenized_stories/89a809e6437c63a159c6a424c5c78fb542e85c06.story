Sadly , however , apathy has seemed overwhelmingly abundant in our First-World-problem-afflicted iPhone realities . The disheartened impressions I previously had of students and America turned 180 degrees after seeing people flock to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and North Dakota . For most of my life , as I am in my fourth decade of existence -LRB- 41 yrs . I have experienced racism because people see my dark skin complexion before my Irish side , or elite college experience , or PhD . Regrettably , the world is replete with experiences we can not witness firsthand with our senses . But we can begin to structurally analyze the systemic issues that shape our planet . We now exist in a capitalist world that allows entities called corporations to push commodities upon the people for the sake of profit for the few , much like the days of feudalism when the wealthy elite were kings , queens , and aristocrats living in castles , while the poor were relegated to throwing their poop onto the streets . The common people get pushed and pulled into wars and battles mystified by ideologies and narratives that keep people divided or apathetic . Standing Rock , as a pivotal moment , epitomizes the struggle and opens the door for a truer historical understanding , one that recognizes that America was built off of slavery and indigenous land dispossession . As you can see in this essay , I do not intend to zero in on a more particular narrative involving the struggles of the Standing Rock Sioux against the corporate interests of the entity known as DAPL . Instead , I implore those of you reading this short composition to examine the issue , to see the coverage , or lack thereof , of this issue in the mainstream media . If you know little of these topics , question why this is the case . In answering these questions , your journey should yield more questions , leading you down a path that avoids apathy . I attended Andover High School and graduated in the class of 1993 . This was much like the other mascot issues that confront American Indians , such as the Washington Redskins . It was a tremendous learning experience , one that afforded me an understanding of how to maneuver and operate in a contentious , hostile , and demoralizing political climate . The act of engaging in civil debate and political action is incredibly important . Nothing could be more satisfying than learning of your work and engagement in issues affecting the world we live in . Apathy versus action can frame a narrow view of reality , but learning of your involvement gives me hope for our nation , and I applaud you for resisting the apathy that goes hand-in-hand with the anti-intellectualism in America .
