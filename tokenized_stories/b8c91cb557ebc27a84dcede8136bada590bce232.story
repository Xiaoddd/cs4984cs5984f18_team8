The power went out conveniently when the top Democrat on the panel , Sen. Mark Warner , was about to speak . They had to move the hearing to another room .

RT aired for about ten minutes before C-SPAN1 came back . Please support our work with a generous donation . Thanks . John Aravosis is the Executive Editor of AMERICAblog , which he founded in 2004 .
