Floberg , priest-in-charge of Episcopal congregations on the North Dakota side of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation , salvaged the flour when the Oceti Sakowin Camp of water protectors near Cannon Ball , North Dakota , was disbanded . Even for a church steeped in justice and reconciliation work , Episcopalians learned some lessons and were reminded of their calling to social justice work that is broad , deep and coordinated . The lessons can put the Church in good stead the next time it gets involved in advocacy on any scale . Some lessons were theological ; others were logistical . Some were both . Episcopalians learned about the lengths to which they are called to reconcile with all peoples . They learned about listening and discerning before acting . The Church learned that standing in solidarity can come with unexpected costs . Local Episcopalians and , at times , Episcopalians from elsewhere , ministered to the locals and newcomers who joined the protest . The gathering drew members of close to 300 tribes in an unprecedented show of unity that resurrected the indigenous rights movement in the United States . Upwards of 6,000 to 10,000 people , indigenous and non-indigenous , were gathered along the river . The Rev. Lauren R.

The tribe has water , treaty fishing and hunting rights in the lake . The company that built the pipeline , Energy Transfer Partners , says it will be safe and better than transporting oil by truck or railcar . Oil began flowing through the entire 1,172-mile , 30-inch diameter pipeline on June 1 . The tribe has not yet achieved its objective of getting permitting authorities to abide by its treaty rights and renegotiate a route to take the pipeline away from its drinking water . Whether we succeed or not is out of our hands . U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg said the Corps needs to reconsider those issues . Whether Dakota Access must cease pipeline operations in the meantime is a separate question , which he has yet to consider . They organized to help the tribe protect its sovereign rights and its drinking water . Floberg , who has ministered with and to reservation residents for more than 20 years , repeatedly asked all Episcopalians to stand with the tribe . He urged them to avoid the other agendas that swirled over the Missouri River . Presiding Bishop Michael Curry speaks Sept. 24 at Oceti Sakowin Camp . Early on pipeline and law enforcement officials developed a disinformation campaign to discredit the protesters . The Intercept website recently reported that the pipeline company hired TigerSwan , a security firm founded by retired military special forces members , to lead that effort . It was hard to find allies among the non-native population in the Dakotas . Floberg belongs to a fledgling ecumenical clergy group that seeks to address the persistent racism . More than 500 interfaith witnesses march north along Highway 1806 Nov. 3 to the Backwater Bridge where they formed a Niobrara Circle of Life . Advocacy through action , not just words Yet , that involvement impressed others . Then they gave a copy of the 15th century document that gave Christian explorers the right to claim the lands they discovered to elders in Oceti Sakowin Camp and asked them to burn it . As a native person and as an Episcopal deacon , Mauai said , the ashes of that document symbolized the beginning of something that has needed to happen . Yet , it was important for Episcopalians to not assume they knew exactly how to act out those vows on Standing Rock . They needed to listen to what the people there needed from the Church and , Hauff said , what they did not need .

South Dakota Bishop John Tarrant is beside Curry . The Rev. John Floberg , behind Curry , arranged the session . Floberg is supervising priest of the Episcopal churches on the North Dakota side of Standing Rock Reservation . Former Executive Council member the Rev. Brandon Mauai , left of Floberg , also welcomed Curry to the camp . They were not universally opposed to fossil fuels or to oil pipelines . All the Sioux Nation wanted , Kim said , was to protect its drinking water the way people in Bismarck did . Some environmental activists used the pipeline to protest any use of fossil fuels , Hauff said . The Episcopal Church was just one of many groups that got involved with Standing Rock . Some clergy from other denominations traveled north to Bismarck later that day , determined to get arrested to show their commitment . Floberg consistently counseled against such demonstrations .

St. James Episcopal Church in Cannon Ball , one of the churches Floberg serves , offered an inside place to meet . Its kitchen and working Wi-Fi were bonuses . The Episcopal Church flag flew in Oceti Sakowin Camp . The area it marked was known as a welcoming place . To anticipate where they were needed , Floberg and others watched what was happening and listened to what was being said , including on social media . They soon realized the camp needed portable toilets and dumpsters . Episcopalians told the rest of the Church that they wanted to help the tribe pay for them . People donated money . Episcopalians could not anticipate other needs so clearly . The money covered things such as Christmas dinner at St. James , various kinds of support in the camps and housing costs . Anticipating future needs , Episcopalians bought a cargo trailer , a dump trailer and a skid-steer loader . When the authorities decided to close the camps , they turned to Episcopalians for help . He enlisted people with pickup trucks and vans . Then , there was all the material left behind . Moreover , people sent material goods that were not needed . The donations were an unintended consequence of constant media coverage . Before and after the closing , Floberg helped salvage and distribute of more than 7,000 pounds of rice , beans and macaroni , as well as much of the flour , to area food banks . The remaining flour is now in his garage , awaiting a home . That lesson was one the Church began to learn as Episcopalians responded to the aftermath of the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri , Kim said . Mni Wiconi , Water is Life , has been the motto of the resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline whose route now passes a half mile north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota . While the Episcopal Church continues to minister with and to the Standing Rock Sioux Nation , Episcopalians elsewhere can use the example in their own communities . Hauff said there is an even larger lesson for the Church .

We are not the churchnof progressivism . But this piece sees no difference between progressive an Christianity . These same people have zero concern for their fellow Christians being persecuted in Muslim dominant countries . They turn their backs on people like Asia Bibi . Ronald Davin says : June 22 , 2017 at 11:53 am They need to learn to clean up after themselves Pam Herbert says : June 22 , 2017 at 1:57 pm Sad to see some only focus on the materials left behind when the camps were closed suddenly . Guess they scanned the article instead of reading it . Otherwise they would have seen the part about this being addressed . Priscilla Johnstone says : June 22 , 2017 at 4:42 pm I too am proud of our Episcopal church for supporting our ministry at Standing Rock . We are called to fight for social justice in our Baptismal vows . The history of treatment of Native American tribes by us -LRB- via our government but certainly with support of a majority of people -RRB- is a dark history ; the church has taken a position of reconciliation and now support of tribal rights . As the article states , the church clarified its presence to be one of prayer , addressing needs & working for peaceful resolution . Jesus does not call us to remain comfortable and blind to those in need , he calls us to help , to be involved , to support justice . The Episcopal church led the way through its mission at Standing Rock , joined by other faith communities . This was a very moving experience for me , to see our church as an island of faith , prayerful focus on peace while supporting the rights of indigenous people ; we also maintained open communication with law enforcement and offered prayers for them . We have been following this story for 12 months . The protesters were given plenty of advance warning by tribal chairman archimbault and various governmental officials prior to the Feb 20th announcement to leave the camp for good . It was not just materials like tents . But in your words you are proud to stand with those people . It doesnt work that way . If you own the movement you own the good and the bad . This article is a disingenuous attempt to absolve our church of consequences it should have reasonably forseen . I applaud and appreciate them . Some people respond by paying trash bills and some people respond by laying their lives on the front line unarmed . Savannah Dee says : June 22 , 2017 at 4:30 pm A considerably too long article , it does hit some very good points about social justice . How to help , what is actually helpful , how the Episcopalian church did with Standing Rock , and how they might better address these situations in the future . As Christ followers , we should all aim to serve . But serve in a way that is necessary and needed and asked for . Robert Nagy says : June 22 , 2017 at 4:35 pm Fools -LRB- for Christ -RRB- rush in where angels fear to tread . I give thx for the ministry of my Church at Standing Rock . Blessings to all . I am proud of you for trying so hard and for being brave enough and open enough to learn lessons . The Spirit of God is with us . This is a great project that has prevailed despite the disingenuous , factually erroneous , opposition that was , unfortunately , aided by our church leadership . Ronald Davin says : June 23 , 2017 at 2:55 pm Here Here , well put Pjabbiness den mark wichar says : June 23 , 2017 at 5:45 pm yeah . i am beyond proud of my Church . Jesus is for Justice . we should all be likewise . Terry Francis says : June 24 , 2017 at 9:57 pm Den Mark Wichar , based on your rantings , you sound like you would be more at home among the protesters and rioters on the Berkeley campus than you would in a church . Typical diatribe from a typical left-winger . The Savior you claim to follow would not approve of your self-rightous judgemental attitude . Very proud that we , as Episcopalians , were represented so well among those who stood with the Standing Rock Sioux nation against those profiteering from the exploitation and development of oil . Perhaps there IS an element of self-righteousness in our pride . You have reached our comment limit of 5 . You may resume commenting in 24 hours .
