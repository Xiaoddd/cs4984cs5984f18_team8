Prior to coming to Philadelphia , he worked at New York Newsday , where he was part of a team that won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for spot news reporting . Instead , with local law enforcement nowhere in sight , escalating violence and human rights abuses are exactly what was unleashed on the mostly Native American protesters this Saturday . Video taken by the liberal journalist Amy Goodman of Democracy Now show pipeline security workers siccing attack dogs -- first on several horses carrying demonstrators and then on the allegedly trespassing but seemingly mostly non-violent protesters . Other marchers were blasted with some type of pepper spray . The ancient cairns and stone prayer rings there can not be replaced . The tribal opponents have a powerful moral case against the Dakota Access Pipeline , but the desecration of Native American land is not the only thing driving the opposition . In Iowa , farmers whose land is being taken for the pipeline through eminent domain are up in arms . The risk of a spill that could poison water supplies for thousands in the vast Missouri River watershed looms large . The pipeline would carry as much as 570,000 barrels of crude oil daily through the Dakotas and Iowa ; it 's unclear whether the fossil fuels are even intended for United States consumers -- or for overseas shipments and big profits . What 's more , the Dakota Access Pipeline is objectionable for the same bigger reasons that the similar Keystone XL project was protested by so many and ultimately iced by the Obama administration : It will increase North America 's addiction to fossil fuels at a time when -- as the New York Times noted in an remarkable report this weekend -- climate change is already here and rising sea levels are wreaking havoc . Yet the native tribes and other citizens fighting to block this environmental abomination were treated with the same brand of violence and intimidation that the notorious sheriff Bull Connor had sicced on civil rights protesters in Birmingham a half century ago . That 's more proof that the arc of the moral universe is bending too slowly . A big chunk of money coming out of Pennsylvania is financing the dog siccers and the pepper sprayers -- including your tax dollars and mine . It turns out that one of the major investors in Energy Transfer Partners is ... the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . That 's more than any other governmental or quasi-governmental agency . The PSERS link is n't the only local connection . Sunoco Logistics Partners , which is headquartered in Newtown Square , is another key pipeline investor along with ETP , and the Dakota Access Pipeline is slated to feed into a Sunoco Logistics terminal . Sunoco is also slated to operate the pipeline -- if it 's ever completed . What an irony : Pennsylvania science teachers are out on the front lines teaching school kids about the impact of global warming at the same time their retirement dollars are hard at work building this monstrosity of a pipeline . What 's more , many large entities -- universities as well as some city and state pension funds -- are currently in the process of divesting in fossil-fuel ventures like this one and looking , instead , to finance alternative energy projects such as solar or wind . How typical that the Keystone State is going in the other direction from the rest of the enlightened world . It does n't have to be this way . If you find these Bull Connor-type violent tactics to be unacceptable , if you find the desecration of indigenous shrines to be a moral outrage , or if you do n't want your tax dollars pumping more carbon into the earth 's atmosphere , then reach out to PSERS -LRB- phone number 1-888-773-7748 , or contact them online -RRB- . Tell them it 's time to stop investing in firms like ETP that a -RRB- condone violence against protesters and b -RRB- contribute to the slow destruction of the planet . Also , pressure elected officials like Gov. Wolf to use their influence with PSERS to start divesting . And it would be fantastic to see Pennsylvania school teachers leading the way on this . I do n't know . But the least they can do is call off the dogs .
