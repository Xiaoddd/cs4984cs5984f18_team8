This is nothing new from this Administration , since over the last four months the Administration has demonstrated by its action and inaction that it intended to delay a decision in this matter until President Obama is out of office . For more than three years now , Dakota Access Pipeline has done nothing but play by the rules . The Army Corps of Engineers agrees , and has said so publicly and in federal court filings . In spite of consistently stating at every turn that the permit for the crossing of the Missouri River at Lake Oahe granted in July 2016 , comported with all legal requirements , including the use of an environmental assessment , rather than an environmental impact statement , the Army Corps now seeks to engage in additional review and analysis of alternative locations for the pipeline . As stated all along , ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe . Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way . Bookmark the permalink . 36 Comments . People world wide have spoken . Everyone needs to be concerned about the damage to Mother Earth by the continous drilling of holes in to the earth . And the contamination of our sacred water . Switching to renewable energy is a must if all living creatures are to survive . Greed is not the way . Everyone is suspicious of the outcome of this decision . The protectors will win . Our veterans will stand by them . these allowances such as letting these compaines proceed without full compliance lets us know what is what . these tactics the governement and these corps use are just delay tactics , as the decisions seems to me to have already been made . Nothing in this statement even acknowledges the disastrous impact on water safety that pipelines have CONSISTENTLY caused . For the difference between an environmental assessment and and environmental impact study , see below . Most Americans agree that sustainable energy is the best route for this country . ETP has blatantly violated the Fort Laramie Treaty and the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 . This has been on video , livestreamed .

This has been on video , livestreamed . Seems there are FAR MORE people AGAINST the pipeline than for it . The pipeline is a profit center for a corporation . Public welfare takes precedence over private gain . This land is part of another sovereign nation , and the US Federal Government , its organs , and its agents have no jurisdiction on this land . The Native Peoples of North America are the legal authorities and residents of a separate nation , as described and agreed to by the United States in hundreds of treaties . By attempting to use the Police , Army Corps of Engineers , or any other American institution to further the construction of this project the DAPL has demonstrated and continues to demonstrate bad faith in the United States Government and in the credibility of agreements that Government makes with all other parties . This is surely 1984 which Huxley warned us about . Deal with it Energy Transfer Partners . Everyone in the entire world knows that for the lie it is . You lie about the project pretending it was a bunch of smaller projects for the sole purpose of usurping the law and foregoing a environmental impact statement . You ignored the tribe when they told you the would not have that pipeline go near their water . You set dogs on the people to cover you while you bulldozed sacred sights and artifacts . account .
