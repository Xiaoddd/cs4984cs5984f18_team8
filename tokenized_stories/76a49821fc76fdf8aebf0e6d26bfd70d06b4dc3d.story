By Avery Thompson Feb 19 , 2017 NASA Satellite footage from NASA 's Landsat 8 satellite shows a large piece of ice broke off of Antarctica 's Pine Island glacier . The new iceberg measures around two miles long , about the same size as the island of Manhattan . As far as icebergs go , this one is actually rather small . A previous iceberg ten times this size broke off in the same region two years ago .

Since the 1990s , warming ocean water has caused increased melting both at the surface and , more dangerously , below the water . Subsurface melting can destabilize large sections of ice and split them from the rest of the glacier . Ultimately , this subsurface melting will trigger a chain reaction that risks sending the entire region into the sea . The West Antarctic Ice Sheet , of which Pine Island is a part , is believed to be highly unstable , and a large collapse in one area could trigger more collapses in others . If the entire ice sheet collapses , as some models predict , it could raise sea levels by around four feet . While this may not happen for decades , the smaller collapses like the one last month do have an effect . Ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet causes sea levels to rise by about a hundredth of an inch per year , and this number is only increasing with time . That sea level rise puts hundreds of millions of people at risk . Unless we do something soon , many of us will be living underwater . All Rights Reserved .
