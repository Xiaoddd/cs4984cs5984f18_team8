The cause of the spill is still not known , said Wendy Owen , spokeswoman for True Companies , which owns the Belle Fourche Pipeline . Of the total spill , about 3,100 barrels leaked into the nearby Ash Coulee Creek , a small waterway that feeds the Little Missouri River , a tributary of the Missouri River . The spill has been contained . Last week , she noted that pipeline equipment did not detect the spill , possibly because the 2,400 barrel-per-day line runs intermittently . The leak occurred just 150 miles from the site of protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline , a crude line whose planned route was under the Missouri River . The Little Missouri feeds the main river upstream of the Dakota Pipeline crossing . The spill happened as pipeline companies such as Energy Transfer Partners , which saw the Dakota Access halted in December by the U.S. government , are trying to convince critics that their systems are the safest way to move crude and other products . The incident underscores concerns of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , whose land is adjacent to the planned pipeline route , and others who have said that a leak from the Dakota Access could contaminate drinking water or desecrate sacred lands . So far , the total number of hazardous liquids pipeline spills in 2016 is on track to fall short of 2015 . As of Nov. 30 , there were 354 spills , versus 462 for all of in 2015 , according to data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration -LRB- PHMSA -RRB- . However , the percentage of spills releasing larger volumes of liquids has been higher this year , the data shows . About 16 percent of pipeline releases in 2016 involved 100 or more barrels of product , versus about 13 percent last year . The percentage involving 1,000 barrels or more has been slightly higher as well for 2016 , at 3.4 percent , versus 3 percent last year . The two largest leaks this year have involved crude pipelines . In September , Sunoco Logistics , the operator of the Dakota Access , spilled 8,600 barrels of oil from its Permian Express II pipeline near Sweetwater , Texas . The company had previously been fined for violating welding practices on that line . In October , Enterprise Products Partners released over 7,600 barrels of oil from its Seaway Crude pipeline near Cushing , Oklahoma . Belle Fourche reported a 1,958 barrel leak of refined products on its system in Campbell County , Wyoming in 2011 , and less than a month later suffered a 1,000 barrel spill of crude oil on its line near McKenzie , North Dakota . -LRB- Reporting by Liz Hampton ; Editing by Alistair Bell -RRB- Our Standards : The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles . 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Advertise with Us Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes .
