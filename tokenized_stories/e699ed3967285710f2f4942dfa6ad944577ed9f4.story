Copied to clipboard A Wisconsin Native American tribe wants a 64-year-old oil pipeline removed from its reservation due to concerns that it poses a grave environmental threat . In a very rare move , the resolution also calls for the decommissioning and removal of the pipeline from all Bad River lands and watershed along the shores of Lake Superior in far northern Wisconsin . This is kind of an unprecedented thing from our understanding . Jennings said that while they stand with the protesters around Standing Rock Indian Reservation fighting to stop the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota , their decision has been a long time coming and was not spurred by the recent attention to the issue . Apparently the resolution caught Calgary-based Enbridge off guard . He noted that the nearby Kalamazoo oil spill in 2010 happened on a similar sized pipeline , but that pipeline was only 43 years old when it ruptured .

A portion of the Line 5 pipeline runs underwater at the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac , which links Lake Michigan and Lake Huron . According to the NWF , a spill in the region would be an unparalleled disaster for the Great Lakes . However the two sides eventually agreed on an easement fee that avoided any rerouting .
