The Army intends to allow the crossing under Lake Oahe as early as Wednesday , Feb. 8 . The crossing is the final big chunk of work on the pipeline . Updated at 6:43 a.m. . The Army said Tuesday that it will allow the four-state pipeline to cross under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota , the last big chunk of construction . The Standing Rock Sioux promised to fight the development in court . The Army intends to cancel further environmental study and allow the Lake Oahe crossing , according to court documents the Justice Department filed that include letters to members of Congress from Deputy Assistant Army Secretary Paul Cramer . The 1,200-mile pipeline would carry North Dakota oil through the Dakotas and Iowa to a shipping point in Patoka , Ill. . Dallas-based developer Energy Transfer Partners had hoped to have the pipeline operating by the end of 2016 , but construction has been stalled while the Army Corps of Engineers and the company battled in court over the crossing . The Standing Rock Sioux , whose reservation is just downstream from the crossing , fears a leak would pollute its drinking water . ETP said the pipeline will be safe . Details of the tribe 's legal challenge to the Army 's decision were still being worked out , attorney Jan Hasselman said Tuesday . Even if the pipeline is finished and begins operating , he said , the tribe will push to get it shut down . The tribe also is organizing a march in Washington , D.C. , on March 10 . An assessment conducted last year determined the crossing would not have a significant impact on the environment . However , then-Assistant Army Secretary for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy on Dec. 4 declined to issue permission for the crossing , saying a broader environmental study was warranted . ETP called Darcy 's decision politically motivated and accused then-President Barack Obama 's administration of delaying the matter until he left office . The Corps launched a study of the crossing on Jan. 18 , two days before Obama left office , which could have taken up to two years to complete . President Donald Trump signed an executive action Jan. 24 telling the Corps to quickly reconsider Darcy 's decision . The court documents filed Tuesday include a proposed Federal Register notice terminating the study . The Standing Rock Sioux argues that under the Fort Laramie Treaties of 1851 and 1888 , the federal government is obliged to consider a tribe 's welfare when making decisions that affect the tribe . North Dakota 's congressional delegation and its governor welcomed the Army 's announcement . But environmental groups , including the Sierra Club , Greenpeace , Amnesty International USA , the Center for Biological Diversity and the Indigenous Environmental Network , issued statements saying the Trump administration is putting corporate profits ahead of the rights of Native Americans and the environment . ETP is poised to begin drilling under Lake Oahe as soon as it has approval . Workers have drilled entry and exit holes for the crossing , and oil has been put in the pipeline leading up to the lake in anticipation of finishing the project . ETP spokeswoman Vicki Granado did n't immediately respond to a request for comment on the Army 's decision , but CEO Kelcy Warren told The Associated Press in November that the company should be able to finish the project in a little over three months once it has the go-ahead . Those at the protest encampment have at times clashed with police , leading to nearly 700 arrests . The camp 's population thinned to fewer than 300 as harsh winter weather arrived and as Standing Rock officials pleaded for the camp to disband before the spring flooding season . The Corps has notified the remaining protesters that the government-owned land will be closed Feb. 22 . But Phyllis Young , a protest leader and member of the Standing Rock Sioux , believes the Army 's decision may draw some people back . The area where the company will drill is about half a mile north of the protest camp , and road access is north of a highway bridge outside the camp that 's been blocked by the state since October . A frozen river and snowy hills are between the drill area and the camp . The construction area is surrounded by a wall and barricades such as razor wire .
