President Obama : Revoke the Dakota Access permits The 1,168-mile Dakota Access Pipeline would carry over 400,000 barrels of fracked oil through four states in the Midwest . It would put communities , waterways , and wildlife at risk . The pipeline also puts our climate at risk . This same test must apply to all energy infrastructure projects , including Dakota Access . Revoking the permits for this dangerous pipeline is critical to respecting Native American communities and their sovereignty , protecting land and water , and keeping fossil fuels in the ground . Oil Change International campaigns to expose the true costs of fossil fuels and facilitate the coming transition towards clean energy .
