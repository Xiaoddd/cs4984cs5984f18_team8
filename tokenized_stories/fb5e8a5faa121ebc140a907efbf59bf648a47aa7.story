The letter amounts to concern-trolling , mischaracterizing the realities of the situation at Standing Rock in a revisionist take on the facts . However , violence by law enforcement has been widespread , from the recent use of water cannons on protesters in below-freezing temperatures to horror stories such as Sophia Wilansky , who had a huge chunk of her lower arm blown away by a concussion grenade . Excessive use of pepper spray , rubber bullets , and Tasers on otherwise peaceful protesters has been common . Ultimately , the violence at Standing Rock has been one sided . The responsibility of de-escalation lies with the police as agents of the state . The violence at Standing Rock is part of a concerted effort by the state in support of Dakota Access , and more broadly the oil industry , to repress opposition to the Bakken pipeline . The very notion of a free-speech zone violates both the principles of the First Amendment and the spirit of protest . The First Amendment enshrines the idea that we the people should be free to speak our minds without fetters . This is clearly in opposition to the First Amendment , the amendment that lays the foundation for our other inalienable constitutional rights . Free-speech zones also fly counter to the tenets of protest . When local protesters blocked I-80 , people were angry that they were inconvenienced . Protests are meant to disrupt the normal and everyday in an effort to demand the attention of a mal-informed population . By relegating protesters to free-speech zones , the government cuts off their access to the people and neuters the possibility of a protest stopping the everyday . While that might sound good to some , the limitation of free speech anywhere is a threat to free speech everywhere . The dispute at Standing Rock is rooted in settler colonialism , the ongoing American genocide against Native Americans , and capitalist disregard for the environment . These concerns should be heard listened to . Corporate interests misused eminent domain in Iowa to take land from Iowa farmers , an economic issue that should anger people of all political persuasions . All Rights Reserved .
