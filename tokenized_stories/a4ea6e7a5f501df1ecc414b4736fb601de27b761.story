Stung by the enthusiasm gap of 2016 , the Democratic National Committee -LRB- DNC -RRB- was quick to claim credit for getting the youth vote out this time . It said this contributed to more than 1.32 m phone calls , 325,000 doors knocked in the last seven weeks and more than 1m texts to volunteers and voters in across the state . But while Republicans looked for ways to stem the bleeding , there were lessons for Democrats too . Before this election , the party was divided , neglected and moribund in Alabama .

The upset in Alabama handed Trump and Bannon their most humiliating political defeat . Back in Birmingham , there was relief among liberals that , after decades in the wilderness with their state often seen as a byword for backwardness and object of derision , Alabama suddenly had something to shout about .
