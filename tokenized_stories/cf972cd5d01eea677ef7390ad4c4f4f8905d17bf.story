We are still here . We are still fighting for our lives on our own land . LaDonna Brave Bull Allard posted Sep 03 , 2016 On this day , 153 years ago , my great-great-grandmother Nape Hote Win -LRB- Mary Big Moccasin -RRB- survived the bloodiest conflict between the Sioux Nations and the U.S. Army ever on North Dakota soil . An estimated 300 to 400 of our people were killed in the Inyan Ska -LRB- Whitestone -RRB- Massacre , far more than at Wounded Knee . But very few know the story . We can not forget our stories of survival . Just 50 miles east of here , in 1863 , nearly 4,000 Yanktonais , Isanti -LRB- Santee -RRB- , and Hunkpapa gathered alongside a lake in southeastern North Dakota , near present-day Ellendale , for an intertribal buffalo hunt to prepare for winter . Many refugees from the 1862 uprising in Minnesota , mostly women and children , had been taken in as family . This was part of a broader U.S. military expedition to promote white settlement in the eastern Dakotas and protect access to the Montana gold fields via the Missouri River . As she ran , she was shot in the hip and went down . She laid there until morning , when a soldier found her . As he loaded her into a wagon , she heard her relatives moaning and crying on the battlefield . The stones are not created anymore , ever since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dredged the mouth of the Cannonball River and flooded the area in the late 1950s as they finished the Oahe dam . They killed a portion of our sacred river . I was a young girl when the floods came and desecrated our burial sites and Sundance grounds . Our people are in that water . Now the river water is no longer safe to drink . Look north and east now , toward the construction sites where they plan to drill under the Missouri River any day now , and you can see the old Sundance grounds , burial grounds , and Arikara village sites that the pipeline would destroy . Below the cliffs you can see the remnants of the place that made our sacred stones . And as it erases our footprint from the world , it erases us as a people . These sites must be protected , or our world will end , it is that simple . Our young people have a right to know who they are . They have a right to language , to culture , to tradition . And more keep coming . This is the first gathering of the Oceti Sakowin -LRB- Sioux tribes -RRB- since the Battle of the Greasy Grass -LRB- Battle of Little Bighorn -RRB- 140 years ago . When we first established the Sacred Stone Camp on April 1 to stop the pipeline through prayer and non-violent direct action , I did not know what would happen . But our prayers were answered . We must remember we are part of a larger story . We should not have to fight so hard to survive on our own lands . My son is buried there , too . We are the river , and the river is us . We have no choice but to stand up . Today , we honor all those who have survived centuries of struggle . Today , we stand together in prayer to demand a future for our people . No Paywall . No Ads .
