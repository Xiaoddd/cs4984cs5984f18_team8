This is another small victory in defeating the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline . The fight , however , is still not over . This notice opens the public scoping phase and invites anyone interested to help them to identify potential issues , concerns , and reasonable alternatives that should be considered in an EIS . While the EIS is exactly what we called for , we must ensure that it fully takes into consideration tribal treaty rights , natural resources , cultural and sacred places , socio-economical concerns , environmental justice , and the health and wellbeing of those downstream who rely on our drinking water . We need your continued support as this process moves forward . The Department of the Army 's Civil Works division will be accepting public comment until February 20th , 2017 Sponsored by Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Action Network is an open platform that empowers individuals and groups to organize for progressive causes .
