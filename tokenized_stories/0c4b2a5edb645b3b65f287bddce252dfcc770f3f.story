The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America The Collapse of The American Dream Click here to view the breakdown of the Fortune 500 , from how much they made compared to how many people they employ . The Sabal Trail Pipeline is a natural gas pipeline starting in Alabama and going from that point , through Georgia , Kissimmee , Florida -LRB- where it is slated to be liquefied and loaded in cars to be carried on the same rails as high-speed passenger trains to be moved to the coast for export -RRB- . It ends in Reunion , Florida , where it connects to a southern FL SE Connection Pipeline . This is a fight that started about three years ago . Recently , outsiders have been moving in on this already established fight , dictating orders to the already set up groups involved . Their plan had already been set up and it never called for any civil disobedience . Two such outsiders are Adam Dubbin of Gainesville , Florida and Jim Petruzzi , of Bellvue , Colorado . They have most of the players in this story . On the second to last update of the Adam Dubbin page , I give a link to a video of Carolina , from the Stop Sabal Trail group and myself . In that video , we hit on the subject of bail funds , legal funds and other solicited donations by individuals and groups . That video is a continuation of what was already written on the Dubbin page . First things first ; all men and women are sovereigns . What an individual does with action towards a foe is up for them to decide . On February 26 , 2017 , James Marker lost his life to police , after shooting up a section of the Sabal Trail Pipeline , located in Marion County , Florida . So let me tell you how I saw and see it . First , a report comes out about a man shooting up a section of the pipeline and some earth moving equipment that was close by it . A local television news crew covered it . They obtained video from a bystander who recorded the man being shot up by the police and interviewed the local who reported the shooting and took a picture for the police to use to find him ; a young man named Chevy Mathews . In his first interview that I saw , Chevy is telling the camera that he was at work and he could hear someone shooting and bullets flying over his head . That floored me because Chevy was a long hair . His hair seemed like dreadlocks pined up in a bun . I had to look up just who this Chevy Mathews is . I goggled him and found out he is a 23 year old kid of privilege . Chevy is a man around 23 years of age . He has only been an adult for five or six years . That means he graduated from high school around 2012 . During his school days he worked for a clothing company called Good Ride Life , Incorporated . This is a company that was started in 2009 . He worked there from 2010 to 2012 -LRB- probably up to graduation -RRB- . He dropped out and went for the easy money to be had in real estate . Not as hard a school as college ; it does have a lot of single moms and strippers doing it ... Oh , single mom crack . I say he dropped out of college because Chevy seems to have a big ego and loves to pad his resume , so I am sure that if he had an associates degree he would have mentioned it here . While and after taking his virtual lessons on line , Chevy took pictures and sold them to various news organizations . Following graduation he found employment with Arbor Development , at their Bel Lago subdivision as a sales associate , a position he currently holds . He also currently holds a position within the same Development Company as a sales and marketing manager , a promotion just given to him last month . Also , while working for the Rosbeck family , he also got a current position with Pegasus Reality and Associates , Inc. , which he picked up in January of this year . All of the above jobs listed on his LinkedIn page have one thing in common ; horses . When he was in high school , Good Rides was a horse riding apparel company . Just the owner and his wife , but they were nice to Chevy and probably because he is kin . His pictures , probably of horses as well . And his real estate experience has been in the selling of high-end horse farms . This all brings us back to what Chevy Mathews was doing at the location of the Sabal Trail shooting . In the first interview I saw with him the day of the shooting , Chevy claimed to be at work and heard what sounded like missiles going over his head . In one video he says he called his boss to ask him if there was any pipeline construction going on that day because who would know better than he . After being told no , Chevy drove out to the road and saw the shooter shooting at the pipeline . In one story , Chevy was at home . Chevy Mathews is a real estate sales person . Dylan Hansen is a real estate broker . Both come from rich families . This sounded all strange to me . Witnesses say that he waited for the cars to pass by before he shot . That is what Chevy said . He sure seemed to know his weapons . I doubt it . You can see the holes that powerful gun made . Big holes , not dents and I doubt he missed . Even if there was a ricochet or two , I doubt they would have made it over the berm or the privacy hill on the other side of the pipe between the pipeline and the neighborhood . Chevy was hundreds of feet , well protected , from the actual shooting . There is a neighborhood many hundreds of feet away , but still . I have spent many days in the woods like are around there and heard many gun shots and have just ignored them . I figured hunters or target shooters . So he knew of the protesters . In some reports they say the shooter left when the police got there , in others they say he was already gone when police arrived . In one report they claim the police lost him for half an hour then found him , in others they chased him for a half and hour . Some reports report it was a high-speed chase , others it never broke the speed limit . I want to know where he is buried and if he is talk with those who buried him . I want to see the body and dash cam recordings of the shooting . And I want this investigated by the Florida Bureau of Investigations or the Florida Department of Law Enforcement . I smell something stinky . This Bel Lago neighborhood is a very exclusive neighborhood . He bought 600 acres in the middle of an 8000 acre conservation . The conservation is surrounded by the pipeline and they plan to build a compressor station near the neighborhood . Now , most of these two million-dollar homes are all in , or near , the blast zone of the pipeline . Dang , Chevy has a tough job . Maybe that is why he got his job with Pegasus . There is no way anyone with millions of dollars to invest in a horse farm will buy there now . Yup , got ta suck . So this shooter ends up getting rammed by a police car and hits a tree . This is were there is no proof of what happened next , but they say he came out of his truck and pointed his weapon at them , so they all shot , multiple times , killing him . That is something that we will explore next . One in particular who was ringing the bell was Peter Tsolkas , a.k.a. . He is seen here in this film made by Dylan Hansen , whom we heard about on the Dubbin page . Interesting too , because Dylan usually takes a week to produce his videos , yet this one was up that evening , less than a day and a half after the shooting . There is quite a connection between these two . Not a legal corporation of any kind , yet a fictitious name registered with the state of Florida . This is his alter ego : the Earth First Journal . You can tell it is his site by the the donation page here . But Tukas , as I like to call him , has another love , another passion that he spends a lot of his time with ; prisons . Peter Tukas has spent a lot of his time fighting for the residents of prisons where environmental damage takes place . This damage , of course , being capable of causing disease to those living around it . Not by old Sparky , but from natural causes . Two different struggles , yet Tukas wants to unite them as one in the same . Standing Rock was more of a Native American land dispute . Leonard Peltier is Native American . One man I knew at Standing Rock was at Wounded Knee and knew Peltier . Nuff said . And now this Tukas has come to the Sabal Trail Pipeline fight to set himself up , get hold of already compiled mailing lists and divert those in the environmental struggle to a struggle to free a man convicted of shooting two cops ; a man who will be dead by the end of this year and will die in prison . The environmental struggle will continue on until we all die from our apathy towards it . Things that make you go hmm . He was all the talk at Standing Rock . Tukas must have been there and being from Florida took it upon himself to organize actions at the prison along with the Native Americans . It makes him happy . Facebook was all-abuzz with talk about the shooting in the various Stop Sabal Trail groups . The news never released his name for a couple of days , so for this period it was time to play speculation . Much time to spin theories . Shortly after this , Nicole Williams came out of the woodwork to defend Mr. Marker . One such spin session is here . This is the video done by Dylan Hansen and was produced and up within hours of the taping . Dylan produced all this under the 501c -LRB- 3 -RRB- nonprofit corporation he started in 2013 . You got it , Dylan Hansen . He is currently selling a house for 2.6 million dollars , while he is telling everyone he is no longer in that business . Look at this million dollar listing . This is his address . This is where Ballane For Earth , Inc. , is ran from . Dylan is also working with a brother who goes by the name Lowell Everly . This guy is a joke . In January , he showed up with Dylan at a grassroots meeting on the pipeline in Brevard and started dictating , with white male privilege , how this two-year-old group was now going to run things . They were chased out , but refused to go quietly . And this was told to them after being told not even to bother coming in the first place . So just who is this Lowell Everly . If you clicked on the last link , you were brought to his LinkedIn Page . It exists in Colorado , Delaware and Nevada and even in Santa Cruz , California , but not in Florida . Most of them make porn . So neither this position nor this company exist . That makes Lowell a liar , a deceiver and therefore someone not to be trusted . It has no reason to be there . Bascom Communications & Consulting LLC , is just listed as some experience he had , probably with one of the women there . Lowell is just trying to reinvent himself with his LinkedIn account . He had a twitter account that was just posts about music until October 17 , 2016 , when in his last post he tried to solicit money to get him to Standing Rock . That account has since been taken down , bet he never went . After that , nothing . His Instagram page is all Lowell ego . The pictures are all of him . Vain . He also claims to be a Water Protector . The big scam Lowell is working on is his documentary . He started this Born of Water documentary on August 19 , 2016 . He is even soliciting for funds to make this film ... well , you know , video . Even has a page devoted to it on Instagram . After the state learns what this man is doing he might not want to be found by them . Another opportunist taking advantage of the Standing Rock struggle . Another one , like Adam and Jim . Sure does to me . Hmm . Okay , so we have one dead guy who shot up an empty pipeline . We have one high-end real estate agent whose call to the police got the shooter killed . One is Tukas , the other is a man named Pete Ackerman . I met Pete Ackerman , along with Cindy Noel and Mike Roth , at the Water Is Life Camp -LRB- now called the Water Is Life House -RRB- , in Branford , Florida , on January 13 , when I showed up for an action planing lecture being given by Akerman for the Martian Luther King Jr. weekend actions . They had no idea it was the holiday weekend . He was the full-time paid camp manager for the Water Is Life Camp ; probably the house now . I introduced myself as Gnome , a nickname given to me 25 years ago and the name a lot of my work is published under and I am known by . Pete was to give the lecture . They were talking civil disobedience . My forte . And the last arrests this group took in Gilchrist County , has a bunch of three-year-olds taking the collar and not knowing how to deal with the consequences . I had to find out if this group had learned anything since that action in November . When I got to the Water Is Life Camp , there were things I had noticed . One was there were no other cars there , another was the size of the property . The camp was around 300 feet from the Santa Fe River divided by a road . The camp side of the property had a port-o-let or two and many brand new looking tents . Many tents , but no people in them . I saw a canopy with a makeshift kitchen under it . Like the tents , it too was pretty much brand new . Big shinney pots and pans . They had all you needed for the anyone of thousands of homeless people who flock to the Sunshine State for the winter . While there I saw about four hippie types get out of and around a tent , but they never came to the lecture . Pete Ackerman mostly discussed where the action was to take place , but not all of it . There was a secret plan a secret subgroup of this group was planning . He talked about three groups that this action will be divided into . Who will go to jail , who will not , who will fuck with the police then run before and illegal action has been made . Pete had no plan . This was nothing other than a photo op . People were asking questions I was more suited to answer , yet Pete had little answers . Like these people should have done with they first came on to the scene . When it was over , I was filled with dread for those who came to get arrested . After the meeting and while walking back to the car , I softly spoke to one young sister and told her not to get arrested . I told her she was young and they had no plan for her for court . What I saw were amateurs and I was scared . I spoke with one friend from my OWS days as soon as were were out of earshot of everyone . All they wanted were bodies to show up for a photo op because this fight is so unknown they think that by getting arrested and having an ariel photo of large numbers of pipeline protesters blocking trucks will get them in the news and the attention they are seeking . Only , the company knew about this action a week in advance as it was announced to the entire world via facebook . They built another road to get in and out of , so they were never affected by the protesters ... water protectors ... whatever you want to call them . And the typography of the land made the angle of the photo nothing they could use , so ... As soon as the people got arrested , the bail funds began to pop up . I know one thing , many people of the 501c -LRB- 3 -RRB- s have property and businesses not only along that river , but hosting the Sabal Trail Resistance Camp at their house under the name Water Is Life Camp . Jim Tatum is on the Board of Directors for the Our Santa Fe River , Inc. , a 501c -LRB- 3 -RRB- registered in the State of Florida . The photo in the margin to the right is of Jim and a woman named Merrillee Malwitz-Jipson . She also lives right on the river in an expensive home . She was the president of Our Santa Fe River , Inc. . She has since left and taken up work for the Sierra Club of Florida , Inc. . Jim , as most board members for OSFR do , has listed his address as the same which is the address for the Kayaking business owned by Merrillee and is also the principal address for Our Santa Fe River , Inc. . Hmm . Also listed as Board Members and officers are Cindy Noel and her husband Michael Roth . Cindy and her husband , you may remember from the Adam Dubbin page , are the ones hosting the Water Is Life Camp on their property in Branford and are both listed as Board Members . Mike Roth is not just a Board Member , but the Treasurer of OSFR . Tukas ; with his Everglades Earth First group and radical activism . And it was set up with the help from Adam Dubbin himself , as Cindy was talking to him about me personally , while I was there in the camp ... lol . Roth is a CPA , so he should know if there are any laws being broken by his 501c -LRB- 3 -RRB- . You know ... like diverting funds from the corporation to personally benefit officers and the directors of the board . Hope they have been following these rules , or these rules here , but if they have been doing this here , uhoh . For all those following this movement you have to believe that there is a conspiracy being unveiled here . These people on this page and the Dubbin page are all trying to rip you off for their own survival . In this campaign , a woman named Sherrie Lewis , is asking for 50 grand to set up a prayer camp . Security . And Proper Waste Management . Okay , some port-o-lets and a dumpster . Kitchen and Medical . Please be self-sufficient . Now we get into it . The Traveling Team . The statement under that makes no sense , other then they want to drive around and tell people just about the major pipelines , not the minor ones . Court costs that their free attorneys will need , but nothing specific as to what the lawyers will be doing . Sherri Lewis owns a beauty salon in Naples , Florida , called Green Difference Spa . The facebook page is here , quite pricey , and here . Her web site is here . Her twitter account is here . Folks , this girl lives in Naples . Only millionaires live in Naples . She used to own a 50,000 square foot athletic club that she sold . Oh , yeah , she has to be a millionaire . She could probably kick down the cash herself , but why when she can funnel other peoples money through her non profit that she owns called , Kid Difference . However , further search of incorporation with Florida has proven frustrating . Sheri has had a lot of businesses in Florida , but she has never registered a 501c -LRB- 3 -RRB- non-profit corporation with the state of Florida as stated on her LinkedIn page . No such corporation named Kid Difference , Inc. exists . She is a scammer . She is just going to take your money . I will let her correct me if wrong . I first learned about Sheri Lewis and her GoFundMe page while watching an Adam Dubbin video of a podcast he was doing for someone . In it , he claims all the donations on his page have been vetted by him and are all real and then he mentions Sherri and her page . I was appalled , especially after finding out this rich American business owner was using the incidents at Standing Rock to sell her pitch for your money . This is her ad as first posted . I donated 5 dollars and left a comment about the page . She responded with the following : Well ... there is a lot with that response . Big deal , you got in touch with Adam and told him to take down your GoFundMe link after you read what I left and investigated for yourself . You and Adam and Jim all met in Colorado , back in January . You might be kidding the bleeding hearts out there , but not me . I see right through you . You should have contacted the Stop Sabal Trail people who have been working on this for over two years . They could have told you what you can do with your water protecters . You have been asking for money for three months now . The pipeline will be finished in a month or two . At that rate you will have your money to set up your camp in 8 years . She has since removed herself . She is also friends with Huston Cypress , the owner of the website for Love the Everglades , Inc. . So too did Our Santa Fe River , Incorporated . On the second page , the folks that are putting this on , the Sabal Trail Resistance folks , who were really planing something for the Leonard Peltier prison action the day of the shooting and the next , states that this is all sponsored by Our Santa Fe River , and gives a link to the Our Santa Fe River , Incorporated , which is accepting donations for this Sabal Trail Resistance . Maybe I already know . This action can be viewed here . The same people that have brought this scam into their non-profits to collect money to be personally used for the board members of Our Santa Fe River , Inc. , and the Sierra Club , Inc. , whom all seem to have members on the Board or working for them that live or have businesses on or near the river and close to , if not in , the blast zones . Wow . Everyone else is using public defenders , but not Cindy . She hired her own . No one should ever follow anyone who says they will help out if you just give them money , especially when those that are asking have no experience , or a personal agenda , when dealing with the cause . It can not and will not ever win . Her name is Kaithleen Hernandez and her solicitation for money to be used for her defense , is here . If you go to the actual link here , you will notice the URL . Our Santa Fe River , Inc. . Click on it and look at the URL then . The money goes right to them which they will use in these cases . Only , from what I hear , they all have public pretenders , so ... I found out about this yesterday while writing this page . They are getting money every which-way they can . Getting back to the rumors about the morning of the Leonard Peltier protest , participants say that Tukas was late to arrive . Very late . Maybe he was with Chevy and James Marker getting them set up . Maybe James was at the Peltier camp and that is where those guys talked him into shooting up the pipeline . Maybe they had planed for him to get arrested , but he took off . They refuse to show the video . Hmm . Maybe he is still alive and this is a plan by the government to gather information and he is being held for debriefing . I can not find any obituary on this guy and the only person that said anything about him to the news that knew him is this girl named Kittie Schwebel . I found her facebook account and left her a message . She is still to read it . Beats me . And of the six or seven facebook friends the shooter had , Nicole Williams is one of them , or was , she took herself off . And by the way she was talking about him after they released his name , we seem to think she may have had a sugar daddy . Both Nicole Williams and Karrie Ford , can not be seen at any pipeline protests due to the conditions of their release . I am almost willing to bet my life that this James Marker was at the camp before the shooting . It is known that he was at the Water Is Life House when it opened , and while there in the pressence of a member of the Red Warrior Society talking about violent actions . Mayber the him and the same guy was at the camp the day of the shooting . He is from the Everglades where Tukas and Nicole Williams are involved with the save the Everglades movement or whatever it is called . This shit is intricate . They convince him to shoot up the pipeline , telling him that he has to get arrested for the cause . These four either tell him , or keep from him , that this action will create a large news gathering that would be great for raising money for the movement . They either tell him , or figure , that they will raise bail for his release which he will get back at the end of the proceeding . Or whoever bails him out of jail . They probably omit that fact . He has a nice new duly . Never follow anyone without an endgame . Google those who want to lead . They piss me off . All you need is a group of dedicated people who have sworn their allegiance and their personal fortunes to each other . Like is written at the bottom of this page . They will pool their resources together for the cause and with their work becoming visible , people will donate things and money on their own without having to be asked . This is true grassroots activism . If you can not contribute anything other than your time , you have a problem . Maybe you are homeless , then finding shelter is priority number one , not protesting a pipeline . The pipeline will be built and the job will be over and you are still faced with priority number one . We should not have to feed you , or give your shelter , just so you will show up and hold a sign or get arrested for a photo op . There is something underhanded there . I know more about these people , their families , friends and employers , the companies they own , websites they own , groups they run and donations they solicit , than I really want to or have time to write about . You follow one link , which leads to another link , then another , and you learn all the players and most of the angles . I even know about Tukas getting arrested at a city council meeting because he was acting like such an ass , they ran a check on him and found a warrant . Fool . I have copies of pages I printed that shows enough to get most of these people locked up while their 501c -LRB- 3 -RRB- s lose non-profit status . What a bunch of criminals . If anyone would like to file a complaint about anyone written above , you may do do so by clicking here and fillig out the form . I hope the IRS , the FDLE , the Florida FBI , the federal FBI and the prosecutors for the state of Florida and in particular the counties of Marion and Citrus , all do extensive investigations on this shooting and everyone written about in this and on the Adam Dubbin page . Something is going on . You have better resources to be able to connect everyone spoken about . Since the pipeline will be up and running in 2 to 3 months , it is quite obvious that she will never reach the the goal and thus never be able to set up her camp . She changed the reason for the money , mid stream , to say they were setting up in the Everglades , an area hundreds of miles from the pipeline , so it is obvious the money would not be used to set up any Sabal Trail encampment . Her response was quick . She deleted the comment -LRB- probably the one she left for me when I donated as well -RRB- and blocked me from ever commenting or donating . Jim Petruzzi did the same to me . All this after she invited me to respond . Immediately , I sent this complaint to get my money back . Sheri Lewis , is so full of shit . Also , I had communication with someone who was at the Water Is Life House . The witness stated : James Marker was present at the Water Is Life House , on February 18 , when the witness showed up and was still there after the witness let the meeting . Witness has no idea how Mr. Marker arrived . James Marker sat next to Cindy Noel the entire meeting . Meeting started 90 minutes late due to Tukas and the Red Warrior Society being late . The meeting started at 4 pm . They all showed up close to 5 30 . The 4 red warriors that came all had their stories of horror to share . but they bragged that they stopped the keystone initial path which was north east of Bismarck ND have to forgive me I do n't remember the tribe or nation they mentioned but they did say they stopped it dead in its tracks in Canada before it even came to the US . He was sitting directly to the left Of Cindy Noel the whole night . Witness stated that a photograph exists that shows James Marker about the crowd . When this was pointed out to the Water Is Life House , after the shooting , it was taken down . If anyone has that photo of James Marker at the meeting , please send it to me here . The Our Santa Fe River , Inc. , is promoting the arrests of Karrie Ford and the other guy . In this screen shot of the news article on their website , they state ... well , look here . So you see , someone mentioned it . Four days later and Karrie is in the tube refusing to come out . Four days following that , the shooting at the same exact site where Karie and her friend were in the pipe , in front of Bel Lago . Hmm . You come to your own conclusions . If you were born after 1945 , click here for a message to humanity . Watch as we explain the bail fund scams . This is Merrillee Malwitz-Jipson , standing at her business along the Santa Fe River . Conflict of interest , so they stepped down . Merrillee went to work for the Sahara Club , where I am sure she continued creating river trips for her business to benefit off of . Maybe not , but she does look somewhat like a Native American . She did it by never mentioning the fact that she was NA .
