Instagram LinkedIn No Tar Sands The UK Tar Sands Network campaigns in partnership with Indigenous communities affected by the Tar Sands oil developments in Canada . We target governments , UK companies , banks and investors operating in the Alberta Tar Sands . Hundreds of people in London joined by thousands of allies across North America , Europe and beyond , taking to the streets to tell the President Obama and the U.S. government to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline . And at the start of this week , we have heard the disturbing reports of rubber bullets , water cannons and pepper spray being deployed with militarized force on unarmed , peaceful water protectors . These human rights abuses have been disregarded by all , however . . Along with allies across the world , the UN has taken notice and recently sent observers to monitor the situation on multiple occasions . Since 2009 , there has been a growing international solidarity movement to work with frontline indigenous communities who are challenging the violence of colonialism , by peacefully targeting banks , corporations , and governments . Recently , the UK Tar Sands Network -LRB- UKTSN -RRB- took action at Canada House to highlight international concern over the failure of Canadian PM Justin Trudeau to respect indigenous rights , and take the threat of climate change seriously by not approving the Kinder Morgan Pipeline . After the escalation of violence last Sunday and the threat of eviction on December 5th , now more than ever we need to continue to build this international movement centred around the indigenous peoples on the frontlines of the fight against DAPL , and indigenous movements globally who are leading the climate justice movement . If you are part of the divestment movement , bring your networks and power to stand behind the peaceful water protectors and demand HSBC , RBS and Barclays pull out the DAPL in light of the rampant human rights violations being carried out by the company U.S. government agencies . Many nations are returning to old ways and often never left them in the first place . These are ways that depend on the weather , the local wildlife , the water , the plants , the soil , all of which are subject to disruption as the climate changes and when those in power meddle in the delicate balance . Living in a more sustainable ways that rely on the environment defies the way that capitalism has structured the colonized world . Colonizer logic dictates that the land and all that is on it belongs to them and that they should be able to take and use as they desire , rather than to protect out of either care or self-preservation . It is that greed that fuels the continued genocide of Native Americans . account .
