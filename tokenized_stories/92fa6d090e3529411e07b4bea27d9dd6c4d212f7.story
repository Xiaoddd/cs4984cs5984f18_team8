Protesters also are not supposed to walk , ride or fly drones north of the bridge , Laney said . The bridge blockade is something that Standing Rock Sioux tribal chairman Dave Archambault has been asking to be removed , the Bismarck Tribune reports , and something he said he would to talk to Gov. Jack Dalrymple about when they meet in person .
