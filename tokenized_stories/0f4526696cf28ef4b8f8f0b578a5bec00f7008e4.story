Now , another group involved in the protest is urging people to fight in other ways . In their response to the order to pause construction until further review , Energy Transfer Partners has made it clear that they will pursue completion of the pipeline . Because of these challenges , along with the deescalated need for allies to be on the ground at Standing Rock while DAPL construction is paused , we now encourage allies to reevaluate staying or coming to Standing Rock . Since the beginning of this movement , thousands have come to Standing Rock to serve as true allies and guests of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , the land and local communities . The support we , as visitors , received helped create a solid foundation of prayer and movement in the protection of Mother Earth and her lifeblood : the water . During this pause in action , we remain committed to supporting the grassroots leadership within the camp and will help facilitate the transition out of camp , prioritizing the safety of its individuals and ensuring that the land we 've been using is left better than it was found .
