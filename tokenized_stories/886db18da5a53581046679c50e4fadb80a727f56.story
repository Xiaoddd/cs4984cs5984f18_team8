In the United States , police and other officials are using brutal force against protestors , says an activist at the Oceti Sakowin Camp . The Dakota Access Pipeline Protest began with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe fighting to protect their clean water , as on July 25 the DAPL was granted authorization to cross Lake Oahe . Now , however it has drawn attention from all over the country and around the globe . Xochitl Lerma , an 18-year-old high school student from Sonoma , Calif. , came down to the protest with her mother . This is not to be destroyed . This is our land . Lerma plans to go home and come back with her brother and stay for as long as possible . The camps are being winterized as the protestors plan on sticking it out indefinitely . They have donations of wood coming into the camp from other tribes and have staggered wood chopping stations throughout the camps . They have asked for donations of winter clothes and they are building a school for the children in the camps . There are signs up all over the camp reminding protestors that it is a peaceful protest . There are also legal aides warning people who exit the camp that they could be arrested . Kubala still has the marks on his wrists from the zip ties and the other injuries he acquired from the officials . On Oct. 27 , he decided to go to the north camp . Kubala says that the arresting officers wiped something into his nose and stuck their black gloved hands into his nostrils . Although this happened two-weeks ago , Kubala still has the marks on his wrists from the zip ties and the other injuries he acquired from the officials . Kubala has made it clear that he is staying until the end . On Oct 27 , 141 protestors were arrested .
