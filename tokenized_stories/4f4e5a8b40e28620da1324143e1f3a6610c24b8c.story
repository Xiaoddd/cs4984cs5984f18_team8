It is a call that has resonated with its Western political audience . This , so the story goes , is the longstanding tale of a yet another Middle Eastern dictator , struggling to maintain his grip on power except by means of military force , a tale of a bad man doing bad things to his own people . In this telling , the US and its allies in NATO and the EU , appear as the good guys , supporting the Syrian rebels in their various guises against the bad guys , from Assad to Putin and Iran . And the assault on eastern Ghouta , like the siege of Aleppo before it , is proof positive of this narrative , a desperately grim manifestation of the baddie-driven dynamic impelling the Syrian conflict on . As stated above , this is the persistent narrative on the Syrian conflict in the West . It is also a persistently misleading narrative . For a corrective , look no further than Afrin , both a city and region in north-eastern Syria , where an equally merciless assault on citizens has been carried out . First came the fighter planes and missiles just over six weeks ago , then the ground troops moved in . And now , the brutal triumph , with the invading fighters celebrating their victory in Afrin this weekend , turfing out their antagonists , and , with them , nearly 200,000 Afrin residents . Yet there has been no condemnation of what has just happened in Afrin . And the planes and missiles -LRB- and not a few troops -RRB- were not of Russian provenance ; they were from neighbouring Turkey . They were from a member of NATO . They were from a nation regarded as a Western ally . This brutal , unforgiving assault on a Syrian city was therefore organised and carried out by a nation too close to the West for comfortable condemnation , outraged-of-Paris-and-Berlin letters , and declamations from the UN . So completely compromised is the West in the Syrian catastrophe that its leaders are now , by backing Turkey , effectively also backing the very people the US and its allies have spent the best part of three years fighting in Syria and Iraq . So , from the perspective of the Turkish president , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the conquest of Afrin is one in the eye for those it considers an existential threat . As well they would given the FSA is populated by those Islamist factions Kurdish fighters have been battling in their conflict with ISIS . Moreover , the fact that there was a Kurdish statue to pull down also tells us something about Afrin . This was not a city , indeed a region , taken over by the Kurds as the Syrian state lost control of its territory in 2012 . Rather Afrin is a region that , since the 18th century , has been predominantly Kurdish . Far from being a simple tale of good-versus-Russia , the reality of Syria is a compromised , cynical mess in which international actors on either side are making endlessly cynical calculations as to what might , at this moment , be in their interests . And as it stands , those calculations are being made at a very steep cost to the Syrian people themselves , be they Arab or Kurdish . Tim Black is a spiked columnist . Picture by : Getty Images .
