All that is left in the tool box is asking the courts if the province can put reasonable restrictions on increased movement of bitumen by pipeline and rail . He challenged the government reading of the Constitutional Question Act , the provincial law under which New Democrats are asking the court to validate their attempt to regulate shipments of Alberta bitumen . The comment drew titters from a public gallery composed mainly of lawyers representing other interests in the case , according to the account by Ian Mulgrew of The Vancouver Sun . Frankel then set the end of the month as a deadline for would-be interveners to file notice as to why they should be permitted to participate and what they could contribute . Only then will the court begin to consider the next stage . By May 31 the deadline , set by pipeline owner Kinder Morgan for deciding whether to proceed with the expansion , will have passed . In declining to accept the government timetable and other assumptions , Justice Frankel may have been reflecting the usual reluctance on the part of judges to be drawn into disputes with a major political component . Nor was it the first occasion where the NDP political agenda on the pipeline was at odds with legal , judicial and constitutional reality . He restricted the province to a single 15-page submission and a brief oral presentation , both confined to the narrow matters relevant to the case . Spearheading the move was Environment Minister Heyman , who celebrated that evening over dinner with a group of activists . Instead B.C. would ask the courts if the province has jurisdiction to regulate the movement of bitumen and if so , to what extent . For all the hand-wringing about increased tanker traffic , missing from the brief to the courts was any suggestion of regulating tankers . B.C. has neither the jurisdiction nor the practical ability to regulate shipping , conceded AG Eby . Likewise the province gave up on any notion of restricting existing shipments of bitumen , estimated at 22 million barrels of the stuff every year . It was that case drawing the cautionary response from the court earlier this week . All that is left in the tool box is asking the courts if the province can put reasonable restrictions on increased movement of bitumen by pipeline and rail . Even if the New Democrats win on that narrow front , their repeated overreaching of the case to date suggests it was more about pandering to their environmental wing than clarifying a legitimate jurisdictional issue .
