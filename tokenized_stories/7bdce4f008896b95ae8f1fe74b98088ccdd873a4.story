The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it rejected an application to allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to tunnel under Lake Oahe , a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River . The decision came after months of protests from Native Americans and climate activists , who argued that the 1,172-mile -LRB- 1,885-km -RRB- Dakota Access Pipeline would damage sacred lands and could contaminate the tribe 's water source . The mood has been upbeat since the rejection was announced on Sunday afternoon at the Oceti Sakowin camp in Cannon Ball , North Dakota . Activists were seen hugging and letting out war cries in response to the news . Still , with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump supportive of the project , activists worried a reversal of the decision could be in the offing . The camp 's numbers have swelled in recent days , as hundreds of U.S. veterans have flocked to North Dakota in support of the protesters . Some of those in a long line of traffic along Highway 1806 heading into the camp hollered and honked their horns after the news was announced . The pipeline , owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP , is complete except for a one-mile segment to run under Lake Oahe . That stretch required an easement from federal authorities . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it will analyze possible alternate routes , although any other route is also likely to cross the Missouri River . Trump has yet to react to Sunday 's decision . He could direct authorities to approve the line , even if before he takes over from Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20 federal authorities will be studying alternative routes . Tom Goldtooth , a Lakota from Minnesota , and a co-founder of Indigenous Environmental Network , said he expects Trump to try to reverse the decision . In November , ETP moved equipment to the edge of the Missouri River to prepare for drilling , and later asked a federal court to disregard the Army Corps , and declare that the company could finish the line . That ruling is still pending . Several veterans recently arrived in camp told Reuters they thought Sunday 's decision , which came just as Oceti Sakowin has seen an influx of service members , was a tactic to convince protesters to leave .
