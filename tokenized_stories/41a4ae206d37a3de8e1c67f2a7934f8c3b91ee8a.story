The Dakota Access pipeline developer said Monday , March 27 , that it has placed oil in the pipeline under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota and that it 's preparing to put the pipeline into service . The Dakota Access pipeline developer said Monday that it has placed oil in the pipeline under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota and that it 's preparing to put the pipeline into service . Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners made the announcement in a brief court filing with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia . The announcement marks a significant development in the long battle over the project that will move North Dakota oil 2000 miles -LRB- 1930 kilometers -RRB- through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois . The pipeline is three months behind schedule due to large protests and the objections of two American Indian tribes who say it threatens their water supply and cultural sites . ETP spokeswoman Vicki Granado said in an email to The Associated Press that the line will deliver oil to Patoka , Illinois , within a few weeks . Despite the announcement , the battle is n't over . The Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes still have an unresolved lawsuit that seeks to stop the project . The Standing Rock chairman did not immediately return a call seeking comment on ETP 's announcement . The tribes argue that a rupture in the section that crosses under Lake Oahe would threaten their water supply and sacred sites and would prevent them from practicing their religion , which requires clean water . The tribes in December held up the project by successfully pushing the U.S. government for a full environmental study of the Lake Oahe crossing , which is in southern North Dakota . But the Army Corps of Engineers , which manages the Missouri River for the government , rescinded the study and gave the company permission to complete the pipeline at the urging of President Donald Trump shortly after he took office . There were months of protests against the pipeline , mainly in North Dakota , where opponents set up a camp on Corps land between the Standing Rock Reservation and the pipeline route . At times it housed thousands of people , many of whom clashed with police , who made about 750 arrests between August and February . The on-the-ground protests waned after the Corps ordered the shutdown of the camp in February in advance of the spring flooding season . While the protests have abated , opposition has not . Authorities in South Dakota and Iowa confirmed that someone apparently used a torch to burn a hole through empty sections of the pipeline at aboveground shut-off valve sites . North Dakota has become the second-biggest oil producer in the U.S. in the past decade , trailing only Texas .
