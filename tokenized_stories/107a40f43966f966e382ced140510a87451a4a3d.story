by Lee Rowland 0 Comments Right-wing and hate-monger Ann Coulter . Without it , institutions of higher education can not truly be said to be preparing students for the world outside of the ivory tower . For many , a college campus is the last stop on the train to true adulthood . The Supreme Court has spilled barrels of ink defining the First Amendment rights of students , from kindergarten to post-graduate studies . But as students age , the shadows of the Constitution start to spread across the school day . Remarkably , Jackson was referring to grade school students , and the court rightly held that forcing patriotism on little ones was both unconstitutional and foolish . If we think inculcating constitutional values is important when kids are in K-12 , it should be nothing less than a core part of the curriculum at any college or university . Soon , your students will graduate . By constitutional design , ours is a world where homophobic street preachers have a right to accost you at a funeral for a loved one , where avowed racists can bring a Nazi rally to your town , where Congress has no right to criminalize appalling images of animal violence . I suspect that many students would like to be able to effectively counter-protest the Westboro Baptist Church . Or publicize and advocate against animal cruelty . Because we need them to tackle public policy issues with the confidence of a generation determined to better us all . That means being an advocate : speaking out and convincing others . Confronting , hearing , and countering offensive speech we disagree with is a skill . And one that should be considered a core requirement at any school worth its salt . But as students age , the shadows of the Constitution start to spread across the school day . To be clear , I am not suggesting that free speech is without grave costs . We fortunately have federal laws to ensure safe learning environments and equal access for all students . But being offended does not rise to that level . We live in an odd country , where the very First Amendment in our Bill of Rights protects hateful speech until it crosses that line . But that same First Amendment also protects the most heart-swelling markers of our democracy : the right to speak our values , to have a press free from censorship , to gather en masse in the streets and speak truth to power . In that regard , recent incidents suggest that colleges are fundamentally failing their students in imparting these skills . In just the past few weeks , from one campus to another and another and another , liberal students have silenced conservative speakers with violence , outrage , and threats . These incidents have not shut down a single bad idea . When you choose censorship as your substantive argument , you lose the debate . We need a next generation of students trained to take a deep breath , open their eyes , and change that world with their words and ideas . This is the world we cover .
