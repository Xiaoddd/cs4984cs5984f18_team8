Author : Kelly Hayes Publish date : Mar 13 , 2018 Fort Yates , North Dakota , September 2017 . -LRB- Illustration : Elias Stein -RRB- About two weeks before what would end up being my last trip to Standing Rock , I was a guest speaker for Indigenous Peoples Day at a Chicago school , where I explained to a group of about 80 fourth through eighth graders how Native youth had created an encampment to resist the Dakota Access Pipeline , and how that pipeline threatened to contaminate the drinking water of the Standing Rock Sioux . The students were excited to learn that there were children in the Standing Rock camps , and that the movement had been created by young people . At the end of our discussion , the children made blue , river-shaped banners bearing messages of hope and love for those on the front lines . I had planned to mail them to my friends in Standing Rock , but as fate would have it , I wound up hanging them myself , in one of the kitchen tents in Oceti Sakowin . Visit Website My health was lousy at the time , and I had promised my husband that my second trip to Standing Rock , just one month prior , would be my last for the year . But then , just before Halloween , police launched an assault , raiding one of the movement 's encampments and threatening others . Visit Website I knew I had to go back . Sacred Stone Village -LRB- in the background -RRB- was founded by LaDonna Bravebull Allard to carry the vision and energy of the Standing Rock camps forward through teaching young people about Native American history , culture , language , and ways of life . Larry Towell took the photograph of Oceti camp -LRB- in the foreground -RRB- in September of 2016 during the height of the controversy over the Dakota Access Pipeline . He returned one year later to witness a healing gathering at Sacred Stone Village and to document where the movement is headed . In the spring and summer of 2016 , a magnetic energy was born in Standing Rock . I had been there in the early days , when no more than a dozen tents dotted the shoreline encampment at Sacred Stone . One of the Native youth who launched the encampment had asked me to come lead some skill-shares on direct action and protest tactics . Native mothers , fathers , and young children crowded around me on that first visit as I explained the mechanics of a basic blockade . In all my years as an organizer and a direct-action trainer , I had never experienced such a space . Participants dancing at the Mni Wiconi -LRB- Water Is Life -RRB- Healing Gathering during the week of September 18th , 2017 , at Sacred Stone Village . The term Water Protector emerged as a descriptor for those holding space to stop the pipeline . It was a time of spectacular convergence . Centuries-old feuds between Native peoples were put aside , as once-hostile tribes joined the camps , bearing tobacco , firewood , and other gifts . The space was full of songs , history , and potential . From quiet , prayerful marches to complex lockdowns that halted construction equipment , a new chapter of our history was being written , in real time . For Native people , 2016 was a year of tension , hope , and action . The movement at its height was n't just inspiring , but life-giving . Then we experienced the effort 's final defeat . In 2017 , the camps were raided , the Dakota Access Pipeline was completed , and oil now flows through the Black Snake . A quiet moment by the fire at Sacred Stone Village . Native organizers sprang into action , arranging rides for hundreds of stranded Water Protectors who had a new task ahead : returning to their lives . Having neglected a great deal for the sake of the movement , some had little to return to . Defeat breeds anguish , and , in the wake of that dispersal , our people were hurting , emotionally and physically . Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder , brought on by militaristic police violence , worsened the ongoing threat of suicide among our young people . On the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation , moving on from the camps meant recovering from the closure of Backwater Bridge , which the Department of Transportation had shut down , citing structural concerns , in late October of 2016 , and which the sheriff did n't reopen until after the camps were fully evicted . The closure was enforced with a barricade against protesters , who police thought might try to halt pipeline construction , but it also functioned as an economic embargo against the Standing Rock Sioux . The closure added hours to local commutes , whether for work , food , or medicine . Decorating artist and activist Billy McMaster 's trailer at Sacred Stone Village . The North Dakota Private Investigative and Security Board filed a suit alleging that these tactics included sending undercover agents into the camps . As someone who was targeted by TigerSwan 's rent-a-spy surveillance , I can attest that their efforts contributed to an environment of paranoia and distrust . Some of those divisions remain firmly in place , along with other lasting effects from navigating strategic differences under harsh living conditions while law enforcement launched assaults for months on end . Nevertheless , our longstanding struggles persist , and new efforts continue to emerge . The Makwa Camp , positioned against Line 3 in Minnesota , has drawn hundreds of resistors who now call themselves Water Protectors . Standing Rock 's influence can also be found at Camp White Pine , where land defenders are resisting the Mariner East 2 pipeline in rural Huntingdon County , Pennsylvania . And along the Missouri River , as the fight to stop Keystone XL re-energizes , Native activists say they are carrying the lessons , skills , and tactics of the NoDAPL movement forward . Cheyenne activist and discussion leader Raymond Kingfisher -LRB- right -RRB- speaks to an audience at the Mni Wiconi Healing Gathering . We talked about Standing Rock , what it represented historically , and what it inspired . We talked about ongoing Native struggles , and the energy the movement had brought them . The students made signs and wrote messages of love and appreciation to Native activists . When Raniya , who made that sign , is old enough , there will be new fronts of resistance waiting to welcome her . My hope is that their chances for success will not be dampened by what ultimately happened in Standing Rock . Because whatever else happened in that space , our imaginations were re-armed . In a world that invisiblizes us , we were seen , and , for a moment , we held space together in common cause . An evening gathering at Sacred Stone Village . I believe that we can . Because in that first tiny camp , and in the massive convergence that followed , I saw what we 're made of . The completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline broke my heart , but I still believe in us . I believe we can build forward , and learn , and dream , about sovereignty , about ourselves , and about solidarity . We can decide who we are in relation to each other . Because we are not the words on TigerSwan 's security reports , or the factions that formed in camp . We are Native people , defined by no one else , and we need not waste another breath on wars our enemies would have us fight . It 's time to starve those fires of oxygen , and breathe life into the world we know is possible . We did n't stop the pipeline , but we did seize a page of history from those who would make us disappear . The movement in Standing Rock was a vision of ourselves , as Native people : imperfect , beautiful , alive in the face of colonialism , and still rising .
