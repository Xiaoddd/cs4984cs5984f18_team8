Published as is with no corrections and the original Danish below : Against the pipeline and its world On the morning of 20th november we burned a G4S vagon in Nordvest , Copenhagen . We did this as gesture of complicity to the spirit of the warriors defending their sacred lands against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . With this humble action we also want to send strength and love to all those who mourn the loss of the young warrior who died on his way to fight alongside Standing Rock . We mourn with you . G4S is a security company with a long history of part Danish ownership and they currently provide security for the construction of the pipeline after a series of arsons against the construction sites . We hope our message of solidarity with fire reaches you .
