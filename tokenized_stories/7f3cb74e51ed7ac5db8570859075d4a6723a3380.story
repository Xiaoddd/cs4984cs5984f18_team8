As the place slowly fills with people , the room becomes a beacon in the cold night , a bright light in a row of dim buildings , a convention of friends new and old , setting the stage for solidarity . September 4th , Dakota Access begins clearing ground for the pipeline , bulldozing over sacred sites and burials . Protesters are attacked by dogs and pepper sprayed . It took just under two weeks for Aurelio Villa Luna Diaz , Mark Sebastian Jordan , Kathy Fetzer-Goodwin to bring this event into the public eye , being touted in the local papers and drawing over a hundred contributors and participants . It even received threats , though none came to fruition . The K.E. McCarthy building was donated as a space for the show and by door time , all money spent on food , drink , and entrance would be sent to the Oceti Sakowin Camp . Mark Jordan opens the show as MC and performer and along with Jason Kauffman , Lucas Hargis , and Nate Weiland presents a spoken word piece -LRB- Pronouncement : An Invocation for the Standing Rock Benefit Concert -RRB- . This becomes the theme of the show , the different voices no longer silenced , but calling for an end to injustice . This is a shout for self-expression and for claiming a space in the land . The Sioux were granted this land in an 1851 treaty signed at Fort Laramie in Wyoming . When the U.S. Government tried to buy the land back , the Sioux would not accept payment . The easement granted by the U.S. Army Corps ignores this Treaty . The Morning After is the first band , a sloppy guitar and somewhat guttural , somewhat gravelly vocals , calling on a soused muse and a punk rock attitude . Jacob states his sadness at joining the military in order to fight for , to defend police brutality . She stands with a smile that convocates the absolutely mythic beauties she finds in the universe . Bill Baker gives an overview of peaceful resistance , and primes the crowd for the new fervor . Jai Marina follows adding her classically trained voice and fingerpicked guitar to the melange of speech . Where many of the artists were calm , Jason Kaufman lets the whole room know what rankles . In another poem , he blames President Obama for not halting the production of the pipeline himself . It damns , but hints at and imagines redemption . Together , their speech becomes muddled at one moment and sharp and clear and cutting in the next . However vague the metaphor , a clarity emerges that calls for interpretation and introspection . I follow , shaky-kneed , my first reading into a microphone . It was a different sound looking out from the stage . It is nothing to be afraid of , but rather , I want to do the crowd justice for their collective beauty . My speech , I must say , is timid . I hear the conversations of the crowd between my voice which seems to boom and hammer my ears from the P.A. I step down relieved to pats on the back that keep me blushing for days . Gratitude seems worth mentioning here . Great waves of it . Thunderous applause and a line of people patting each artist on the back as they leave . The beauty of this show lies not only in the performers , but the artists watching the performers , being involved in the performance . In fact , this place is filled with artists of one variety or another , some performing or showing their work , some merely respecting the spectacle , but all enamored by their peers . A young girl dances . To call it psychedelic would not do it justice . This is primal and it is cosmic . He wears a bird mask and strikes a walking stick on the ground to emphasize the important notes . The hula hoop spins in the background and listeners gather at his feet intently listening to his mythic words and emphatic voice . Sovroncourt plays next . He tells me he is singing to himself . His speech is for the listener . It is not to create the listener , to force one to listen , but to invite those willing to listen through the door . They embellish on the past , reimagining Tin Pan Alley with training in the classical and reimagining it on modern instruments . With such a complete understanding of music , The Trio plays with a wink and a nod to a hundred years of music and a sound that has not quite yet been replicated . If DAPL can go through and claim eminent domain on landowners and Native peoples on their own land , then we as sovereign nations can then declare eminent domain on our own aboriginal homeland . We are here to protect the burial sites here . The crowd dwindles and the last beers are bought , Man Made Bomb closes out the evening . They are loud , holding the stragglers in their swaying dances , keeping the sleepy alive for the last half hour . This is pretty good for a bunch of artists living at or around the poverty line . These are not the moneyed elite . These are the downtown shop owners , your baristas and bartenders , your servers and library workers . Even so , they emptied their pockets for a cause they believed in . But to hell with the money . The takeaway from the show is more than this . It is about the collective voice . In all the schisms formed by specific tastes in music and art , all the age gaps , and different visions , it is easy to forget that there are many of us who speak the same type of speeches , hope the same hopes , and believe in a better future for all beings . This is our land . It is there for us as an escape from the constant rush of life . It is a little slice of peace in the midst of almost constant war . We must protect it . Also a special thanks to Kathy Fetzer-Goodwin , Mark Jordan , Aurelio Villa Luna Diaz , and all the other donors and performers who made this show possible .
