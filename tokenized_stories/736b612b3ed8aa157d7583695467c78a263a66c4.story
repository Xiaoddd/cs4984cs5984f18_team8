Once there we will stand on the front lines in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in this fight . Donations will go towards renting the vehicle and covering gas , as well as helping with supplies for the camp . We will also be doing a donation drop at Bernie 's Coffee Shop on Wilshire Blvd this coming Thursday and Friday . Feel free to reach out for details . Please help us on our journey in whatever way you can by donating , dropping supplies or sharing this effort with your friends and families . If you would like to join this journey please let us know , we are still working out details on numbers of cars going . We 're heading to Standing Rock to help in the winterization of the camp and to document the arrival and actions of the thousands of veterans arriving this weekend . Along the way we bought a ton of things to help protect against the recent tactics of the Morton County Sherriffs . This includes emergency blankets and coagulant bandages , spray bottles for antacid , ponchos and rain gear , and waterproof matches . This will be for the medics at Standing Rock , as they are currently in small personal tents that are not winterized . Please try again . Sign in to track your impact .
