The Associated Press obtained the testimony in advance . Mahmoud also targeted the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , whose reservation lies near the pipeline 's route and who say the pipeline threatens their water supply and tribal artifacts . The pipeline developer reached out to the tribe more than two years ago but has been continually rebuffed , Mahmoud said . Mahmoud challenged the tribe 's objections and said the pipeline poses little threat to drinking water . The Dakota pipeline will be at least the 15th pipeline to cross the Missouri River , will employ state-of-the-art technology and will be buried more than 90 feet below the lowest part of the river , Mahmoud said . On Dec. 4 , then-assistant Army secretary for civil works , Jo-Ellen Darcy , declined to issue an easement , saying a broader environmental study was warranted . A federal judge on Monday refused to stop construction on the last stretch of the pipeline , which is progressing much faster than expected and could be operational as soon as next month . U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled that as long as oil is n't flowing through the pipeline , there is no imminent harm to the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River tribes , which are suing to stop the project . Another hearing is scheduled on Feb. 27 . Must be age 13 . All rights reserved . Weather data powered by Forecast .
