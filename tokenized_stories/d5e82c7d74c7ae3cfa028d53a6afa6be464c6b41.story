In an interview with the Omaha World-Herald published Tuesday , Kirchmeier predicted that the next flashpoint will come in Nebraska over the pending construction of the Keystone XL -LRB- KXL -RRB- tar sands pipeline . Throughout the months-long standoff in North Dakota , the sheriff 's office was repeatedly criticized for acting as a security force for pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners , as well as for routinely employing an excessive use of force against demonstrators . Police in riot gear attacked the water protectors with rubber bullets , water cannons , teargas grenades , and other weapons . In addition , military vehicles such as a BearCat and MRAPs were deployed , while protesters were monitored by helicopters and identification check-points . Since Trump 's State Department issued a permit last month for the portion of the pipeline that would run from tar sands fields in Alberta , Canada to existing pipelines in Steele City , Nebraska , opponents have been ramping up legal challenges and plans for non-violence resistance . And it seems that local law enforcement is also making preparations . Activist Jane Kleeb , who founded the organization Bold Nebraska that helped lead the original movement against KXL under former President Barack Obama , told Hammel that she is hopeful the project will not come to fruition , either because of the pending lawsuits or because it still needs approval from the Nebraskan government .
