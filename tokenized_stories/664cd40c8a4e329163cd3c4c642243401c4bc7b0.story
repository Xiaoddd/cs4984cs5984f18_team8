In the United States , the 1033 Program transfers excess military equipment to civilian law enforcement agencies . Some of the most commonly requested items include ammunition , cold weather clothing , sand bags , medical supplies , sleeping bags , flashlights and electrical wiring . Small arms and vehicles such as aircraft , watercraft and armored vehicles have also been obtained . The program has been criticized over the years by local media , by the Office of the Inspector General , U.S. Department of Defense in 2003 , and by the GAO which found waste , fraud and abuse . The ACLU and the NAACP have raised concerns about they call the militarization of police forces in the US . The War Assets Administration was the latest to operate and was abolished in 1949 . In October the DLA Disposition Services first released information about the equipment distribution by county . An inflection point occurred in the fall 2014 after several events brought increasing public scrutiny , and the eventual release of Federal records on the movement of military goods to civilian police forces was made public on November 21 , 2014 . The 1033 program is designed to specifically work with law enforcement agencies , like local police forces , school district police and others . The most commonly obtained item from the 1033 program is ammunition . The 1033 program also transfers office equipment such as fax machines , which many smaller police departments are unable to afford . Police departments are responsible for paying for shipment and storage of material acquired , but do not pay for the donation . The largest number of requests for material comes from small to mid-sized police departments who are unable to afford extra clothing , vehicles and weapons . The most popular military equipment acquired by colleges and universities through the 1033 program is the M16 . If colleges and universities seek to acquire material not obtainable directly through the 1033 program , like other local law enforcement agencies , they may purchase said equipment through federal grants allocated by the DOD . OversightEdit Law enforcement agencies must declare the intended use for each item , maintain an audit trail for each item and conduct inventory checks for DLA . In September 2014 , Senator Claire McCaskill organized the Senate 's first hearing on the program , and federal officials faced bipartisan criticism : Brian Kamoie , assistant administrator for grant programs at the Federal Emergency Management Agency , stated that officials are conducting a review to determine if police forces deployed in Ferguson improperly used equipment purchased with the grants for riot suppression , which is not allowed . Rear Admiral John Kirby , press secretary for the Pentagon , argued that the program has aided law enforcement across the US in counter-terrorism and counter-narcotic operation , and to protect civilians . The White House had not released results of its review , promised in September , when National Guard of the United States was deployed to Ferguson and further unrest occurred after the grand jury decision in Ferguson .
