The Trump era may echo that . By Jelani Cobb Illustration by Tom Bachtell On December 6th , less than a month after the election , Vice-President Joe Biden , who was in New York to receive the Robert F. Kennedy Ripple of Hope Award , for his decades of public service , used the occasion to urge Americans not to despair . And bad it was . So was Martin Luther King , Jr. . Riots erupted in more than a hundred cities , and violence broke out at the Democratic National Convention , in Chicago . The year closed with the hairbreadth victory of a law-and-order Presidential nominee whose Southern strategy of racial politicking remade the electoral map . Whatever innocence had survived the tumult of the five years since the murder of John F. Kennedy was gone . It was telling that Biden had to sift through nearly a half century of history to find a precedent for the current malaise among liberals and progressives , but the comparison was not entirely fitting . In 2016 , the Republicans won the White House , maintained control of both chambers of Congress , and secured the ability to create a conservative Supreme Court majority that could last a generation or more . Donald Trump , a man with minimal restraint , has been awarded maximal power . Last summer , the A.C.L.U. . In November , Trump tweeted that he would have won the popular vote but for millions of illegal ballots cast . This was not just a window into the conspiratorial and fantasist mind-set of the President-elect but a looming threat to voting rights . But , with a Republican majority that has mostly shown compliance with Trump , despite his contempt for the norms of democracy , the fear is that he will achieve much of what he wants . Even if he accomplishes only half , the landscape of American politics and policy will be radically altered . Movements are born in the moments when abstract principles become concrete concerns . MoveOn arose in response to what was perceived as the Republican congressional overreach that resulted in the impeachment of President Bill Clinton . The Occupy movement was a backlash to the financial crisis . The message of Black Lives Matter was inspired by the death of Trayvon Martin and the unrest in Ferguson , Missouri . Last July , when the Army Corps of Engineers gave final approval for the completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline , members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , anxious that the pipeline would threaten their water supply , started an online petition and filed a lawsuit to halt construction . On December 4th , the Army Corps announced that it would look for an alternate route . In that context , the waves of protests in Portland , Los Angeles , Oakland , New York , Chicago , and Washington , D.C. , in the days after the election look less like spontaneous outrage and more like a preview of what the next four years may hold . Unlike the specific protests that emerged during the Obama Administration , the post-election demonstrations have been directed at the general state of American democracy . The first Inauguration of George W. Bush , in 2001 , saw mass protests driven by the sentiment that the election had been stolen . The protests that greet Trump will , in all probability , exceed them : some twenty other groups have also applied for march permits . Given his history with African-Americans , Muslims , Latinos , immigrants , unionized labor , environmentalists , and people with disabilities , it is not hard to imagine that there will be many more to come .

Given his history with African-Americans , Muslims , Latinos , immigrants , unionized labor , environmentalists , and people with disabilities , it is not hard to imagine that there will be many more to come . He writes frequently about race , politics , history , and culture . He shuffled gamely after her . Backstage , he gravely smoothed his lapels , now a matter of concern . At fifty , with graying whiskers and a broad , lonely face , he has the soulful air of a sepia-era frontiersman . he wondered . But his films are nakedly personal . Flinty , funny , stylish , and mannish , a blend of Amelia Earhart and Humphrey Bogart , Dorothea adores Jamie , but her Depression-era rigor precludes her saying so . As he gravitates to skateboarding and Iggy Pop , she enlists two much younger women to help teach him how to be a good man . wife , Miranda July , a writer and filmmaker with the steely fragility of a Buster Keaton , once anatomized guys like Mills in a short story . Making a movie is as close as Mills can get . views himself as an outsider , a borderline recluse , but his sweet-natured , Eeyoreish manner disarms almost everyone . While his stance is one of self-deprecating bewilderment , he is also often genuinely bewildered . the festival , Mills stood in the hallway as his film played , listening through a closed door . Waves of laughter made him crack the door . went outside in the drizzle to call July , just to hear her voice . Then he sneaked into the back of the theatre for the last twenty minutes . He pulled Mills into a bear hug and murmured plaudits into his ear . He filled being a movie star with doubt and befuddlement . He rejects even the customary reliance on an eventful plot . Their stories are accompanied by montages of period photos intended to create an air of credence . his mother , Mills became a parent late in life , and his son , Hopper , spent time in the neonatal ward . Mills has some photographs of her smiling at him as a toddler , but the smiles faded once he could talk back . When he was a boy , they were like a couple , he said : she took him to museum openings as her date , and she was often beguiling . died of cancer in 1999 . He wants to mine the gap between what we know and what the characters know . Dorothea is thrilled by his candor , some of the others scoff , and Jamie silently registers the moment . Carter , punk , and the expansive cultural impulse that brought this random family together are about to be supplanted by the Reagan era . We know how fateful the occasion is . The photographer Richard Verdi and his wife , Mindi , looked on . In the late seventies , Verdi chronicled the punk scene at CBGB with a Leica , capturing the jagged , fleeting defiance . Mills followed her to New York in 1984 , to study art at Cooper Union . Mills winced . His detractors accuse him of excessive charm , but it may be more accurate to say that he edits brutality from his world view . teen-age rebellion was less defiant than exploratory . His parents , with no sense of their designated role as oppressors , let his punk band practice in their house . He became a mainstay of the D.I.Y. scene around the Alleged Gallery , on the Lower East Side , where Shepard Fairey and Ed Templeton , self-taught artists who prized feeling over technique , drank forty-ounce Budweisers and skateboarded out front . His relationship with nostalgia is complex . He began by shooting music videos . moving to Los Angeles , in 1999 , Mills co-founded a commercial-production company , called the Directors Bureau . Volkswagen and Nike wanted his pawky sensibility , up to a point . Mills was shocked that it was so evident . It was an ambitious attempt to braid two stories , set in two periods : 1997 to 2002 , when Oliver -LRB- Ewan McGregor -RRB- and his father , Hal -LRB- Christopher Plummer -RRB- , belatedly get to know each other ; and 2003 , after Hal dies , when the grieving Oliver tries to establish a relationship with a French actress named Anna -LRB- Melanie Laurent -RRB- . Mills believed that sorrow had made his work stronger and stranger . To get the film financed , he ended up throwing in his fee . And he had Plummer shop for a scarf with McGregor and supervise him as he made a bed . Mills met Miranda July , at a noisy bar at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival , she was wearing a Mickey Mouse sweatshirt and leather pants . So it was a no-brainer . Both were seekers of buoyancy . But she decided that he was , after all , an artist . connects Mills and July is the failure of connection . stood on Miramar Beach , in Santa Barbara , squinting worriedly as perfect waves rolled in . When he was six , his mother began encouraging him to get out of the house , telling him to be home by suppertime . The place was snugly feral , lacquered with graffiti , some of it added during shooting . For two and a half years , he labored on a script . set , Mills is his best self : assured , curious , generous . He brought in Buddhist monks to bless the cast and crew , and a cellist to play during rehearsals . He sent a file of that version to July . But maybe it was never really like that again . He wanted to spend less on his films and make just enough to keep making them . He laughed . Now I try to do two ads a year , so I can earn the hundred and fifty thousand dollars I need to pay for my life . He was exhilarated until he woke up . He laughed . Watching Hopper , so nice , giving his lunch money to other kids , I think I was a little like that . and Hopper ambled into the back yard to sweep up fallen olive leaves . a candid woman in her early thirties , had a slightly different take . Mills said . childhood suffuses his work . childhood suffuses his work . A conversation was playing in my mind , with a research colleague who questioned whether we had sufficient data to go ahead and publish . The results were already solid , I answered . I converse with friends and family members , tell myself jokes , replay dialogue from the past . She very rarely has inner conversations ; the one instance is when she reminds herself to do something , like change her e-mail password . His book offers a chatty , somewhat inconclusive tour of the subject , making a case for the role of inner speech in memory , sports performance , religious revelation , psychotherapy , and literary fiction . experimental work on voice-hearing , Fernyhough describes a protocol devised by Russell Hurlburt , a psychologist at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas . A subject wears an earpiece and a beeper sounds at random intervals . As soon as the person hears the beep , she jots notes about what was in her mind at that moment . For some , it was a full back-and-forth conversation , for others a more condensed script of short phrases or keywords . The results of another study suggest that , on average , about twenty to twenty-five per cent of the waking day is spent in self-talk . Naturally , the scan showed activity in parts of the left hemisphere associated with language . Among the other brain regions that were activated , however , were some associated with our interactions with other people . Experimental psychology focusses on things that can be studied in laboratory situations and can yield clear , reproducible results . Being prompted to enter into an inner dialogue in an fMRI machine is not the same as spontaneously debating with oneself at the kitchen table . Fernyhough has built up an interesting picture of inner speech and its functions . It certainly seems to be important in memory , and not merely the mnemonic recitation of lists , to which my wife and many others resort . I sometimes replay childhood conversations with my father , long deceased . I conjure his voice and respond to it , preserving his presence in my life . Inner speech may participate in reasoning about right and wrong by constructing point-counterpoint situations in our minds . speech could also serve as a safety mechanism . Negative emotions may be easier to cope with when channelled into words spoken to ourselves . Indeed , a mainstream strategy in cognitive behavioral therapy involves purposefully articulating thoughts to oneself in order to diminish pernicious habits of mind . behavioral therapy also harnesses the effectiveness of verbalizing positive thoughts . Many athletes talk to themselves as a way of enhancing performance ; Andy Murray yells at himself during tennis matches . The potential benefits of this have some experimental support . In 2008 , Greek researchers randomly assigned tennis players to one of two groups . The second group got a tactical lecture on the use of particular shots . He speaks individually to Adam , Eve , Cain , Noah , and Abraham . But in later prophetic books the divine voice grows quieter . Elijah , on Mt. Especially in evangelical traditions , it has persisted . Martin Luther King , Jr. , recounted an experience of it in the early days of the bus boycott in Montgomery , in 1956 . After receiving a threatening anonymous phone call , he went in despair into his kitchen and prayed . relates some arresting instances of conversations with God and other celestial powers that occurred during the Middle Ages . In fifteenth-century France , Joan of Arc testified to hearing angels and saints tell her to lead the French Army in rescuing her country from English domination . The voice of Jesus gave her advice for negotiating a deal with her frustrated and worried husband . Fernyhough writes imaginatively about the various registers of voice she hears . People perceived the utterances of the right hemisphere as being external to them and attributed them to gods . They have no conscious minds such as we say we have , and certainly no introspections . When Agamemnon , king of men , robs Achilles of his mistress , it is a god that grabs Achilles by his yellow hair and warns him not to strike Agamemnon . It is one god who makes Achilles promise not to go into battle , another who urges him to go , and another who then clothes him in a golden fire reaching up to heaven and screams through his throat across the bloodied trench at the Trojans , rousing in them ungovernable panic . believed that the development of nerve fibres connecting the two hemispheres gradually integrated brain function . Following a theory of Homeric authorship that assumed the Odyssey to have been composed at least a century after the Iliad , he pointed out that Odysseus , who is constantly reflecting and planning , manifests a self-consciousness of mind . book was hugely influential in its day , one of those rare specialist works whose ideas enter the culture at large . In evolutionary time , the few thousand years that separate us from Achilles are a blink of an eye , far too short to allow for such radical structural changes in the brain . Contemporary neurologists offer alternative explanations for hearing celestial speech . Some speculate that it represents temporal-lobe epilepsy , others schizophrenia ; auditory hallucinations are common in both conditions . They are also a feature of degenerative neurological diseases . I asked . his unwillingness to draw a clear line between normal perceptions and delusions , Fernyhough follows ideas popularized by a range of groups that have emerged in the past three decades known as the Hearing Voices Movement . In 1987 , a Dutch psychiatrist , Marius Romme , was treating a patient named Patsy Hage , who heard malign voices . But Hage insisted that her voice-hearing was a valid mode of thought . Not coincidentally , she was familiar with the work of Julian Jaynes . The pair started to publicize the condition , asking other voice-hearers to be in touch . The movement grew from there . It currently has networks in twenty-four countries , with more than a hundred and eighty groups in the United Kingdom alone , and its membership is growing in the United States . They want it to be seen as a normal variation in human nature . Their arguments are in part about who controls the interpretation of such experiences . Critics point out that , while depathologizing voice-hearing may feel liberating for some , it entails a risk that people with serious mental illnesses will not receive appropriate care . Ninety-one writers attending the 2014 Edinburgh International Book Festival responded to a questionnaire ; seventy per cent said that they heard characters speak . Several writers linked the speech of their characters to inner dialogues even when they are not actively writing . If the result is great literature , it would be perverse to judge hearing voices an aberration requiring treatment rather than a precious gift . Even leaving aside the fact that most people with mood disorders are not creative geniuses , many writers find their creative talent psychologically troublesome , and even prize an idea of themselves as , in some sense , abnormal . A patient had arrived by ambulance from McLean Hospital , a famous psychiatric institution in nearby Belmont . Sitting bolt upright , laboring to breathe , was the poet Robert Lowell . I introduced myself and performed a physical examination . Lowell was in congestive heart failure , his lungs filling with fluid . I administered diuretics and fitted an oxygen tube to his nostrils . Soon he was breathing comfortably . He seemed sullen and , to distract him from his predicament , I asked about a medallion that hung from a chain around his neck . In Achilles , Lowell seemed to find a heroic reflection of his own mental volatility . Lowell , too , suffered from auditory hallucinations . The intertwining of madness and genius remains an essential part of his posthumous legend , and Lowell himself saw the two as related . Jamison also shows that Lowell sometimes saw his episodes of manic inspiration in a more coldly medical light . was discharged from Mass General on February 9th . Later that month , Lowell had recovered sufficiently to travel to New York and do a reading with Allen Ginsberg . Groopman , a staff writer since 1998 , writes primarily about medicine and biology . He holds the Dina and Raphael Recanati Chair of Medicine at the Harvard Medical School and is the chief of experimental medicine at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center . His research has focussed on the basic mechanisms of cancer and AIDS . He has been a major participant in the development of many AIDS-related therapies , including protease inhibitors , and he is active in regional and national education activities in AIDS and cancer medicine , as well as in the training and education of young scientists in these fields . Recently , he has extended the research infrastructure in genetics and cell biology to studies in lymphoma , myelodysplasia , and leukemia . He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies . attractions the 1975 , a British rock band , holds for its many fans , a shared interest in the year 1975 is probably not among them . Healy wore a long wool coat , a red sweater with white rose patterns on it , and different-colored socks . Choosing a table in the corner , he explained how he goes about this delicate task . He brought his palms together piously . He sipped his English breakfast tea . twisted a strand of his long dark hair , which was worn in an asparagus-going-to-seed style on top of his head . The nominations had come out that morning , and the 1975 was nominated for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package , but not for its music . turned into the former CBGB , on Bowery , now a John Varvatos store . He had never been inside before . peered at a shot of the Sex Pistols performing in 1976 .

The figure may curdle the dish , unless he appears at first to be a joke , a clown , or a total idiot . the mixture to congeal into a malignant orange mass , and let it stew in the pot for several months , heating the populace with racist rhetoric . This recipe calls specifically for Islamic terrorism . But , if you do have a taste for it , you can spice up the dish with a pinch of ass , a small handful of pussy , a smear of telling a candidate who has spent forty years in public service that she looks tired , or a scant cup of sexual-assault accusers paraded around as human shields on live TV . this point , everything may begin to boil over . Common sense would call for lowering the temperature , but that would obscure the full , rich -LRB- or ostensibly rich , but who really knows without tax returns -RRB- flavor . To prevent progressives from sticking together , whisk some yolks into the mix . she been born in a different era , Becky thought , and without the education to qualify as a governess , she might have become a wet nurse , offering nourishment in the most mindless form to an infant from a wealthy family . The man next to Becky leaned over so that she alone could hear this confession . She nodded . To be a wet nurse one had to be a mother first . The woman who was taking the podium was the director of this freshly remodelled San Francisco museum . It was terrible of her to seek connections that allowed her to feel closer to her son . Jude was six , and was being seen by two specialists four afternoons a week . man in the red tie said something , and Becky , not catching the words , nodded in confirmation . She would note that the man had reminded her of SpongeBob . Soon his face and his voice would fade from her memory ; only the red tie and his words would remain . The children , too , were mirrors for one another , though they , inward-looking , did not seek solace from those caught in the same situation . Becky had thought about inviting the girl over for Christmas Eve . looked past the SpongeBob man at the nearest painting , a splash of colors that she found both familiar and exhausting . Seeing a painting in a museum and making an effort to understand it was enough of a responsibility . Owning it would be too much . Owning it would be like inheriting a tree , being accountable for its existence even after the person who planted it had vanished . Yet a tree you can cut down with a permit and a reliable crew . woman finished her speech , and people milled about with a purposefulness that felt amiss to Becky . She raised her champagne flute to look at them through the bubbles , and their perfect social demeanor became less impressive . Perhaps that was how the world appeared to Jude , none of its inhabitants as engaging as a cluster of rising bubbles . But Jude might never find himself at an event like this . asked Jude , who was not mute at home and was especially articulate when he was alone with Becky . She had been talking about soccer club and Little League and the birthday parties to which he was invited , because everyone was invited at that age . These are the things people usually enjoy , she said , and you may feel sad if you miss them . I find little amusement in them . Dots and squiggly lines , he said . man approached Becky . Even a banal conversation was a relief from a masterpiece staring back in silence , and she was ready to be saved . The man , wearing a plaid hat and a plaid jacket , appeared out of place among the dark suits and festive dresses . He asked Becky if she liked the painter , and she shook her head noncommittally . noticed his accent , the kind its owner would not hide , each word hanging on to the lips with a demure graciousness . Years ago , when Becky had been a work-study student in a research lab , she had overheard her manager tell a visiting foreign scholar that people in the Midwest did not have any accent . Mainstream American English , she said , which made Becky feel bland and transparent . Recently , while Becky was waiting for jury duty , a woman had told her that she was originally from Spain and was a linguistics professor but that at a summer party she had gone to with her sister and brother-in-law no one would talk to her : she had walked in with a nephew in her arms and a niece clutching her sleeve . They thought I was the nanny , the woman said . My sister , of course , my gorgeous sister with her handsome husband , she was in no hurry to correct the misunderstanding . mean , if someone owned it . man looked at Becky . could have been a suitable conversation partner for this man . She was the second one they had consulted ; the first had been unable to get Jude to speak . Perhaps there was hope still . asked her if she was an artist . No , she said . He took a pipe out of his pocket and said he had dallied in a few things here and there but nothing too special . Becky was about to point out that smoking was not allowed when he put the pipe back . Becky thought . Perhaps others would have recognized him right away from his outfit . tied up at the moment . Another engagement . He took the pipe out again and toyed with it . Matisse is under the weather , so he may not look himself tonight . She suspected that Ossie Gulliver was a made-up name . Still , a named man would claim more personal space than a man in a red tie . It could become an affair . Becky still had his business card , and with the pretense of hiring him for an event she could make a call . was a good woman , and it required little talent to be good . Before she and Max moved to California , she had worked in a hospital in Sioux City as a float-pool nurse , a well-liked colleague . She was close to her three brothers , who still lived in Correctionville . Becky , the only one who had left , returned twice a year , for a family reunion in the first week of August and at Thanksgiving . Becky thought of herself as one of those folktale misers , never letting a person slip out of her life . No parent could do that for a child , Max reminded her . He believed in science , intervention , and his will power as a father . Max did not ask , as Becky did , what had gone wrong with her pregnancy ; nor did he waste his energy , whenever there was a mass shooting , worrying that it would be linked to a young man on the autism spectrum . that was the talent Becky was missing : she wanted a comprehensible life , but she did not comprehend her life . She could not begin an affair because it required imagination . She could not understand Jude because her mind was too commonplace . Becky had to Google to get the sentence right . She remembered Mr. Hagen , her English teacher , talking at length about that Vonnegut line in high school . Read it ten , twenty years from now , he had told the class . Lance was the tallest boy in her junior year , and she imagined that Harrison Bergeron would look like Lance . What was not fair was that Jude had Becky , who was so normal , as his mother . A woman capable of having an affair with Ossie Gulliver would be a better choice , a mother who would rearrange the world for Jude . Gulliver , a stranger she refused to put in her journal , stayed on in her memory . People around her were like lights in a house : the more , the merrier ; the more , the less space left unlit . Becky decided to visit Vivien by herself first . She needed all the evidence to show that they did what they could for Jude . lived on a street lined with one-story , boxy houses , battered pickup trucks , older-model cars , and several dogs that barked from behind metal fences . Becky was not familiar with this part of Oakland , and she felt that she should reproach herself for noticing these things . Roads in Correctionville were wider , houses larger , but people in her current neighborhood , a picturesque suburb overlooking the Bay , would find Correctionville strange , too . The living room was small , with two armchairs and a sofa around a coffee table . A picture window showed a patch of front yard large enough to accommodate a single agave plant . Another woman was sitting on the sofa , so Becky took an armchair . Becky was going to decline , but the old woman said that they were sweet , and she and Vivien had more than they could eat . The thought of letting the plums rot made Becky feel guilty . She chose a medium-sized one . She had a lunch pail of dollar bills next to her . Becky watched her fold the bills into intricate patterns . Money leis , she said when she noticed Becky watching , and explained that she sold them at graduations . mother sat with an erect back in another armchair , her creased face showing little acknowledgment of the conversation . All she knew was that the old woman had raised a musician . They were set in the corners of the living room . The overpowering feeling that any second you may suddenly appear . People stop and stare . Becky been a sentimental woman she would have wept . For Jude and William and children like them , love songs were another measure of their apartness from the world . A month earlier , Jude and his classmates had been asked to write about their fears . It was not fair that her son did not live with only some minor fears . Still , always , forever . That a person who expressed no interest in people could live with such a yearning for them ; that a paramount fear of being alone could drive him away from the world . Becky could have empathized if this fear came from traumas , the kinds that she read about in magazines and saw on movie screens . But Jude had been born to a pair of dedicated parents . Of course , children like William and Jude were the loneliest people in the world . Parents like Becky and Max visited therapists , discussed treatments , formed support groups , but they did this only because they could not understand . They , with their limited imaginations , wanted to change their children . Vandalism , Ossie Gulliver had said in front of the Jackson Pollock painting . William walked out of the studio , his moon-shaped face expressionless , his mother put a newly made lei around his neck . She was about to get into her car when a man , who seemed to have come from nowhere , grabbed her purse . She had been one of the top cross-country runners at her high school . The man turned the corner , his dark pants too loose for him to run efficiently . In no time she would overtake him , and she could sense the exhilaration she used to feel , making the final sprint toward the finish line . Becky said . man did not look menacing , yet she had to believe him . put the Moleskine on the curb next to him and backed away . would never read the journal . It was silly to risk her life for the journal , anyone would say . thief was out of sight . Becky thought of calling Max and asking him to cancel the credit cards , and realized that the man had got away with her phone , too . That evening they would find out that he charged more than two thousand dollars , buying gift cards and a can of soda in a nearby drugstore . whatever they did , they could never free Jude from his fear of being alone . This Max did not understand . There were other things that he did not understand . Max could have married June Landry , another float-pool nurse , who would be tending to their dinner now . But Becky had not hesitated to say yes when Max proposed . They had dated long enough to think of themselves as being in love . She could be contentedly married to any reasonable man : that had been a comforting thought during their engagement . He could be happily married to any capable woman : that was a comforting thought in their marriage . For these comforts , Jude must have been given to her as a punishment . No , no , Becky told herself , shuddering violently . noticed the shaking of her hands as she drove away . An affair with Ossie Gulliver , like being a wet nurse , was only a fantasy of infidelity . next street she turned onto , an overpass above the freeway , was blocked by traffic . Many people had got out of their vehicles . Becky did , too . There must have been an accident . Perhaps what made most people different from Jude was their cowardice . On the next overpass , a similar crowd had gathered : a man was standing outside the railing , on the edge . Fire engines , ambulances , and police cars blinked below . A giant ladder had been set up , and two police officers were climbing it . People on both overpasses raised their cell phones . Good thing they caught him before he jumped , someone said . moment of crisis , a moment of near-catastrophe . But when the man was subdued and moved into the ambulance the excitement quickly fizzled out . People dispersed . It was then that Becky noticed the man who had robbed her . returned to her car . It occurred to her that she could flag down a policeman , but she was exhausted , and saw little point in prolonging the day . People would tell him that he had many reasons to live ; they would not accept it if he said that he had many reasons for wanting to die . The only option was to blunder on through hoping . For that reason , Becky would keep telling Jude that it was good to make eye contact , to engage in conversation , to talk about his feelings , to make connections with the world . spirit of that diaspora cuisine lives at Spice Symphony , a compact , cacophonous canteen near Curry Hill . But not everything on the menu polarizes . To the uninitiated , the Paneer Chili Dry , an unintuitive pairing of chili and cheese , may seem dangerously ill-advised , until you realize that strips of fried cottage cheese could not find a more winning foil than the sweet , hot tang of chili and ginger . On a recent Thursday evening , a table of overzealous patrons decided to order everything they found suspect , with varying degrees of success . The spinach chaat is perfect for anyone who is indifferent to the vegetable but enamored of the texture of waffle fries . everything pleased everyone , but the table began to resemble a Thanksgiving spread : there was way too much food , but that was to be expected . Plaza , 182 Lexington Ave. 212 Rome Street , in Newark , New Jersey , used to be the address of Grammer , Dempsey & Hudson , a steel-supply company . It was like a lumberyard for steel , which it bought in bulk from distant mills and distributed in smaller amounts , mostly to customers within a hundred-mile radius of Newark . It sold off its assets in 2008 and later shut down . In 2015 , a new indoor-agriculture company called AeroFarms leased the property . It had the rusting corrugated-steel exterior torn down and a new building erected on the old frame . Then it filled nearly seventy thousand square feet of floor space with what is called a vertical farm . Dempsey & Hudson was founded in 1929 . Its workers were members of the Teamsters Union , whose stance could be aggressive . Despite the union , the company and its employees got along amicably , and many of them worked there all their lives . Men moved steel plate and I-beams with cranes that ran on tracks in the floor . Trucks pulled up to the loading bays and loaded or unloaded , coming and going through the streets of Newark , past the scrap-metal yards and chemical plants and breweries . In an average year , Grammer , Dempsey & Hudson shipped about twenty thousand tons of steel . She is a slim , widely smiling woman with shoulder-length dreads who dresses in Michelle Obama blues , blacks , and whites . Through it she met many people , including a woman who is a financial expert and helps local residents with their budgets . After the speeches , she stayed to congratulate her friend and also introduced herself to Rosenberg . He asked her if she was looking for a job . In fact , it is a key to the story , and it figures in the larger picture of vertical farming worldwide and of indoor agriculture in general . Harwood is a sixty-six-year-old man of medium stature who speaks with the kind of rural accent that sometimes drops the last letters of words . One of the first inventions he worked on was a method to determine when a cow is in estrus . Harwood helped develop a cow ankle bracelet that transmitted data on how active the cow was each day ; the farmer could then consult the data on his computer and know when it was time for the artificial inseminator . To check the accuracy of the bracelet , Harwood spent days walking around the pasture beside a cow with his hand on her back while he counted her steps . first became interested in growing crops indoors in the two-thousand-aughts . Around 2003 , his notebooks and diaries began to converge on ideas about how he could raise crops without soil , sunlight , or large amounts of water . Aeroponic farming uses about seventy per cent less water than hydroponic farming , which grows plants in water ; hydroponic farming uses seventy per cent less water than regular farming . solved the problem of the crop-growing medium by substituting cloth for soil . Finally , he settled on an artificial fabric that he created himself out of fibres from recycled plastic water bottles , and he patented it . The fabric is a thin white fleece that holds the seeds as they germinate , then keeps the plants upright as they mature . The knock on aeroponics had always been that the nozzles clogged . He has no patent for his new nozzle . I have no fear of anyone copying it . rented an empty canoe factory in Ithaca and set up a two-level grow tower a hundred feet long and five feet wide to employ his new discoveries , along with a light system that eventually consisted of L.E.D. lights modified to his needs . He had decided to grow commercial crops and chose baby salad greens . His financial situation , never robust , then took an upturn when an investor offered funding on the condition that he concentrate on selling the grow towers themselves , rather than the greens . Switching to that business model , Harwood formed a new company called Aero Farm Systems . He leased a number of his grow towers and sold a few . One of them went to Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , and he has no idea what happened to it . It refers to a method of growing crops , usually without soil or natural light , in beds stacked vertically inside a controlled-environment building . other words , plants create themselves partly out of thin air . Salad greens are about ninety per cent water . About half of the remaining ten per cent is carbon . lives in Fort Lee , New Jersey , and not long after his lecture I visited him at his apartment , in a high-rise with a skyline view of New York . He is a cheerful , demonstrative man , seventy-six years old , with a short gray beard and a mobile face . The concept of vertical farming came from a class he taught in medical ecology , he said . Finally , they determined that by farming every square foot of rooftop space in the city you could provide enough calories to feed only about two per cent of the 2050 population of New York . As the couple drove back and forth along the West Side Highway , Despommier considered the light-filled glass-and-steel structures , and that got him thinking about the thousands of abandoned buildings throughout the city . possibilities that opened up put stars in his eyes . Agricultural runoff is the main cause of pollution in the oceans ; vertical farms produce no runoff . All over the world , croplands have been degraded or are disappearing . Vertical farming can allow former cropland to go back to nature and reverse the plundering of the earth . Despommier began to give talks and get noticed . He became the original vertical-farming proselytizer . Two more were in the planning stages in the U.S. I gave a talk in Korea in 2009 , and they invited me back two years later . Fifty reporters were waiting for me . AeroFarms is one of the largest . Usually the main crop is baby salad greens , whose premium price , as Ed Harwood realized , makes the enterprise attractive . The willingness of a certain kind of customer to pay a lot for salad justifies the investment , and after the greens get the business up and running its technology will be adapted for other crops , eventually feeding the world or a major fraction of it . occupies three other buildings in Newark aside from the main vertical farm , on Rome Street . At 400 Ferry Street , it has a thirty-thousand-square-foot space whose most recent previous use was as a paintball and laser-tag entertainment center called Inferno Limits . The graffiti-type spray-painted murals and stylized paintball splatters of that incarnation still cover the walls . Technicians in white coats who wear white sanitary mobcaps on their heads walk around quietly . Some of these workers are young guys who also have mobcaps on their beards . The salad greens , when you put on coat and mobcap yourself and get close enough to peer into the trays , stand in orderly ranks by the thousands , whole vast armies of little watercresses , arugulas , and kales waiting to be harvested and sold . Employees are distributed in more or less open spaces here and there . In a dim corner of the area with the vertical farm , where the fresh , florist-shop aroma of chlorophyll is strong , young graduates of prestigious colleges confab around laptop screens that show photos of currently germinating seeds and growing leaves . Folding tables burgeon with cables , clipboards , and fast-food impedimenta . David Rosenberg , the C.E.O. , who hired Ingrid Williams last year , is the boss . He wore dark jeans , a blue-and-white plaid shirt with the AeroFarms logo on the breast pocket , and running shoes . In past years , he used to fence competitively and win championships . He is forty-four , tall , and still fit , with close-shaved black hair and dark , soulful eyes . The quietness and patience with which he speaks can be disconcerting . He grew up in the Bronx , went to U.N.C. at Chapel Hill , and got an M.B.A. from Columbia in 2002 . AeroFarms is not his first company . When his grandfather Michael Rhodes , a chemist , died , in 2002 , a relative told Rosenberg about a molecule that his grandfather had created that could be used to make a weatherizing treatment for concrete . With his fellow business-school alumnus and fellow-fencer Marc Oshima , he set about researching the latest indoor agricultural technology . When they learned about the work of Ed Harwood , they immediately got in touch with him . Harwood had the trademark on the name Aero Farm Systems . They proposed to him that the two companies merge and do business under the name of AeroFarms . Rosenberg would be the chief executive officer , Oshima the chief marketing officer , and Harwood the chief science officer . It would build the vertical-farm systems but not sell them , grow baby greens commercially , and scale the operation up gigantically . This change in fortunes left Harwood thunderstruck . During the winter months , some production moves to similar fields in Arizona or goes even farther south , into Mexico . At the moment , the greens can be purchased retail only at two ShopRite supermarkets , one on Springfield Avenue in Newark and the other on Broad Street in Bloomfield . ounces instead of five . The company plans to have its greens on the shelves soon at Whole Foods stores and Kings , also in the local area . Greens that come from California ride in trucks for days . Then she picked up a clamshell of Fresh Attitude arugula and dropped it in her cart . I asked her if she knew that AeroFarms was grown in Newark . I told her the arugula was indeed Newark-grown and explained about the vertical farm . She put the out-of-state arugula back , picked up the Newark arugula , and thanked me for telling her . I think AeroFarms does not play up Newark enough on the packaging . AeroFarms chose Newark because of its convenient location and the relative cheapness of its real estate . City and state development agencies encouraged the decision , and the company has hired about sixty blue-collar workers from Newark , some of them from a program for past offenders . The technology it uses derives partly from systems designed to grow crops on the moon . The interior space is its own sealed-off world ; nothing inside the vertical-farm buildings is uncontrolled . Countless algorithm-driven computer commands combine to induce the greens to grow , night and day , so that a crop can go from seed to shoot to harvest in eighteen days . Their radiance has been stripped of the heat-producing part of the spectrum , the most expensive part of it from an energy point of view . In row after row , the L.E.D.s shining these colors call to mind strings of Christmas lights . short , each plant grows at the pinnacle of a trembling heap of tightly focussed and hypersensitive data . many of the hundred-plus employees seem to be diffused throughout the enterprise and most vividly present in cyberspace , everybody gathers sometimes in the headquarters building for a buffet-style lunch , at which Rosenberg makes a short speech . We have to be the best total farmers . And to do all this we need the best data . If the data is not current and completely reliable , we will fail . The invention sits in a corner of the cafeteria by the round lunch tables and the molded black plastic cafeteria chairs , an improbable-looking teaching tool . dimensions are five feet wide by twelve feet long by six and a half feet high . Essentially , it consists of two horizontal trays of thick plastic , both about ten inches deep , one above the other , suspended in a strong but minimal framework of aluminum . Below the trays , at floor level , a plastic tank holds two hundred and fifty gallons of water . Frames like those used for window screens fit on top of the plastic trays . The cloth is attached to the frame by snaps . The spray hits the bottom of the tray and bounces up , and some of it becomes the mist that nourishes the roots growing through the cloths . speckle the white surface of the cloth . The L.E.D. lights above the trays shine on the seeds . They germinate , and soon the roots descend . Seedlings grow . In about three weeks , the plants are ready for harvesting . The trays are taken out and the leaves are cut off and given to the cafeteria staff , who put them in the salad bar . the mini-farm , PVC pipes and wires run here and there , connecting to clamps and switches . teacher who keeps all this machinery in good order is Catkin Flowers . That is her real given name . I think the farm is the reason our science scores are so competitive in the state . We get the kids involved in running the grow cycles and then solving the problems that inevitably come up . They want to find out how they taste . another morning , I stayed for lunch . professor , on a tour of the school . He has worked for famous restaurants , but decided he could contribute more to the public good by running school kitchens . Hawkins , a fifth grader , stopped by our table . Her mother is Ingrid Williams , the H.R. director at AeroFarms . Zara has a quiet manner , and she sometimes looks thoughtfully into the near distance as she talks . I have the baby kales in omelettes , with cheese . You can also put them in smoothies . They are O.K. . One little girl took a sip and said it was pretty good . few weeks before the vertical farm at 212 Rome Street was to harvest its first official crop , I walked through the building with David Rosenberg . After the usual handwashing , putting on of mobcaps and coats , and wiping our feet on mats for disinfecting , we stepped into the high-ceilinged room where the vertical farm was humming away . It seemed a long way to go for salad . Rosenberg and I stood looking at the vertical farm in silence . On his face was a mixture of pride and love ; he might have been seven years old . He has been contributing to the magazine since 1974 , when he published his first piece in The Talk of the Town . German writer Gregor Hens smoked his first cigarette when he was five . His mother gave it to him . Little Gregor took this wonderful thing and held it to the fuse of one of the rockets , which shot into the sky . He means this literally . And , because he is a writer , he sees this birth of a story as the birth of his personality . any case , it is by association with nicotine that Hens shows us what he wants us to know about his life . mother first . She insisted that he take a nap before the fireworks . She had a cycling depression . When she was doing badly , she read romances , lots of them , and smoked heavily . When she was better , she smoked less and read loftier literature : Musil , Mann , Joseph Roth . Gregor grieves for her , but this does not prevent him from letting us know , in small ways , the difficulties her illness created for her sons . At the age of ten , Gregor was dispatched to a boarding school of truly Dickensian awfulness . He says that he never knew why he was sent away from home , but his brothers were shipped off , too . It seems probable that the mother was getting worse . By the time Gregor was eighteen , she was dead . From page to page , this beloved woman is glimpsed only partially . recalls ruefully that she did not try to shield her sons from their brutal father . The tirade went on for twenty minutes , Hens says . Herr Hens made his living as an inspector of damage from industrial explosions . Because of this , and because a blaze once broke out in his home office , he was very strict about fire safety . After the office fire , he bought a hundred and twenty Gloria-brand fire extinguishers to send out as Christmas gifts . That was the end of that . Overnight , without the help of books or pills or hypnotherapy , he had quit smoking . But I can do it . this is fun . Hens , to judge from his book , truly hated his father . pumped out of his moist , mucus-filled lungs . A passer-by , throwing only a fleeting look over the place , would have been completely unaware of it . But the moment I stuck a spade into it , the moment I pulled up just a single patch of weeds or disturbed a mossy slab with my foot , whole armies of combat-ready army ants gazed up at me ; powerful , shimmering red specimens evidently waiting only for me . red specimens , streaming into the light : this is beautiful in an appalling way . An ambulance arrives , but , as it rushes to the hospital , it runs over an old lady , so it stops and picks her up , too . But , instead of returning his greeting , she screams abuse at him all the way to the hospital . Only there does he discover that his face is caked with blood and that there is a long , gaping laceration on his right temple . all of it . In some scenes , Hens achieves a kind of middle tone , where , while still producing little horrors , he remains stoic , or reticent . In an early chapter , he and Stefan , grown men now , drive to the house of their great-aunt Anna , in Bremen . She has just died , and they are going to collect her keys . The house , of course , fills Gregor with memories . She never married . She devoted herself to her job at the Brinkmann cigarette factory . Once a month , a courier from Brinkmann would arrive at her front door with two cartons of cigarettes . Now she was dead , but the stipend was to continue until 2071 , so that , like the house , it passed to her great-nephews . book , too , ends with love and cigarettes . Gregor is eighteen . He is in love for the first time , with the beautiful Eliana . He has been to a party at her house , where , feeling outclassed by the other boys , he got terribly drunk and had to sleep over . In the morning , Eliana appears in his room in a gray robe and sits on the edge of the bed . She senses his discomfort , takes a cigarette out of his pack , lights it , and holds it to his lips . And then Eliana led the cigarette to her own full , slightly parted lips and took a deep , sensual drag . She bent over me and released the smoke , and the shimmering blue veil that caught the first autumnal sunshine sank over my face and caressed me . her lips , where my lips had been . I closed my eyes and sucked it in to the tips of my lungs . She has been granted fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation , the American Academy in Berlin , the New York Institute for the Humanities , and the Cullman Center of the New York Public Library . She has received awards from the American Academy of Arts and Letters , the New York Book Critics Circle , the Congress on Research in Dance , and the American Psychoanalytic Association . had persuaded Togami to join the hacking club their freshman year . They discussed a hacking hero , George Hotz , who , in 2007 , at the age of seventeen , became the first person to carrier-unlock an iPhone . students stuck to the N.Y.U. building or to their hotel , next door . Wang and his Stuyvesant teammate , Nobel Gautam , milled around trying to spot name tags they recognized from online communities . a normal Saturday , Wang might be with his robotics team at a karaoke parlor in Queens , where he lives . But for the Dos Pueblos students C.S.A.W. presented a rare opportunity to socialize face-to-face . turned to cybersecurity in the news . Assange has this thing , like , everything is fair game . was careful . He brought up the possibility of escalating security threats . On a recent Sunday night , Yoshiko Sakuma , the owner , chef , and sommelier , asked a patron who had just stepped in from the cold if she would mind if the bar forwent its overhead lights in favor of candles . Sakuma had had a long week . One patron reminded her that the popular sake bar was closed on Sundays , and she groaned . Others suggested places she might visit instead , as they accompanied her in drinking the terrific house sake , which is available only during happy hour . Flights of sake are another good choice , if only because Sakuma walks drinkers through each selection , sharing gossip about the producers . They were so close to the bar that one patron , who was deep in conversation with a friend , apologized for interrupting their music . October 4 , 1986 , the University of Alabama hosted Notre Dame in a game of football . Notre Dame had won the previous four contests , but this time Alabama was favored . It had a stifling defense and a swift senior linebacker named Cornelius Bennett . Football is essentially a spectacle of car crashes . Beuerlein landed on his back . He stood up , wobbly and dazed . He had a concussion . college , Bennett was drafted into the National Football League . Between 1987 and 1995 , he played for the Buffalo Bills , and appeared in four Super Bowls . During his pro career , he made more than a thousand tackles , playing through sprains , muscle tears , broken bones , and concussions . 1996 , he signed a thirteen-million-dollar contract with the Atlanta Falcons . He received weekly injections of Toradol , an anti-inflammatory drug . In 2000 , at the age of thirty-five , Bennett retired and moved to Florida . Darryl Talley , a former Bills teammate , suffered from severe depression . Mike Webster , a Hall of Fame center for the Pittsburgh Steelers , had become a homeless alcoholic ; he died , of a heart attack , in 2002 . Three years later , Terry Long , another former Steeler , committed suicide by drinking antifreeze . neuropathologist named Bennet Omalu autopsied Webster , Long , and Waters , and detected a pattern : each had a high concentration of an abnormal form of a protein , called tau , on his brain . In 2010 , he was elected to head the Board of Former Players , and he participated in heated discussions among league representatives , team owners , and players . own son , Kivon , had just turned eleven , and was starting to play tackle football . Parenting is about providing children with opportunities while protecting them from harm , and few recreational activities put those impulses in opposition the way football does . Yet Bennett never considered trying to stop Kivon from playing . was big for his age , like his father had been , and performed well on his youth team . Bennett shared safety tips with Kivon : how to protect his head when tackling by hitting his opponent with his shoulder instead of his helmet ; how to improve his footwork . wanted to give Kivon the best chance to excel . In 2015 , when Kivon was a high-school junior , he transferred to St. Thomas Aquinas , a prestigious Catholic high school in Fort Lauderdale . Kivon , a strong student , enrolled in Advanced Placement classes . Kivon went to St. Thomas primarily to play football . The school has produced more pro players than any other high school in the country . By the time Kivon enrolled , the St. Thomas Aquinas Raiders had won eight state championships and two national titles . Moreover , the school had embarked on a potentially radical experiment . The head football coach , Roger Harriott , had been instituting changes to make the game safer . He limited practices to ninety minutes , and got the school to acquire a pair of motorized human-size robots , wrapped in foam , which players could tackle , saving their teammates from unnecessary hits . blew an air horn to signal the start of practice . It was late August . He had on a short-sleeved windbreaker and a sun hat with a wide brim . A stopwatch hung from a cord around his neck , and he had tucked some crumpled notes into the waistband of his shorts . He starts each practice by shaking their hands and asking them about their day , or their parents , or their progress in recovering from an injury . father was born in Jamaica and came to the United States when Roger was an infant . Roger grew up in South Florida , and in the nineties he was a running back for St. Thomas . He won a scholarship to Boston University , and became a star there , then transferred to Villanova . He contemplated a career in the N.F.L. , but he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in practice and never regained top form . March , 2015 , he took the St. Thomas job . His predecessor had just won a state championship , but he had also been hard-nosed and profane . Students should play for the love of their teammates , he told them , not out of hatred for their opponents . tenure got off to a rough start . In the opening game , several first-string players sustained season-ending injuries . The quarterback missed a few games . A standout defensive end , an Ohio State-bound senior named Nick Bosa , suffered an A.C.L. tear . Sports reporters lowered their expectations for the team . Kivon , a third-stringer behind Bosa , urged his teammates to ignore the press . Harriott pulled him off the field . His father watched , proudly , from the stands . This summer , Kivon accepted a scholarship offer from the University of Tennessee . Harriott and the school had made preventing head injuries a priority . The team bought Riddell SpeedFlex helmets , which came onto the market in 2014 , and cost nearly four hundred dollars apiece . The exam is designed to establish a cognitive baseline ; after a suspected concussion , a player is supposed to retake the test , allowing a medical professional to determine whether the athlete requires further assessment . But self-reporting of injuries is inherently unreliable , and no player wants to sit out for a ding . Dwayne Owens , the athletic trainer at St. Thomas , said that he knew players who had intentionally botched their baseline tests . Thomas wanted to make the assessment of student concussions more objective , and this summer it agreed to participate in a research project with the University of Miami . Hoffer was funded , in part , by the N.F.L. , but the goggles would be useful to all types of athletes . Owens told me that , in the past year at St. Thomas , he had identified concussions in two female soccer players , two volleyball players , and a baton twirler . In 2015 , nine St. Thomas football players suffered season-ending injuries in training . Teevens was worried about the future of the sport . Since 2009 , the number of boys between the ages of six and seventeen who play football has fallen by nineteen per cent . In 2010 , Teevens outlawed tackling during Dartmouth practices . In the spring , two prototypes arrived by FedEx . The robots , called Mobile Virtual Players , or M.V.P.s , stand just under six feet tall , weigh a hundred and ninety pounds , and look like pillars of black foam . Some players laughed when they saw them , but they stopped when a coach squeezed the trigger on a remote controller and an M.V.P. took off , moving at about sixteen miles an hour . Smith ordered two , at a price of sixteen thousand dollars . St. Thomas can afford such experiments . robots arrived in late summer . Riley exhibited the proper form : lowering his shoulder , wrapping his arms around the dummy , then wrestling it to the ground . A minute later , the defensive back dragged the M.V.P. down . Billitier , the assistant head coach , also observed the robot drill with a skeptical eye . But something had to change in order to diminish the damage done in practice . After five minutes , the drill ended . afternoon this summer , Harriott , while shaking hands at the start of practice , noticed a player near the back of the line putting his shoulder pads on , shimmying them over his head . The student , Trevon Grimes , had a temple-fade haircut so bushy on top that classmates compared his head to a broccoli floret . He was tall and lean , with blazing speed and grippy hands . He was the only St. Thomas player who had chosen not to wear a Riddell SpeedFlex helmet . smiled . Grimes felt that Harriott , who has five children , treated him as much like a son as like a football player . asked Harriott when he could get his game cleats . Harriott told him that an expected shipment , from Nike , was late . -LRB- St. Grimes grew up in Indianapolis , and started playing football at the age of seven . But the sport continued gaining in popularity . Grimes completed the fifth grade , Leah , a nurse , found a job at a hospital in Margate , Florida , so that Trevon could eventually attend St. Thomas . She worked twelve-hour shifts to save up for tuition , which costs more than twelve thousand dollars . Grimes tested in before his freshman year . In 2014 , as a sophomore , he made the varsity football team ; during that championship season , he scored two touchdowns . In his junior year , he scored seven touchdowns , helping St. Thomas win the state title yet again . Privately , Grimes was intent on attending Ohio State . invited Grimes to announce his college choice on-air , but he declined . Urban Meyer , its head coach , had been in frequent contact with him . But athletic talent is fragile . Harriott had dreamed of the pros before tearing his A.C.L. -LRB- For most teen-agers , who tend not to think about long-term repercussions , a busted knee is far more worrying than a concussion . blasted the air horn and the offense lined up for seven-on-seven drills . On one play , Jake Allen , the starting quarterback , threw the ball to Grimes , amid double coverage . Grimes plucked the ball out of the air . also impressed on the students that they were just playing a game . One of them is Glenn Holt , who was a wide receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals , tallying two touchdowns and four concussions in three years . NBC , CBS , Fox , and ESPN pay billions of dollars a year for broadcast rights , giving the N.F.L. great leverage . The show was cancelled . The film , echoing the scientific consensus , puts forth the idea that repetitive subconcussive blows are thought to be the main cause of C.T.E. . A one-off concussion likely represents a lesser threat . April , 2016 , he contacted a law firm that was representing former players suing the N.F.L. . The league settled the case for nearly a billion dollars . Patrick was skeptical of the deal ; in his view , it made it too difficult for individual players to receive medical compensation . research has indicated that symptoms of C.T.E. may emerge as early as high school . At a congressional hearing in March , Ann McKee , a C.T.E. asked Patrick if , given these findings , he regretted having played football . You could live into your nineties , or get hit by a car tomorrow . game day , St. Thomas amassed a thirty-five-point lead before halftime . Grimes caught a ball in tight coverage , brushed off two tacklers , and ran for a touchdown . Kivon Bennett made two sacks , and Asante Samuel , whose father was a cornerback in the N.F.L. , returned an interception for a touchdown . Schneider , Harriott , and the team reviewed the game on video . reminded Paulino-Bell and the others about a new rule : blocking uninvolved players was not allowed . In recent years , the youth league Pop Warner , the National Federation of State High School Associations , the National Collegiate Athletic Association , and the N.F.L. have implemented rule changes aimed at reducing injuries , and introduced protocols for treating concussions . Helmet-to-helmet hits are forbidden across all leagues . The N.C.A.A. has banned gratuitously hitting the head or neck of an opposing player . He acknowledged that reforms were needed , but worried about hamstringing defenders . similar public conversation about safety in football occurred at the end of the nineteenth century . Back then , the sport was played almost exclusively at Ivy League schools . The effort was not successful , and dozens of players died from broken backs and snapped necks . Games increasingly resembled blood sport . death rate declined , but football did not lose its martial character . He also reminded the boys to complete their summer reading assignments . night , Grimes shaved off the inverted V that he had stencilled along his neckline . He ran up to Harriott before practice the next day . Everyone else is in college algebra . Harriott told him to stick with it . In 2009 , one of its players was shot and killed at a party . Booker T. was the four-time returning state champ . and his coaching staff had recently scouted their opponent , observing them play against a team from Plantation , Florida . Booker T. won . They talk a lot . In it , Harris and other coaches are shown cursing at and hitting their players . still ran tackling sessions at Booker T. , he said , but only once a week , for thirty minutes . week of the Booker T. game , the air was soupy , the sun devastatingly hot . By three-thirty , when practice started at St. Thomas , rubber pellets dusting the artificial turf were absorbing heat , pushing the field temperature well above a hundred degrees . One player threw up . used the weather as motivation . Private . afternoon , Grimes was running a curl route when he pivoted awkwardly , torquing his right knee . Grimes had been playing through nagging knee pain since the eighth grade . His tone suddenly changed . game was held at a stadium in Miami-Dade County . Cumulonimbus clouds hung in the sky . As the players ran onto the field , they mimed firing machine guns . Larry Little , a former Miami Dolphins guard and a Booker T. alum , and Michael Irvin , a former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver and a St. Thomas alum , met on the fifty-yard line and shook hands . But the official spotted the ball favorably . He went on to win a national championship with the University of Miami , and three Super Bowl rings with Dallas . In 2007 , he was inducted into the Hall of Fame . St. Thomas was special to him . professional career was cut short by a spinal-cord injury . Irvin agreed . Youth participation may be down in well-to-do communities , but the Upper East Side has never been a font of football talent . But many will not . St. Thomas , with Jake Allen at quarterback , took over , but Allen fumbled and Booker T. recovered . He privately regretted having presented the contest as an existential struggle . Thomas came out in the second half and played more mistake-filled football : dropping an easy interception opportunity , getting penalized for roughing the punter . Late in the third quarter , St. players lined up for the kickoff . Perhaps no part of football is more dangerous than the kickoff , when both sides barrel toward each other at full speed , like jousters . Ghastly collisions often occur . Pop Warner has eliminated kickoffs for children under eleven , but the kickoff will most likely endure elsewhere , because every once in a while a kick returner shoots the gap and runs all the way to the end zone . For fans , the thrill derives , in part , from the possibility of disaster . the football sailed through the air , Daniel Carter plunged down the field for St. Thomas , weaving around potential blockers . Carter jumped up , his body surging with adrenaline ; the returner did not . Booker T. trainers carried the player off the field . the fourth quarter , with St. Thomas down by a point , Grimes came alive . He caught a short pass , stiff-armed his defender , and ran for an additional twenty yards . air smelled like car tires . It started to rain , but the boys kept playing . Thunder boomed . Thomas needed a touchdown , and Grimes desperately wanted the ball . He caught a pass near the sideline , but seemed to aggravate his knee injury , and hobbled off the field . Allen dropped back , swivelled right , and threw to Grimes , who , after catching the ball , cut inside and got by a potential tackler . Another one stood in his way . Grimes lowered his shoulder , plowed over the defender , and fell into the end zone . The ball was spotted at the one . Thomas had been defeated ; for the first time in decades , the team had a losing record . Grimes was crying , as were others . Harriott tried to console them . His doctor gave him a dose of oral steroids , and recommended two weeks off . High-school football was important , but being healthy for Ohio State was essential . In class , he acted out ; injured athletes are notoriously cranky . practice , Harriott urged the players not to let anger distract them . Grimes returned for the homecoming game and caught a touchdown pass . few days later , the Raiders flew to Las Vegas for a nationally televised game against the new No. 1 in the country , Bishop Gorman , a team that had not lost since 2013 . The players and coaches checked into a resort nine miles southwest of the Strip . There were ten restaurants and a pool with a waterfall , but Harriott prohibited his team from enjoying any of it . This was not a pleasure trip . He cut back on the motivational speeches . had already beaten top-ranked teams from Texas , Hawaii , Florida , and California , and it had an electrifying quarterback , Tate Martell , who , like Grimes , was headed to Ohio State . In five games , Martell had thrown for thirteen touchdowns and run for six . Indeed , ESPN presented the matchup as if it were a prizefight . stadium was filled to its capacity of five thousand . A row of rugged mountain peaks loomed to the west . Flavor Flav , whose son attended the school , showed up to watch . Bennett made the cross-country trip , as did Leah Grimes . Before the game , some of the players talked about why they were playing . She has cancer . She made a long trip to come watch me play . During warmups , Leah told me that the two weeks of rest had done wonders for her son . She hoped that his patellar problems were over . The St. Thomas spirit should never leave here . Jake Allen looked nervous and struggled to find his rhythm . He missed Grimes a few times , and then threw an interception . Others were more direct . Thomas had the ball on its own forty-six-yard line , and went into a spread formation . Allen took the snap and pitched the ball to Michael Harley , a wide receiver . But Harley stopped , set his feet , and tossed an arcing pass toward the end zone . Grimes outran his defender , extended his arms , and pulled the ball in . swaggered back to the bench . On the next possession , they forced a fumble and recovered the ball . did not get up . He pounded his fist on the field , in agony . He and a coach carried Grimes to the bench . A doctor packed his knee with ice and braced it with a cardboard splint . Grimes left the stadium on a stretcher , with a Gatorade towel covering his face . refused pain medication , so that he could stay awake and follow the game on his phone . The game went into overtime . The Raiders scored a touchdown , then Gorman did the same . Double overtime . In triple overtime , St. Thomas scored again , but so did Gorman , and instead of settling for an extra point they went for a two-point conversion . rushed the field . The St. Thomas players looked bewildered : they had been so close . was a few feet away , addressing his team . He reminded the guys that their season was far from over . the ESPN crew packed up their gear , little kids , basking in the bright lights , pretended that they were the stars . A group of twentysomethings crossed the parking lot , trying to find their car . days later , Grimes had another MRI , which showed what he , his coaches , his family , and Ohio State feared the most : a torn A.C.L. His high-school career was over . He needed surgery and months of rehab if he was going to be ready for the start of the college season . November , Grimes visited Columbus ; he toured the athletic facilities and the dormitories , sat in on meetings with the coaches and the players , and had his knee examined by the team doctor . He and Leah met with a guidance counsellor to discuss his plan to graduate in three years . I want to have a business or invent something . State played at home that weekend , against Nebraska . Grimes and his mother had front-row seats on the forty-yard line . His head bounced off the turf and , for several minutes , he lay lifeless a few feet from where Grimes and his mother sat . Armstrong was strapped to a backboard and taken away . With Grimes out , other players stepped up . One day , during punt-formation drills , an eager J.V. call-up collided helmet-to-helmet with Kaleb McCarty , a junior . He woke up feeling dizzy , nauseated , and a little scared . next day , McCarty went to see Dwayne Owens , the athletic trainer . Owens told me that the researchers from Miami had completed a trial of the goggles that measured rapid eye movements , but had failed to provide St. Thomas with a pair to use . Owens , using a cell-phone flashlight and a series of balance tests , determined that McCarty had likely suffered a concussion . His mother took him to the hospital , where he was given an MRI . If you sprain an ankle and try to run before it has healed , you can cause further damage , but pain usually dissuades you from pushing it . McCarty said . He was troubled to learn about Tyler Varga , a Yale graduate who played in three games for the Indianapolis Colts before suffering a concussion that lasted four months ; Varga eventually quit the sport . Other players were retiring early . Chris Borland was the kind of football player McCarty wanted to be : a linebacker who relished a dirty jersey and the roar of the crowd . In 2014 , after graduating from the University of Wisconsin , Borland secured a multimillion-dollar contract to play for the San Francisco 49ers . went on TV and attended conferences on head trauma . Other professionals , like Varga , asked him for advice . few months ago , in Atlanta , Borland appeared on a panel about concussions and the N.F.L. . He was asked how to make football safer . Incredibly , football seemed more popular the more people learned about the risks . In September , the parents of two former Pop Warner players who died , and subsequently were given a diagnosis of C.T.E. , filed a class-action suit against the organization , contending that it had created a false impression of safety . When it comes to , say , shooting heroin , the answer is simple . But football , which can create tremendous financial and social opportunities for those who play it , can not be categorized as purely harmful . McCarty told me that he once dreamed of going to the N.F.L. , but now he just wanted to get into a good school . Fortunately , the Raiders were the heavy favorite . McCarty attended the game in street clothes . When teammates asked him about the concussion , he told them that he had experienced blurred vision and skewed depth perception . minutes before the kickoff , the players lined up in the tunnel leading into the stadium . Grill smoke from the snack bar hung over the field . Raiders started strong , with a rushing touchdown on their second play from scrimmage . one point , Kivon Bennett hurt his knee . Ice , rest , rehab . Troutman , a safety , scored two of the first-quarter touchdowns , running in a fumble recovery and returning an interception . At one point , he hit a Palm Beach Lakes running back so hard that the player stumbled grotesquely around the field before collapsing . Harriott felt pleased with the performance of Troutman and a few others , but otherwise he was frustrated . He expected clinical , disciplined play . Instead , he saw senseless penalties and mental mistakes . Two coaches had been shouting at each other on the sidelines . St. Thomas would never win the state championship if it performed this way . team clustered around him . Their next opponent , Dwyer High School , was more formidable . McCarty sat on the bench again , but he said that his head now felt fine . December 9th , the Raiders travelled to Orlando , to face an undefeated team from Tampa . Grimes , no longer on crutches and already pressing eighty pounds with his bad leg , watched from the sidelines . Kivon Bennett was back on the field , and so was McCarty . St. Thomas dominated from the start , getting so far ahead that the Mercy Rule went into effect . McCarty was elated . He paused . Since then , he has written about a Russian arms trafficker , an antiquarian book forger , a wrongful conviction in Chicago , the former national-security adviser Michael Flynn , and many others . In 2017 , he was a Ferris Professor of Journalism at Princeton University . varsity football team at St. Thomas Aquinas , a high school in Fort Lauderdale , gathers around Rob Biasotti , one of the coaches . He emerges in this excellent biography as a man more complex than the myth of him would have it . His military and political stratagems coincided with a receptive mood in revolutionary France , which abolished slavery in 1794 . In the restive period that followed , Louverture consolidated power , ultimately enforcing a labor code no less repressive than slavery . Following the death of his father , Orner is left with a blank grief that he can quell only through reading . Talla , aged twelve , is walking with her husband from a small Iranian village toward a new life in the city . He is old enough to be afraid of bandits , she young enough to be afraid of ogres tucked among the dunes . We follow the couple through parenthood and three decades of alternating regimes . Cardenas hopscotches across time , shedding forms from section to section , and extending a single sentence over twenty pages . In November , though , people who owned New Balance sneakers began setting them alight , posting videos of flaming footware to social media , and calling for a boycott of the company . The spokesman was actually making a fairly limited point about trade policy . Trump has promised to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a deal secured by President Obama that would reduce trade barriers between many Pacific Rim countries . That suits New Balance , which still manufactures some of its shoes in the U.S. , but good luck trying to communicate such subtleties in the current climate . But , until now , boycotts have usually been staged in response to specific corporate practices . The United Farm Workers , in the mid-sixties , organized the famous grape boycott in order to get farmers to stop relying on underpaid , non-union workers . Greenpeace organized a boycott of Shell , in 1995 , to stop the company from dumping an old oil platform at sea . There are antecedents : a few years ago , L.G.B.T. activists went after Chick-fil-A after its president voiced his opposition to gay marriage . Boycotts are not just futile griping ; they often work . The U.F.W. , Greenpeace , and anti-Nike boycotts were all successful . King also found that more than a third of the boycotted companies ended up changing their behavior in response to the protest . Perhaps his most striking finding was that boycotts usually had only a small impact on sales . They used to face a classic collective-action problem : taking part makes sense only if everyone else is . Now you can see how many people have signed online pledges , and view videos of burning sneakers . obvious solution for corporations is to say nothing controversial . But in the Trump era a truly neutral position is hard to find . Companies are used to facing pressure over where they advertise . decades , we held corporations responsible for labor practices and environmental records . Ridgely spent months hunting down the scripts from various libraries and combining them into a full-length compilation . The play begins in Tokyo in 1937 , as a noted Benshi live-narrates a silent film , then skips ahead ten years , when the same man survives as a street performer under American occupation . most cogent argument for electing Donald Trump was made not by Trump , or by his campaign , but by a writer who , unlike Trump , betrayed no eagerness to attach his name to his creations . He called himself Publius Decius Mus , after the Roman consul known for sacrificing himself in battle , although the author used a pseudonym precisely because he hoped not to suffer any repercussions . Decius sought to be clear-eyed about the candidate he was endorsing . But he argued that this corruption was also evidence of a national crisis , one that could be addressed only by a politician untethered to political piety . I want my party to live . essay was meant to provoke conservatives , and it succeeded . for conservative intellectuals , as for so many others , November 8th did not mark a return to normalcy . A day and a half after Donald Trump was elected President , he flew from New York to Washington to meet with President Obama at the White House . At the same time , about two miles east , in an auditorium at the headquarters of the Heritage Foundation , the well-connected conservative think tank , a handful of prominent conservatives gathered onstage to try to figure out their place in this new political order . DeMint , the former senator from South Carolina , is the president of the foundation , and he was jubilant . In March , Heritage published a list of eight worthy nominees for the Supreme Court ; when Trump released his own list , in May , it included five judges from the Heritage slate . Addressing the audience , DeMint looked like a man who had won a long-shot bet . At the Heritage event , though , Goldberg tried to be magnanimous in defeat . speakers at Heritage that day differed in the degree of optimism they allowed themselves . that Trump is the President-elect , plenty of prominent conservatives are hoping that he will govern as a reliably conservative Republican . He is one of a handful of pro-Trump intellectuals who have been laboring to establish an ideological foundation for the political tendency sometimes known as Trumpism . Politicians , as a rule , do not trouble themselves overmuch with the opinions of intellectuals , and Trump is unusually untroubled by debates about political philosophy . The irony is that the modern conservative movement cohered , in the nineteen-sixties and seventies , as a rebellion against a Republican establishment that it considered out of touch . Now , according to a small but possibly prescient band of pro-Trump intellectuals , it is happening again . But , among conservative pundits more broadly , skepticism of Trump was so widespread that it began to threaten the business model of cable-news networks . CNN dealt with this problem by hiring Jeffrey Lord , an obscure columnist and former Reagan aide who had met Trump in 2013 and been a supporter ever since . differences , of course , are plentiful . Not only was Reagan a two-term governor of California ; he also ran for President with considerable support from the conservative movement , which was emerging as the dominant intellectual force in American politics . His conservative coalition brought together free marketeers , military hawks , and Christian activists ; it is partly thanks to him that those three groups came to be regarded as natural allies . Before launching his campaign , in June , 2015 , he had been a Democrat -LRB- for most of his life -RRB- , a potential Reform Party candidate -LRB- during a brief flirtation with Presidential politics , in 2000 -RRB- , and , starting in 2011 , a kind of conservative gadfly , obsessed with the fallacious idea that Obama was not born in America . Web address , it evoked an earlier , nerdier version of the Internet , and its wry tone seemed calculated to contrast with the bombastic style of its chosen candidate . This was where Publius Decius Mus began his career , alongside a handful of other writers , most of whom adopted Latin pseudonyms . The hidden identities of Decius and the other Journal contributors may have made the essays more seductive , by making their authors seem like fugitives , desperate to stay one step ahead of the ideological authorities . Decius was not quite prepared to quit the debate . He chose a private club in midtown , where he had been attending a lecture . Then he strolled over to a suitably anonymous location : the tatty food court in the basement of Grand Central Terminal , where he endeavored to fold his long legs beneath a small table . The man known as Decius was tall and fit , a youthful middle-aged professional dressed in a well-tailored gray suit and a pink shirt . He has worked in the finance world , but he talked about political philosophy with the enthusiasm of someone who would do it for fun , which is essentially what he does . is a longtime conservative , though a heterodox one . But he suggests that a government might justifiably hamper international trade , or subsidize an ailing industry , in order to sustain particular communities and particular jobs . Trump argues that the government should do more to insure that workers have good jobs , speaks very little about religious imperatives , and excoriates the war in Iraq and wars of occupation in general . is a reason for that , of course . Trump has routinely said things that would , in previous elections , have been considered scandalous and disqualifying . His outlandish and often incompatible claims , along with his refusal to admit mistakes , make it impossible to determine which of his notions are likely to become policies , and can foster the sinister impression that , as President , Trump will be accountable to no one , not even himself . Throughout the campaign , he was accused of being the leader of a white backlash movement , waging war on minorities : he says that he wants to expel millions of unauthorized immigrants , and calls for a moratorium on Muslims entering the country . Both also saw themselves as defenders of an American culture that was implicitly white , or even explicitly so . with forebears such as these , what is striking about Trump is how little he engages , at least explicitly , with questions of culture and identity . Whether he was in a rural white town or an urban black church , Trump avoided moral exhortation , preferring to focus on the economic renewal that his Presidency would bring . Decius and his comrades , the language of citizenship is central to Trumpism , which encourages Americans to think of themselves as members of a wonderful club , besieged by gate-crashers . Marini is a member of an exotic tribe known as West Coast Straussians : a student of Harry Jaffa , who was a student of the opaque but influential political philosopher Leo Strauss , and who sought to draw out connections between the American republic and its classical antecedents . Another member of this tribe is Larry Arnn , the president of Hillsdale College , a stronghold of conservative thought , who sees in Trump a leader who , because of his willingness to violate political taboos , might be independent enough to check the progress of runaway regulations . So far , his announced appointments have given orthodox conservatives little cause for alarm , raising the possibility that Trump might be ideologically reliable after all . It is difficult to predict the outcome of any Presidency , but with Trump the worst-case scenarios seem particularly plausible , because he is so uninterested in the safeguards that might prevent them . His reliance on his own intuition is part of what Trumpists love about him , because it frees him from the tyranny of technocracy , but it also makes their job much more difficult . Bauerlein is an admirer of Decius , and also a supporter of Trump , whose promise to control the border appealed to his sense of patriotism . But he was also suspicious of his own urge to glory in that desecration . His hope , however far-fetched , was that Trump , by demolishing traditional Party ideologies , might somehow help people move beyond hardened partisan positions . When Bauerlein was reminded of this , he merely sighed . Russian pianist Daniil Trifonov creates a furor . The term is a familiar one in the annals of super-virtuosity . Paderewski left furor in his wake , as did Sviatoslav Richter , the young Martha Argerich , and the young Evgeny Kissin . Russians are more prone to do so . It should be noted that a furor is not the same as a sensation . Furor pianists exhibit intelligence as well as dexterity ; they often make curious interpretive choices that cause head-shaking at intermission . They give a hint of the unearthly , the diabolical . was born in Nizhny Novgorod in 1991 , and now lives in New York . He achieved international fame in 2011 , when he won first prize in the Tchaikovsky Competition . Not everything cohered , yet the playing had beauty and power to spare . A scurrying encore left even the most obscurantist pianophiles mystified . sets Trifonov apart is a pair of attributes that are seldom found in one pianist : monstrous technique and lustrous tone . The characteristic Trifonov effect is a rapid , glistening flurry of notes that hardly seems to involve the mechanical action of hammers and strings . The elemental thrill is to see him lunge from one extreme to another . far , Trifonov has done best in the high-virtuoso territory of Liszt , Scriabin , and Rachmaninoff . Trifonov dispatches all of it with stupefying effortlessness , in the process transforming this ostensibly bravura music into something elegant and rarefied , almost French . He suggests how much Debussy and Ravel owed to Liszt . explorations of Germanic repertory have yielded murkier results . He lavished such affection on each hovering chord and quiver of melody that the music was repeatedly in danger of gliding to a halt . Richter , through the force of his personality , could get away with such mystical prolongations of Schubert . his most recent Carnegie appearance , on December 7th , Trifonov devoted the first half of the program to Schumann . Both were deftly done . The opening piece was hectic and clangorous ; after that , torpor set in . The slow pieces were languid to the point of stasis . Phrases dissolved into a lovely miasma of disconnected notes . The prayerful melody of the fourth piece shed its songlike character ; even the longest-breathed singer would have had a hard time sustaining the line at this tempo . A minute here or there in Neverland would have been compelling , but fully half the work fell into that zone . The Stravinsky tended to skim the surface , but it blazed with energy and color . Trifonov even allowed himself a bit of showmanship : at the beginning of the second movement , in honor of the titular puppet , he let his right arm dangle limply for a moment . With Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic , he performed the Rachmaninoff Third Concerto , a work that always gives pleasure but seldom surprises . For most of the first movement , Trifonov played with unaffected brilliance ; after initial tensions over tempo , he and Dudamel settled into a vibrant groove . The revelation occurred in the cadenza . The composer employed the first in his famous recording with the Philadelphia Orchestra , and most pianists have followed suit . heart of the second cadenza is an imperious elaboration of the suave , sauntering theme with which the concerto begins . Trifonov could have knocked it off at high speed ; instead , he took a deliberate , almost labored approach , slowing to a crawl in the turn to G minor . The sound was immense , seeming to ventriloquize the orchestra sitting silently by . The passage assumed a tragic heft that changed the meaning of the concerto around it . When a performer is astounding on one occasion and exasperating on another , you want him to continue on his chosen path , however circuitous it may appear . He still has not touched much of the twentieth-century repertory ; he will enrich it when he does . Once he settles into his maturity , he may have no equal . He writes about classical music , covering the field from the Metropolitan Opera to the downtown avant-garde , and has also contributed essays on pop music , literature , twentieth-century history , and gay life . Chances are you will do none of the above . But if your to-do list includes getting rid of your old stuff to make room for new stuff , help is on the way . One morning not long ago , Mike Cardona and Darryl Bradley , both thirty-three and dressed in black T-shirts , cargo pants , and baseball caps , showed up at a one-bedroom apartment near Sutton Place to pick up a sleep sofa , love seat , sideboard , and ottoman . In those days , the Dodge Durango that Josh and Zach borrowed from their mother played a central role . Two sisters were disposing of their old living-room furniture to make room for a new set being delivered that afternoon . that day , Angela Kelly , the nice woman who manages the Twenty-third Street Salvation Army thrift shop , welcomed the gray Ultrasuede sleep sofa , overlooking the scratch but giving the mattress a once-over -LRB- many organizations will not accept mattresses for bedbug and ick reasons -RRB- . Cardona counts among his favorite freebies a table made from a tree trunk and a violin . Bradley once nabbed a frozen-smoothie-maker and a Pink Floyd boogie board . Last year , he was named Lugger of the Year , an award based partly on the number of donations secured .

But in recent years amateurs have emerged at the fore via new channels . After making a name for himself in Columbus , Ohio , cutting up records on turntables in local d.j. battles , he bought a sampler in 1997 and began imitating the sounds he heard churning from the coasts . Krohn offered catchy , achy loops of melody ripped from fuzzy soul and jazz records , punctuated by kick and snare drums that swung with urgency ; most vitally , he articulated a style without saying a word . Instead of pitching beats to established rappers , he signed to the independent label Definitive Jux and released an instrumental album of his own , then still a novel proposition in hip-hop . It was just smug , drab stuff .
