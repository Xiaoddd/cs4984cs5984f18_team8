House Speaker Paul Ryan is fuming . And Energy Transfer Partners is promising that the Dakota Access Pipeline will go forward as planned . On Sunday , the Army Corps of Engineers determined that one piece of the pipeline needs a full environmental impact study -LRB- EIS -RRB- , a months-long process that looks at whether the line is appropriately sited , where alternative routes could go , and who will be impacted . The EIS is required for a length of the pipeline that would run under Lake Oahe on the Missouri River , a half mile north of the Standing Rock Reservation . On one side , you have money , President-elect Donald Trump , and a network of fossil fuel infrastructure . On the other , you have protesters , lawyers , and time . Trying to Trump this decision would be a bad idea In the immediate aftermath of the announcement , environmentalists were quick to wonder if this was yet another Obama administration decision that the president-elect can reverse come January 20 . There is good reason to be concerned . Trump is personally invested in both ETP and a company that will eventually own 25 percent of the completed pipeline . He clearly wants the project to go forward . There is a mountain of paperwork to get through Tribe members and supporters , including many indigenous groups , have been protesting the Lake Oahe section for months , clashing with militarized authorities and drawing national attention to the project . They have also sued the Army Corps over its handling of the permit process . Native American tribes are sovereign states , and permitting agencies are required to consult with the tribes on any environmental issues .

The most likely outcome of the EIS is that the pipeline is , in fact , rerouted . There is an alternative route that ETP considered that takes the line 10 miles north of Bismarck . But if it moves ahead with construction without a permit , its bank financing could be at risk , since financing agreements almost always stipulate that the loan party must be in good standing . Market forces are already undermining the financial viability of a pipeline bringing crude oil from North Dakota . But there are multiple market factors at work against the pipeline . Since Dakota Access was proposed in 2014 , oil prices have fallen dramatically , even while production from the Bakken formation has decreased . OPEC , the international oil production group , recently agreed to limited production , thrusting global oil prices back up , at least temporarily . Meanwhile , new data from the Energy Information Administration shows that oil exports from the United States have gone up 1,000 percent since 2009 . But Williams-Derry said that this current market volatility is , while far from predictive , certainly worrying for investors in the project . The Keystone XL permit rejection opened the doors for a multi-billion dollar lawsuit against the United States . The Shell decision to back out of the Arctic did not stop drilling there . The Paris climate agreement is on shaky ground . But the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe might have just triggered a complete rethinking of how the U.S. government interacts with the Indian nations .
