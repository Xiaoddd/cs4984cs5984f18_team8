As police prepare to raid Oceti Sakowin Camp on Wednesday afternoon at 2 p.m. , the water protectors clear out what remains of the former front lines of the struggle , demolishing some structures and burning others ceremoniously to commemorate the camp and its former inhabitants . Other camps have been established in the past few months , with new sacred fires lit farther from police lines . The tribal government has asked protesters to leave while they try legal measures to fight the Dakota Access Pipeline ; the water protectors still at the camps stand resolute . Just weeks ago , as protesters celebrated a short-lived victory over the pipeline 's proponents before the inauguration of President Donald Trump , the camp was packed with thousands of protesters .
