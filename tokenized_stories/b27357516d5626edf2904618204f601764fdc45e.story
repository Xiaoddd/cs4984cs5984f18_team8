And the Trump White House does itself no favors by continuing to give vague and non-descript answers on the subject . But contrary to what the president might think , he lacks any authority to censor the unclassified communications of former federal employees . In McGehee v. Casey , 718 F. 2d 1137 -LRB- D.C. Cir . 1983 -RRB- , and United States v. Marchetti , 466 F. 2d 1309 -LRB- 4th Cir . 1972 -RRB- , the two appellate courts concluded that the federal government has no legitimate interest in censoring unclassified materials of former employees and that they may not censor such material , contractually or otherwise . The Supreme Court found the same in Snepp v. United States . This is the contractual agreement by which every security-clearance holder agrees to be bound . It memorializes a binding , legal understanding that the individual will not disseminate classified information without authorization . To address this legal confusion and allow former employees to publish their work without fear of facing a criminal or civil suit for unauthorized disclosure of classified information , federal agencies constructed the pre-publication review process . The government can not attempt to censor unclassified , albeit embarrassing , information within the manuscripts . Once the government has completed its pre-publication review , it will inform the individual in writing whether the manuscript is approved for release in total ; with redactions ; or not at all . Snepp and its progeny , however , require that the individual must first go through administrative pre-publication review ; subsequently file the civil lawsuit ; and ultimately receive a favorable judicial ruling before publishing any part of the manuscript originally deemed classified by the government . If somehow she had failed to go through pre-publication review process before publishing her book , the president might be in luck . But Manigault-Newman appears not to have had a security clearance at all , making the pre-publication question potentially irrelevant . Former federal employees simply can not be forced to contractually surrender their First Amendment right to discuss unclassified details of what they saw while serving in government . But that is of no consequence either , at least with respect to her time in the administration . However , as so many of us warned while he was running for president , overseeing your own private business and being the elected head of government are two very different legal worlds . Part and parcel of being the most powerful person on the planet and the leader of a constitutional republic is the corresponding limitation on your ability to silence detractors .
