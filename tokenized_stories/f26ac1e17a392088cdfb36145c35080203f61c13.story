Trump reverses position on family separations Trump signs executive order to end family separations Trump : Take children away to prosecute parents Trump : The US will not be a migrant camp Trump mentions rape in immigration argument Story highlights US taxpayers will have to pay for construction Trump has said Mexico will reimburse the US for the cost of the wall Philadelphia -LRB- CNN -RRB- Congress may pay for the border wall through a special spending bill being hashed out over the next two months , footing the cost of President Donald Trump 's priority before seeking any refund from Mexico , Republican lawmakers said Wednesday . Earlier , Ryan told lawmakers gathered in Philadelphia for a private retreat this week that they could pay for the wall through a supplemental appropriations bill -- a spending measure that would be dedicated just to the wall , according to Republicans in the room and a GOP lawmaker . The President said he 's going to get reimbursed one way or the other and we accept that . Read More Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said Wednesday they are aware that Trump may request a special spending measure , but that they have not received that request from the White House yet . Collins said that Ryan did not discuss a price tag for the wall , and that he considered the discussions to still be early . Trump quickly shifted the focus to the wall Wednesday after he issued an executive order saying that he would rely on a 2006 law to build his signature wall along the southern border . That announcement came to dominate much of the debate among Republican lawmakers gathered in Philadelphia . Congressional Republicans escaped Washington Wednesday to try to focus on top issues -- including replacing Obamacare . But Trump swiftly ripped the focus away with his executive action on a border wall and reports that he may reopen the use torture sites outlawed by Congress . White House press secretary Sean Spicer said later Wednesday pushed back on the reports , saying that the document did not come from the White House . Thune brushed aside Trump 's claims of voter fraud -- and a call for an investigation -- indicating to the new President it is time to get back on track . And then the questions turned to how Congress would pay for Trump 's proposed border wall -- which was rolled out by the White House just hours earlier . McMorris Rodgers deflected questions by saying she had n't seen Trump 's proposal yet . Thune then said that any proposal would have to be accounted for by Congress , and not add to the debt .
