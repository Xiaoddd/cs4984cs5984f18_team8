Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries , tribe after tribe was left with no recourse other than rebellion or starvation , and the Dakota Sioux were no exception . In exchange , they were promised compensation in the form of cash and trade goods , and directed to live on a reservation along the upper Minnesota River . The thoroughly corrupt Bureau of Indian Affairs was responsible for overseeing the terms of the treaties . This situation continued for years . The land was cleared , and the hunting and fishing that had in large measure sustained the Sioux virtually ended . The situation worsened with each passing year , with the Sioux suffering increasing hunger and hardship . Library of Congress Little Crow , a leader of the Sioux Uprising In August 1862 , the powder keg exploded . It began almost randomly , when a party of four braves on an egg-stealing foray impulsively killed five white settlers . From there , it escalated rapidly . Under the leadership of a somewhat reluctant Little Crow , several bands held a war council , and set about attacking the new settlements . They seized the Lower Sioux Agency , killing whites and burning the buildings . At the outbreak of hostilities , Myrick was one of the first casualties , and when his body was discovered , his mouth was stuffed with grass . A combined force of militia and volunteer infantry set out to subdue the Indians . The two sides met at Redwood Ferry , where the Indians gave the soldiers a thorough drubbing , killing 24 men . Flush with victory , roving bands of Sioux destroyed entire townships throughout the month and into September , plundering and killing as they went . Finally , over a month after the outbreak of the Sioux uprising , Lincoln responded , assigning Gen. John Pope , fresh from his defeat at Bull Run , the task of ending the uprising . The Army finally subdued the Sioux in the battle of Wood Lake on Sept. 23 . The Sioux who surrendered were promised safety . The trials were perfunctory affairs , some lasting less than five minutes . More than 40 cases were adjudicated in one day alone .

General Pope , seeking a quick and dramatic finish to the affair , pressured Lincoln to sign the orders for all 303 executions . Nor was he alone ; outraged newspaper editors and congressmen advocated a speedy hanging as well . After thorough analysis , only 38 Sioux could be proved to have participated in the uprising . Lincoln immediately approved their execution order , and commuted the sentences of the others . In a finish that is pure Lincoln , the president hand wrote the list of long , difficult , phonetically spelled Sioux names himself , and advised the telegrapher on the vital necessity of sending them correctly , lest the wrong men be hanged . At a drum signal , the trap was sprung , and the watching crowd of thousands cheered . Library of Congress The execution of 38 Sioux men on Dec. 26 , 1862 The year after the uprising , Congress expunged all Sioux treaties from the record , took back their reservation and ordered that the entire tribe be expelled from Minnesota . There still was scattered resistance , but the Dakota War was over . The Sioux would continue to fight for years to come , until 1890 , when the Army marked paid to their account by massacring at least 150 men , women and children from the tribe at Wounded Knee . While Lincoln felt that there must be a reckoning , and that the wholesale killing of settlers could neither be condoned nor ignored , he would not allow the law to be used to elicit indiscriminate revenge , despite the tremendous pressure on him to do just that .
