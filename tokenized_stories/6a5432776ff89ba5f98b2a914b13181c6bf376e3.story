This may not be a regular mugging incident , as the attacker pulls a gun on the lawyer and later kicks him to a pulp . A battered and bruised , and highly traumatised Louis will reach his office , where Gretchen -LRB- Aloma Wright -RRB- will see him in pain . The man is too proud to tell anyone about his troubles , and he will try to deal with it in his own way . Samantha will become a team player for a change in the next episode . After presumably finding out what happened to Louis , she will first try to speak to him . Later she will approach Harvey -LRB- Gabriel Macht -RRB- to have him help Louis . Louis has always respected Harvey too much to share his story and become vulnerable in front of him . Instead , the quirky lawyer will become highly defensive and unstable with everyone at the firm . It will be interesting to see who bears such a grudge against Louis to attack him so viciously . According to the official synopsis of the episode , Alex will be caught between Harvey and Robert Zane . It is unclear if this is about a new case or about the fight for name partner .
