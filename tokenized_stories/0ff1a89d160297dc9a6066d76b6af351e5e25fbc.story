He 's already green-lighted the Keystone XL and North Dakota Access pipelines , and Trump 's energy policy is based on massively expanding natural gas drilling nationwide . We ca n't afford the environmental destruction that fracking would bring to the Delaware River Basin . Because of cleanup efforts and investment , areas that were once highly polluted are now safe for swimming and fishing , and bald eagles are coming back . Fracking would use up millions of gallons of clean water , tear up the forests that naturally filter flows to our waterways , and could release polluted fracked water into both surface and groundwater . The Delaware River Basin Commission -- made up of the governors from Delaware , New Jersey , New York , and Pennsylvania , and one federal representative -- has kept fracking out the Basin . But if the Trump administration throws its weight around , we could see the area opened up to drilling , and big polluters ' profits put ahead of clean drinking water for more than 15 million people . We 've got to keep Trump 's polluter friends out of the Delaware River Basin . Sign the petition to tell the Delaware River Basin Commission to permanently protect the largest drinking water source in the Northeast by permanently banning fracking in the Basin . We 've made great progress reducing pollution in the Basin , but all that work could be jeopardized -- and families ' health put at risk -- if natural gas development is ever allowed to begin . Fracking would require millions of gallons of clean water , and could release pollutants into both surface and ground water . Building fracking infrastructure would tear up the very forests that naturally filter pollutants out of our drinking water . Please protect the Delaware River Basin permanently by banning natural gas drilling . We can not gamble with our children and grandchildren 's drinking water .
