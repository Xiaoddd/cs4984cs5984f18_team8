The shipment was the first reported sale of Bakken crude outside the United States since a 40-year ban on exporting U.S. crude was lifted by Congress and signed into law by the president last December . Hess CEO John Hess was a leading advocate of lifting of the ban , going on record to say that it inhibited fair trade by keeping U.S. crude out of the free market . Lifting the ban will create jobs and ultimately lower fuel prices , he explained . The company 's call to lift the ban was joined by other industry leaders and government officials , especially North Dakota senators John Hoeven , a member of the Senate Energy Committee and Heidi Heitkamp . Following the announcement of Hess ' first Bakken crude export to Europe , Hoeven and Heitkamp each issued releases hailing the Hess shipment overseas . Now , we mark another important milestone for North Dakota . Lifting the ban on crude oil exports will create jobs , grow our economy and keep the price of gasoline lower at the pump for consumers . Importantly , it will also bolster national security by providing our allies with alternative sources of oil and free them , as well as us , from reliance on energy from unstable parts of the world .
