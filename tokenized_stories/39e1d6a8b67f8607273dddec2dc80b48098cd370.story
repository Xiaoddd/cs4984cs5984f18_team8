Little did an isolated pawn , Red Fawn Fallis , know of an apparent trap set for her near Standing Rock on October 27 , 2016 , the day police took over the northern 1851 Treaty Camp , according to her defense attorneys . Law enforcement turned their attention to potential leaders of the pipeline resistance . Before Energy Transfer Partners hired the international private security firm TigerSwan , local law enforcement repeatedly retreated from the front lines . Pressure from politicians financially supported by big oil lobbyists mounted , and the state requested federal help . The infiltrator , Heath Harmon , a 46-year-old Fort Berthold Reservation member , befriended and seduced Fallis , according to a December 29 , 2017 Motion to Compel Discovery filed by defense attorneys . Out of the hundreds that begrudgingly gave way before the law enforcement blitz on the northern Treaty Camp , she was targeted and tackled by a deputy named Thadius Schmit . Two shots rang out , according to affidavits ; other video reports state three . Harmon regularly reported to the FBI , according to unclassified FBI documents revealed by the defense . Others were embedded in the camps , according to the testimony . Informants gave briefings to law enforcement about what they had witnessed . A November 5 , 2016 TigerSwan situational report also stated in an executive summary that documents obtained at a resistance camp showed activists were evolving , getting training from within and outside North Dakota , and that Earth First magazines had been discovered , which TigerSwan stated promoted violent activities . TigerSwan analysts described a sense of urgency in attempting to obtain information , which was at best difficult , according to a September 22 , 2016 informational report from TigerSwan . The defense attorneys maintain that Harmon continued his relationship with Fallis until shortly after her arrest . The defense argues that videos and documents they have received from the prosecution , namely United States Attorney Christopher C. Myers and Assistant United States Attorney David D. Hagler , are vastly incomplete , and that some videos from body cams and GoPros have had sections deleted or have been tampered with . The defense responded with another motion nine days later , arguing that all pertinent information from all the agencies , public and private , involved in intelligence gathering should be handed over , as per U.S. Supreme Court precedent under the Brady motion . A Brady motion is a defendant 's request for evidence concerning a material witness , which is favorable to the defense and to which the defense may be entitled , according to US Legal Definitions . Favorable evidence includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the accused , but also evidence that may impeach the credibility of a government witness . The civil suit is slated for October 8 this year . In addition , TigerSwan hired Stutsman County Sheriff Chad Kaiser as the DAPL operations local deputy unified commander , according to defense motions . Later , multiple requests for cooperation and information were mostly ignored , according to the NDPISB civil suit . Under North Dakota law , officers who collaborated with TigerSwan may be accomplices to the misdemeanor violation of unlicensed operation , the defense stated . She spent a year in jail without bond . Many pipeline supporters pointed to the incident to ridicule the entire resistance movement outside of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation , which at one time became the tenth largest community in the state.An October 28 , 2016 affidavit conducted by Special Agent Joseph Arenz of the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation stated that Pennington County deputies Thaddeus Schmit and Rusty Schmidt were moving activists , known as water protectors , south along Highway 1806 , when they identified Fallis as an instigator . Standing at five feet three inches tall , and weighing approximately 125 pounds , Fallis would have been an easy tackle for two well-trained sheriff deputies . Neither deputy saw a gun when they took Fallis to the ground , and believe she was able to retrieve the weapon when Schmit stopped pulling on her left arm , the affidavit stated . While being transported to the Morton County Detention Center , police said Fallis told them she was trying to pull the gun out of her pocket and was jumped , making the gun go off . A Facebook page supporting Fallis called Free Red Fawn stated that Fallis was retreating from the front lines when she was tackled . She is accused of firing a weapon . Originally , Fallis was charged with attempted murder , preventing arrest , carrying a concealed firearm , and possession of marijuana . The charges were dropped by the state a month later , but were moved to federal court . On January 29 , Fallis will begin court proceedings charged with engaging in civil disorder , discharging a firearm in relation to a felony crime of violence , possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon , which if found guilty carries a minimum sentence of 10 years and the potential of life imprisonment . Red Fawn Today , Fallis resides in a halfway house in Fargo . She has access to a mobile phone and can chat online , but heeding caution from her lawyers , refused interview requests . Fallis , and her supporters , say she is a political prisoner of a war that has lasted more than 500 years . While at the camps , Fallis worked primarily as a medic , pulling injured people from the front lines , dowsing faces burning from pepper spray with milk of magnesia , and easing the pain of those hit with rubber bullets . Fallis is the daughter of Troylynn YellowWood , an activist who helped block the Columbus Day Parade in Denver , Colorado in 2004 , according to the American Indian Genocide Museum . YellowWood was also a member of the American Indian Movement , and in the 1970s gave safe house to Annie Mae Aquash in her Denver home , according to February 2004 testimony in the trial of Arlo Looking Cloud . YellowWood passed away in June 2016 , four months before her daughter was arrested . Fallis has a prior record from 14 years ago , and served 30 months of probation in Denver after pleading guilty . She is the only woman and one of six Native Americans facing charges in federal court from the Dakota Access Pipeline controversy , according to the Water Protector Legal Collective . Dion Ortiz , 21 , was being held at the Sandoval County Detention Center in New Mexico on federal charges of civil disorder and the use of fire to commit a federal crime . His request to be released to a halfway house was granted on December 7 , 2017 . Michael Giron , known as Little Feather , is from the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation and was raised in Santa Barbara , California . He has been incarcerated without bond since March 9 , 2017 on two federal charges of civil disorder and using fire to commit a federal felony offense arising from October 27 , 2016 . His trial is set for April 10 , 2018 , in Bismarck . Little Feather faces up to 15 years in prison if proven guilty . Nastacio was also charged by the state with felony terrorism after he helped disarm Kyle Thompson , a former employee of Leighton Security Services under the TigerSwan fusion lead . He too faces federal charges and was arrested in January 2017 . On December 4 , 2017 , Fallis made a public statement on the Red Fawn Facebook page . Her mother was an influence in her life , she stated . I added a picture of us at the Capitol that day and even though my Ina was very ill and battling cancer she was there , smiling and offering her heart and love to our relatives who were there to honor the memory of so many who died at the hands of hate , racism , greed , and the American government . I love them and my heart feels good when I remember the times we spent and the talks we had . The idea that women are not funny never entered my mind . Editorial Wisdom from a forgotten flagpole by Sabrina Hornung Photo by Sabrina HornungI had a little bit of gravel-road therapy this weekend , found myself cruising rural Burleigh County and made a pit stop at Lake Mitchell . Participants were judged on creativity , flavor , and presentation ; and this year we added a new category . I suffer from acute scoliosis in my lower back , and pain radiates from this area on a daily basis .
