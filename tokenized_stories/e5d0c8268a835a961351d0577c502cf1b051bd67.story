The U.S. Army confirmed in a statement Sunday afternoon that it will not grant an easement for the pipeline . From the start , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has asked for a full analysis to consider threats to the water and environment , and also the social and cultural impacts . News about the development first appeared on social media . A video posted on Facebook showed a man identified as Remi Baldeagle saying the secretary of the Army had denied the Dakota Access pipeline easement . Some in the crowd banged drums . Carla Youngbear of the Meskwaki Potawatomi tribe traveled from central Kansas to be at the protest site . The easement marks a stunning victory for pipeline protesters , who for weeks have gathered at an encampment in southern North Dakota . The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and others who have joined them wanted changes made to the route of the pipeline , which is largely complete except for a short segment underneath a Missouri River reservoir . They said the pipeline could pollute drinking water and threatens sacred sites . Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier released a statement on the decision Sunday . This is big-government decision-making at its worst . I look forward to putting this anti-energy presidency behind us . Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners previously said it was unwilling to reroute the project . Earlier on Sunday , tribal elders had asked the military veterans joining the large Dakota Access pipeline protest encampment not to have confrontations with law enforcement officials , an organizer with Veterans Stand for Standing Rock said . Cars waiting to get into the camp Sunday afternoon were backed up for more than a half-mile . All Rights Reserved . This material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .
