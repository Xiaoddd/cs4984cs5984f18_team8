Source : MuckRock In studying the wealth of FOIAed documents that have come out over the last year through MuckRock and the work of various journalists , attorneys , and local organizers , we also get a glimpse into the collective mindset of law enforcement . In short , as they always have , the intelligence community clearly views grassroots movements as the principle threat to the established order of the country , but are always quick to frame this threat in terms of a violent menace to the public at large . In justifying these labels , those in the intelligence community point to a collection of shoddy research , often pulled from far-Right and even Alt-Right sources , that seeks to justify what is clearly a political bias among law enforcement . In some instances , Alt-Right websites were even minded for info , such as the Occidental Dissent , which is connected to the neo-Nazi and KKK confederation , the Nationalist Front . Begs the question what the Fusion Center is then doing . The article in question , archived here , simply quotes people on a Reddit anarchist forum stating that in the face of Alt-Right violence , people need to train and be prepared to defend themselves , which includes learning how to legally use firearms . The irony that the people in the article are discussing protecting themselves from far-Right violence seems to be lost on them . A Fusion Center document that shows a photo-shopped meme popular among the Alt-Right being used as a genuine antifascist article , speaks to the degree in which members of the intelligence community consume far-Right media , as well as their dislocation from reality . In the aftermath of the death of Heather Heyer however , this stance by the police blew back upon them , as many people pointed out time and time again that the drive for violence and bringing weapons was openly discussed , planned , and celebrated on various Alt-Right online platforms , yet was by and large completely ignored by local police and government officials . A white supremacist group in California posted online videos glorifying physical assaults they had perpetrated on their ideological opponents . Many of the white supremacists traveling to Charlottesville had violent criminal histories and were well-known to law enforcement . They included : a former Green Beret and Ku Klux Klansman who went to prison for stealing weapons and explosives , a former Marine who went to prison for assaulting a cab driver he thought was Iraqi and participated in violence at the Berkeley protests before coming to Charlottesville , and a Baltimore Klansman who was charged with three separate assaults and a rape -LRB- but not convicted -RRB- . But as the State turned a blind eye to the far-Right , in the lead up to the Trump inauguration its violent grew and then exploded after Trump came into office . This violent escalation took many forms , including acts of vandalism , harassment , and even outright murder , as well as arson and other attacks on Mosques , holocaust memorials , synagogues , and LGBTQAI centers . When Trump entered office , he also shifted far-Right groups off of the various domestic terrorism lists , and defunded non-profits like Life After Hate , which does outreach to current and former white supremacists . The signal to the far-Right was received loud and clear . These procedures also have led to police working at times closely with neo-Nazis in order to repress and arrest antifascist and antiracist protesters . Officers interviewed Punneo in jail after he was arrested for an unrelated domestic violence charge . Audio recordings captured investigators saying they brought photos to show him , hoping he could help them identify anti-fascist activists . In one phone call with Doug McCormack , identified by police as the TWP affiliate who acquired the permit for the Sacramento rally , CHP investigator Donovan Ayres warned him that police might have to release his name in response to a public records requests . The officer said he would try to protect McCormack . Ayres , however , treated the protester like a suspect in the investigation . The police investigator recommended the man be charged with 11 offenses , including disturbing the peace , conspiracy , assault , unlawful assembly and wearing a mask to evade police . As evidence , Ayres provided Facebook photos of the man holding up his fist . He was ultimately not charged . Sacramento Police worked closely with Derik Punneo , a neo-Nazi responsible for stabbing multiple people in June of 2016 . Police were uninterested in putting Punneo away , and instead wanted his help in IDing antifascists . By 2017 , these kid gloves and even open endorsement of the far-Right led to an explosion of death and destruction across the US . As Christophe Mathias wrote : White supremacists in the United States killed more than twice as many people in 2017 as they did the year before , and were responsible for far more murders than domestic Islamic extremists , helping make 2017 the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence in America , a new report states . The same strategies used to attack Black Lives Matter , have in turn been used on other movements . In the world of Fusion Centers , far-Right conspiracy theories are job security .

Source : MuckRock Manufacturing the Threat Clearly , the State is most interested in manufacturing a threat of extremism out of autonomous social movements , seemly while the amount of far-Right violence grows all around them . But while the tools the State has at its disposal to make this a reality are crude , what is becoming clear , is that far-Right and Alt-Right media are quick to aid them in their quest to convince enough people that social movements are a violent threat to the public . This kind of reporting would make Alex Jones blush . More Info : Will Parrish on Twitter and on the Web , National Lawyers Guild -LRB- NLG -RRB- , and DC Legal Posse .
