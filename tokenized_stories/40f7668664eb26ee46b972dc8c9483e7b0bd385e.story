By 8:45 a.m. , the spilled crude oil flowed from Hall Canyon a half-mile down Prince Barranca Valley , about one mile inland from San Buenaventura State Beach . Early estimates put the spill at around 5,000 barrels , which was later adjusted down to 700 . One barrel of oil contains 42 gallons , so nearly 30,000 gallons of crude may have been spilled . Fire officials and hazmat teams are on the scene of Ventura County oil spill . He said he called 911 after smelling and hearing the flowing crude , and then rode his motor scooter up the canyon to find oil gushing from an above-ground box . The leak prompted a swift hazmat response to contain the spill and prevent the oil from entering the Pacific Ocean . The responders included several local and state agencies , including the California Fish and Wildlife Office of Spill Prevention and Response , the Ventura and Oxnard County fire departments and the Coast Guard Marine Safety Detachment Santa Barbara . The pipeline is owned by Crimson Pipeline , a privately-owned midstream pipeline company that owns and operates approximately 1,500 miles of pipelines across California and the Gulf of Mexico . The oil itself is owned by Aera Energy , the largest onshore oil producer in Ventura County , which produces an average of 13,000 barrels per day . The exact cause of the leak is still unknown . He added that he air quality was being monitored as a precaution . Some of the oil entered the Pacific Ocean , forming into tar balls that were found 130 miles away at Manhattan Beach . Oil from the spill fills a natural depression , despoiling the natural beauty of Ventura County 's landscape . He told AlterNet : We have to treat pipeline spills and failures for what they are : not accidents but part of the day to day operations of the oil and gas industry . But the real goal needs to be a transition away from the dirty fuels that pave the road to catastrophic climate change with disasters like these . David Braun , co-founder of Rootskeeper , spoke on behalf of Californians Against Fracking in a press statement : Firefighters racing to block thousands of gallons of oil from dumping into our beautiful ocean sounds like a scene from a Hollywood disaster movie , but these devastating images are the reality in California . There is no incentive for oil companies to properly maintain their sites and to stop spilling because federal and state regulations and regulator agencies are so weak and there are no penalties . That is more spillage than the Exxon Valdez . Onshore . In one year . At this point , we can not even call these spills . Spills happen by accident . This is no accident , this is a permanent state of criminal negligence . The oil and gas industry is so sloppy , so irresponsible , so damaging that their behavior amounts to crimes against nature and against humanity . If terrorists despoiled this much water and land and resources in the U.S. , it would be all over the news every day . Since the oil and gas industry owns the government , there 's hardly ever even the most paltry fines and penalties . And spills are even worse in places like the Amazon , where devastating leakages happen all the time .
