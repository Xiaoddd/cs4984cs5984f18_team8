Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected a request from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe asking for an injunction to withdraw permission issued by the Army Corps for the last link of the oil pipeline to be built under Lake Oahe in North Dakota . A group protesting the Dakota Access oil pipeline has set up teepees on the National Mall near the Washington Monument in Washington , March 7 , 2017 . Native Americans and environmental activists had lived at a camp on the site since August fighting construction of the pipeline , which they say threatens the Standing Rock Sioux tribe 's water resources and disregards the land 's sacred status . At the height of the protests , thousands lived at the site , but its population dwindled to just a couple of hundred as the pipeline battle moved into the courts . The camp was completely evacuated on February 22 . The 1,885-kilometer -LRB- 1,171-mile -RRB- pipeline , owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP , is mostly complete , except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe , a reservoir in North Dakota formed by a dam on the Missouri River . It is designed to transport up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil daily from North Dakota to Illinois . The protests have been led by Native American tribes , particularly the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux , whose reservations are downstream from the construction site . In September , the Obama administration temporarily blocked construction in hopes of conducting a review of the project , but a federal court later ruled the project could continue .
