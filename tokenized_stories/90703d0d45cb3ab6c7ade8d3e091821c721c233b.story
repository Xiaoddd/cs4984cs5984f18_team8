The pipeline belonging to Hilcorp Alaska , LLC , moves processed natural gas from shore to four drilling platforms in the inlet . The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation is investigating the leak . In an email response to questions , spokeswoman Candice Bressler said the agency is assessing public health and environmental risks . The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration also is investigating . The U.S. Coast Guard warned mariners to stay at least 1,000 feet from the bubbling gas . Another federal agency expressed concern over possible adverse effects on marine mammals . The natural gas discharge is within the winter foraging area for the white whales , she said . The cause of the leak is unknown . Stopping the leak is not as simple as shutting down the gas supply line , the state agency said . The agency concluded there was low risk to public safety because there are few people in the area this time of year , the incident is far off shore and there is minimal boating because of ice . Hilcorp spokeswoman Lori Nelson in an email said platform crews have shut down non-essential equipment to reduce natural gas flow to the minimum gas pressure possible without jeopardizing employee safety or the environment . The company estimates the pipeline is emitting 210,000 to 310,000 cubic feet of gas per day . The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation has not made an independent estimate . A Hilcorp helicopter flying to a drilling platform on Feb. 7 spotted gas bubbling to the surface . Hilcorp reported the leak to the National Response Center , the federal point of contact for all spills , and the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation . Hilcorp hired a diving company to assess damage when the leak was discovered , the state agency said . Diving was determined to be unsafe because of ice in the inlet . Environmental groups say the gas leak will harm the inlet . Kristen Monsell , an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity , said natural gas spills are highly toxic to marine life , including the prey needed by beluga whales . Cook Inletkeeper , a nonprofit group dedicated to protecting the Cook Inlet watershed , gave formal notice Wednesday that it intends to sue Hilcorp under provisions of the Clean Water Act . The group called for an immediate halt to illegal discharges of natural gas . Copyright 2018 The Associated Press . All rights reserved .
