An independent platform for the people . Many Bernie Sanders supporters were hopeful that Sanders-backed Keith Ellison would emerge victorious from the election , as he was representing the progressive wing of the Democratic Party that many believed needed a takeover . Tom Perez was the former Labor Secretary in the Barack Obama administration and represented the establishment that pushes centrism and corporate donations , which the progressive wing of the party feverishly wanted to be expelled . There were zero Sanders progressive wing representatives elected in the Democratic Party . The Chair , two Vice Chairs , and the Chair Of CEVP were all part of the Obama administration . The third Vice Chair was re-elected for her post served during the Debbie Wasserman Schultz-led Democratic Party . The Treasurer may be worst of all , being , overtly and frankly , an investment banker . Democrats will not win elections by electing investment bankers , superdelegates , and former Obama administration establishment officials to their posts . The Democrats will continue to lose elections because of their centrist and corporate donation-friendly mentality . If the Democrats continue to shun the progressives and Bernie Sanders supporters , the Democratic Party will go on to lose elections until they finally lose power or they eventually are reorganized .

We mobilize our own progressive army through social media and doing what we as progressives are good at doing the work in our community that needs to be done . The power that they have stolen from the people will not be given back willingly , we must take it back from them . I am running as a member of my county to the PA State Democratic Committee . Ward and Precinct Captains or Committee Person as well as your local committee , club or Democratic organization . It is the duty of the opposition to oppose . We are working to unite the Progressives , Bernie friendly Independents , DemSocialists , Greens , Libertarians , Republicans into a New Party of the People . We want Bernie to lead us , but we will go on without him if he refuses . WE are the majority of the voter electorate . We need to come together and start acting like it . I wrote a SCATHING e-mail to Chuck Schumer when he posted that the Democrats plan to run Hillary again in 2020 . So , if he wants Trump to have a second term , then go ahead and run Hillary . We elected progressives to at least three of the four seats on the executive committee . We also have a bonafide Berniecrat running to fill the House seat vacated by Mike Pompeo and we have progressives running for seats at every level of government . All talk and not action .

You start by every progressive who want change becoming a Precinct committeeman , then to state committtee through your local legislative district committee meetings and from there to state committee or county leadership , where you start to pick up some power . Only a very few people from each state get elected to the DNC by each state committee . Leave the influence peddling of the Democratic Party behind . Those idiots ar likely to back Hillary again . Because none of the candidates , to my recollection , ever identified themselves as Bernie supporters . And , as the ONLY Bernie delegate to get elected from CA to the DNC , I was looking out for that .

Because none of the candidates , to my recollection , ever identified themselves as Bernie supporters . And , as the ONLY Bernie delegate to get elected from CA to the DNC , I was looking out for that . If there were no candidates running that supported Bernie , then how could they have gotten elected . And Ken Martin -LRB- Vice Chair , ASDC President -RRB- , who endorsed Ellison for the chair . Its that kind of thing that leads me to not trusting anything else in the article . No real need to change anything .
