Hypothermia is no joke . A few months ago , while she was recovering from foot surgery at home , she watched as people from miles away traveled to Standing Rock to join the growing movement and express solidarity . SPONSORED Hundreds of Native Americans and their non-native allies gathered on a bridge just north of the Oceti Sakowin camp in Cannonball , North Dakota to remove burnt vehicles and a police barricade that has been blocking traffic on Highway 1806 and protecting pipeline construction since October 27 . The Army National Guard monitors a northern barrier on Highway 1806 . Anyone who wants to oppose it no longer has access . The blockage also unjustly restricts the free movement of local residents and hurts the Tribe economically by cutting off travel to and from the Prairie Knights Casino . We are done with flood lights and armored military trucks . Unicorn Riot , a volunteer run decentralized media collective , was also filming on the front line . At least 26 people had to be evacuated by ambulance to three hospitals in the surrounding areas . Sophia Wilansky , a 21-year-old water protector from New York City , was air lifted to County Medical Center in Minneapolis where surgeons are trying to save her arm and hand and prevent a possible amputation . Standing Rock medics say they have proof it was a concussion grenade thrown by police . She will need multiple surgeries to try to gain some functional use of the arm and hand . I died a thousand deaths today and will continue to do so for quite some time . Medics have compiled a list of other injuries including an elder who lost consciousness and was revived on the scene ; a woman who was shot in the face by a rubber bullet with subsequent eye injury and compromised vision ; a young man with internal bleeding who was vomiting blood after a rubber bullet hit his abdomen ; and a man shot in the back near his spine by a rubber bullet causing blunt force trauma and a severe head laceration . They are spraying high-pressure water on unarmed people . My message is simple . Contact the President . Contact your representatives . Some of the larger banks include Wells Fargo . Make a statement . I got shot by a rubber bullet and it hurts . I got sprayed by tear gas . Dr. Rupa Marya , a professor of medicine at UCSF Medical School who works with the Standing Rock Medical and Healer Council , points to case reports in medical journals showing that rubber bullets can cause death by hemorrhage . During my trip to Standing Rock earlier this month , water protectors consistently expressed frustration that the State of North Dakota , most especially through a militarized police force , is protecting the pipeline .
