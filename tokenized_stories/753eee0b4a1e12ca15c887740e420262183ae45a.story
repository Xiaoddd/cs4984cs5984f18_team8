President Trump on Tuesday signed orders to advance construction of the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines . The orders do not grant the final permits needed for the oil pipelines but will move both projects toward approval , a person familiar with the action said . The Trump administration began to inform lawmakers starting late Monday that the orders were coming . The orders fulfill Trump 's campaign promise to approve both pipelines , which have staunch support from the oil industry and the GOP but are strongly opposed by Democrats and environmentalists . The White House did not provide more details . Former President Obama rejected Keystone in November 2015 , citing the need to show international leadership on climate change . If fully built by developer TransCanada Corp. , Keystone would run from Alberta , Canada , which contains a bulk of that nation 's oil sands , to the Gulf Coast in Texas , bringing heavy oil sands petroleum to refineries . Last month , the Obama administration ordered a comprehensive environmental impact statement to be conducted on the Dakota Access pipeline before any decision could be made on building its final section below Lake Oahe in North Dakota . The pipeline has been the subject of international protests that have fired up environmentalists and indigenous rights activists . They say that the pipeline threatens the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe , and further development of oil infrastructure threatens the climate . The two projects require different approvals . Keystone needs a presidential permit to build across the Canadian border , while Dakota Access , developed by Energy Transfer Partners , needs an Army Corps of Engineers easement to build under Lake Oahe . The planned orders were first reported Tuesday by Bloomberg . Sign up for our daily email .
