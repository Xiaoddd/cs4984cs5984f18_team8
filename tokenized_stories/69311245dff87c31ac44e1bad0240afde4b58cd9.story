The unfortunate part of the Post article is that Wilansky is portrayed as something of a victim . It was dark , and she was bundled up in a puffer jacket against the 20-degree temperature . She had volunteered , along with three others , to hold the ground in front of the span , which the protest army had cleared of police - and pipeline-company barricades earlier in the day . She fumbled to pick up a plastic shield , but the onslaught escalated . The explosion had ripped out the radius bone , muscle , nerves and arteries of her left arm , and her hand was hanging by a few threads of flesh . It was the police who were on guard . Wilansky was injured when she and a group of her fellow political extremists attacked the police who were guarding the bridge . They were also attempting to assemble some sort of explosive device , which is when Wilansky was hurt . This from the New York Times : Around the time of the explosion , Lieutenant Iverson said , officers fired sponge and beanbag rounds at three people who had shielded themselves behind a length of plywood near a burned vehicle on the bridge . The three were thought to be acting suspiciously and refused orders to emerge , he said . Officers saw someone roll metal cylinders to the protesters by the burned vehicle , Lieutenant Iverson said , and then heard an explosion . Afterward , he said , several protesters ran up , pulled a woman from under the vehicle and ran off . Three propane canisters were recovered from the vicinity of the explosion early Tuesday , he said . The larger point here is that the violence on the Backwater Bridge happened because the protesters provoked it . The protesters repeatedly attacked the pipeline workers and their equipment . When the police put up road blocks and check points to try and stop the violence , the protesters attacked the police . Had the protesters been peaceful , had they restrained themselves to lawful tactics , nobody -LRB- including Wilansky -RRB- would have been hurt .
