However ... The Principles as they are written now are not stopping banks from financing disaster projects that are destroying our climate . We call on the Equator Principles Association to agree in Brazil to a full revision process for the Principles , so that they reflect at minimum two solid commitments : Stop financing climate disasters : Include a full commitment to the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to below 2 degrees , aiming for 1.5 degrees ; Include stringent and binding criteria that all projects to be financed under the Equator framework be fully aligned with reaching the Paris Agreement goals ; and for this reason : Explicitly exclude all new fossil fuel extraction , transportation and power projects from financing under the Equator Principles .
