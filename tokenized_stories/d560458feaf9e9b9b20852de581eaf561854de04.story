Endangered Arbutus tree on SPAET with a view over the Salish Sea . Photo : Rick Stiebel SPAET SPAET is a traditional mountain area in shared Coast Salish territories , located 20 km north of Victoria on Vancouver Island in British Columbia . In November 2006 , a sacred First Nations cave on SPAET was bulldozed over -LRB- left -RRB- , part of an orchestrated land grab by greedy real estate developers and their political cronies . Langford 's Bear Mountain Interchange Ben Isitt December 2007 Heritage Conservation Act or Heritage Destruction Act Cheryl Bryce Songhees Lands Manager 24 May 2007 SPAET cave was finally and fully blown up at Christmas 2006 . Two condemning reports have since been written : one by Songhees member and lands manager Cheryl Bryce on the failure of the Heritage Conservation Act to protect aboriginal sites like SPAET ; the other by historian Ben Isitt on the murky political dealings behind Langford 's Bear Mountain Interchange .

The partial destruction of the sacred cave site on SPAET was discovered in November 2006 by Coast Salish - Songhees member Cheryl Bryce -LRB- above -RRB- . A real estate scheme backed by local politicians receiving economic kickbacks is despoiling SPAET -LRB- right -RRB- . Behind their smooth and sanctimonious rhetoric , elected public officials continue to operate with the same colonialist contempt for First Nations that tarnishes the 150 year colonial history of British Columbia -LRB- BC -RRB- . SPAET Stand , 16 November 2006 . Photo : Don Knight Tsartlip Chief Chris Tom -LRB- above , with Songhees members David Dick and Cheryl Bryce -RRB- took part in the SPAET Stand . The Tsartlip have fought to establish their right to hunt , as protected in their 1852 Douglas Treaty . On 21 December 2006 , they won their case in the Supreme Court of Canada : R. v. Morris . The case was covered by the international press and set a precedence for treaties being paramount to provincial law . But without a land base such as SPAET , the Tsartlip have no place to practice their indigenous rights . Bear Mtn Resort sales office , Victoria , 2006 . Photo : Karen Wonders -LRB- red text added -RRB- To stop the developers from further despoiling the sanctity and ecological integrity of the SPAET cave , First Nations activists and their non native supporters organized a pre dawn blockade on 16 November 2006 . They stopped the machinery citing ethical , spiritual and environmental grounds . See the two minute YouTube video that records the moment of confrontation -LRB- below -RRB- .

In an aggressive retaliatory act with racist outbursts , over 100 male construction workers surrounded and assaulted the small vunerable group of six protesters -LRB- left -RRB- . The next day , 17 November 2006 , Bear Mountain Resort developers served punitive one million dollar law suits on Cheryl Bryce and other Songhees and Tsartlip members . The vengeful developers also initiated SLAPP injunctions to authorize the RCMP to arrest peaceful SPAET protesters and to ban Songhees lands manager Cheryl Bryce from setting foot on the mountain . Present at the SPAET Stand on 16 November 2006 were Grand Chief Stewart Phillip , president of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs , and vice president , St ` at ` imc Nation Chief Robert Shintah -LRB- right -RRB- .

Photo : Paul Griffiths Hidden from sight behind the entrance to the limestone cave on SPAET is an underground grotto with a beautiful crystal clear pool of water -LRB- left -RRB- . First Nations elders say such waters were used traditionally for bathing in spiritual rituals that continue to be important to Coast Salish culture . In an act of vandalism , Bear Mountain Corporation pumped the water out of SPAET cave and filled it with old tires and tree stumps . According to the Heritage Conservation Act , the damaging , desecrating or altering of places with historical or archaeological value is illegal . But no government laws exist to prohibit or impede development on private property . Until a few years ago the SPAET cave was protected as forest land . Now sold to Bear Mountain Corporation , no protection exists for the SPAET cave or other sacred sites such as the Guardian and Transformation Rocks . Prior to the First Nations stand , Bear Mountain Resort dumped debris from the clearcut mountainside of SPAET over the cave entrance in a crude attempt to cover up evidence of its existence . On discovering the wanton damage , Songhees lands manager Cheryl Bryce was shocked -LRB- right -RRB- . It expresses their unity with the natural and spiritual environment . It embodies their traditional knowledge of spirits , places , land uses , and ecology . Coast Salish protestors say the SPAET cave is sacred and important as cultural heritage . BC 's Archaeological Society president , Eric McLay , confirms that limestone caves with pools of water inside have been powerful spiritual places traditionally kept secret by Coast Salish people . Speleologist Paul Griffiths is one of the few non - native people to have been invited inside the SPAET cave .

Another act of vandalism on SPAET is the ruining of a rare and vunerable Arbutus habitat -LRB- left -RRB- . Bear Mountain Resort 's slash - burning of this most beautiful and elegant of native Coast Salish aboriginal heritage trees is despicable .

Wonders -RRB- Road infrastructure on Vancouver Island is controlled by the heavy handed BC Ministry of Transportation which is partnered with Stantec , the American based engineering empire that rose to power by paving over Edmonton , Alberta . Stantec 's map reveals its nature wrecking plans for the Saanich Inlet -LRB- left -RRB- . Note that the proposed Malahat Corridor will open up SPAET for further development and facilitate the sly subdivision plans of Three Point Properties at Bamberton . Its secretive sale to the Bear Mountain Corporation in 2001 adds up to a form of political favouritism that has still to be detailed . The controversial interchange will connect to the Bear Mountain Parkway which is being bulldozed across the mountain slopes of Goldstream Watershed . This degradation of the already endangered rainforest ecosystem and salmon bearing river further puts at risk the long term viability of the Chum salmon fishery shared by the five Saanich tribes at Goldstream Indian Reserve -LRB- left -RRB- . SPAET is being destroyed by a clandestine land grab . In 2001 the BC government transfered 44 hectares of land to Western Forest Products for the giveaway price of one million dollars . Within six months the land was flipped to the Bear Mountain Resort developer for the same price and zoning regulations were altered , courtesy of the local pro big business Langford mayor . The result is a cancer - like urban sprawl of golf courses , residential subdivisions , roads , hotels and strip malls . All of this can be easily observed by anyone using Google Earth satellite and mapping technology -LRB- right -RRB- . Black bear in Goldstream Watershed .

Photo : Google Earth The sleaze surrounding the Bear Mountain Resort land grab involves big business and elected officials eager to make a quick buck . Community and environmental issues such as municipal water supply , pollution from golf courses and sewage , changes to the fragile watershed hydrology , public transport infrastructure , etc. have hardly been addressed . Bears and other large wild animals have no place to go as their mountainside habitat disappears -LRB- left -RRB- . Ancient cedar in Goldstream Watershed . Photo : Capital Region District The SENCOTEN name for Goldstream River is above . The mouth of Goldstream River is at the head of a long fjord known as the Saanich Inlet . An important Saanich chum fishery was located here as well as an ancient village and a burial ground . Goldstream River and SPAET are part of the Goldstream Watershed . As a result of clearcut logging , only a fraction of the once magnificent old growth forest survives , a remnant of a now rare Douglas fir ecosystem with its colossal ancient trees -LRB- left -RRB- . The development of SPAET further degrades the Goldstream Watershed and puts its few remaining big tree veterans at risk . Goldstream River was first described by settlers in the 1860s when a small gold rush occured here . In the 1870s , Goldstream River was surveyed by the Indian Land Commission , an early government agency formed to assign Indian Reserves . In 1884 , colonial officials determined the boundaries of the Goldstream Land District . Goldstream River was first dammed in 1892 to provide drinking water for the growing city of Victoria , 16 km to the south . In 1897 one of the first hydro plants in Canada was built here to supply power for Victoria . Not until 28 July 1913 did the government allot a tiny 12 acre parcel of estuary land on Saanich Inlet to the five Saanich Indian tribes , called Goldstream Indian Reserve No. 13 . Since the colonization of Vancouver Island in 1858 , the hydrology of the Goldstream Watershed has been severely altered by mining , clearcut logging and the building of railways , roads , dams and subdivisions . Not until 1998 did local environmental groups suceed in forcing the government to stop clearcut logging in park reserves and municipal drinking water reservoirs including Goldstream Watershed . The hydro plant on Goldstream River operated until 1958 when a provincial park was founded . The spectacle of wild salmon returning from the ocean to their natal stream where they were hatched has astounded countless scores of visitors to Goldstream Park . The salmon die as they deposit their eggs in the gravel beds of Goldstream River -LRB- right -RRB- , and become part of the rich temperate rainforest biodiversity that is a world class and priceless nature treasure .

Photo : Mary Coakley , Turtle Island Native Network Few visitors to Goldstream Park realize that an ancient Saanich village and gravesite is located here as well as the Goldstream Indian Reserve which is shared by the Malahat , Pauquachin , Tsartlip , Tsawout and Tseycum peoples . Tsartlip youth hold wreaths made of rainforest ferns -LRB- above -RRB- while performing a traditional ceremony in Goldstream River , a place of cultural heritage and a resource site for salmon gaffing . A contemporary print design by Tsartlip artist Chris Paul conveys how vital salmon are to his community -LRB- right -RRB- . The Saanich aboriginal right to fish is enshrined in two treaties signed in 1852 . This indigenous right does not mean very much , however , if there are no chum salmon stocks left due to habitat degradation caused by urban sprawl . The Goldstream Watershed is the primary source of drinking water for Victoria and its surrounding communities -LRB- about half a million people -RRB- and has been intensively engineered to support a complex system of dams and reservoirs , increased to maximum capacity in 2003 . Water flow to Goldstream River for salmon spawning is artificially controlled . Also wild salmon stocks are artificially managed by the Goldstream Salmon Hatchery . Photo : Alcheringa Gallery American Dipper , Goldstream Park , 2005 . Photo : Mike Yip In the fall of 2006 , a record low level of returning Chum salmon was recorded at Goldstream River . According to the BC Conservation Foundation , the status of the wild stock salmon is of extreme concern with the possibility of extirpation . A last minute restoration effort constructing artificial fish habitat has been initiated in the Greater Georgia Basin including Goldstream River . Not much habitat recovery is possible while the regenerated forests of Goldstream Watershed continue to be fragmented by roads and subdivisions . Contamination from the unregulated expansion of golf courses is worsening due to the poisons and toxic chemicals used to maintain the wasteful artificial greens . This is also of concern as scientific studies have shown that people who regularly play golf and live near golf courses risk elevated pecentages of neurological cancers . Habitat diminishment and the contamination of the Goldstream Watershed is bad news for the Western Red-backed salamander -LRB- right -RRB- . This tiny and vunerable creature does not move around much in its territory of a few square meters . Like many other such amphibian species , it is dependent on damp and rainforest habitat . Tsartlip and Songhees land managers have documented pollution from toxic construction materials and raw sewage at Bear Mountain Resort . Salamander , Goldstream Park , 2001 . Photo : Allen Chartier Eagle on snag tree , Goldstream Park , 2006 . Photo : Ngawangchodr The Marbled murrelet is a bird species dependent on old growth forests . Like the ancient trees in which the females nest , the species is on the verge of extinction . One of the last recorded birds was seen in 1998 in the Goldstream Watershed . In recent years , White - headed eagles have returned to the estuary of Goldstream River to feast on salmon carcasses during the spawning season -LRB- left -RRB- . To protect the eagles , the BC Ministry of Environment has initiated a an eagle eatery and conservation strategy . Conservation efforts by the government to protect Goldstream Park are recent in comparison to the Coast Salish peoples who have stewarded the salmon and forest resources here for millenia . Parks are another form of colonial land takeover , like resource exploitation and urban expansion . The increasing urbanization of Vancouver Island is displacing many of the native wildlife species , especially large carnivores such as bears and cougars . Not long ago these species were ruthlessly hunted for bounties as part of the official predator control program . Today the most serious threat to their survival is loss of habitat due to urban sprawl . The magnificent cougar in its primaeval forest home is shown here in a diorama -LRB- right -RRB- at the Royal BC Museum . In reality , the cougar has today vanished from most places on Vancouver Island and the mainland of British Columbia . First Nations field researchers have found on SPAET evidence of an old cougar den and an active one . Both are on a mountain slope being leveled for golf courses at Bear Mtn Resort . Also in the Goldstream Watershed , in October 2006 , a black bear was observed eating a salmon carcass . It is not acceptable that this rich and endangered rainforest biodiversity that enraptures and amazes countless visitors and groups of school children every year be at risk . Canada signed the 2004 Convention on Biological Diversity . Moreover international edicts such as the United Nation 's Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Berlin Declaration on sustainable tourism and biological diversity are ignored .

Another example of desecration is an ancient Songhees grave site with prehistoric boulder circles and massive burial cairns in Beacon Hill Park has been frequently disturbed , the latest incident occuring in 1987 : Aboriginal Burial Cairns . The Douglas Treaties were never honoured by Canada or BC . Treatied land included important winter villages , food gathering sites , hunting grounds and fisheries that were not protected .
