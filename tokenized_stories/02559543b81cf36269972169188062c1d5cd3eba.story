According to a report from Food and Water Watch , an American consumer rights watchdog , at least three Canadian banks -- Scotiabank , TD and RBC -- are helping to bankroll the 1,800 km pipeline that travels directly through the traditional and treatied territories of the Standing Rock Sioux . On Thursday , 141 unarmed , peaceful Standing Rock land defenders were arrested by armed police from at least seven states with militarized weapons and tactics . As many have pointed out , that same day the white insurrectionists behind the armed occupation at Malheur Wildlife preserve in Oregon were acquitted . Thursday 's arrests mean that the protestors have been pushed off the construction site and the project is fast-approaching completion , despite the sovereign wishes of the Sioux and their allies . State-sponsored violence has protected the interests of fracked gas and pipeline companies and the investments of the Big Banks . It 's not just Canada 's Big Banks that have gotten involved at Standing Rock . Some Black Lives Matter - Toronto activists , including Janaya Khan , visited the Oceti Sakowin Camp in late August as part of a larger BLM solidarity delegation . A so-far anonymous call-out requested that allies check-in to the reservation to confuse the police and confound their efforts . These efforts are impressive -- and so far keep Indigenous people at the centre of the fight for clean water and air . The camps at Standing Rock -- that have reached as many as 8,000 inhabitants at times -- are certainly inspirational and any allies who put their bodies on the line with the brave land defenders should be lauded . But as long as billions of dollars in Canadian financing are driving the oil and gas infrastructure criss-crossing this continent in the name of an unsustainable and foolhardy industry , we 're going to need more than check-ins to stop it .
