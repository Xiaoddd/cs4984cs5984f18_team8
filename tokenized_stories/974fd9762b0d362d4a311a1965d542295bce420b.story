Since ETP was permitted to proceed with the pipeline project in early 2017 following an executive action from Donald Trump -LRB- though a full environmental review is still pending -RRB- , one might well wonder why the company would still pursue litigation to silence its opponents . The answer is clear : even when protests , such as the one led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe against the Dakota Access Pipeline , do not achieve their immediate goals , the publicity they engender can help turn the tide of public sentiment against the unfettered corporate exploitation of resources and its devastating environmental consequences . Activism also inspires other acts of resistance , such as the robust divestment campaign that has caused creditors and investors in ETP to reallocate millions of dollars elsewhere . For these reasons , ETP is still worried . Such suits have been dubbed SLAPPs -LRB- Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation -RRB- . They are typically brought by corporate plaintiffs against groups and activists with comparatively meager resources . The suits threaten foundational First Amendment principles by chilling and penalizing vigorous debate on issues of public interest . Namely , such suits cause activists to hemorrhage their limited resources fighting the litigation , and many are then also hit with increased operating expenses , such as higher costs of obtaining insurance , and dampened donor enthusiasm . Additionally , SLAPPs strike fear in the hearts of other would-be activists , who may not have the stomachs or pocketbooks to risk costly court battles and public smear campaigns , causing some to self-censor . Because the goal is to drain the defendants financially and emotionally , the companies are often not amenable to alternative dispute resolution : cases are far less likely to settle long before trial , as in ordinary litigation , and fees can easily run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars . The resulting climate for activists is worrisome . SLAPPs are not new . In fact , twenty-eight U.S. states -LRB- though notably not the federal government -RRB- and numerous other countries have already passed laws which attempt to prevent SLAPPs , mostly by creating mechanisms for such suits to be quickly dismissed at little cost to the defendant . What is relatively new is the decision by companies to ramp up the potential impact of their cases by bringing charges under the federal racketeering statute called RICO -LRB- Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -RRB- , a law which facilitates suits against sprawling criminal enterprises . Plus , RICO allows for litigants to claim treble damages when they allege to have been harmed by the actions of an established criminal organization . The lawsuit against Greenpeace discredits the massive , Indigenous-led movement that coalesced around opposition to the pipeline . TigerSwan employed military counterinsurgency tactics to suppress pipeline opposition , referring to protestors as jihadists and the movement as an insurgency . Wetterer is right to discern a new corporate strategy . Notably , this is the second RICO case filed against Greenpeace by the same law firm . As the process grinds on , Greenpeace will continue to expended resources and energy defending against the suit . In focusing on environmental advocacy groups , the suit diminishes the place of Native leaders at the vanguard of the resistance . Indeed , it positions them as rubes , claiming that the predominately white organizations that rallied to their side were in fact taking advantage of them rather than following their lead . Lawsuits are not the only method that corporations are pursuing to chill dissent . ETP hired TigerSwan , a private security contractor that employed military counterinsurgency tactics to suppress pipeline opposition . In TigerSwan internal communications uncovered by the Intercept , the security firm compared protestors to jihadists and the water protector movement to an insurgency . The ensuing coordination between TigerSwan and law enforcement blurred the distinctions between them . And rather than coming to the defense of citizens against such abuses , state legislatures have been in a race to the bottom to propose laws that instead criminalize protest . Some were proposed in response to Black Lives Matters activities and some motivated by environmental and labor activism , highlighting the degree to which legislators are in thrall to corporations . These laws , often reacting to the protests of black and brown people , also set in sharp relief the degree to which some efforts by corporations to protect the economic status quo are wrapped up with white supremacy . Given the increasingly urgent stakes , advocates for a more just and sustainable future will not be easily silenced . While we have you ... ... we need your help .
