Covert surveillance , law enforcement , federal courts , local tabloid fodder . Respondeat superior . If it can be destroyed by the truth it should be . Some messaging will change , but the perception management will surely continue . One presence of note I omitted from my last post : Netizens for Progress and Justice . The website has been up since October and exclusively covers the Dakota Access Pipeline protests . Rob Port is the editor of the SayAnything blog and a columnist for the Forum News Service .

Our government spends billions of dollars on creating education and employment opportunities for Indians , not to mention the billions spent on personal assistance for the Indians themselves in the form of housing money , food money , welfare money , etc. . But none of this is working . it seems to me as though most of these Indians are perfectly content to live there . They were likely raised in housing projects by their parents , who in turn were probably raised in housing projects themselves . The reservation system needs to end . This is just something to keep in mind as the saga continues , as Port is certain to keep writing about it . Give Kenneth Lipp a round of applause .
