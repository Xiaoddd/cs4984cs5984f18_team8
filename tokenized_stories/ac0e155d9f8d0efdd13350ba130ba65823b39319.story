The Trump administration will approve the pipeline reversing a decision from President Obama . The move by the State Department comes 16 months after Obama blocked construction of the 1,200-mile pipeline , which would ship crude from Canada 's western oil-sands region to refineries on the Gulf Coast . The pipeline became the subject of major lobbying efforts by both oil industry supporters and environmental groups , which turned the project into the focus of their climate change campaigns . Secretary of State and former Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson recused himself from the process . Republicans and oil industry backers have touted its economic benefits and the thousands of construction jobs it would create , while environmentalists warned the oil artery could pose huge spill risks and would stoke development in Alberta 's oil sands region , unleashing a vast amount of the carbon dioxide that scientists say is causing climate change . The White House would not confirm the report , and spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at the daily briefing that he would have update on Keystone on Friday . While the permit will eliminate a crucial barrier for the pipeline , other hurdles still remain , including winning approval for the project in Nebraska and winning over landowners there who have denied it the right of way . The president and his administration also continue to struggle on another of his pipeline-related promises : Where the steel for the pipeline will come from . TransCanada has said roughly half of the steel for Keystone XL will come from the U.S. . That steel will come from Welspun Tubular in Arkansas , a subsidiary of India-based Welspun Group . The decision is expected in late September . Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO . You can unsubscribe at any time . TransCanada says 90 percent of landowners along the proposed route have signed voluntary easement approvals , but there are still holdouts .
