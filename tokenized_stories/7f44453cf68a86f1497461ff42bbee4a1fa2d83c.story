Among them is Deia Schlosberg , an Emmy-winning documentarian who was recording nonviolent protests against the Dakota Access pipeline for an upcoming film . On Oct. 14 , the trespass charge was dropped and replaced with a misdemeanor charge of rioting . Dickson continued : The first charge was frivolous . We want reporters to report the news whether we agree with their politics . She wrote : I am a climate reporter ; my specialty is following the story of how humankind is creating a grave problem for civilization by continuing to flood the atmosphere with greenhouse gases through the burning of fossil fuels and other industrial processes . Schlosberg noted that two other reporters , Lindsey Grayzel and Carl Davis , are charged with felonies for covering concurrent anti-Dakota Access actions in Washington state . Two arrests occurred in North Dakota on Sept. 13 , and the other two were arrested at separate direct actions in Iowa earlier this month . The nonprofit , independent media collective further noted that fighting the arrests costs time and eats into scarce financial resources . It continued : Attacks on media organizations create an environment where the actions of DAPL security and law enforcement can not be properly documented by the press . This makes it possible for state -LRB- or corporate mercenary -RRB- forces to commit serious human rights violations while avoiding accountability for their actions . On his website , Fox posted an open letter demanding that the state drop all charges against Schlosberg . Fox warned that fundamental American freedoms are at stake if journalists can not safely perform their jobs for fear of arrest . He concluded : This is not only about reporting on the climate-change movement . Journalists have also been arrested reporting on Black Lives Matter , the movement for Native rights , and many other important movements the corporate media fails to cover . The First Amendment and the Constitution are at stake in this case . If we lose it , we lose America too .
