Home Archive The Truth Lies Buried at Fort Laramie The grave of an unidentified U.S. Army soldier at Fort Laramie in Wyoming by Indian Country Today Jun 8 , 2011 The Truth Lies Buried at Fort Laramie Driving my VW Bug along Interstate 70 in early January 1973 , I was crossing the wide Missouri and on to Denver to report for work as a historian with the National Park Service . With both a degree and employment in hand , and aware that the academic job market for historians had crashed , I felt extremely lucky . My first field assignment was to prepare a report on the Fort Laramie National Historic Site in southeastern Wyoming . Although inexperienced in Park Service practices , I drove up to the fort hoping to learn what preservation at a historical park was all about . It was not what I expected . Guarding the closed entrance gate , he informed me that AIM had threatened to burn down Fort Laramie . Alarmed by the threat , the superintendent had closed the fort for the day as federal law-enforcement officers rushed to the park from duty stations in the general area . It developed into an important center where the Lakota Sioux , along with the Northern Cheyenne and Northern Arapaho , among other free-roaming tribes , came to barter furs and buffalo hides for trade goods . Their presence antagonized the Indians , resulting in occasional attacks on overland travelers . Army activity at Fort Laramie and across the Northern Plains proved fateful for the Native tribes , with two major treaties , two wars and the decisive loss of a way of life . The Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 sought to reduce armed conflict between Indians and whites , offering annuities as well as curbs on white encroachment in return for Indian guarantees to let whites travel along the trails to points farther west . But many Indians and whites deemed the treaty unsatisfactory . In late November 1864 , along Sand Creek in eastern Colorado Territory , U.S. volunteer troops massacred at least 165 Cheyenne and Arapaho men , women and children , heightening Indian resentment of whites all across the plains . Meeting with Indians at Fort Laramie , government negotiators led by William Tecumseh Sherman -LRB- soon to be named Commanding General of the United States Army -RRB- agreed to abandon the Bozeman Trail and the new forts , leaving the Powder River country of Wyoming and Montana as Indian hunting territory . Of special consequence , the treaty established the Great Sioux Reservation covering all of present-day South Dakota lying west of the Missouri River , and including the Black Hills plus a small part of North Dakota . At the end , and in contradiction to terms of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 , the Sioux lost the Black Hills through manipulative pressure by top-level military and political leaders , backed up by the U.S. Congress . By the early 1880s white market-hunters were obliterating the buffalo herds , and within the next decade the Indians lost much more of their reservation lands . In 1890 the army pulled out of Fort Laramie , and left about 60 standing buildings to be sold at public auction . The state of Wyoming purchased the fort in 1937 and donated it to the National Park Service the following year . By the early 1960s Fort Laramie National Historic Site had begun receiving large numbers of visitors curious about the history of the westward movement . For sure , had AIM leaders actually shown up and bothered to take the ranger-led tour of the fort , they would have been even more irritated . The army had built the barracks in 1873-1874 to accommodate a hundred or more additional cavalrymen , thereby strengthening its mounted forces to strike the enemy : those Indians who refused to accept confinement on their reservation or abandonment of traditional hunting areas . But what one sees today in the barracks is mainly where the soldiers ate and slept . They suffered the worst consequences . And without their presence , the military would have had little need to build forts on the Northern Plains . Certainly this was the case . But surely , most of the truly consequential actions of the Fort Laramie garrison came after the soldiers received orders from the commanding officer and rode out across the plains , possibly to fight and die in combat with American Indians . It is estimated that about two-fifths of the entire U.S. Army served on the Northern Plains at the height of the Great Sioux War . And of those soldiers not stationed at Fort Laramie , many stopped at the fort for rest and replenishment . Aided by its bases at Fort Laramie and elsewhere , the military effectively concluded the Great Sioux War by the summer of 1877 . During the conflict , both General Sherman and especially his subordinate -LRB- and successor -RRB- , General Phil Sheridan condoned a kind of total war against the Plains Indians , somewhat akin to their Civil War strategies that had devastating effects in Georgia and the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia . Surely the most notorious failure was the aborted effort to protect Sioux tribal rights once the Black Hills gold rush began in 1874-1875 . Threatening to withhold food rations , the delegation used a sign-or-starve ploy to force tribal acquiescence . Although park interpretation mentions the Black Hills at times , it avoids any clear indication that the government grabbed this land back from the Lakota . Negotiations for that 1868 treaty took place at Fort Laramie , and without doubt comprised the single most important historical occurrence at the fort . With so many Indians forced onto reservations and buffalo reduced almost to extinction so that they no longer threatened to stampede through farmsteads or cattle ranches , most of the Northern Plains were left open for white settlement . The museum exhibit text and film briefly cover the long period of white civilian use of the old fort after the army left in 1890 , but they give little indication of the long-term fate of American Indians who once roamed throughout the area . The policies were intended to convert the tribesmen into farmers and ranchers , much like whites , but they also left the Indians vulnerable to fraudulent manipulation by the government and private sectors , and many inexperienced allottees sold their lands to whites . Assaulted by other government assimilation measures , such as intense pressure to convert to Christianity and forced attendance at Indian schools that required students to speak English language only , tribal reservation life came to include high rates of unemployment , poverty and alcoholism . Persistent racial discrimination fueled these and other consequences , which have affected generations of Indians to this day . It seems the Service did not understand the need to understand . Congress also authorized an Indian memorial at the park to honor those who fought there to defend their way of life . After some hesitation , the National Park Service actively supported the changes , and began promoting Indian participation in ceremonies at the battlefield and including them in park management and staffing . Park Service experience with atonement sites has grown in recent decades , such as at the Sand Creek Massacre site in eastern Colorado . But both of these goals seem out of reach , given the general drift of the centennial plan . In reality , the whites were the aggressive new superpower on the Northern Plains , and if the Indians thought there was a limitless flow of emigrants crossing the plains and spreading out from the Rockies to the West Coast , one could argue that they were right : It is still going on , but from all directions and by whatever means -LRB- including in a VW Bug loaded with academic books -RRB- . In the history profession , assertions of inevitability generally get a negative reception . But given the way Indians had already been treated in the East , South and Midwest , it seems to me that there was a certain inevitability that the whites , with their numbers and their might , would in time subjugate the Northern Plains tribes and take their lands , and that the tribes would be forced to endure a tragic aftermath . And sooner or later , descendants of the empire builders would surely want to commemorate their conquests by preserving celebratory places like Fort Laramie . Tracking the Service through a 35-year career , I know for sure that it has played an Artful Dodger elsewhere , although less so now than in years past .
