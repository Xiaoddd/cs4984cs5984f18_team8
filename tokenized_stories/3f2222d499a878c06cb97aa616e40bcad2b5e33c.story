The slew of upcoming trials , beginning on Monday in Washington state , stem from a series of coordinated actions on 11 October 2016 aimed at shutting down oil sands pipelines . Nine criminal cases include several filed against film-makers and live-streamers who recorded protesters closing the emergency valves on pipelines but did not directly participate in the disruptions . One case was later dropped . Lawmakers in multiple states have also recently pursued new laws aimed at restricting protests and making it easier for police to target demonstrators . Those demonstrations have also led to serious criminal charges , including a case against radio host Amy Goodman , which a judge eventually rejected . Facebook Twitter Pinterest Two well-known documentary film-makers , who had faced decades in prison for filming the 11 October actions , have since had charges suspended or dismissed . But several activists who live-streamed and filmed the actions , including Liptay , are now preparing for trials alongside five demonstrators who were directly responsible for shutting down pipeline valves . Charges include mischief , criminal damage , trespassing and conspiracy . Sam Jessup , a Vermont activist who live-streamed an action at the TransCanada Keystone pipeline in North Dakota , is facing three felony charges , including two conspiracy allegations that could result in 20-year sentences . Even when cases against journalists are ultimately dismissed , the initial charges can have a chilling effect . Facebook Twitter Pinterest Deia Schlosberg . The charges were eventually suspended and will be formally dropped later this year , but only if she commits no further crimes , according to Schlosberg . Lindsey Grayzel , the other independent film-maker whose felony case in Washington was ultimately dismissed , said law enforcement still has not returned her memory cards with footage on them , her phone or her notes . But the ordeal , she said , would not stop her from doing her job . On Monday , Grayzel plans to film the start of the trial of Ken Ward , the 60-year-old subject of her documentary The Reluctant Radical , who is potentially facing 30 years behind bars for targeting the TransMountain pipeline in Skagit County , Washington , on 11 October .

Richard Mollin , Clearwater County attorney in Minnesota , who is handling the cases of Liptay and Johnston , defended the charges , claiming that neither was likely to spend more than a year behind bars if convicted .
