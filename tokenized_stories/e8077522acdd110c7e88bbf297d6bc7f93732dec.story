What You Can Do to Help 1 . Join the Native Tribes March on Washington on Friday March 10 . Over 360 tribes will march from the Mall to the Capitol building . Allies are welcome . Come peaceful , come respectful , show solidarity . 2 . Avoid Exploiters That Feed Off NoDAPL . These people , sites , and groups divert funds , time , and effort from NoDAPL for their own profit or self promotion : Andras Corben Arthan , Earthspirit Community-Falsely claims to be doing Native ceremony . Sean Henry AKA Nanyu Shaabu Eil - Black supremacist claims to be a Native leader . Anne Wilson Schaef - Cult leader claiming to be Cherokee , long history of abusing followers . Sylina TaliniYona AKA Sylina Two Bears AKA Sylina Lynch Buehne , falsely claims to be a Cherokee medicine woman and Mayan Shaman , soliciting donations . Rachel Holzwarth AKA White Eagle Medicine Woman , white imposter claims to be Mohawk . Jose and Laralyn Rivera AKA Joseph and Laralyn Riverwind , lead a phony tribe and are part of an anti-Muslim hate group , Act For America . Jim Petruzzi AKA Greywolf falsely claims to be a Lakota healer , diverts money for NoDAPL . If You Love Native Americans on Facebook - Sells t-shirts falsely claiming to be NoDAPL Maria Torres profile on Facebook - More fake t-shirts , claims Native , actually Vietnamese . TheIndigenousPeoples.com-Sells knockoffs of Native t-shirt artists . sells knockoffs made in China or Vietnam . Rise With Standing Rock , a click bait site run by Rave Mehta . for updates . There are many sites that have falsely reported deaths or attacks by police . This makes the public less likely to believe actual police abuses , which have been numerous . Many racist sites have also spread rumors falsely claiming violence by water protectors or there being armed or committing crimes . Always double check the facts before reposting anything on social media . 4 . Divest from Banks Supporting the Pipeline . Many argue this is the best way to win , now that there is a would-be president with financial ties to the company building the Dakota Pipeline . The US banks listed below are invested in and will profit from Dakota Pipeline . Already numerous tribes and the City of Seattle have divested . If you have accounts with any of these , call , email , and write your bank and ask them to divest . State your concerns forcefully and respectfully and that you will close your accounts and urge others to do the same . Then follow up by doing so and tell your friends what you did , urging them to do the same . ph : 866-249-3302 Corporate Office : 420 Montgomery Street , San Francisco , CA 94104 SunTrust CEO William H. Rodgers Jr. 212-793-1201 Corporate Office : 388 Greenwich Street , New York , NY 10013 Ph : 800-285-3000 and 212-793-0710 DNB Capital U.S. office : 200 Park Avenue , 31st Floor New York , N.Y. . If you can visit their local offices , do so . If you will be in DC , try to visit them there . 6 . Be a Good Ally . The good news is that camps at Standing Rock , and in Florida , Minnesota , and Texas , are far from finished . If you still wish to go : DO NOT ask others to raise funds for you that could instead go to those already there . DO NOT use up the supplies there . Bring your own , including weather appropriate clothing , tents , and fuel . DO follow the directions of Native leaders onsite . This includes no drug or alcohol use , no drums or guitars . This is to protect water , homelands , and sacred sites . This NOT a place for New Age or neo-hippie fantasy role playing . These are good articles worth reading , and apply to the other sites too .
