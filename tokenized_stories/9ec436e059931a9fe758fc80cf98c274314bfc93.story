With contributions from : Franco Bifo Berardi , Christine Delphy , Keller Easterling , Nick Estes , Liz Fekete , Amber A'Lee Frost , Andrea Gibbons , Owen Hatherley , Eric Hazan , Helen Hester , Karen L. Ishizuka , Reece Jones , Costas Lapavitsas , Andreas Malm , Geoff Mann , Jane McAlevey , Ed Morales , David Roediger Nick Srnicek and Wolfgang Streeck . They did not win , but they destroyed Europe . They will not win this time neither , but they are poised to destroy the world . After two centuries of colonial violence , we are now facing the final showdown . After centuries of colonial domination and violence , the dominators of the world are now facing a final showdown : the dispossessed of the world are reclaiming a moral and economic reward that the West is unwilling and unable to pay . The concrete historical debt towards those people that we have exploited can not be paid because we are forced to pay the abstract financial debt . The collapse of capitalism is going to be interminable and enormously destructive , as long as a conscious subjectivity does not emerge . There was a mass mobilisation against this plan , lasting across the whole spring and part of summer . Two people lost an eye , not to mention the others who were injured . The photo of four armed police ordering a woman to undress circulated around the world , and thus allowed not a few people to understand how out-of-control the anti-Muslim hatred might get . Even today I sometimes think I am about to wake up , and that it was all just a nightmare . Finally , we have just witnessed the end of the long bullfightthat the prime minister has been waging against the man who appointed him . So in May we will get to choose between the far Right -LRB- Marine Le Pen -RRB- , a Right that identifies with Thatcher , and a Left that identifies with Blair and Napoleon . A long , long nightmare . Keller Easterling , author of Extrastatecraft In 2016 the world got another bad political superbug . Dissembling with resilience , it tells not the one lie that calls for truth , but the many lies that create a Teflon on which puny rationality slips and slides . Occasionally it appears to be in retreat to galvanize false hope around a customary solution . Then , refueled and refreshed from all the attention , it continues to out-maneuver reasonable conversations and runs rings around earnest punditry . By doubling and inverting the terms of any debate , it defangs those terms and inoculates itself against them . Especially susceptible are those for whom the logics of Capital and neoliberalism are all that is needed to explain concentrations of bullet-proof authoritarian power . Mostly the superbug is pure disposition without content except that luckily it likes to see its shape . So with one foot lightly resting on its neck and attention turned away , maybe what came into view this year was a more dispositional dissensus with surprising powers of its own . But fear must not guide us . While these struggles have faced significant state repression , they instruct us to fight back . The title is apt because every election cycle is a loss for Indigenous peoples . No matter who wins , we still lose , the land is still stolen . Its intention , for years , has been to foment a cultural revolution from the Right , to reconfigure politics and establish itself in power . The cultural revolution from the Right demands a cultural revolution from the Left . If we are to step up to this challenge , we need to root ourselves in the new communities of resistance and develop a vocabulary that , in speaking to issues of human dignity , breathes fresh life into Socialism . Of course , socialism or barbarism has always been the only choice before us , but the false starts and political bombshells of 2016 have been exceptionally dispiriting , especially under the urgent deadline of irremediable global climate catastrophe . It is not enough that we are fighting austerity , neoliberal tyranny , raging war , rising reactionary sentiments and so on , we must fight these battles while the world burns , boils and melts . The work ahead is daunting but winnable , and we must win , for our task is no less than saving the world itself . And as always comrades , be kind to each other , and enjoy yourself -LRB- it 's later than you think -RRB- . Make time for art and laughter , leisure and a bit of luxury , perhaps even romance if you 're of a mind . Devour everything we 're fighting for ; it will sustain you for the work ahead . Andrea Gibbons , author of Land , Privilege , Race : One Hundred Years of Struggle Against Segregation in Los Angeles -LRB- forthcoming -RRB- I listened to my mother last night . Her compassion is causing her physical pain . She talked politics , the death and damage coming . This the threat , this the promise of 2016 . A year of loss and terror . People have been dying for a long time , their beautiful promise robbed by structural injustice and the strip-mining of communities . It huddles around its white supremacist roots , circles its fearful wagons against the world it has engendered . Denies CO2 levels now past the point of no return , demonizes tens of millions worldwide fleeing starvation and war in desperate migrations for survival . Chokes the breath from Black Lives Matter , sets dogs on indigenous peoples rising to protect water and life . Trump offers the select few a rapacious scramble for what resources are left . I hope 2016 made the violence visible to those who could not see it . Most can not choose their side . May those with choice join their movements of love and struggle to listen , learn , and fight side-by-side . Owen Hatherley , author of The Ministry of Nostalgia Everyone is going to note the awfulness of 2016 , and I ca n't disagree , though personally it was considerably less awful than 2015 . Chris Leslie 's Disappearing Glasgow , a photo-book on the clusters of ` high flats ' that the city crammed into infill sites at great speed in the 1960s , and their current fate as an embarrassment the city council would prefer to erase , captures the programme 's ambition , the lives lived in them and the ambiguous results of their ` regeneration ' . 2016 was the 25th anniversary of the collapse of the USSR . The contrast between two accounts of Ukraine and Russia -LRB- and Belarus -RRB- is noteworthy : Svetlana Alexievich 's Second-Hand Time , an almost unbearably moving and unashamedly overwrought lament for the lives destroyed by , and in more cases destroyed by the collapse of , the Soviet Union ; and Sophie Pinkham 's Black Square , a lighter and far subtler account of travelling through Russia and Ukraine in the last ten years , shows a humanity , humour and nuance too often lacking in accounts of the subject . Eric Hazan , author of A History of the Barricade In Paris at the moment you can go and see a work by a very fashionable British artist called Tino Sehgal . It is not an installation , but rather a walk through the architecture of the Palais de Tokyo , lightly fitted , totally empty and uniformly painted in white : a big corridor , a bend , a second corridor where with a dozen steps you get to a staircase going down toward a series of similarly empty white spaces . And to go in you have to queue up to enter in little groups . Since the viewers themselves make up most of the activity , they can not be too numerous to be able to observe one other . You hear hardly anyone speak . The effect is a sort of mute astonishment . Resistance to these developments has been fierce . We have seen an ecology of activisms emerge , operating upon various scales and according to multiple timelines . Tactics have included grassroots direct action , alliances with trade unions , and engagement with political parties . This diversity of approaches has made feminist activism nimble and robust , as demonstrated by the Black Monday protests in Poland . By successfully mobilizing tens of thousands of people , they helped to ensure anti-choice proposals were voted down . And yet , activists repeatedly find themselves on the back foot . We must think ecologically and learn to operate within the contradictions that complex , interconnecting struggles can generate . 2 -RRB- We must not think of pro-choice activism as a single-issue struggle . Feminists of colour have long stressed the necessity of a holistic understanding of reproductive justice . 3 -RRB- Finally , we would do well to look to previous generations of feminist influencers . Karen L. Ishizuka , author of Serve the People : Making Asian America in the Long Sixties 2016 started out as the best year ever . My husband and I were honoured by the Japanese American National Museum . I had the pleasure of having Verso publish my third book . My son premiered his 5th -LRB- and some say his best -RRB- film . My third grandchild was born and my other two turned a robust 9 and 7 . My daughter got married and my husband celebrated his 80th birthday with a badass workout with his trainer . This is now . Reece Jones , author of Violent Borders The good news about the past year is that the long-term structural problems of global capitalism finally had an impact on the politics of Europe and North America . The bad news is that the moment of reckoning resulted in the success of an anti-migrant and closed border politics that drove the Brexit and Trump votes . These outcomes suggest that for the short term in 2017 , more countries around the world will turn to walls and closed border policies . This year had the highest number of deaths at borders ever recorded -LRB- over 6,200 through early December -RRB- and this troubling trend will likely continue as the further hardening of borders will result in ever more dangerous journeys and more deaths for people on the move . In the longer term , the fortress world of closed borders is not sustainable and the history of walls from the Great Wall of China to Medieval city walls suggests that they always come down . The financialisation of capitalism , characteristic of the previous four decades , has probably passed its peak . Financial profits have been stagnating , the rate of growth in developing countries has weakened , and developed countries have simply been stagnating . Slowly and steadily the world economy is entering a new phase . In 2016 the political implications of these developments have started to become clear . The Brexit vote in Britain , the election of Donald Trump in the USA , and the Italian referendum are obvious landmarks . Still , the way has been opened for the Left to recover some of its radicalism . Events in 2016 have shown that the plebeian classes in mature countries are angry with systemic forces , and want sovereignty and democracy . The task for the Left is to reconnect with its historic roots providing a radical , anti-capitalist content to popular demands . Not one , not one and a half , not two , not six : 20 . And Donald Trump has just kicked off his reign by declaring that all climate research at NASA will be terminated . Try to wrap your head around these two facts simultaneously and maintain a modicum of mental health . The moment when the guards and police realised they were outnumbered . Their panic , our euphoria when streaming into the compound , their spasmodic movements , the few minutes when they felt they could do nothing and we that we could do anything . Geoff Mann , author of In the Long Run We Are All Dead : Keynesianism , Political Economy and Revolution Those of us on the Left have much we can and must learn from 2016 , and I think one of the most important lessons is that we must affirm the dignity of all while avoiding the tempting expediency of re-engineering the legitimacy of a system that generates dishonour endogenously . The point can not be to simply give the dishonoured masses sufficient dignity to pull back from the precipice and re-cement the existing social order in some kinder form . That is the Keynesian urge , and it must be resisted . But we must also acknowledge , not ridicule or deny out of hand , the alienation of millions in the hope that they will be shamed into suppressing it . Of course we have to oppose racism and imperialism , gendered and other oppressions . That breeds desperation , and not just on the Right . A somewhere-close-to-peaceful transition to what comes next is impossible without a compelling alternative conception of what it means to live a dignified life . Jane McAlevey , author of Raising Expectations -LRB- and Raising Hell -RRB- : My Decade Fighting for the Labor Movement The vicious tactics used by the Trump campaign throughout the 2016 election cycle are the lifeblood of successful union busters . Turning the class against itself using racism , misogyny , lies , and fear is exactly what workers attempting unionization , or a real all-out strike , face day-in and day-out in the USA and elsewhere . Leftists become liberals on the question of what organizing means , believing that as long as they are deeply committed to the idea of class struggle , and militant -LRB- of course -RRB- , they can win . Wrong . There are no shortcuts , and yes , there are methods . Being content with merely delivering votes to a Democratic Party machine that has yielded few returns is clearly not an option . Latinxs should expect marginalizing attacks from multiple directions . Perhaps the most threatening is an expanding mass incarceration system designed to entrap acculturated citizens of large cities as well as undocumented and legal residents whose citizenship will always be in question . Latinx identity itself will also be subject to a low-intensity warfare against ethnic studies , bilingualism , as well as pressure to abandon racial difference as a form of cultural and class solidarity . There are little Trumps among those choosing to be white instead of working class -- living their miseries as possibilities of a future of bullying , ethnic cleansing , and sexual battery . But the little Trumps congregate among the owners of DIY car washes and franchise restaurants and within the ranks of aggrieved middle management in desperate search of apprentices . Watch out for the little Trumps . But these are not normal times . Absent an alternative , neoliberalism seems likely to mutate into increasingly twisted forms . Its first death was in 2007-8 , when the global economy nearly collapsed under the weight of immaterial speculation . Obituaries were gleefully written , but after a brief moment of respite , neoliberalism returned in renewed austerian form . Not satisfied with its ignominious exit , neoliberalism sought to revive its regime of accumulation . Yet a decade of lacklustre investment , sluggish productivity growth , and surging government debt has left neoliberalism worse off . The UK has seen the longest decline in wages since the beginning of British capitalism , long-term unemployment in the US remains abnormally high , Italian banks are precariously positioned , and Greek and Spanish unemployment remain at Depression-era levels . Under such conditions , increasingly tedious attempts to shore up the status quo are bound to fail . This leads us to the second death of neoliberalism : the emergence of a far right economic nationalism combined with vicious xenophobia and racism . The border has become more important than the market , the wall more significant than Wall Street . Yet there is a significant difference from previous epochal crises of capitalism . In the 1930s , fascism and communism openly competed to defeat liberal capitalism . In the 1970s , neoliberalism had spent decades preparing for the downfall of Keynesianism . Today , no clear competitor is ready . The right-wing resurgence is not the product of strategic foresight and ideological coherence , but opportunists treading well-laid paths to xenophobia and racism . Their incoherent ideologies and tendentious social alliances prevent them from solidifying a new hegemonic bloc . But a breakdown of hegemonic consensus will incite a period of overt coercion , and the contemporary security state should make us all cautious . There are monsters worse than neoliberals . The task for the left now is not just to deploy defensive actions , but also to actively mobilise and organise for the alternative . We must assert the necessity of socialism . This question means speculating about what fascism would look like in the twenty-first century . Historical comparisons allow to sketch analogies rather than homologies : Trump is as far from classical fascism as Occupy Wall Street , los Indignados and La nuit debout are from twentieth century communism . But this is a historical analogy , not a genealogy . Trump is an explosive cocktail of charismatic politics , authoritarianism , contempt of law , radical nationalism , racism , xenophobia , misogyny , homophobia , Islamophobia , and a populist style that consider citizens only as a crowd to mesmerize and mislead . All these features have an incontestably fascist taste , but they simply concern the personality of Trump . The fact is that behind him there is no fascist movement . He is a demagogic billionaire , much more reminiscent of Berlusconi than Mussolini , and he was the nominee of the GOP , a historical pillar of the American establishment itself . Classical fascism championed a strong state ; he defends individualism . All in all , he embodies a xenophobic and reactionary vision of Americanism : a social-Darwinist self-made man , the avenger bringing arms , the resentment of a White population that does not accept becoming a minority in a country of immigrants . Trump is a fascist without fascism , but his campaign is a foretaste of what American fascism could look like .
