Madley spent a decade finding names and recounting the history of an organized genocide against indigenous people in California , a kind of genocide not uncommon across the United States . Scheer and Madley begin by discussing the protests at Standing Rock , and how the latest wave of demonstrations is a reflection of how Native Americans have been historically mistreated . They also discuss past incidences of violence against Native Americans and the power of racism as it spreads from words to actions .
