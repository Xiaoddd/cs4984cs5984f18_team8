The shareholders say the value of their investments could be jeopardized by the negative image created by future confrontations that could result in damage to the company 's reputation . So , they are asking Marathon to prepare a report that describes the review process used to identify and address environmental and social risks in reviewing potential acquisitions . They want the company to consider a number of points , including how environmental and social risks are identified and assessed ; which international standards are used to define the company 's human rights ; and how this information is calculated into business decisions . Jamal Kheiry , communications manager for Marathon , said the company had no comment . The company 's position will be spelled out later in its proxy statement that addresses business to be conducted at the meeting . Human Rights Risks Are Investment Risks The resolution by Marathon shareholders is one of more than two dozen resolutions on environmental matters filed with oil and gas companies . Those resolutions , which address concerns such as reducing methane emissions and curbing global warming , could be considered during annual meetings usually scheduled throughout the spring . The New York State Comptroller 's Office , which manages public employee pension funds that are major shareholders , was the lead sponsor of both resolutions . Although the office declined to discuss the resolution in detail , Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said a year ago that investors had a right to know how Marathon considered the rights of indigenous peoples . Preparing the kind of reports sought through the resolution would require a highly customized study of projects under consideration , the company 's 2017 proxy statement said . Marathon 's Board of Directors argued that the company 's community engagement program provided a forum and allowed adequate opportunity for any group to make its positions known . Similar resolutions addressing environmental and social justice issues with oil and gas companies typically generate around 20 percent approval , he said . A year ago , Marathon sought permission from the Securities Exchange Commission to suppress the resolution . The commission , which regulates publicly traded companies like Marathon , rejected the company 's request . This year , Marathon has not tried to block the resolution and is in discussions with DiNapoli 's office . The solution would have been for the company to engage the people affected by the pipeline , he said . Although Enbridge opposed the resolution and it was defeated , the company nevertheless vowed to update its policy on indigenous peoples and expand its disclosures about how it addresses human rights . The Dakota Access pipeline is part of Marathon 's 8,300 mile pipeline system . It begins in the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota and runs nearly 1,200 miles to Illinois , where it connects to other pipelines that carry oil to refineries as far south as Texas . Along the way , it crosses hundreds of streams , rivers and other waterways , including the Missouri River a half-mile upstream from the Standing Rock reservation . The people of Standing Rock rely on the river for drinking water , irrigation and fishing . A prolonged protest involving people from more than 100 tribal nations , along with veterans and supporters from across the country , began in 2016 during construction of the pipeline . It was designed to carry 470,000 barrels of oil a day . Prior to joining ICN , Hasemyer had an award-wining tenure at The San Diego Union-Tribune as an investigative reporter .
