From the start , this has been an against-the-odds battle . But that opposition finally did arise , and it centered on the last place the pipeline would have to cross : the confluence of the Missouri and the Cannonball rivers . At its heart , however , in the great camp that grew up along the rivers , this was a largely spiritual resistance . As a result , overlapping epochs of sad American history were on display . But it went back further than that : the encampment , with its teepees and woodsmoke hovering in the valley , looked like something out of an 1840s painting . With the exception that this was not just one tribe : this was pretty much all of native North America . The flags of more than 200 Indian nations lined the rough dirt entrance road . If we manage to slow down the fossil fuel juggernaut before it boils the planet , groups like the Indigenous Environmental Network and Honor the Earth will deserve a great share of the credit . Persist , perhaps , even in the face of the new Trump administration . Trump , of course , can try and figure out a way to approve the pipeline right away , though the Obama administration has done its best to make that difficult . Simply spitting on them to aid his friends in the oil industry would clarify a lot about him from the start , which is one reason he may hesitate . For five hundred years , half a millennia , the same grim story has repeated itself over and over again . Standing Rock , like Little Big Horn or Wounded Knee , or for that matter Lexington Green and Concord Bridge , now belongs to our history .
