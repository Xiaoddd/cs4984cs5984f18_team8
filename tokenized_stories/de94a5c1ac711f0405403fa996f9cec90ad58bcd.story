The last three years on Earth have been the warmest on record . The opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline has grown from opposition to the more than 1,100 mile-long oil pipeline to a broader movement against further fossil-fuel development , activists said at the community meeting Monday night in Seattle . Meanwhile , construction is continuing on the Dakota Access Pipeline , after a federal judge Monday denied a motion filed by the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River tribes to stop it . Judge James E.
