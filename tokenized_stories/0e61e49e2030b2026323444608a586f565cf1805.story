Bernhardt , for his part , has a long history as a right-wing influence peddler . Before sidling up to Trump , he spent eight years as a lawyer and lobbyist at the powerhouse firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck . During his time there , according to federal disclosure forms , Bernhardt represented Samson Resources , an oil and gas developer in the American West . He lobbied on behalf of Rosemont Copper , a proposed open pit mine on national forest land in Arizona . Visit Website In the George W. Bush era , Bernhardt was a high-level official in the Interior , where he had a mixed record . On one hand , he presided over the federal protection of the polar bear , flawed though it was . And on the other , he helped craft rules that exempted carbon emissions from regulatory authority . Recently , though , as the incoming administration tried to distance itself from lobbyists , it was announced that Domenech had taken over . It is unclear what role , if any , Bernhardt still has . The Trump team did not provide comment . Like Bernhardt , Domenech served in the Bush administration . Like Bernhardt , he was part of an Interior leadership team that was cozy with fossil fuel interests and plagued by ethics scandals . Domenech was even tangentially involved in the Jack Abramoff corruption affair , as the Denver Post has reported . Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff leaves court after being released on bail on August 12th , 2005m in Los Angeles , California . As Interior falls into the hands of industry advocates and right-wing ideologues , those who care about public lands and wildlife should prepare to fight on at least four fronts . The Corrosion of Conservation Law For years , GOP hardliners have sought to undermine the Endangered Species Act , the Antiquities Act , and the National Environmental Policy Act , among other laws . The White House or the Senate has blocked these efforts in the past , but now the safeguards are largely gone . Watch as legislators like Rob Bishop in the House of Representatives attempt to remove federal protections for specific species , such as the greater sage grouse . Fossil Fuels on Federal Land Trump is a loyal ally of Big Oil , and the industry knows it . Environmentalists , meanwhile , are already preparing for renewed attempts to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling . And , given the disturbing alliance of white nationalists and fossil fuel interests taking shape within the Trump administration , we can expect to see increased crackdowns on frontline communities , especially communities of color , that are resisting extreme extraction and its assorted effects . A Revitalized Land Transfer Campaign The land transfer scheme wants to put hundreds of millions of publicly owned acres into the hands of GOP-controlled state governments . Backed by fossil fuel interests and libertarian politicians , it seeks to rob the American people of their rightful stake in most federal lands . And now , as Trump rises to power , it can expect to have sympathizers , if not full-fledged supporters , at the highest level of government . In order to block land transfer , conservationists should be ready to put unstinting pressure on senators who hail from states where public lands are popular , like Cory Gardner of Colorado and Steve Daines of Montana . And the Canadian border is inching toward the same fate . Lucky for anti-conservationists in Congress , such policies are a ready-made way to roll back environmental protections in the name of national security . Republicans that sit on the House Committee on Natural Resources , for example , have proposed violating the Wilderness Act in order to set up surveillance towers and use off-road vehicles on protected public lands in Arizona . In the Trump administration , that proposal and others like it will have a champion . Efforts to rollback protections for the greater sage grouse and other dwindling species in oil and gas country should spark closer coordination between the anti-extinction movement and climate campaigners . If Congress attempts to transfer federal lands to state ownership , then hikers , bikers , campers , climbers , hunters , anglers , and outdoor retailers , among others , should be ready to put aside their many differences and march on Washington . Our lands and our wildlife embody public wealth , public beauty , and public good . They are not the private piggy bank of oil developers and mining firms . And they are not the property of state governments . They belong to all Americans , regardless of race , class , age , or ideology . And , whether in the courts , on the streets or around the dinner table , we must defend them . Indeed .
