About 20 protesters gathered at the corner of Portage Avenue and Main Street at around 9 p.m. to show their disapproval of the pipeline . Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs Grand Chief Derek Nepinak said that when discussions first started it was a process of manufacturing consent rather than getting true permission . While he was disappointed , Nepinak said he was n't surprised .
