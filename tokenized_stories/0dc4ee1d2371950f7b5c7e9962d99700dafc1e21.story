Deceleration Climate Change : Mitigation . Adaptation . Justice . Giving remembrance on December 29 , 2016 , to those massacred at Wounded Knee Creek 1890 . Strength to the Chief Big Foot memorial riders . The approval is a massive blow to DAPL opponents , who have waged a months-long resistance to the pipeline on the grounds that it violates Indigenous treaty rights and threatens access to clean water . It comes shortly after the Obama administration ordered the corps to conduct a full environmental review of the 1,172-mile pipeline before allowing construction to continue . The corps said it would terminate its plans to release the environmental impact statement . Army Corps has given the US Senate only 24 hour notice on DAPL easement , instead of required 14-day notice . Chase Iron Eyes , Native American attorney and activist of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe , called for water protectors to return to the camps to reengage in peaceful mass civil disobedience to stop the pipeline . Iron Eyes assumed a leadership position at camps after the tribal chairman , Dave Archambault II , called for their dissolution after the Army Corps agreed to a full environmental assessment of the project . See the full statement below . The environmental impact statement was wrongfully terminated . This pipeline was unfairly rerouted across our treaty lands . Attorneys for the Tribe emphasize that the easement can not be granted legally at this time . The Earth Justice release continues : The Tribe will challenge any easement decision on the grounds that the EIS was wrongfully terminated . The Tribe will demand a fair , accurate and lawful environmental impact statement to identify true risks to its treaty rights , including its water supply and sacred places . The Tribe has asked the court for DAPL to disclose its oil spill and risk assessment records for full transparency and review by the public . If DAPL is successful in constructing and operating the pipeline , the Tribe will seek to shut the pipeline operations down . A Native Nations march on Washington is scheduled for March 10 . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and tribes across the country invite allies in America and from around theworld to join the march . Our fight is with Congress and the Trump administration . We call on the Native Nations of the United States to stand together , unite and fight back . Under this administration , all of our rights , everything that makes us who we are is at risk .
