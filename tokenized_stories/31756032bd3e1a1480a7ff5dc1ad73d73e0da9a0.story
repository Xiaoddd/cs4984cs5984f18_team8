One of them is a case study in the need for awareness , cultivating diverse sources and understanding the local ramifications of national news : the ongoing protest at Standing Rock Reservation . Suddenly , the intersection of big energy , commerce , and sovereignty have drawn our attention to an ethnic and cultural group often erased in discussions about diversity . The issue facing Native Americans at Standing Rock , which straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota state line , shows how diversity of representation and perspective can lead to better reporting on issues with universal implications for public health and safety . And the spike in East Coast gas prices after an Alabama pipeline exploded earlier this year , killing one person and injuring six others . The National Transportation Safety Board has made 123 reports of pipeline incidents available on the web . Most are fairly recent , but some date back as far as the 1960s . Tommy Cummings , a digital producer at at the Dallas Morning News , is familiar with the paradoxical fixation-on-yet erasure-of Native peoples in the news . The quantification leads to oversimplification , and with such small numbers , issues that impact Native communities get downplayed as issues that only pertain to a sliver of the country . For his part , Cummings is relying on Twitter for an inside look at Standing Rock . Neither it nor the experiences of Native Americans should be reported on as isolated and disconnected from urbanized life . There are Native centers in Seattle , Chicago , Detroit , Los Angeles , Phoenix . All these places have one or more Native centers , there are Native populations there . As both Cummings and Mays can attest , many are working alongside people with Native American lineage and yet totally unaware . Meredith D. Clark , Ph.D. . Meredith D.
