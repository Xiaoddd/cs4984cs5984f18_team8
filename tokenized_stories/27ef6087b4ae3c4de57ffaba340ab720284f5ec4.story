The PSC has approved an alternative route that TransCanada , the company behind the pipeline , has called unworkable . TransCanada has publicly stated that they are n't sure Keystone XL will ever be built . Funding Keystone XL is out of line with Wells Fargo 's public commitments to both climate action and respect of Indigenous rights . Keystone XL would cross the Ogallala Aquifer , which is one of the country 's largest sources of freshwater . A spill in the aquifer would threaten the drinking water for millions of people . Wells Fargo has an opportunity right now to move away from the financial and reputational risks of Keystone XL . Wells Fargo can stop this funding right away and move to end all of its investments in KXL and tar sands . When we stand together , we are stronger than Big Oil 's money , and in this moment we can still fight back by showing Wells Fargo that they will be held publicly accountable for betting against our climate by investing in dirty fuels .

This pipeline is , simply put , a bad investment -- TransCanada has already stated publicly that they are having a hard time finding shippers and the pipeline may not be economically viable . This pipeline also puts our climate , communities , water , and wildlife at risk while violating the rights of Indigenous peoples -- problems that are directly out of line with your public commitments to climate action and Indigenous rights . Keystone XL would carry 830,000 barrels of the world 's dirtiest oil -- tar sands -- every day from Alberta , Canada , to the U.S. Gulf Coast . It would be responsible for annual greenhouse gas emissions equal to 37.7 million cars -- a disaster for our climate . A report from the University of Nebraska determined that Keystone XL is likely to have 91 significant spills , putting water sources and wildlife habitat at risk along the entire 1,179-mile route . Keystone XL would cross the Ogallala Aquifer , which is one of the country 's largest sources of freshwater . A spill in the aquifer would threaten the drinking water for millions of Americans as well as the livelihood of local ranchers and farmers . The pipeline also lies within one mile of thousands of water wells in Nebraska , Montana , and South Dakota -- putting even more people at risk of losing access to clean water . TransCanada 's Keystone 1 pipeline recently spilled more than 200,000 gallons of oil showing that it 's not a matter of if , but when , a pipeline will spill . You have also claimed that you value Indigenous rights , but your support for TransCanada , the company behind Keystone XL , is out of line with this commitment . Keystone XL would cut directly through Sioux treaty lands and near several other tribal reservations and the historic Ponca Trail of Tears , yet Tribal Nations in Nebraska and South Dakota have not been properly consulted . Instead , TransCanada failed to present a single witness during the Keystone XL hearings to address the damage this pipeline would cause to sacred and historic sites . That 's why five sovereign Indigenous nations in Nebraska signed a treaty opposing Keystone XL and tar sands development . More than 150 Tribes have signed on to this treaty , including every Tribe along the Keystone XL route from Canada to Nebraska , in opposition to this dangerous pipeline . In 2015 , you joined five other major financial institutions to issue a joint statement asking for climate commitments from world leaders negotiating what would become the Paris Climate Agreement . I applaud your efforts , but it 's clear your own business practices do not align with what you 've asked of world leaders since you continue to fund fossil fuel development . Right now , you have an opportunity to move away from the financial and reputational risks of Keystone XL . Wells Fargo can end its role in these loans right away , and move to end all of its other investments in Keystone XL and the tar sands . The world is watching to see whether Wells Fargo will choose to finance the continued violation of the rights of Indigenous people and exacerbation of climate change , or whether they will choose to lead by supporting clean energy and human rights . I urge you not to fund TransCanada 's Keystone XL pipeline . Thank you . button click . The Sierra Club Seal is a registered copyright , service mark , and trademark of the Sierra Club .
