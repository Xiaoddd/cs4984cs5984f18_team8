The weekend included three days of discussion and strategy sessions aimed at strengthening the organization and focusing on our goals at a time of rapidly evolving mass struggles and passionate debates about the direction of revolutionary politics in the Americas . In stark terms , 2017 represented the continuation of repressive and reactionary policies at various levels with the legal harassment of J20 protesters , the detainment of migrant children , further attacks on organized labor , and the political challenge represented by growth of left electoralism and sectors of the left seeking institutional power . This marked the context in which BRRN members have been building a broader analysis of political events while also working to build popular power where we live , where we work , and where we study . One of the strongest messages at the Convention were the examples of involvement in dynamic organizing work despite often difficult circumstances . This range of projects , representing different communities and locations , joining in a common struggle against exploitation and oppression , shows the importance of specific anarchist organization as a powerful tool for work within larger social movements and reflecting both a theory and practice of our shared libertarian socialist ideals . The panel also highlighted the growing internal diversity of BRRN as an organization . Expansion and Diversification At a time when sectors of the left have much work to do representing and centering the communities implicated in political and social struggle , one of the bright spots of the Convention was that it highlighted an increasingly diverse membership both in terms of race and gender . What we envision is an organization of committed militants representing oppressed communities and fighting by their side . The growing diversity of BRRN could also be felt geographically . Towards an Americas Coordinator BRRN was extremely excited to arrange for and welcome several comrades from sister organizations in Latin America as observers to the Convention . Their presence signaled our strengthened ongoing personal and organizational ties between those of us struggling in the belly of the beast of the US empire and the global south of Latin America . As members of anarchist and political organizations in countries with rich traditions of mass revolutionary struggle , they contributed their insight to our discussions . Concretely the purpose would be to organize exchanges among militants , develop shared political analysis and perhaps even stimulate the formation of new political organizations . Convention delegates overwhelmingly expressed their support for this project before hearing more from a panel of the international attendees on their local struggles . During the Convention , members of BRRN recorded messages of support for ongoing struggles against the criminalization of abortion in Argentina and Chile as an expression of solidarity . Members from each organization discussed the political climate of each respective country , setbacks and internal struggles within the organizations , as well as political struggles members had been active participants in . At the end of the meeting , some of the organizations agreed to create a proposal producing a shared analysis to build the Americas Coordinator with the purpose of understanding the social , political and economic systems and structures each country faces and which we seek to dismantle . After the shared analysis is created , the Coordinator will discuss how we can move forward . Each member of BRRN goes through an integration process of 3-6 months consisting of meeting with active members and reading a wide range of materials reflecting on anarchist theory and practice . The new document affirms that BRRN members should continuously strive to meet a certain standard when it comes to their social movement work . In other words , we must do more than attend meetings and dabble in theory . Overall the Convention left attendees inspired that the organization has continued to grow and mature in its level of political discussion and in developing a shared sense of continuity and purpose . For new members Conventions are always important opportunities to connect with the larger organization through meeting members from other locals to participating in wider discussions and plugging into national level committee work .
