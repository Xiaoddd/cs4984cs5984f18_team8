But the victories against it offer lessons for resisting Trump . There , new pictures of the climate fight have emerged , showing communal kitchens , fields of tents and armed guards , hired by the fossil fuel industry , facing off with praying grandmothers . Jade Begay has been stationed in Standing Rock for the last month with the Indigenous Environmental Network -LRB- IEN -RRB- . High winds had sent smoke down the flume of the stove heating her yurt the night before , resulting in a lengthy troubleshooting period and more than a few lost hours of sleep . Resistance against it will continue . And because , as anyone at Standing Rock can tell you , the fight against the pipeline has always been about much more than one piece of infrastructure . At its core has been a centuries-long battle for indigenous sovereignty and an effort to preserve the earth for generations to come . Fight beyond Standing Rock A week ago Sunday , the U.S. Army denied a permit necessary for Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- ETP -RRB- to complete a crucial part of the pipeline . The next morning a harsh blizzard set in , and Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault asked those camped out along the banks of the Cannonball River to return home . As ETP seeks a speedy green light from the courts , one possible path forward for the pipeline is a reroute , diverting the remaining route away from sacred Sioux sites . We have that ability . North Dakota residents know all too well that energy markets look quite a bit different than they did when the project was first proposed in 2014 , at the height of the Bakken shale boom . If the companies are unable to use the pipeline , they could opt to drop their investments in it altogether . Several demonstrations have been held at banks around the country that invested in the pipeline , including giants like Wells Fargo and TD Bank . Long history of struggle While the campaign against the Dakota Access Pipeline continues , there are other long-standing concerns facing the Sioux and indigenous communities around the country . The so-called sacrifice zones pipelines tend to get constructed over are as economic as they are environmental , and delinking the two can be virtually impossible . As of 2014 , 43 percent of Standing Rock Sioux reservation residents lived below the poverty line , joining one in four Native Americans throughout the United States . An estimated 32 percent of homes in the Navajo Nation lack electricity ; thirty-eight percent lack basic water services . Incarceration rates are similarly unequal ; Native men are incarcerated at four times the rate of their white counterparts . Native Americans are also more likely to be killed be police than any other racial group . Despite being a frequent target of regressive policies , Native voices can be hard to find in left organizing spaces . LeBlanc , a member of the Caddo Nation , is a longtime organizer and the director of Native Organizers Alliance -LRB- NOA -RRB- . According to LeBlanc , many of the elders at the Standing Rock encampments were active in these and other struggles , with several having been members of the American Indian Movement -LRB- AIM -RRB- . In other words , many of the leading water protectors in the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline are seasoned organizers , some holding three and four decades of experience in social movements . Neither it is an abstract or radical point to say that a pipeline that spills oil into the Missouri River is a severe danger not just to the Sioux but to the many thousands of people downstream , like climate change itself . And like its leadership structures , the politics behind it are even more finely tuned . Trump recently named ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his top pick to become Secretary of State . If confirmed , Tillerson could hold the final call over border-crossing pipelines like the Keystone XL . The President-elect has also named Rick Perry , the former governor of Texas , as his choice to head the Department of Energy . They came out of a militancy around the Fight for 15 , Black Lives Matter , Occupy Wall Street . Facing Trump and Tillerson , those movements will need to be stronger than ever .

Maybe some day . The alternatives are becoming more economical but are not there yet in terms of replacing a major amount of fossil fuel energy . The pipeline will be built , not because you are right or wrong , but because that is what will happen . Posted by Bob Fritz on 2016-12-20 15:30:20 You do n't know what is happening at Standing Rock . The pipeline will not be built there . The will of the people is just too great . There is also a good chance that the pipeline will never be used . That is their fault for continuing to invest in an energy source that we must stop using ASAP . The cost of using the pipeline will far outweigh any benefits , except for the fossil fuel monopoly , of course . Alternatives are most certainly cheaper than fossil fuels . They are technology disruptors that the fossil fuel monopoly can not compete against . You can not prove otherwise . ruling , so there will be no penalty . President Trump will void the current ruling . The investors will rfeturn because they have already spent most of the money to build the portion already built . The January 1 deadline will nave no effect . If the pipeline were to be permanently halted , rail transport would be used . Rail is more expensive and has more spills . Spills harm the environment . Personally I think the Indians know this and are holding out for getting some more cash . The environmentalists probably do n't know it -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- . If they were smart and were really concerned about having a clean environment , they would not oppose this pipeline or the Keystone one . They have a Jan 1 deadline , or investors start to pull out , and the pipeline gets shelved . A completed pipeline , jail for those who break the law , lower energy prices , and less pollution risk than shipping oil by rail . In reality , this temporary halt will probably be reversed in a few months . The goal at Standing Rock was limited to moving the pipeline route not shutting it down . The protests never got out any message about stopping the use of gasoline powered personal transportation and limiting profits on gas buying which is the only way any real changes will be made in relation to pipelines . . Also , comparing Standing Rock to Occupy Wall Street is strange since many OWS activists and livestreamers were the first to go there and helped promote the Standing Rock protests on social media . I see both alternative and mainstream press headlines saying this is a victory when in fact what happened at a very high cost may be only temporary lasting a few months . Once again people who do not want pipelines but continue to buy gas for personal transport are being hypocritical and need to consider their own lifestyles if they really want change .
