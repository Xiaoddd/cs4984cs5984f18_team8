The announcement comes days after Virginians in different parts of the state rallied against the expanding Atlantic Coast Pipeline that is being laid in the western part of the state . Northam has been in the middle about the growing expansion of pipelines in Virginia , while his Lt. Governor , Justin Fairfax , has opposed the use of them . Sims and others protested last Thursday outside of the Executive Mansion on Capitol Square . Their concern are issues that could be caused by pipelines , and these powers granted to Northam are a way to check the construction of them , if issues do arise . West Virginia recently said it will be stopping construction of the Rover Pipeline being built there because of the water contamination caused by its construction . The companies building the Atlantic Coast Pipeline are Dominion Energy , Duke Energy and Southern Co. . Those companies say that the pipeline could bring economic benefits to Virginia , North Carolina and West Virginia , and also lower energy cost across the states .
