By Amber Phillips Amber Phillips Reporter for The Fix covering Congress , statehouses Email Bio Follow June 14 He used his namesake charity to benefit himself , both financially and politically . He broke state and federal law multiple times . That 's the bottom line of a stunning lawsuit filed against President Trump and his three oldest children Thursday in New York . It comes from New York 's attorney general , who announced the lawsuit after a nearly two-year investigation by New York authorities of wrongdoing at the Trump Foundation . Read another way , the state of New York is alleging that the president 's charity was a sham . A thorough , nonpartisan investigation by state officials just alleged that for decades , Trump used his own charity , set up to help others , to knowingly help himself . That 's as swampy as it gets . And he has plenty of plausible deniability to try to convince his supporters that he 's being wrongly attacked . The lawsuit , which courts have allowed to go forward , could provide evidence of Trump allegedly kissing Summer Zervos a decade ago and then groping her a month later . But those are two moments in Trump 's life . Or he 'll continue to deny groping more than a dozen women against their will . That 's an esoteric argument that does n't necessarily involve the president 's own actions . His defenders can plausibly argue that these foreign governments made their own decision to stay at the president 's hotel , just blocks from the White House . It 's much harder to separate the person from the actions . It alleges that he used the charity 's money over the past decade to settle legal disputes involving his for-profit business . And the lawsuit alleges that when he was running for president , things got worse , not better . It alleges that he used the money to donate to certain veterans ' charities that could be politically beneficial to him , for example . The lawsuit alleges that this was n't just a mistake on his staff 's part or bad apples in his campaign acting on their own . Trump had been using the charity to enrich himself consistently for decades . He knew what he was doing when he used it to run for president . In other words , Trump knew he was acting unethically and maybe even illegally . And he did it anyway . Over and over again . The story must be told .
