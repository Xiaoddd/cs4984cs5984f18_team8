CANNON BALL , N.D. -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - More than 2,000 U.S. military veterans plan to form a human shield to protect protesters of a pipeline project near a Native American reservation in North Dakota , organizers said , just ahead of a federal deadline for activists to leave the camp they have been occupying . Protesters include various Native American tribes as well as environmentalists and even actors including Shailene Woodley . State officials issued an order on Monday for activists to vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp , located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land near Cannon Ball , North Dakota , citing harsh weather conditions . The state 's latest decision not to stop cars entering the protest site indicated local officials will not actively enforce Monday 's emergency order to evacuate the camp issued by Governor Jack Dalrymple . The 1,172-mile -LRB- 1,885 km -RRB- pipeline project , owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP , is mostly complete , except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe , a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River . Veterans Stand for Standing Rock , a contingent of more than 2,000 U.S. military veterans , intends to go to North Dakota by this weekend and form a human wall in front of police , protest organizers said on a Facebook page . Organizers could not immediately be reached for comment . Dull Knife , a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe from the Pine Ridge Reservation of South Dakota , said he has been camping at the protest site for months . Morton County Sheriff 's Office spokesman Rob Keller said in an email his agency was aware of the veterans ' plans , but would not comment further on how law enforcement will deal with demonstrators . Former U.S. Marine Michael A. Wood Jr is leading the effort along with Wesley Clark Jr , a writer whose father is retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark . U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard , a Democrat from Hawaii and a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard , has said on Twitter she will join the protesters on Sunday . The Army Corps , citing safety concerns , has ordered the evacuation of the primary protest camp by Dec. 5 , but said it would not forcibly remove people from the land . Local law enforcement said on Tuesday they planned a blockade of the camp , but local and state officials later retreated , saying they would only check vehicles for certain prohibited supplies like propane , and possibly issue fines . Dalrymple on Wednesday said state officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters and there had been no plans to block food or other supplies from the camp . He also warned protesters that while emergency responders will try to reach anyone in need , that would be contingent on weather conditions . That decision has been delayed twice by the Army Corps . Stand for Standing Rock , a contingent of more than 2,000 U.S. military veterans , intends to go to North Dakota by this weekend and form a human wall in front of police , protest organizers said on a Facebook page .
