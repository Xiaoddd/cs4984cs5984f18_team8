In north-central South Dakota , it cuts through Campbell , McPherson , Edmunds , Faulk and Spink counties . Crandon is southeast of Redfield and east of Tulare . Richard B. Kuprewicz said pipeline pump stations are typically built in such a way that oil releases stay within the station boundaries . He is a pipeline infrastructure expert and incident investigator with more than 40 years of energy industry experience . The cause could also be due to human error , he added . Granado said the line-fill process should be finished within the next few weeks and the pipeline should be in service by June 1 . Walsh said all the crude oil was recovered through absorbent materials and was contained in drums , then put back into the line . Dakota Access was responsible for cleaning up the spill , which it has done , he said . The spilled crude oil , which is roughly equal to two barrels , is a very small amount compared to the 470,000 barrels of crude oil the pipeline is designed to carry in a day . Some gravel was removed from the spill site and will be taken to the Brown County Landfill after sampling of the soils is finished , according to Walsh . The Brown County Landfill routinely takes deliveries of contaminated soil from throughout the region . Once the state receives the paperwork for disposal and spill site samples , the case will be closed , Walsh said . This is the first and only spill in the state associated with the Dakota Access Pipeline to date , he said . In early April , there was a minor crude oil leak at the Dakota Access Pipeline pump station in Spink County . Your notification has been saved . There was a problem saving your notification .
