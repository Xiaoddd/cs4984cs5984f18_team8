The company building it , Energy Transfer Partners , did not have an immediate comment . Meanwhile , the Army is exploring alternate routes . Supporters of the pipeline say it does not pose a threat to drinking water and that multiple archaeological studies have found no sacred items along the route . The pipeline was routed to parallel existing pipelines in order to avoid culturally and environmentally sensitive areas . The Standing Rock Sioux also claim the pipeline would threaten their water supply . But that argument is also overblown . The new water treatment plant is located 70 miles away from the pipeline further down the Missouri River . In addition , the pipeline is set to be buried 92 feet under the riverbed , further reducing the odds of water supply contamination . It was then flooded to create the lake under the Pick-Sloan Plan in 1944 . The tribes refused to accept the court-ordered payment for the land . Despite this , under the current law , the land the pipeline will run through does not belong to the Standing Rock Sioux . They have no jurisdiction over it . This is yet another example of lawlessness by the Obama administration . But the U.S. is going to continue to use fossil fuels for the foreseeable future , and pipelines are the safest way to transport it . The message this sends the enemies of energy infrastructure is that if they cause enough mayhem , if they light enough fires and pick enough fights , they can get their way . There is no excuse to deny the Dakota Access pipeline .
