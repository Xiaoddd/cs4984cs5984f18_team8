As the arrests were underway law enforcement personel drove several large construction equipment into the camp to begin the cleanup process of razing tents and structures . Several fires were set throughout the day at the Oceti Sakowin camp before many of the protesters left the camp near Cannon Ball , N.D. as per the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers mandatory evacuation . In the background smoke and flames from one of the several structural fires started by the protesters over the course of the day . The response included 18 North Dakota National Guard members who operated Humvees and other military vehicles and about 220 officers from various agencies . Some people left voluntarily throughout the day . A bus was available for people who wanted transportation out of the camp , but none accepted it Thursday , said Levi Bachmeier , an adviser to Gov. Doug Burgum . Nine people accepted help from a travel assistance center arranged by state agencies and other organizations on Tuesday and Wednesday , but the center closed due to lack of interest , Bachmeier said . Among the final people in the camp Thursday was a man who remained on the roof of a building surrounded by a large contingent of officers and a helicopter circling overhead . The man eventually came down peacefully , Kirchmeier said . Some of the protesters engaged in passive resistance and refused to walk , requiring officers to carry them , said Lt. Tom Iverson of the North Dakota Highway Patrol . The arrestees also included one woman who appeared to be a tribal elder . They were placed in plastic handcuffs and transported in vans . Law enforcement proceeded cautiously before entering the camp , first assessing the situation through surveillance and monitoring social media feeds . An airplane , two helicopters and drones flew overhead at times throughout the day . Up until about 2 p.m. , some people crossed the frozen Cannonball River to enter and exit the camp . After clearing the camp , officers planned to secure the area and maintain a presence to prevent people from re-entering , Kirchmeier said . As officers cleared a section of camp , backhoes and other heavy equipment began demolishing structures and clearing debris . A line of tow trucks arrived to remove approximately 20 vehicles that remained in the area . The Corps and Burgum set a deadline of 2 p.m. Wednesday for the camp to close in order to clear the land ahead of potential spring flooding . Law enforcement arranged to have cultural items including tipis removed in a culturally sensitive manner , Iverson said . However , a traditional wigwam was demolished Thursday . Joye Braun , who began camping to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline last April , monitored the activity through social media feeds and staying in contact with people on the ground . Most people who vacated the main camp are relocating to new camps that people are establishing on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation , Braun said . The Corps also had ordered people to leave a camp known as the Rosebud camp and a portion of the Sacred Stone camp , which are Corps-managed lands on the reservation . North Dakota law enforcement does not have jurisdiction in that area , Kirchmeier said . Eyewitnesses said arrests were made Thursday in the Rosebud camp , but it was unclear what agency made the arrests . A Bureau of Indian Affairs spokesperson said the BIA did not make arrests but was working to prevent people from re-entering the Rosebud camp . On Wednesday afternoon , a total of 11 people were arrested near the entrance of the camp , including at least one member of the media , Jack Smith IV of Mic , an online news outlet . Iverson said everyone was warned to leave Highway 1806 or face arrest . None of those who were arrested Wednesday were from North Dakota . Four are from California , while the others are from Canada , Illinois , New York , Oklahoma , South Dakota , Tennessee and Wisconsin . They were charged with physical obstruction of a government function , a Class A misdemeanor . Charges for those arrested Thursday had not been filed . Her 10-year-old brother suffered minor burns and was expected to be released from a Bismarck hospital , officials said . The incident is under investigation . An estimated 20 fires were set by people in the camp Wednesday and law enforcement reported at least two explosions .
