I seen the truck go into a ditch because the roads were full of people . I jumped in my car and frantically honked for a clear path . I pursued and slammed into the white truck twice . With the help of another pick up truck we immobilized the armed security guard by the river . He pulled out a fully racked ar15 and began making threats backing up into the river . I HEARD LATER that Morton county purchased hundreds of body bags for that day . The infiltrader was handed over to BIA and they handed him over to FBI . I 've been spending my time serving the Akicita -LRB- Warriors -RRB- and I 've been through multiple stand offs with Morton county since then with peaceful and prayerful intentions ONLY . Please I need help . I have a wife and 3 kids all the way in NY and they really need the support . A couple weeks ago our landlord put all of our things on the porch . This is something my wife had to deal with as im stilI at standing rock . I did n't know my landlord would be so rigid . I told him what I was doing and he seemed like a nice guy . This week morton county put out 2 warrants for my arrest . I WilI be turning myself in as soon as I 'm organized . All your help is need wanted and greatly appreciated . This is the other truck that helped me . Everything went fine . I was n't mistreated . They have n't given me a court date yet but I 'll keep you posted . I 'm still shocked by how many people have answered my call for help . Its amazing . I do n't feel so alone in this fight with the beast -LRB- dapl -RRB- anymore . I 've been down and out for sometime now and I thank you all for picking me back up . Wopila Tonka midakuye oyasin . Please try again . Sign in to track your impact .
