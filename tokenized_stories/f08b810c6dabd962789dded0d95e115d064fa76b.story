Guatemalan foreign minister Sandra Jovel broke the news on the radio show ConCriterio about the speculated trip cost that covered government officials , guests , and religious leaders . Jovel said Adelson did not have business affairs in Guatemala . Nonetheless , director of civil society organization Citizen Action , Manfredo Marroquin , said President Jimmy Morales 's administration violated Guatemalan law by accepting the gift from a private entity , Haaretz reported . Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales inaugurated the country 's mission in the holy city on May 16 , becoming the first country to follow in the footsteps of the United States just one day later in a deeply controversial move that was accompanied by deadly violence on the Gaza border . The US and Guatemalan moves break with decades of international consensus . US ambassador to Israel David Friedman also attended the ceremony . The Guatemalan move was widely seen as aimed to earn points with American President Donald Trump , who first announced the embassy move at the end of his first year in office . However , the move prompted both the Arab League and Morocco to recently suspend ventures with Guatemala . So far the only other nation with immediate plans to open an Israel embassy in Jerusalem is Paraguay , expected to do so before the end of the month . Casino magnate Adelson has been mentioned in various controversies , including with his newspaper Israel Hayom entangled with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a corruption case that involves a potential quid pro quo arrangement providing him with favorable coverage . The Republican mega-donor had also offered to subsidize the cost of building the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem . Comments -LRB- 0 -RRB- You need to be logged in in order to post comments .
