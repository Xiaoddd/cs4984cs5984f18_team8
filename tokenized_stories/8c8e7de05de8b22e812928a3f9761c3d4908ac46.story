He 's spent his time in office working to allow big polluters to do whatever they want , rather than protecting the health , clean air and water of his constituents . Americans count on the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure our air is safe to breathe and our water is safe to drink , but Scott Pruitt is an extremist who will put those safeguards at risk . As Attorney General of Oklahoma , Pruitt was a key architect of of unrelenting attacks on our bedrock , lifesaving clean air and clean water protections . He has also led the fight against climate action and the Clean Power Plan , doing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry . An EPA run by Scott Pruitt means more pollution , more asthma attacks , more premature deaths , and more mercury poisoning . And if Trump is able to confirm Pruitt for EPA and ExxonMobil -LRB- a Private Enterprise Council Member of ALEC -RRB- CEO Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State , the result would not only put our local air and water at risk , but would also cripple U.S. climate leadership and put the stability of our planet in danger .

Scott Pruitt can not be trusted to head the EPA , an agency charged with protecting all Americans from threats to their water , air , and health . Pruitt is also out of step with the vast majority of scientists , not only on the science of climate change but also protecting our air and water . As a scientific agency charged with protecting the public 's health according to the best and most recent science , the EPA deserves to be headed by someone with a scientific background , not a fossil fuel hack . I strongly urge you , as my Senator , to stand up for families across the nation and oppose this nomination . button click .
