Block Kavanaugh 's nomination . website released the following statement excerpt concerning the Army Corp of Engineers plans . Our Tribe is deeply disappointed in this decision by the United States , but our resolve to protect our water is stronger than ever . We ask that all everyone who can appeal to President Obama and the Army Corps of Engineers to consider the future of our people and rescind all permits and deny the easement to cross the Missouri River just north of our Reservation and straight through our treaty lands . When Dakota Access Pipeline chose this route , they did not consider our strong opposition . Our concerns were clearly articulated directly to them in a meeting on Sept. 30 , 2014 . Atrocities and human rights violations continue to escalate near Cannon Ball , North Dakota where the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , Water Protectors and supporters have been holding the line to stop the petroleum North Dakota access pipeline from posing a danger to the ecosystem , water and sacred tribal lands . Here are excerpts from their fundraising site . We have full support of the Sioux tribe elders and will be cooperating with them every step of the way . Several had to be treated for hypothermia and one protestor who was hit directly with a grenade has reportedly had her arm amputated as a result . Let 's stop this savage injustice being committed right here at home . Not if you allow this the be the United States . It 's time for real Patriots . Now more than ever , it 's time for anyone and everyone to lead .
