Everything you need to know from the authority on music , entertainment , politics and pop culture . David Rollingcloud Last week , author , photographer and Lamb of God vocalist Randy Blythe visited the Standing Rock camp in Cannonball , North Dakota . Below is his account of what he witnessed , who he met and what he learned . The late afternoon sun was sinking towards the rolling hills of Morton County as I drove south on North Dakota Highway 6 . My friend David and I had fallen uncharacteristically silent , our normally constant stream of inappropriate jokes and mutual ball-breaking at a standstill . As we stared at the beautiful countryside spread out before us , both lost in our private contemplation of what we were about to do , I turned down the Killing Joke In Dub album pulsing through the rental car stereo and looked to David . Always a twinge of fear . We were definitely heading towards a serious situation . David is friend of mine and tribal member of the Leech Lake band of Ojibwe in Minnesota . He was accompanying me to Cannonball , North Dakota , a small community located in the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation . We were going to Oceti Sakowin , the largest of four camps erected alongside the Cannonball River in protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline being constructed on land that the Sioux consider sacred . The Sioux say that construction of the pipeline will desecrate tribal burial sites , as well being concerned that the pipeline -LRB- which would carry half a million gallons of crude oil per day beneath the Missouri River -RRB- could burst and contaminate their primary water supply . I had first gotten wind of the resistance to DAPL via social media , as there was -LRB- and still is -RRB- a shockingly small amount of coverage available via mainstream media outlets . The scattered news that does get reported seems shallow to me in light of such a large and historic gathering of people , and the voices of the indigenous people there are more often than not marginalized . I had been trying to find out what I could about Standing Rock over the last two months while touring with two different bands , and had become increasingly concerned the more I read up on the situation . There were stories of attack dogs and tear gas and rubber bullets , reporters being arrested , rumors of a media blackout and of supplies needed for the oncoming brutal North Dakota winter . After Clinton called Trump to concede victory , I took a break from election coverage to see if there was any news from Standing Rock , and in the process found out that our brand-new President-elect had personally invested money in the pipeline . I carried an old Army duffel stuffed with brand-new zero-degree sleeping bags and heavy wool army blankets from the local surplus store . My suitcase was crammed with more blankets , winter clothes , and 10 pounds of freshly roasted beans donated by Lamplighter , a local coffee shop I frequent . I began contacting Native friends of mine to see what on-the-ground information they had about Standing Rock ; when I hit up David he decided to come along to represent his people . I flew to Minnesota on November 21st , we loaded our supplies and some firewood into the rental car , then left that night to try and beat a winter storm blowing in that evening . We made it as far as Fargo before stopping due to ice forming on the roads . The next day we continued on deeper into North Dakota . As we drove , we discussed the importance of keeping our hearts free of anger , no matter what happened or what we saw . The camps at Standing Rock were first organized as Spirit Camps , places of prayer . We wanted to respect the original intent of the people who had set up the camps , even though the number of people there had swelled in size more than they could have ever foreseen . As well , the severity of the tactics used by law enforcement had increased . Clouds of tear gas filled the air , and people were being shot with bean-bag rounds and rubber bullets . A woman had been hit with a concussion grenade , mangling her arm and nearly blowing it off . It angered me to see these things , but everything I had been able to find out about Standing Rock led me to believe that carrying that anger with me into the camps would be disrespectful , so before we left we made sure our motives were pure and our heads were clear and focused on the task ahead . We would go and bring supplies to the people , pay our respects to the elders there , and be a helpful presence in camp in whatever form that would take for the few days we would be there . Now was not the time for punk-rock shenanigans . As we joined the short line of cars entering Oceti Sakowin through the north gate of the camp , we were met by a young Native security guard with a cast on his arm . Yep . We drove down Flag Row , the main road cutting through camp lined with the flags of different Indian nations and headed towards the eastern end of camp , near a horse corral . We pitched our tent with the assistance of young man from Philadelphia named Jason . By the time we had figured out how to get our borrowed tent up , it was almost dark , and we were getting cold and hungry . We had brought food to cook and donate , but decided to see if there were any kitchens open so that we could eat and get some sleep . We walked back up to the security checkpoint and introduced ourselves to Baloo , the young man who had let us in earlier . As he led us down a hill to his camp , David asked Baloo if he had hurt his arm on the bridge . We ate a dinner of grilled burgers and hot soup at the Blackfoot camp , thanked them , then walked back to our tent to bundle up in our sleeping bags and crash . Before sunrise the next morning , I was awakened by a deep voice blasting through a loudspeaker . We rolled out of our sleeping bags , and I borrowed a shovel from the camp next door and dug a fire pit . While David cooked us a backstrap of venison for breakfast , we made our plan for the day . All new campers were requested to attend one of two daily orientation meetings , so we decided to go to the 9 a.m. meeting after we ate . We finished our breakfast and walked to the center of camp where the orientation meeting would take place . Along the way , I heard someone call out my name . A young man named Cory introduced himself and asked if he could take a picture with me . Cory had come to Standing Rock with two of his classmates from Stanford . Both fans of heavy-metal bands like my own and Native Americans have often been stereotyped as violent , drunken , savages . And while there are indeed violent , drunken , savage people of all races and musical tastes , I did not meet any of them at Standing Rock . Furthermore , the fans I met there , both Native and non-Native , were without fail polite and well-spoken . They all expressed their gratitude to me for my presence , treated me with respect , and did not attempt to hog my time . This was my experience . At orientation , we were split up into two groups of around 150 people each and listened to facilitators talk about the purpose of the camps and protocols to abide by while there . The two facilitators were both women , a Filipino New Yorker and a white Californian who got a bit too weepy and self-flagellating for my tastes . Act in a manner respectful of elders and to Native traditions and culture , which may be very different than your own . We are here for a purpose , not a holiday . These things seemed to be almost childishly self-evident to me , but they obviously needed to be said , as I found out later when I saw some young people not getting up to offer elders their seats . About 15 of us raised our hands . Then a Native man from California got up and gave an impassioned speech about the need to remain prayerful and non-violent . He was followed by a local Lakota man who said much the same thing , then a female Canadian First Nations elder began talking about how she was ashamed of how so much oil was coming from her country . She was speaking in such a low voice that I could barely make out what she was saying . David and I decided to leave , as the orientation had veered away from practical matters into emotion , and we wanted to find a way to be of use . We went back to camp to decide where to distribute our supplies , and since the Blackfoot camp had fed us , we brought them one of our five-pound bags of coffee . The headman there thanked us heartily , and invited us back to eat with them anytime we wished . We tightened up our camp some more until it was time for direct-action training . The training was held in the northwest section of the camp , and was attended by around 200 people . The people leading the training began by stressing the fact that the protocols for direct action at Standing Rock were developed in conjunction with the local elders , and that people who had participated in acts of civil disobedience elsewhere should remember that there was a certain way things were to be done that might look different from what they were used to . Then a medic demonstrated how to treat injuries from chemical weapons . After the medic spoke , a facilitator called for volunteers to act as water bearers and banner carriers . We all linked arms and formed a group around them , then began to move . The objective was move the group as a unit in a circle around the camp . After spending the majority of my adult life in a touring band and attending more basement punk-rock shows than I can remember , it felt pretty normal to me . After we had successfully reached our objective point , there was a debriefing session followed by an open discussion of what we thought had gone right with the mock action and what we could have done better . Afterwards , a young Native fan from Gallup , New Mexico , named Sabrina asked if she could take a picture with me and a Mni Wiconi banner , and I agreed . After a dinner of jambalaya at the Blackfoot camp , David and I walked up to Facebook Hill , so named as it was one of the only places in camp where cell reception existed . Even there , it was spotty at best . I checked a few emails , then posted one photo to my Instagram account just to let people know I had arrived at Standing Rock safely . As soon as the post went up , my screen immediately went a blank gray color , and the phone stayed frozen . I did a hard reset , and the screen showed that my battery was completely drained before the phone completely died . I had had at least a 50-percent charge seconds before . We went back to our tent , and before going to bed I plugged my phone into a rechargeable battery I had brought . The phone started right back up , the battery indicator showing half a charge . I got dressed and made us some breakfast . As we sat in the gently falling snow enjoying our last few bites of scrambled eggs , a woman came ripping by our tents in a muddy SUV , yelling into a bullhorn . We removed our camping knives from our belts , grabbed a few bottles of water , and began walking towards the gate . The peaceful mood of the morning was replaced by a palpable tension as people moved quickly up flag row . By the medic tent , David grabbed a few pairs of rubber gloves to protect our hands in case tear gas was deployed . I tied my bandana around my neck and gave David a neck warmer I had on to cover his face . With so much confusion in the air , I decided to go scope the situation at the north gate out , and David said he would join me after checking on the elders . There were Native security guards on the bridge , telling the people not to move forward any further . I stood there , looking across at the rows of concertina wire and all the police on the other side of the two-lane bridge . No one on either side seemed to be moving , so I climbed up the hill beside the bridge to see what I could . I looked to the far northeastern shore of the Cannonball River at the area known as Turtle Island , and saw a large group of people massing , perhaps half a mile away as the crow flies . I walked back down onto the edge of the bridge , and met a Native woman from Flagstaff named Vontrivia , who asked me for a picture . We talked briefly and took a few photos , then David appeared to check on me . We decided to head back into camp , and I walked over to Turtle Island . As I headed toward the throng of people at Turtle Island , I heard singing , drumming , and chanting getting louder and and louder . I walked into the crowd of several hundred people gathered on the muddy river bank and saw two young men getting out of a canoe at the bottom of a steep hill on the opposite shore , perhaps 30 feet away . More people were loading into canoes , and over the next 15 minutes the group across from us grew from two to 50 people . The ridge line at the top of the hill became crowded with heavily armed police officers and men in tactical gear staring down at us . I saw rifles , grenade launchers , safety-orange shotguns , large pepper-spray canisters resembling fire extinguishers and a few water hoses that were rolled out . Hooded men with binoculars and video cameras walked the hilltop , filming and scanning our faces constantly . A burly young Native man walked up next to me and politely introduced himself in an even voice . In the energy of the crowd , Joseph was a calming presence , and I was happy to have him beside me . Suddenly a great cheer went up from the people to our left , and I saw a makeshift bridge constructed of wood , rope and Styrofoam being pushed across the river , several people riding on top . People began crossing over the flimsy looking bridge , which to my surprise stayed afloat . Return across the river . Do not approach us , or we will have no choice but to view it as an act of aggression and will be forced to respond . Except for one person I saw begin to charge up the hill -LRB- they were immediately and firmly stopped by two Native men -RRB- , I did not witness anyone moving towards the police line at all , nor acting in any manner that I would construe as aggressive . Do not bring children . Remain in prayer . Remain peaceful . Do not antagonize the police . The surgical gloves people were putting on were to protect their hands in case of tear gas . The liquids they were mixing were milk of magnesia and water , to flush eyes and mucous membranes , also in case of tear gas . We all could clearly see what people were doing from across the water , even without the benefit of the high-powered binoculars the cops had trained on us . While this ludicrous statement was initially funny to me , I began to see how it could quickly turn serious if the cops actually used these actions as justification to use force . It was eerie looking up at so many armed men , knowing that they could open fire on us at any time . After about 45 minutes the group across the shore had grown to about three hundred people , all singing , dancing , and praying at the base of the hill . I looked at the river and thought It would be cold , but I could definitely swim that no problem if they opened fire . I thought about how my digital cameras would be ruined , and decided that although it would suck , I would get over it . If I went to jail , I would remain there through the weekend , and I had promised that we would have the car back on time and in good shape on Saturday . Joseph and I were almost right beside the bridge by this point , and I was thinking about how fast I would have to swim across the river to avoid arrest and hopefully avoid hospitalization for hypothermia in order to return the car on time when people began crossing back over to our side of the river . The elders had decided that the action was to be terminated before the police got too agitated . I had been standing in the cold mud for over an hour by this point , and my feet were frozen , even through my heavy boots . Joseph and I walked back to my camp , along the way meeting David , who was coming to check on me . We sat by our campfire for a bit , warming our feet and drinking coffee until Joseph invited us to dinner at his camp , where many of the security guards were staying . When a policeman had seen him picking them up and told him he was not allowed to take them as they were considered evidence at a crime scene , he performed a bit of sleight-of-hand , palmed them and walked away . I picked up the rounds and felt them . I also saw video footage of a man standing in front of the water cannons , his arms spread out to the side like Christ , taking the freezing blasts face on . Joseph told me about seeing a small Asian woman getting dropped right in front of him by rubber bullets , then a cop running up and pepper-spraying her while she lay on the ground . When the food was ready , we heard drumming begin inside their large green army tent and a Sioux man began singing a Lakota song . We all went inside , then some guests from another tribe took up the drum and sang in their language . Then the drum was passed to a group of Pawnee visitors , who sang three or four songs in their tongue . Then a plate was made for the matriarch of the tent , a beautiful grandmother in her late seventies . After Grandmother received her food , plates were made for the other elders . Then women and children got their food , followed by the men . As visitors , David and I waited until one of the women told us to hurry up or we would miss out on the ribs and fry bread they had made . The whole process of blessing the food with song and prayer took at least half an hour . In a tent in North Dakota , on a holiday that many Native Americans associate with colonization and the destruction of their way of life , I watched people receive their food with a level of gratitude and respect for those that prepared it that I have never witnessed at any Thanksgiving dinner , and they did this as a matter of course . There was no mention of any holiday or hurried recitations of a few things they were grateful for ; they just gave thanks , and they did it with sincerity . It was awesome to be a part of it . After dinner there was more singing and dancing around the fire . A Paiute man from Pyramid Lake , Nevada -LRB- whom we determined was a cousin of some friends of mine there -RRB- sang beautifully until his voice was hoarse , and almost stopped until Grandmother came outside to dance . Others sang as well , both in Native languages and in English . Some of the songs included references to steamy texting and misleading social-media profile pictures . Native Americans are not magical creatures from some forgotten era ; they are human beings living in the modern world just like anyone else . A feeling of closeness and belonging hung in the air . After a while both David and I left for our camp , thanking everyone for the food and company . Our final morning was the coldest one ; ice covered the tent and the air outside was a balmy 17 degrees . We made breakfast , then began breaking down camp . Joseph and his girlfriend stopped by on the way to the nearby casino for breakfast , and we put in an order for cold sodas . When they returned , we loaded up their car with most of the items we had brought to donate . They drove the supplies over to their camp , then David and I carried two of the wool blankets and some sacks of tobacco directly to one of the elders he had met the first day we were there . It was the proper way to show respect , to thank a local for letting us visit his land . He was a funny old man . He passed the shell to me , I washed myself with the smoke , and I prayed in my own way too . Maybe if everyone felt protected , then the violence could stop . David and I left Standing Rock and went home to our friends and families . It had been a brief , but very intense trip . Both of us learned a lot during our time there , but I left with far more questions than answers . I went to bring supplies and show support for people that I believed were being treated with unnecessary force while peacefully protesting something they believed endangered their welfare . What is happening at Standing Rock is a reaction to the continued and systematic oppression of the indigenous people of our land . I am amazed at the level of restraint and commitment to nonviolence the overwhelming majority of these people have continued to display in such large numbers , and can only pray that everything remains as peaceful as possible . If the events occurring there were to happen in a major American city instead of way out on the edge of an isolated Indian reservation , there would be massive riots , and there is no question about that in my mind . There are other questions , though ; hard questions that we need to start asking ourselves , all of us . I am a touring musician who makes his living traveling around the world in vehicles powered by fossil fuels . These things were made then shipped to distribution centers in vehicles requiring fossil fuels . The clothes I am wearing and the glasses I see through contain fossil fuels . Even the surfboards I ride when I am in the ocean , communing with my favorite part of the natural world , are made from fossil fuels . Fossil fuels are pervasive in my life . They are in yours , too . Fossil fuels are named such because they are derived from decaying plant and animal matter that once lived hundreds of millions of years ago . Fossil fuels are a finite , non-renewable resource . Humanity has the potential to reproduce and increase in size infinitely , at least until the sun burns itself out and our planet dies of natural cosmic causes . The supply is going to run out . Fossil fuels also pollute the ever-loving crap out of our planet . This is not a matter of debate . This year , smog in Los Angeles was at its highest level since 2009 , with hospitals and clinics reporting increases in patients seeking treatment for respiratory illness associated with bad air quality . Oil spills poison our waters , wiping out marine life . The events at Standing Rock are a timely reminder that we are killing our planet , and it is the only one we have . We have to begin damage control now , and as one race start embracing clean energy alternatives . This will obviously not occur overnight , and the millions of hard-working people who feed their families by working in the fossil-fuel industry will need to be provided with a way to earn a living .
