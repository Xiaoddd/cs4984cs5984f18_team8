The Complaint also alleges that the Enterprise incited , funded , and facilitated crimes and acts of terrorism to further these objectives . The Energy Transfer Partners ' statement went on to claim that information being disseminated by Greenpeace was false , and listed a couple of what they feel are false accusations by them . The two treaties that left this land to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe were unequivocal in their relegation of the land to said tribe , and contained promises that the land would be left alone for tribal use . The notion that what they did was not encroachment is absurd . The press release continues to claim in the next line that Energy Transfer is also guilty of desecrating sacred lands , another myth which could be debunked by any one of the natives forced to collect the fragments of their family 's graveyard . They are apparently trying to market themselves as corporate mercenaries willing to abuse the legal system to silence legitimate advocacy work . This complaint repackages spurious allegations and legal claims made against Greenpeace by the Kasowitz firm on behalf of Resolute Forest Products in a lawsuit filed in May 2016 .
