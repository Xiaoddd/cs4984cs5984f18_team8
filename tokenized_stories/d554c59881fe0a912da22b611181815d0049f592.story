While protesters were fueling worldwide outrage and fundraising over allegations of police brutality , an aggressive cohort of agitators was terrorizing the families of law-enforcement officers with threats of death , rape and arson . She had good reason to fear that protesters knew where they lived . The North Dakota State and Local Intelligence Center compiled a 41-page document of social media posts with threats along with photos , names , addresses and contact information for officers involved with the protest . For Ms. Engelstad , the threats hit home the night before Thanksgiving , when her husband called and urged her to leave , saying protesters had threatened to set fire to the houses of law enforcement locked in a late-night standoff at the bridge near Cannon Ball , North Dakota . One of the boys brought with him a baseball bat for protection . Most protesters have left the area following the Feb. 23 evacuation of the protest camps located on federal land . Oil could begin flowing through the 1,172-mile , four-state pipeline as early as Monday after a series of court rulings against tribes fighting to stop the project . At least two camps remain , one called Sacred Stone located in part on tribal land and another on a lot recently leased by the Cheyenne River Sioux , but their numbers are far fewer than the thousands who occupied for months the floodplain along the Cannonball River . Elsewhere , however , the anti-pipeline movement has taken off , with protest camps being erected in seven states : Florida , Iowa , Oklahoma , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , South Dakota and Texas . Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier later said that the dog handlers were not properly licensed , but even though his department was not involved in the confrontation , the viral video and national media coverage drew an influx of protesters with an anti-cop agenda . Figures released March 1 by law enforcement showed that 661 of the 709 arrests involved out-of-state protesters . Of those arrested , 227 had a total of 1,503 previous citations and charges , including domestic violence , child abuse , robbery , burglary , drug possession and driving under the influence . Human rights violations Protesters stoked an international uproar over what they described as the over-the-top , militarized response of police , who wore riot gear and used tear gas , bean bags , rubber bullets , flash bangs and other non-lethal methods in order to move protest crowds off highways , bridges and private land . At various protests , large groups of peaceful activists were accompanied by an aggressive minority setting fires and hurling rocks , frozen water bottles , feces and even Molotov cocktails at police . I mean , people were getting hit in the head with socks full of nuts and bolts that a helmet protects them from . Getting a rise out of law enforcement , and capturing it on camera , was clearly the aim of the more aggressive protesters , said Ms. Engelstad . In November , a U.N. human-rights expert accused law enforcement of using excessive force against protesters . Ms. Engelstad said she once spent 45 minutes in the Bismarck post office during a lockdown as hundreds of activists blocked streets . Some family members removed their photos and information from social media or cancelled their accounts . Even when driving or shopping in town , the women worried that activists would target them based on the pro-police bumper stickers or yellow ribbons on their cars . Ms. Eagon said she even began leaving her diaper bag in her car because it was made of camouflage material . At the same time , locals said they tried not to paint protesters with too broad a brush . Most of the injuries stemming from the protest were relatively minor , such as officers being hit with projectiles and protesters stung with rubber bullets . The most serious was a gruesome arm injury suffered by a 21-year-old protester during a November bridge clash , the cause of which is in dispute . It could have been much worse .
