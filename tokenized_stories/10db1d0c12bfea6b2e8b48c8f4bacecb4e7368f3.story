Email Icon resembling an envelope . It appears that the actual costs were substantially higher than anticipated . These figures may have played a large part in Sheriff Dave Mahoney terminating the last two week-long rotations the agreement had called for , pulling out after just eight days . Sheriff Mahoney declared the withdrawal was due to issues in his own community that needed attention . However , he also noted that after the first week the EMAC agreement would not pay for the overtime of the deputies back in Dane County filling in . When you see the potential figures , his decision seems more obvious . While some effects of the EMAC on the Standing Rock demonstration have been covered here and elsewhere , little has been made of how expensive it was for North Dakotans and the states that responded to it . Ultimately , it is up to North Dakotans and residents of the other states that deployed law enforcement , to decide if that is how they want their tax dollars spent : putting down a nonviolent demonstration against an oil pipeline . We have also sent out similar requests to other states and law enforcement agencies that responded to the EMAC , and will report back on whatever we manage to dig up .
