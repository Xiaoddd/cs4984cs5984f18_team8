Pipeline protests are expanding across the country . Pipeline protests are expanding across the country . ARI SHAPIRO , HOST : Months of protests over the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota have come to an end . Construction on the pipeline is going forward after President Trump intervened in January . Now , it 's almost finished . Oil could start flowing in the coming weeks . But the Dakota Access pipeline battle at the Standing Rock Reservation has energized others . NPR 's Jeff Brady is here to tell us more about pipeline protests around the country . Hi , Jeff . JEFF BRADY , BYLINE : Hi , Ari . BRADY : They have . And it 's because of a strategy that 's really led by environmental groups . And their goal is to keep fossil fuels in the ground . Now , in the past , those groups , they encourage people to use less oil , drive smaller cars , walk more , that sort of thing . But that did n't work out very well . So they came up with this new strategy . And I think the Keystone XL pipeline - you probably remember that from a couple of years ago - it 's a really good example of it . This is a pipeline that would have transported crude oil from Canada 's oil sands down to the Gulf Coast . Opponents succeeded in delaying construction of the Keystone XL . And ultimately , President Obama blocked the project . President Trump says he wants the pipeline now . But the economics have completely changed . Oil prices are half of what they were just a few years ago . So recently , we see ExxonMobil and Shell decide that it 's not profitable to open up new oil sands projects in Canada . Those fossil fuels , they 're going to stay on the ground . And score one for those environmental groups . SHAPIRO : So these environmentalists have adopted a new strategy of protesting pipelines . BRADY : At first , they just looked at the ones where they were most likely to succeed , like the Keystone XL . But now , we 're seeing campaigns pop up all over the place , even in Texas and Louisiana . And those are two big oil producing states . We thought we 'd take a look at a couple of these places . First , we have a report from our colleague Marie Cusick from WITF in Harrisburg and StateImpact Pennsylvania . She recently visited a protest site in the central part of the state . MARIE CUSICK , BYLINE : Amidst the rolling farm fields of Pennsylvania Amish country , protesters are settling in for the long haul . They 've built two tall wooden structures that looked sort of like tree houses without the tree . Once built , it will move natural gas southward through Pennsylvania . MARK CLATTERBUCK : So right behind us is this old historic tobacco barn that we 're using as kind of the base of operations . We 're - that 's where we 're storing food donations , as well as supplies , camping supplies , tarps . CUSICK : The landowners here refused to make a deal with the pipeline company . Now , part of their farm may be taken through eminent domain . That 's why they 've welcomed in dozens of protesters who 've set up camp in a cornfield . The site has a food truck , a large military tent and portable toilets . CLATTERBUCK : We 're running electric . And we 'll run cable here so we have the internet as well . CUSICK : He and others here took part in the Standing Rock protests in North Dakota . They 've taken lessons from that experience and are rehearsing nonviolent direct action scenarios . Molly Wallace says she 's probably too much of a wuss to stay out in a tent overnight . But she wants to make her voice heard . MOLLY WALLACE : Yeah . I 'm willing to get arrested . It 's a cause worth getting arrested for . CUSICK : The cause encompasses a long list of concerns about the pipeline , including its implications for climate change , the seizure of private property and questions over whether there 's really a public need for all of this gas , since some of it will be exported . Chris Stockton is a spokesman for Williams , the company behind the Atlantic Sunrise project . CHRIS STOCKTON : We 've actually made modifications to more than half of the route trying to accommodate folks the best we can . But certainly , there 's always going to be opposition . CUSICK : President Donald Trump is viewed as friendly to the oil and gas industry . But Williams CEO Alan Armstrong warned his colleagues at a conference this year that they should n't get too complacent because of the new administration . -LRB- SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING -RRB- ALAN ARMSTRONG : That is not changing the opposition that we have at a local level . And we 're going to continue to see that . And I would tell you , it may even enhance . CUSICK : And it 's true , activists are taking inspiration from each other in coordinating . Stephanie Graybill is at the Lancaster camp with her two daughters . She runs the kitchen . She also protested at Standing Rock and knows six people who are making their way out to Pennsylvania . STEPHANIE GRAYBILL : I think Standing Rock 's the playbook for camps like ours because we 're tired of government pushing us around . They 're supposed to be working for us , not working against us . CUSICK : As the camp continues to grow , the pipeline company has failed to get permission from dozens of property owners . It 's now taking them to court . MOLLY SAMUEL , BYLINE : In Georgia , there 's a lot of political pushback against taking private land for these projects . I 'm Molly Samuel from WABE in Atlanta . Right now , there 's a moratorium on new petroleum pipelines while the state legislature debates the laws around pipelines and eminent domain . ANDRES VILLEGAS : That threat of losing land with no recourse is something that can keep a land owner awake at night . SAMUEL : Andres Villegas is the president of the Georgia Forestry Association . Tree farming is a big business here . It 's even older than the state . VILLEGAS : Forestry and landownership that comes with it has been woven into the fabric of Georgia since the time of the colonization of the state . It 's been a central part of the economy . It 's been a central part of the culture . SAMUEL : There are people here whose families have been on the same land since the 1700s . So it was n't just environmental activists who got up in arms when a company proposed building a pipeline along the coast in 2015 . Opponents had powerful allies from the business world and in politics , from both sides of the aisle . BILL HITCHENS : You know , I 'm a Republican from a Republican area . SAMUEL : State Representative Bill Hitchens proposed that moratorium on new petroleum pipelines . HITCHENS : I may very well have had more Democratic votes because it affects everybody . SAMUEL : The pipeline was shelved . South Carolina has a moratorium in place too over the same pipeline . Hitchens says he 's pro-business . And he understands if you have to lose private property for something that serves the public like a road . HITCHENS : But I think people look at it a little differently when you lose it so somebody else can make some money off of it . SAMUEL : There 's another pipeline though that Georgia lawmakers could n't block . The federal government granted the Sabal Trail pipeline permission to use eminent domain along its route through Alabama , Georgia and Florida . It 's being built now , though people are setting up Standing Rock-like camps in protest . SHAPIRO : That 's Molly Samuel in Georgia . And NPR 's Jeff Brady is still on the line with us . Jeff , President Trump has signed several executive actions designed to speed up the approval process for new pipelines . BRADY : I think we should expect more confrontations around the country because on one side , you have an industry that now has an ally in the White House . They 're very optimistic . And on the other side , you have pipeline opponents who 've experienced some success . And they 're not ready to give up just because there 's a new administration in the White House . SHAPIRO : That 's NPR 's Jeff Brady . Thanks a lot . BRADY : You 're welcome , Ari . All rights reserved .
