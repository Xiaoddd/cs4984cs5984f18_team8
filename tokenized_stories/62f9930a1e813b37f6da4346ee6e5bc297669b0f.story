When it is ignited the aluminum powder reacts with the O3 part of the rust in a highly exothermic reaction , the resulting product is molten iron . Thermite is commonly used in welding , because the molten iron has the ability to seep into cracks in metal . It cal also be used to melt through things as shown in an episode of Brainiac and the movie The Sixth Day . I have made thermite a few times , but never in large enough batches to burn through anything significant . Aluminum powder is hard to come by and I never had a good enough reason to use what little powder I had . or on E-bay .

Put the thermite in the pot , and then when it ignites it will burn through the paper spilling molten iron onto whatever is underneath . Thermite requires extremely high temperatures to ignite -LRB- about 4000 F -RRB- . Ignition can be achieved in multiple ways .

It is virtually impossible to extinguish . Do not pour water on it because it will not extinguish it and it give you steam burns in the process . If you are having this burn through something put a bucket of sand underneath it . Only do this outdoors in a completely nonflammable environment . 0 miyagisan 1 year ago Reply Upvote al foil and rust will produce the same product 0 Trerstand69 1 year ago Reply Upvote Is the thermate by weight because the ratio does not equal 100 percent either . 0 sfjohnson73 2 years ago Reply Upvote I use this to burn stumps , and it entertains the children . 0 sfjohnson73 DouglasC67 Reply 1 year ago Reply Upvote It works well with getting the stumps burning .
