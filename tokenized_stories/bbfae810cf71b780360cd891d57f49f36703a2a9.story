On a clear Saturday morning , he and his friends drove an hour and a half to Pelham , North Carolina , where the KKK march was set to happen , to join over 100 other protesters from all around the country . With his brass instrument slung over his chest , Maxwell was intent on disrupting the Klan 's celebration of President-elect Donald Trump . Trump 's presidential win has seemingly emboldened the KKK to be more visible . Within 48 hours of his election in November , The Loyal White Knights of Pelham announced plans to celebrate with a parade on December 3 , although they did n't provide a time or location . This rise , noted the Southern Poverty Law Center , is likely due to two KKK groups splintering into smaller groups . All photos by Catie Laffoon . In addition to the KKK 's adulation of Trump , hateful incidents and harassment have been on the rise since the election . Between November 9 and November 14 , the Southern Poverty Law Center counted 437 hate-related incidents against women , children , and minorities in the US . The most reported incidents were anti-immigrant -LRB- 136 -RRB- , anti-black -LRB- 89 -RRB- , and anti-LGBT -LRB- 43 -RRB- . North Carolina , a swing state that went to Trump and currently home to eight KKK groups and two white nationalist groups , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center , has a particularly violent history of KKK clashes with protesters . On November 3 , 1979 , an anti-KKK demonstration in Greensboro , ended when a caravan of Klansman and Nazis opened fire , killing five and wounding ten people . The Greensboro Massacre , as it was later called , was captured by four TV stations , yet none of the gunmen spent a single day in prison . Counter protesters in North Carolina most notably confronted the KKK again in 2012 when they held a rally in uptown Charlotte with a much different result : The 250 protesters , who rallied in clown makeup while blowing silly-sounding horns , outnumbered the Klansmen and there was no violence reported . But the confrontation never came . Instead , the KKK played cat and mouse with counter protesters , first moving the parade from the morning in Pelham to the afternoon in Danville about 20 minutes away , and then back towards Pelham , and then in Danville again . In between all of this ping-ponging , protesters held two counter protest marches in Pelham and Danville . In Danville , they marched down Main Street to honking horns and passersby . But it was not a victory parade ; it was a funeral procession , an inglorious retreat .
