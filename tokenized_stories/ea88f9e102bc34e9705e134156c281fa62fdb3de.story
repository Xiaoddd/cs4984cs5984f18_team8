To ask the question is to acknowledge the premise of such pieces . This is especially true in the 20th century , when hard-won political gains opened cultural doors unimaginable to many previous generations . But those gains did not fundamentally alter how cultural histories have been written . This is a truth reinforced in many different ways : by the shelves weighed down with books about Jimi Hendrix and Nirvana , while only one or two about Aretha Franklin or Patti Smith sit nearby ; by the radio playlists that still only feature women once or twice every hour . You can hear nearly all of those albums in our Spotify playlist below . The point is to offer a view of popular music history with women 's work at the center . It stands for music history , touching upon every significant trend , social issue , set of sonic innovations , and new avenue for self-expression that popular music has intersected in the past fifty years . Plenty of lists include female artists . It is a list , that is to say , of 150 great albums , written , recorded , and released over the course of fifty plus years , by some of the most talented writers , players , and musicians in modern music history . Read the full list of 150 albums , with commentary , here . A few of the 150 albums , including Lemonade , Bikini Kill 's Yeah Yeah Yeah , Joan Jett 's I Love Rock 'n' Roll , Joanna Newsome 's Ys , and Laurie Anderson 's Big Science are n't on Spotify , so did n't make our playlist above .

A baroque-folk masterpiece . FWIW , in the United States Joni Mitchell was basically a one hit wonder , at least in terms of singles . Pleeeease . Of course , the American ones includes a handful of Latino records . There may be one or two additions to America or Britain but no more than that . This way I can see the progression from 1964 to 2016 . Reply Areawoman says : September 15 , 2017 at 9:17 pm I love the astute commentary coming from the World Contingency .
