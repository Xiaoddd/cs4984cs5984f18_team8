Twitter told the committee that more than 4 percent of tweets produced by the Russians dealt with energy and climate issues . Smith is a longtime advocate for increased oil and gas drilling in the United States and counts the industry as one of his biggest political benefactors . Facebook declined to comment on the report . Twitter issued a statement seeking to minimize the reach of the Russian disinformation campaign . The report underscores how Russians worked on both sides of contentious American political issues . The Facebook posts - which typically were accompanied by identical posts shared by affiliated Instagram accounts - appeared designed to specifically appeal to either liberal or conservative audiences . There were posts , for example , expressing concern about climate change and others mocking it . This tracks previous reports about how the Russian disinformation campaign worked to inflame other sensitive political issues - and worked both sides - on racial and religious matters , immigration policy and gay marriage . It was shared 497 times on Facebook , according to the committee . Other online accounts tied to the Internet Research Agency sought to promote drilling and to question climate science , including in Smith 's home state of Texas .
