Business Why Hollywood , environmentalists and Native Americans have converged on North Dakota Demonstrators stand next to burning tires as armed soldiers and law enforcement officers assemble on Thursday , Oct. 27 to force Dakota Access pipeline protesters off private land where they had camped to block construction . To block the construction of an oil pipeline . On Thursday , the group was met by scores of police wearing riot gear and riding in military-style armored vehicles . By the end of the day , after firing tear gas , dismantling teepees and seeking to disperse the crowd , police said they had arrested 141 people , according to news reports . The pipeline would save money for oil producers in North Dakota , many of whom ship their crude oil in rail cars across Canada and the northern United States . The reduction in oil transported by rail would also bring down rates for transporting grain out of South Dakota . Railroads that , with little competition , have been charging hefty rates . The winners would also include the Dakota Access owners : a partnership called Energy Transfer , and its investors . They include : Donald Trump . Energy Transfer is a master limited partnership , a type of corporation that does not pay corporate taxes but which passes profits through to the partners , who pay income tax . Lots of reasons . Then there are the Native American Groups , nursing grievances dating back to the 19th century treaties in which tribes ceded much of the Dakotas to the U.S. government . The protestors say the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie treaties left areas west of the Missouri River to the Lakota or Sioux tribes . Energy Transfer says it obtained right of way from private landowners . And the Army Corps of Engineers , which approved the route , says the pipeline crosses half a mile north of the modern day Standing Rock Sioux reservation . Native American groups have also raised two other objections : danger to water supplies and sacred grounds including Lake Oahe . They also say that the pipeline would dig up sacred burial grounds and historic archaeological artifacts . The protestors also say that Energy Transfer moved the route of the pipeline , which originally passed through wealthier areas of the state close to Bismarck . Many people support the pipeline , even those who worry about climate change . One reason , they say , is that the pipeline would be safer than trains , which have derailed with oil cargos on several occasions . Another reason , they say , is that we still need the oil and producers will find ways of getting it to market . A lot depends on who becomes president . He said concerns about sacred grounds could be addressed through the use of tribal monitors or laying the pipeline well below areas with artifacts . McKibben had a different interpretation of the Clinton statement . Since joining The Washington Post in 1989 , he has covered economic policy , China , U.S. diplomacy , energy and the White House . Earlier he worked for The Wall Street Journal in New York , London and Johannesburg . Follow The story must be told . Your subscription supports journalism that matters .
