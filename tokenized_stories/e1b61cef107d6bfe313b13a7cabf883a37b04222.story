I ordered their Pangoa bowl with tofu and they catered it to my tastes -LRB- the more spices the better -RRB- . The portion size was relatively large for the price -LRB- 11.53 after taxes -RRB- and had a substantial amount of avocado in it . In a way , you have to emphasize that you 're looking for spice , otherwise I feel they will err on the bland side . The one thing missing that would complete it : basil . Things that were n't as cool : this snobby rich girl walking in and complaining about mentally ill people , not realizing that there was a mentally ill girl ten feet away listening in on her words . The staff seemed speechless . But hey , that 's not really their fault , though it 's interesting to note the demographic this place is aimed at would usually make me feel excluded . Instead , I felt included because of their warm staff . This spot is pretty cool . Service is really good and the food is n't bad . I tried a buffalo chicken wrap and was pleasantly surprised . It had lots of flavor , and they have a lot of toppings to choose from . The wrap was ginormous and I 'm clumsy so I used a fork too haha . I went to Freshii for the first time this afternoon to grab a late lunch for myself and my colleague . After a crazy , long day , we freaking deserved a good meal . I walked all the way from my office , braving the cold and the elements , thinking it 'll alllll be worth it , and I was sadly wrong . Incredibly wrong . I walk into the store to be greeted ... by no one . This is a-w-k-w-a-r-d . I stood there for a bit actually - still no one . Finally , I decide to open and close the front door , hoping to make a noise that will prompt someone to come out from wherever they 're hiding . A woman suddenly appears from the back of the store , not looking happy mind you . Because I 'm honestly being treated as if I walked in one minute after it was closed . If looks could kill , I swear you would 've had to mop the floor of my dead body . She obviously did not want to help me , was annoyed with me while taking my order , and could n't even crack a smile at the end even though I was incredibly polite and nice throughout the entire encounter . She 's right though , how dare I order two wraps at 3:30 PM . As if matters could n't get more awkward , she had no idea what was in the damn wraps I ordered and had to continue checking the menu while making them , thus dragging out the process BIG TIME . A gentleman walked in while I was being helped , sensed the poor customer service , and left . I finally get my wraps , tell the lady to have a great day , and I get zero response . I start inspecting the wrap to discover that the quinoa in my wrap is hard . Like hurting my mouth and getting stuck in my teeth hard . I 'm not sure if the quinoa was burnt , or what , but I was sure of one thing - the wrap was awful . In addition to the burnt , crunchy quinoa issue , neither of our wraps had the dressing or sauce that they were supposed to come with . At the end of the day we ended up with wraps that were bland , bland , bland , that might as well have been stuffed full of popcorn kernels , and after enduring mean customer service . But under no circumstances will I ever show up late in the afternoon . Solid lunch option . You can choose bowls , salads , soups , burritos . Nutrition charts are available for each option . People are positive and smiling . I got the teriyaki bowl and added some falafel -LRB- which does n't necessarily go with the Asian flavor profile of the bowl -RRB- . Filling portions and healthy . Not particularly pricy compared to similar options . They also have quick service so do n't be discouraged by the lunch line . Every time I stop in here I am disappointed . The burritos and salads are mixed by pouring the ingredients into a plastic bag , tossed around and then dumped into a bowl or on a burrito shell . It 's horrifying to think of the amount of plastic being wasted during this process . I stopped in to try the chili recently , and was very confused . I received an ENORMOUS amount of turkey chili and I realized they use the vegetarian chili base and ADD turkey to it . Also serve it over Rice , which makes it rice and beans NOT chili . Again , it 's just weird shortcuts that I do n't understand . This is a brand new place to get your burritos and bowls . But ... You can get 2 kinds of frozen yogurt , with your choice of 2 toppings , here too . The deal : my satay was very spicy , but my friends food was a bit bland . The bowls here are filling , reasonably priced , and decently healthy . I like the Teriyaki Twist with quinoa instead of rice and one of the many protein options . The only complaint I have is this - there 's not enough Sriracha in the individual containers they set out ... they should just leave out an entire bottle of Sriracha so folks can spice up their food to their heart 's content . Multiple oatmeal options , breakfast wraps and yogurt parfaits available as well - will check if they have muesli next time . Really enjoyed the blueberry oatmeal , which came loaded with fresh blueberries and walnuts . Friendly staff . Conveniently located near Copley Square , directly underneath Healthworks . Plenty of seating , nice and bright . It is definitely my favorite breakfast and lunch spot in Boston . I went here because I was craving salad , and I thought I would divert from my occasional trip to Sweetgreen . It was delicious and fresh , it just did n't quite compare to the luscious greens from Sweetgreen . I did have a sample of their froyo and it was really really REALLY good . Tastes creamy and satiating on a warm day . I want to love this place , but so far it 's just been pretty mediocre . Pros : I absolutely love the concept of healthy fast food , and the location is absolutely perfect for taking off from the gym , deciding not to cook , and entering freshiis . So far I 've had a couple of salads , and the lemongrass soup . I can tell you the soup was great . Not enough places have soup . Cons : The salads were mediocre at best ; the buffalo chicken salad was a bit sad with wilted lettuce and barely - there chicken . You 'd be way better off walking down the street for sweetgreens for the salad . I have n't had the other items , so I 'm going to just assume the food 's hit or miss . I may stop by for the convenience factor , but certainly wo n't be going out of my way . They were very inflexible about modifying their juice mixes , which was very annoying . I did enjoy my smoothie bowl , very healthy and fresh . Place inside is nice . I ordered a salad and a smoothie . The salad was a huge disappointment and the smoothie was only decent . Do n't think I 'll be returning . Oh , where to start . First off , huge fan of Freshii generally ; this location though ... my god . Ordered a burrito at 7:50 assuming they would let me finish it before kicking me out . They did not . Whatever , went home and literally bit into one of the worst burritos ever . The quinoa was literally crunchy , so undercooked I was n't sure how to identify it . Steak in it also blew . So two strikes , bad food and mediocre service ... ARGGGGGGH They steam their falafel and on behalf of humans that would like to enjoy healthy vegetarian protein options in Boston , I 'd say this is a win . I think the ingredient combos are great . Also it 's all chopped which helps make a working lunch go much more smoothly than it might with full leaves . I look forward to trying the juice . Another win . I stopped in to try it out and went with the Cobb wrap , plus chicken . While waiting , I was given a cookies and cream froyo sample which I 'd highly recommend . The line moved quickly and I only waited a few minutes for the wrap , but there is n't a well-structured waiting area , which can cause some crowding around those seated and trying to enjoy their lunch . The wrap seemed a little pricey at check out , but came out larger than expected and tasted delicious . With everything so fresh and high quality , I enjoyed the last bite as much as the first . I 'm definitely coming back . Only one that is open late . I enjoyed the Zen salad very much . Only downside is no restroom which is surprising with that many seats so you will need to go to the restroom next to Au Bon Pain . Delicious bowls and wraps , excellent vegetarian options . One of my go to places in Back Bay . First time here , tried the Spicy Thai , pretty good . Love the environment , very decent . Yelpers report this location has closed . Find a similar spot .

We do not use plastic bags . toreduce carbon emissions . This also helps us to remove the potential for cross contamination for customers with -LRB- ex : peanut -RRB- allergies . The chili you tried today starts vegan , and can be served over rice , quinoa , or greens , and the toppings can either be vegan -LRB- avocado & broccoli -RRB- or can include meat -LRB- turkey & sriracha -RRB- , or you can order a side which is just the chili by itself . I hope that clears up any confusion . with any further questions , so I can answer them in a timely manner . But ... You can get 2 kinds of frozen yogurt , with your choice of 2 toppings , here too .
