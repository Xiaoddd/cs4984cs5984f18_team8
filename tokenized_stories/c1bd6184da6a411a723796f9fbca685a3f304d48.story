That line was originally constructed in the 1960s but in recent years has needed constant maintenance to keep it in good working order . It needs replacement to cut down on the amount of digging and construction along its route . The Standing Rock Indian Reservation in south central North Dakota was the organizing grounds for what were often violent attacks on the construction of the Dakota Access line , though not one foot of that pipe was buried on reservation land . I can understand why a professional activist like LaDuke want to compare the opposition to Line 3 to the fight against Dakota Access pipeline . It drew national media attention and visits from celebrities , not to mention gobs and gobs of money in the form of donations to a rat 's nest of groups and online accounts with little in the way of transparency or accountability . Today the Dakota Access Pipeline is bringing hundreds of thousands of barrels of North Dakota oil to market on a daily basis . None of the apocalyptic predictions made by overwrought activists during the pipeline 's construction have come true . For months the public watched activists block highways and instigate violent conflicts with law enforcement . We watched them vandalize construction equipment , cutting wires and setting things on fire . We heard from citizens who lived in the region of the protests talk about harassment from the activists . When the protests ended we watched as tons and tons of garbage and human waste were removed , at the expense of the taxpayers , from the campsites where these supposed stewards of nature were living . Protests organized around the egos and careers of professional activists like LaDuke are n't likely to accomplish much .
