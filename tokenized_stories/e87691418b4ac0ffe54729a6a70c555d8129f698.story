Campers worked to keep each other warm , cutting firewood and passing out hand and foot warmers . When a blizzard struck on Dec. 6 , elderly people were evacuated to Prairie Knights Casino . As he went through tents and teepees looking for people , Running Fisher came across the elderly woman zip-tied to a chair , wearing only a heavy sweater , he said . She was not wearing a diaper and surrounded by her own urine and excrement , he said . Running Fisher said he cut her off the chair , and she was evacuated to the casino , but got lost in the shuffle before she could be taken to the hospital or authorities could respond . Running Fisher found her again on Dec. 17 , he said , this time in a sleeping bag and diaper . You have to wonder how many other people were aware of this situation and did nothing . All politics aside , crimes should be reported to the authorities for proper investigation , arrest , and adjudication .
