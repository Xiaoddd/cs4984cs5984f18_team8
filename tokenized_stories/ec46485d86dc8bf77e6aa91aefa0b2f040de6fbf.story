Energy issues that started rocking Western Pennsylvania nearly a decade ago with the Marcellus shale boom rippled eastward Wednesday as residents of Philadelphia 's suburbs questioned plans for a proposed pipeline through densely populated neighborhoods . Representatives of the Delaware County-based Middletown Coalition for Community Safety told Harrisburg lawmakers that Sunoco Logistics ' proposed 350-mile Mariner East 2 pipeline is too risky . The underground pipeline project would deliver liquid natural gas from Western Pennsylvania shale fields to Delaware County 's Marcus Hook for processing and sale . Citing the Salem Township pipeline explosion last spring , Middletown Coalition spokeswoman Bibianna Dussling said Pennsylvania avoided a mass casualty largely because it happened in a rural area . Too many loopholes exist in regulations to adequately address the risks the proliferation of new pipelines from the Marcellus shale region pose , Dussling said . Her comments stood in stark contrast to testimony offered by Joseph McGinn , a Sunoco Logistics spokesman . McGinn ticked off various tests and reviews the company uses to ensure the safety of its more than 7,500 miles of pipelines . Dussling , a veteran naval aviator and safety and emergency preparedness officer , said she is worried that state and federal regulators have failed to make a complete assessment of the potential dangers such pipelines pose . Given the proposed line 's size and volume , an explosion could sear a blast zone of 1,100 to 1,500 feet , Dussling said . Glenwood Elementary is within a blast zone , and three other schools in Delaware County 's Rose Tree Media School District are within an evacuation area , she said . Northley Middle School in neighboring Penn-Delco School District is within an impact zone , and five other district schools are within an evacuation zone . The joint committee took no action .
