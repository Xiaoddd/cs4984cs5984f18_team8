Courtesy of History Colorado H. 6130.37 At dawn on November 29 , 1864 , approximately 675 U.S. volunteer soldiers commanded by Colonel John M. Chivington attacked a village of about 750 Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians along Sand Creek in southeastern Colorado Territory . Using small arms and howitzer fire , the troops drove the people out of their camp . While many managed to escape the initial onslaught , others , particularly noncombatant women , children , and the elderly fled into and up the bottom of the dry stream bed . The soldiers followed , shooting at them as they struggled through the sandy earth . At a point several hundred yards above the village , the women and children frantically excavated pits and trenches along either side of the streambed to protect themselves . Some adult men attempted to hold back the Army with whatever weapons they had managed to retrieve from the camp , and at several places along Sand Creek the soldiers shot people from opposite banks and brought forward the howitzers to assault their improvised defenses . Over the course of eight hours the troops killed around 230 Cheyenne and Arapaho people composed mostly of women , children , and the elderly . During the afternoon and following day , the soldiers wandered over the field committing atrocities on the dead before departing the scene on December 1 to resume campaigning . Since the barbarism of November 29 , the Sand Creek Massacre maintains its station as one of the most emotionally charged and controversial events in American history , a tragedy reflective of its time and place . The background of the Sand Creek Massacre lay in a whirlwind of events and issues registered by the ongoing Civil War in the East and West ; the overreactions by whites on the frontier to the 1862-63 Dakota uprising in Minnesota and its aftermath ; the status of the various bands of Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians relative to each other as well as other plains tribes ; the constant undercurrent of threatened Confederate incursions ; and the existing state of politics in Colorado including the intrigues of individual politicians in that territory . Perhaps most important , the seeds of the Sand Creek Massacre lay in the presence of two historically discordant cultures within a geographical area that both coveted for disparate reasons , an avoidable situation that resulted in tragedy . These letters , as firsthand accounts of the massacre , reveal the moral resistance of some of the soldiers to the barbarism that surrounded them . As primary sources , these letters show much about the atrocities at Sand Creek while also demonstrating how a hundred men stood in resistance to orders . These letters , and the text of the sign introducing them at the site , can be found here . Please read with empathy and care , as these letters are graphic and disturbing .
