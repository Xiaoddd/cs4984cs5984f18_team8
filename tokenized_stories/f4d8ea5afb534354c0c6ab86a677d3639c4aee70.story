The leaders write : Under your authority , the United States is in the process of writing another disgraceful chapter in its history of relations with Indigenous Peoples . Here is text of letter sent to President Obama : November 11 , 2016 The White House Barack Obama 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington , DC 20500 President Barack Obama , As spiritual leaders , elders , medicine people , we carry great responsibility for our Nations . We are not political people though we stand-up to politics to ensure the future . This Law guides all life and is the spiritual foundation held sacred by Indigenous Peoples around the world . Policies , procedures and laws created by the United States of America continue to hurt the Indigenous Peoples , our ways of life and the natural world . These laws , policies and procedures can be changed or amended what can not change is our absolute dependence on Mother Nature . As President , you have unprecedented access to the latest technological information and data from the scientific community . This vast amount of information provides you with tremendous knowledge . This information is confirming what Indigenous Peoples have been voicing since the arrival of Europeans . Knowledge without wisdom is unguided . Just as science without spirit has brought the people of the world to the brink of self-destruction . It has been extremely difficult for Indigenous Peoples to be understood by those that make decisions based on money . We feel sorry for leaders , including those from Indigenous Peoples , who gamble with our future by making spiritually disconnected decisions . You , Barack Obama , during this meeting with Chief Arvol Looking Horse indicated that you understood Treaties and would address the violations against our people . As Indigenous Peoples we take such words as your word . We recognize those that fulfill their words and those that do not . During your term you have been resistant to uphold your word by refusing to meet with the Aboriginal Indigenous Spiritual People of the Earth . At Standing Rock , we have seen those that are gathering peaceably and prayerfully being met with unprecedented violence . Unarmed people including elders and children are being maced , beaten , shot , arrested , strip-searched and left unclothed in kennels meant for animals . To us that is elder and child abuse . As spiritual people we can not sit and watch as those who claim to be upholding the law , repeatedly violate their own man-made laws . The path to life and a healthy future requires this addiction to end . Under your authority , the United States is in the process of writing another disgraceful chapter in its history of relations with Indigenous Peoples . The lack of inclusion of the Indigenous Spiritual People of the Earth is apparent and is reflected in the continued desecration and destruction of our ways of life , sacred places and Mother Earth . We are not intending to challenge you . Our people are peaceful people , we hold the ancient ways of healing and maintain the sacred knowledge of how to live in harmony with Mother Earth and All Creation . Common sense dictates that it is time to meet when those that are seeking protection for the sanctity of water are jailed while those willing to pollute it are protected . We are once again offering you the opportunity to fulfill your word and meet face-to-face . Your time in office is now short . Therefore , every day is critical . It provides you an opportunity to work with us to heal the future . All Life is sacred . We come into Life as sacred beings . When we abuse the sacredness of Life we affect all Creation As spiritual people , we live by faith and belief in the Creator . We know you can not fool the good spirit . We want to be very direct when addressing this addiction to fossil fuels . Simply re-routing a pipeline does not alter the damaging activities on either end of the pipe or the threat in-between . Previously , he served as editor of the Native News Network . He is a resident of Grand Rapids , Michigan . 17 Comments Patricia Smith Olmstead 2 years ago Exceptional letter . I sorely hope that there will be some positive movement in this regard . Gwen Kirkby 2 years ago I pray that before President Obama leaves the highest and most powerful office , that he will do all in his power to bring stop this pipeline from moving forward . We owe the people of this great nation safe pure water . Clean water is essential for everything survivel . Thank you . My daughter and I have been trying to collect items to bring out there to Standing Rock on Thanksgiving weekend . We are not doing too well . Not getting much response , which is disheartening . There is so much turmoil in our lives right now . . a lot of violence . I think the the other events of the time have stolen the thunder . Uninformed people see the photos and video of Standing Rock and assume it is more of that . Also . . there is reluctance to helping to stop the flow of oil altogether . We all need oil to get to our jobs , etc. . I think it is fear , that is stopping some from helping . Helen Panetti 2 years ago I understand your frustration . In my personal opinion , I truly believe it is the lack of reporting from the big national broadcasting stations . They are told what and what not to televise and rarely report on things that would actually matter to so many and could possibly change things . I have a friend that worked for the media so I know this as fact . The violence is coming from the other side . Good news is , I have gotten a little reaction from krqe in New Mexico and they have actually shown a couple of shot reports . We have to keep trying to get the major networks involved . Helen Panetti 2 years ago Please give me more details and info about the supplies and donations you are trying to gather . Helen Panetti 2 years ago I am not able to be at Standing Rock but I support the efforts being made there wholeheartedly . My son went from west Texas and recently attended a camp there and helped build shelters and saw first hand the awful mistreatment of your people . I was raised on a farm where we were pretty self sustaining and my husband and I know how to live off of the land . We do not take anything we do not need or can not use so I appreciate what the Native American people have done for our country and I pray with you that the raping of Mother Earth will come to an end soon . We stand with Standing Rock and hope our president will do so as well . Make history of being a compassionate President who made a difference . Be like Pres. Lincoln . My family has decided to donate our Christmas to Standing Rock but we need some place to send it to . A name and an address would be handy . Thank you all . Paula Gorgas 2 years ago I am not Native , but my common sense & my Faith tell me what Chief Looking Horse says is true . I stand with you . Monica Birsen 2 years ago I also stand with standing rock . Having been in love with Native American culture since very young , I have read the writings of Black Elk , John Fire Lame Deer , Hyemeyohsts Storm , to name a few . What Arvol Looking Horse says nobody can deny or contradict . Tom Brown of the Tom Brown School of Wilderness Survival proposed that learning wilderness survival and doing a 30 day survival should be a high school graduation requirement in every state of this country . He said if this were done , there would be a lot more awareness of our connection to Nature . Donald Trump , like most world leaders , seems to think he has all the answers , all the power , yet his power and knowledge are based on man-made elements and principles . Cynthia McTyre 2 years ago This sounds like a very sound idea to me . TribalMember and Proud of it . 2 years ago That was a perspective I shared several comment posts ago . It is no solution if it still allows potential harm to come to living humans , animals or any part of nature . THAT is the bottom line . On a side note , it is good to see a representative of the Hopi nation . Thank you Bucky Preston , I do believe in our spiritual way of life . richard smith 2 years ago I sincerely hope you not only get the meeting , but that Obama agrees to reroute the pipeline . It is within his power , and he still has time to make things right , before he leaves office . After that , well we all know nothing good will happen again for at least 4 years . Laurie 2 years ago Re-routing is NOT an option . egruttadaurio 2 years ago I so agree with you Laurie . Renewable energy is what we need to be focusing on . Keep the oil in the soil .
