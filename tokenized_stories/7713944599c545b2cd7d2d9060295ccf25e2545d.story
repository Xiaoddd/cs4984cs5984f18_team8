It is a proposed pipeline that would carry approximately 470,000 barrels of oil over 1,172 miles from North Dakota wells , through South Dakota and Iowa , ending at a shipping port in Illinois . The project was initially approved by the states involved in 2014 , but has been met with several months of protest by activists . The proposed route runs under Lake Oahe on the Standing Rock Sioux Indian reservation . There is also concern that it would lead to increased carbon emissions . Proponents of the pipeline have estimated it would create nearly 8,000 jobs , most of which would be temporary , and lead to lower energy costs . It is expected to generate tax revenue for the four states as well . Back in December protesters celebrated a decision by the US Army Corps of Engineers -LRB- Usace -RRB- denying Energy Transfer Partners an extension of the pipeline under a Missouri river reservoir , seen by the company as a political delaying tactic by the Obama administration .
