Developer Energy Transfer Partners and the Army are battling in court over permission for the pipeline to cross under the Missouri River in southern North Dakota , the last large chunk of construction for the project to move North Dakota oil 1,200 miles to a shipping point in Illinois . Thousands of opponents who have protested for months have been leaving their main camp in southern North Dakota in recent days due to the work stoppage and severe winter weather . Dalrymple said in a statement that the camp might be vacated by Jan. 1 , but Archambault said that 's not the case . Some in the camp have said they need until the end of the year to complete their exit , while others plan to stay the winter , he said . An unknown number of others remain in another camp nearby that 's run by LaDonna Brave Bull Allard , a protest organizer . Some pipeline opponents fear a federal judge will give ETP permission to finish the project or that the administration of pro-energy President-elect Donald Trump will overturn an Army decision this month not to grant permission for the river crossing . The Associated Press reported Tuesday that according to people with knowledge of the decision former Texas Governor Rick Perry is Trump 's choice to lead the Energy Department . Perry is on the board of ETP , although Archambault said that does n't discourage him . The tribe and its supporters believe the pipeline threatens American Indian cultural sites and the tribe 's drinking water , which is drawn from the Missouri . ETP disputes that . Dalrymple and Archambault both said that efforts to normalize relations between the state and tribe rest heavily on reopening a state Highway 1806 bridge right outside the camp . The Backwater Bridge has been closed since being damaged by fire set by protesters in late October . Pipeline opponents think the state is deliberately leaving the bridge closed to block protesters in from the north . Dalrymple said the plan is to enlist the help of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to maintain safety while workers inspect the bridge . Archambault said a timeline was n't developed during the Monday meeting , which also was attended by other Tribal Council members and s state officials . Also , prosecutor Ladd Erickson said he wants people who have been arrested for protesting against the pipeline to reimburse the state for their court-appointed attorneys . The protests have resulted in 570 arrests since August , creating an unprecedented burden for the state 's court system . Must be age 13 . All rights reserved . Weather data powered by Forecast .
