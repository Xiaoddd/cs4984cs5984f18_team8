Dakota Access pipeline opponents burn structures in their main protest camp in southern North Dakota near Cannon Ball , N.D. , on Wednesday , Feb. 22 , 2017 , as authorities prepare to shut down the camp in advance of spring flooding season . State officials are urging the 200 to 300 activists left at the soggy , trash-strewn encampment on federal land to take advantage of the offer by 2 p.m. Central , the deadline set by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to evacuate the floodplain . Light snow fell as some protesters packed their belongings and engaged in prayer in preparation to leave as law enforcement watched from a distance , according to video posted Wednesday on the Sacred Stone Camp page on Facebook . The pipeline would have been finished long ago if it had not been for the bravery , fortitude , and wisdom of the people . Some of those remaining at the camps have said they plan to move to another site . The Cheyenne River Sioux , which is fighting the pipeline project along with the Standing Rock , recently leased private land nearby for protesters . Law enforcement is prepared to arrest those who refuse to abide by the federal evacuation order . More than 700 protest-related arrests have been made since August , mainly for trespassing and rioting involving out-of-state activists . The corps approved two weeks ago an easement for the final 1,100-foot segment of the 1,172-mile , four-state pipeline , which is expected to be completed May 1 . The two Sioux tribes lost a legal challenge to block the project last week , but are slated to appear again Thursday in federal court . Click here for reprint permission .
