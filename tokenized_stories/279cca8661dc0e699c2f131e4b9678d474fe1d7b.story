Over the past few months , the Dakota Access pipeline and the Standing Rock Sioux tribe that opposes this oil project went from anonymity to full blown national news coverage . For months , we have been informed only about the most dramatic developments , but I discovered after a visit to the Sacred Stone camp two weeks ago that public understanding of what this movement is all about is based on misrepresentations . As I prepared to make the trip , I read articles about the risks . And I fell for it . We had gone to North Dakota to learn how GreenLatinos might be able to help the tribe , yet at first I concentrated on myself . But all that anxiety quickly evaporated when I reached the camps . I saw that this assembly of indigenous tribes and supporters is among the most serene and peaceful groups of people I have been around . They are not unified by indignity . What unifies the thousands of water protectors who are bracing for the incoming winter is devotion and prayer . And , they told us , they expect the behavior of their brothers and sisters to reflect that . Even when we were talking about politics , the sacredness of it all was what tribe members conveyed as important . The respect of the people overcame any thought of animosity , and the solemnity of the place and the need to protect nature inspired peaceful unity . This indigenous vision of sacred air , sacred water and sacred land was striking to me . I live in Washington , D.C. , where polarized rhetoric dominates the landscape , and where , since the presidential election season , distasteful attacks are rampant . Visiting the camps and understanding the spirituality driving this struggle against corporate profit was an eye-opening and humbling experience . Water protectors are constantly looking after one another , helping one another . They may not have a lot , but they are willing to give everything . I learned that not just by seeing how they would offer sweaters or blankets as temperatures dropped into the 20s , but also by listening to their stories . One woman , who is now one of many who prepare meals for the camp for free , told me how she arrived with little besides her eagerness to help cook . I have not seen a single news report that elevates this type of story . Still , peace is what this historic indigenous gathering is all about . At a time when we know that fake news stories are rampant , I encourage everyone to verify the authenticity of the news they read . This movement of solidarity is filled with people who , when asked about what they need , say they need us to pray for them . Read more . En el vuelo hacia Bismarck , la capital de Dakota del Norte , estaba sumamente nervioso . Lo que une a los miles de estos guardianes del agua es fervor y plegarias . Asimismo , nos dijeron que ellos esperan que el comportamiento de sus hermanos y hermanas reflejen esta sagrada esencia . No he visto ninguna noticia en donde se resalte este tipo de historias . Pero este no es el caso . Orar y hacer lo que es correcto , eso es lo que nos piden los ancianos de la tribu en este momento . Learn more about Raul .
