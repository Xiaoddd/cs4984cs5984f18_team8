In October , Aaron Turgeon was arrested by Morton County Police and was charged with a felony count of Reckless Endangerment , a misdemeanor count of Reckless Endangerment , and a misdemeanor count of Physical Obstruction of a Government Function , according to court documents obtained by Motherboard . Together , he faces up to seven years in court if found guilty . His court case is Thursday . Several of these aerial videos documented police shooting protesters with water cannons and tear gas canisters . The case raises important questions about the limitations of the First Amendment and the ability for local and state police to enforce laws against drone pilots . The state laws used to arrest Turgeon are rarely used to pursue a drone pilot , and airspace safety has typically been enforced by the Federal Aviation Administration , not local law enforcement . The case hinges of course on whether or not the court believes that Turgeon was flying recklessly . We 've seen this discrepancy come up numerous times before : A pilot claims they are in complete control of their aircraft , but law enforcement disagrees . Who a judge decides to believe in this instance will determine whether Turgeon spends years in jail or walks free . A screengrab from the state 's complaint against Turgeon . Henke also wrote that Turgeon flew near a North Dakota Highway Patrol aircraft ; a video released by the Morton County Sheriff 's Department shows the drone and a plane stay a considerable distance from each other . Previously , law enforcement in other states have lied about drone encounters with police aircraft . In an interview with Indigenous Life Movement , Turgeon said he complied with the officer when he was approached and did not come close to injuring anyone . There are a few things at issue here : The FAA has made flying over people illegal without a specific waiver under its Part 107 regulations , which were released last year . An excerpt from one of the state 's court documents . But Turgeon is being charged under North Dakota state law , not under federal law . As any drone operator will tell you , the risk of bodily injury is largely dependent on the flying skills of the pilot , which likely ca n't be assessed on the spot by a police officer . If found guilty , it would be the first time I 've heard of a drone pilot going to jail based on the assessment of a police officer on the ground . The case is particularly contentious because during the height of the Dakota Access Pipeline protests last year , the FAA and local police conspired to create what many legal experts saw as an illegal no fly zone designed to keep media from filming police . Both local police and federal agencies have been slow to make information about police surveillance and suppression of the protests public : Several Freedom of Information requests filed by Motherboard and other news outlets have been outright rejected , while a FOIA request about the no fly zone has been delayed several times and is now two months past the FAA 's self-imposed deadline .
