BISMARCK - Former DAPL security employee turned whistleblower , Kourtni Dockter , is in hiding . Despite her checkered past and brushes with the law , she is not reneging her stance , and is prepared to testify in court to what she calls illegal actions of TigerSwan and other security companies involved in protecting the Dakota Access Pipeline . They told everyone to be armed . The terms were indoctrinated into security personnel meetings , disseminated to mainstream media disguised deliberately as news , when at least part of the violence along the pipeline in 2016 and early 2017 was amplified and created by the security companies , most importantly TigerSwan , according to Dockter and leaked and requested documents first published by The Intercept . I am expecting everything . There were five-ton military trucks and barricade that boxed us in . Some of the acts reported by law enforcement were committed by security company infiltrators disguised as activists , Dockter said . The charge is one long discussed at the Standing Rock camps , but one for which there was little proof until Dockter came forward with information . Her family supports her , she said . Her father , especially , is undaunted . She described herself as a diehard liberal , who was against the pipeline to begin with , but after meeting Thompson at a local McDonalds , it was love at first sight . The two met on Facebook , and she believes Thompson originally wanted to meet her for information as she had friends involved in the Standing Rock camps . We told each other everything that first night . A veteran , and recipient of a Purple Heart , Thompson suffers from what she believes is PTSD after two tours in Afghanistan and one tour in Iraq . Thompson slowly pulled her into working for North Dakota-based EH Investigations and Security , LLC . Initially , he wanted to become involved with security work because he wanted to protect everyone involved , Dockter said . I feel like I sold out for a guy that I loved . Attempts were made to contact Thompson , but he refused to comment.In January , Dockter began working for EH Investigations , which was subcontracted by Leighton Security Services as the Texas-based company was not authorized to work in North Dakota . Dockter also described TigerSwan media cells using high-tech software to discover locations and intelligence in private social media pages , Dockter said . TigerSwan documents also show that security personnel relied heavily on social media postings for information . Eventually , Dockter was fired after EH Investigations personnel discovered her past with drugs and forgery . She is unfazed by those who say she is not a credible witness . The activities she saw , the plans she heard while with Thompson or working in security , has been eating at her conscience , she said . Dockter 's testimony coincides with a civil action lawsuit filed by the North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board against TigerSwan . The idea that women are not funny never entered my mind . Editorial Wisdom from a forgotten flagpole by Sabrina Hornung Photo by Sabrina HornungI had a little bit of gravel-road therapy this weekend , found myself cruising rural Burleigh County and made a pit stop at Lake Mitchell . Participants were judged on creativity , flavor , and presentation ; and this year we added a new category . I suffer from acute scoliosis in my lower back , and pain radiates from this area on a daily basis .
