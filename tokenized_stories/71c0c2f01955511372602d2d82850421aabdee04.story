A former tribal historic preservation officer of the Standing Rock Sioux , Mentz wore a baseball cap , rimless glasses and two thin braids of graying hair . He was upset and spoke rapidly about the area behind him , an expanse of the Great Plains cut by a new 150-foot-wide road . Two days before , Mentz had testified to the D.C. District Court to report the area that lay in the path of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- corridor holds 82 cultural features and 27 graves . By the next day , DAPL construction workers graded the area . Behind where Mentz stood in the video was a place known as the Strong Heart Society Staff , where a sacred rattle or staff was placed within stone rings . Here members of the elite warrior society would come to make pledges . As an anthropologist who has worked with Native Americans for more than a decade to document their sacred places in the paths of new power plants , power lines , water pipelines and more , the battle in North Dakota is all too familiar . The stand-off between Native Americans in North Dakota and an oil pipeline project developer and police forces has inspired protests across the country . Consultation with tribes too often breaks down because federal agencies are unwilling to consider how Native Americans view their own heritage . Irreplaceable heritage If completed , the Dakota Access Pipeline would run from North Dakota to Illinois for nearly 1,200 miles , carrying up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil per day . DAPL would meander across the landscape , through farms , around cities , buried underground and across more than 200 waterways . The passage of the pipeline over and under waterways requires permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . This federal authorization in turns requires compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act -LRB- NHPA -RRB- . When considering a new undertaking , a number of effects on historic properties must be considered : direct -LRB- like physical destruction -RRB- , indirect -LRB- like spoiling a viewshed -RRB- , short-term , long-term , or cumulative -LRB- like how one pipeline may not harm a site , but perhaps a dozen of them will -RRB- . The NHPA does not guarantee preservation . For many years , Native Americans would have had little input on a project such as DAPL . But in 1992 , Congress amended the NHPA to formally include traditional cultural properties . The amendments directed federal agencies , in carrying out their responsibilities under the NHPA , to consult with Indian tribes that attach religious and cultural significance to these sacred places . Beyond consultation In North Dakota , federal and state review and compliance measures for DAPL were combined . Engineers rerouted DAPL to avoid all but nine sites . Archaeologists serve an important role in documenting historic properties . But they tend to view the world through the lens of science and history . They search out buried villages , pottery shards , bones , broken stone tools . Traditional cultural properties in the U.S. can often be archaeological sites , artifacts that ancestors once touched and places that mark ancestral homes . But just as often they can be a mountain where spirits dwell or a spring where water is gathered for ceremonies . They can be a traditional area for collecting plants or animals that sustain and heal communities . They can be origin places where ancestors emerged onto the earth or named places recalled in ancient tongues . This is why documenting traditional cultural properties requires not the work of archaeologists but Native Americans as well . On one project I conducted with the Hopi tribe to detail cultural resources along a 470-mile power line , we needed weeks of research to identify more than 200 plant species that the tribe uses in its traditional religious and healing practices . When it comes to traditional practices , Native Americans see what archaeologists overlook . Tribal surveys For DAPL , a tribal survey was not undertaken . In North Dakota the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers tried to engage in consultation dozens of times , but the Standing Rock Sioux largely refused because the federal agency only wanted to consult on a narrow corridor at water crossings instead of the entire pipeline . Once , though , consultation did occur at Lake Oahe on March 8 , 2016 . Current designs call for the pipeline to go under this now controversial waterway , which the Sioux want protected . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials admitted they were unaware of some of these sites . On Sept. 21 and then again on Oct. 20 , according to an email I received from the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Office , delegations that included law enforcement , Standing Rock Sioux officials and tribal and state archaeologists went to the areas that Mentz suggested contained 82 sites and 27 burials . Two bones were recovered , but analysis showed them to be from a horse , cow , or bison . It would seem that the main sites Mentz agonized over had escaped physical destruction . However , tribal input would be needed to determine if the sites , so close to the corridor , could still suffer from indirect and cumulative impacts . Not too late Because consultation broke down and so little of the pipeline has received tribal survey , we must wonder how much has been missed . Nearly 90 percent of the pipeline has already been completed . Chip Colwell This is an unfortunate but common occurrence . Last month I went out with traditional leaders of the Zuni tribe in New Mexico to identify traditional cultural properties under the NHPA in the path of a massive network of water pipelines . When we arrived , we found dozens of construction workers busily laying the new pipe . An archaeological survey was already completed ; the construction had begun with the consent of the federal agency . We were too late . Read the original article .
