Photo by Rob Wilson . Victim of police attack . Morton County Sheriff and the Violent Gang of Police Targeted and Arrested Medics while they were Treating Patients By Brenda Norrell Censored News Oct. 27 , 2016 Espanol aqui Dr. Villanueva CANNON BALL , North Dakota -- One of the Standing Rock medics described how police targeted medics , and violently arrested medics , while they were treating people during the violent police attack on Standing Rock water protectors on Thursday , Oct. 27 , 2016 at Treaty Camp , directly on the path of Dakota Access Pipeline . The medic could see silencers on police weapons . As the medics struggled to treat those who were victims of the police attack , they became victims and were violently arrested . Video published on Oct 27 , 2016 Update : Law enforcement are targeting medics . We had two medics arrested and nearly two more arrested . Medics were at the frontline trying to move their car out as police advanced . Two medics were sitting on the trunk . Police approached and hit them both with batons , knocking them both to the ground . Water Protectors helped those medics before law enforcement could grab them . In the meantime , police surrounded the CLEARLY LABELED car -LRB- big Red Cross in the hood as well as on all medic personnel -RRB- and grabbed the driver -LRB- one medic -RRB- while the car was in motion . The other medic was in front of the car and nearly hit by the car as the police took out the driver medic . This is a clear safety risk that the police caused . Both of those medics were arrested . We are asking for more help here . Things are more escalated than before . We need you to stand with us , and we need your help financially as we have lost medical supplies and infrastructure in today 's raid . This is the real thing folks , and we need your help and prayers . Stay in prayer and peace . As you know violent scare tactics . Beating and abusing everyday people , people just like you and me . Please pray that the protectors of the water do not fall into the trap . White Corporate America has to be stopped . Everybody should be hitting up on everyone one pilitition site presidents and prime minster everywhere . need help . I feel like this will cause alot of upset more then befor . Everyone needs to turn around on the goverment . Yes , Cheyenne River Lakota Chairman Harold Frazier met with him in Los Angeles this week and asked him to intervene . Obama did nothing . The video is on Censored News of Frazier describing his meeting . Also , eariler , Obama gave DAPL owners , Energy Transfer Partners in Texas , a permit in May to cross the border into Mexico with their fracked gas . They tore up ancient Indian sites in Big Bend with their bulldozers . It is obvious . The article is on Censored News . A young black criminal made the news and made a difference all around this country with the Obamas cursing white America ways . It would break her heart and kill her to know this is happening . Profit . Period . Profit . Not respect for indigenous rights . Not adherence to treaties . Not respect for medical personel . Not protection of water . Not the survival of humanity on an endangered plnet . No . None of this . Profit . Period . I am calling all our angels and protectors . The Government is money hungry . This list could go on and on . I will say one thing when it is ok to beat old women with a stick and shoot her with rubber bullets , which hurts like hell , this has gone to far . I am ashamed to be an American citizen . People go to church and say they are Christian and pray to God to be forgiven . Come on , no Christian acts like that . You better hope this does not cause then end of the world because what I saw in the videos , God could really be mad . What is a little piece of land . Buy the land somewhere else . We have committed Genocide already with them . Police are to trained to protect and defend . Military are trained to kill . There is a big difference . Little Chicken Shit . Big Man . You can not treat people this way . They are han beings and deserves to live there life in peace . No more Genocide Please . I understand there were live ammo there too . Leave them along . We have enough from the already . I saw Muslims in the streets having a ball because Obama let them in . It was Jesus head cut off and they were laughing and throwing blood on it . This is your Saviour . Think about for a while . If I was God , they would have been struck down . You are brave and strong . In corporate america its ultimate focus is the dollar . Therefore all actions taken thus far demonstrates a corrupted systematic process of brain washing to creating a frenizified state of mind nearing and becoming , militant mob mentality . I send my prayers for unified Life Guidance to help walk you through this , as tough as it seems . My Energy is sent through my Prayers to help you to stand strong and Protect Our Babies Yet To Arrive . The time has come for for judging the dead , and for and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your saints and those who reverence your name , both small and great -- and for destroying those who destroy those who destroy the earth . The time has come for for judging the dead , and for and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your saints and those who reverence your name , both small and great -- and for destroying those who destroy the earth . Thank you , brave people at Standing Rock , for giving up your time , your resources , your energy and your safety for this important cause . I am white , my husband is Native , and we wish we could be there with you . Shame on politicians and corporations for whom money is the only stimulant , for whom profit is the only motivation . Shame on our Government and our justice department , for not deciding once and for all that desecrating Native American lands , that harming Mother Earth , that risking our life blood and polluting our water supplies for generations to come are federal crimes and should be punishable by law . The shortsightedness of these people is beyond understanding . I thought America was beyond abusing unarmed protesters . I was wrong . It is too easy to sit behind our computers and feel righteous . It is up to all of us to help the people at Standing Rock by donating money or food . It is up to all of us to phone and write our local leaders , to sit on the doorsteps of our state legislators , to hound our local news channels with demands for coverage . Sending a LEGION of Angels that live and work in the white Christ light . These militarized robots know only one thing : follow orders . Most of the people I know are Caucasian and hate this as much as the Red and Brown and Yellow people . It is pure Greed , nothing but bullies trying to steal your lunch money . That is what MY Ancestrs prayed to and with , untill the Romans came to comit genocide . Call your state senators and representatives , get them to call the White House and object to treating Americans like war criminals . Stop the pipeline , no matter where it proposes to be put . All they want is to be left alone in peace and govern the little bit of land the white men gave them . Our government just takes what it wants . Something needs to be done about this government and the greedy politicians who cater to the big oil companies . This is the kind of injustice that could trigger a civil war . It is not Black . Or Brown . Bronze and copper . Treaties are the supreme law of the land . What you are seeing at the Dakota Access Pipeline protest is white supremacist colonial law perpetrated in the twenty first century . It is racist because there is liberty and justice for all except the Indians . Treaties are international contracts and the way contracts work is that if you break a contract , the property reverts back to the original owner . But look , with interest , it has grown to over a billion dollars . All of them said the same thing ... We can not be there in person but we are promoting the updates on our pages and putting our financial donations to the funding pages . Most of all - you are in our hearts and in our prayers , we love and honor you and the beautiful Mother Earth whom we al owe our lives to ... do not lose hope - you are not alone - you are not forgotten . As you know violent scare tactics . Sounds like a military assault situation where the Medics would be taken out because then they would not be able to help the water protectors .

ReplyDelete Peace Waits October 28 , 2016 at 6:38 AM Thank you for your sacrifice for all of us . Beating and abusing everyday people , people just like you and me . Young women , daughters , mothers , older women , somebody 's aunt , grandmother . A teenage boy , an old man , shot at , beaten , poison sprayed on him . A lady punched in the stomach with a bat , a group of beefed up police men on one small framed woman attacking , beating , poisoning , jeering at her as she holds onto her sacred prayer bahos . America would be outraged if a Catholic priest was being beaten in public , or a minister had chemical poisons sprayed in his face . America , we need you to want to live too , with clean and safe water for all our relations . Americans , be brave enough to Stand with Standing Rock , this is how America can be great : be great at caring for Mother earth and each other . The profiteers do n't seem to realise that the water protectors will Never give up . Water is Life . Delete Anonymous October 29 , 2016 at 12:17 PM This is SO upsetting an unacceptable .
