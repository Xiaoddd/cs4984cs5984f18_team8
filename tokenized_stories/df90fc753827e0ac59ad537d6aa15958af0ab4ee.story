SIERRA The national magazine of the Sierra Club Jump to navigation Photos From Standing Rock After the Decision Photographer Brian Nevins captures a moment of victory for the Dakota Access Pipeline Resistance All Photos By Brian Nevins . Introduction by Joe Spring . The entire march had stopped on the bridge separating the Standing Rock march from the Dakota Access Pipeline . It was like Moses parting the seas ; everyone split the line open . Nevins was on a flight six hours later from Boston . Some of the people with him at Pine Ridge wanted to go to Standing Rock to be water protectors . He invited Nevins to join them because the photographer has worked with him on past projects , most notably in Nicaragua . Both men were present when news moved through the camp that the Army Corps of Engineers would look for an alternative route to the pipeline , instead of drilling near the camp and under the Missouri River . He says that people also realized that the forces behind the Dakota Access Pipeline might just wait until Trump is in office to move forward , and that they are resolved to protest until the end . His photos capture a march that took place after the announcement was made . It brought me to tears . Sign up for daily updates from Sierra magazine . Something went wrong .
