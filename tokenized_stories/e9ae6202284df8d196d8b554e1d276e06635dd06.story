The Northern Cheyenne are on a journey from their reservation in Lame Deer , Montana , to La Junta , Colorado . In between , they traveled to Lincoln , Nebraska , to collect their displaced relative in order to return the remains to the banks of Sand Creek . Many historians consider the Sand Creek Massacre the most brutal and deliberate attack on an Indian village in American history , and the raid initiated almost three decades of brutal warfare up and down the Great Plains between the United States Army and the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes . One hundred and forty-one years after Sand Creek , the northern and southern bands of the Cheyenne and Arapaho are scattered between reservations and other lands in Montana , Wyoming and Oklahoma . The Massacre In the dawn light of November 29 , 1864 , 700 Colorado soldiers under the command of Colonel John Chivington attacked a Cheyenne and Arapaho camp along Sand Creek , about twenty miles outside the present-day small town of Eads . Chivington was a Methodist minister turned Civil War hero , and he had no tolerance for or interest in the tribes . His troops were mostly volunteers who had signed on for 100 days of service specifically to kill Indians . As the militia approached , an American flag waved over the lodge of Black Kettle , one of the Cheyenne chiefs . Black Kettle believed the flag would spare the lives of his people , and he encouraged them to gather around his lodge as he also raised a white banner of truce . The militia fired indiscriminately on the Indians , and the chief and the others fled for their lives along the creek . His great-grandfather , Braided Hair , was one of the few warriors in the village , and he lassoed a stampeding horse for his pregnant wife and got her to safety . The American soldiers slaughtered without mercy . They hacked off limbs with hatchets , and scalped the wounded without killing them . Defenseless groups of women and children who burrowed into pits along the stream banks were raped and shot . One pregnant Indian woman was cut open and her unborn child left lying beside her . About 150 Indians , mostly women and children , died at the Sand Creek Massacre . Black Kettle and his wife , who survived nine bullets , managed to escape up the creek , but many other tribal leaders did not . They paraded through Denver as heroes when they returned . Those samples ended up in the Smithsonian museum , which eventually housed about 18,500 Native American remains including 4,500 skulls . This status as souvenirs and specimens has represented a tragic fate for the remains , which the government , museums and tribes have begun to address only in the last fifteen years . In 1990 , Congress passed the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act . The law established a formal process to catalog and return certain cultural items , including human remains , to affiliated tribes and descendants . Museums across the country have since repatriated , or returned , such artifacts to tribes . The Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes know of seven human remains from Sand Creek held by the federal government and state museums . The Colorado Historical Society repatriated a scalp lock to the tribes in 1997 through NAGPRA . Representatives of the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes took custody of the individual this past October . The widow of Major Jacob Downing , who fought under Chivington at Sand Creek , originally donated the long lock of hair to the state in 1911 . On this trip , the Northern Cheyenne have picked up a skull fragment of a Sand Creek victim from the University of Nebraska State Museum in Lincoln . The museum knows the cranium was donated in 1927 but not much else : A staff member accidentally discovered it in a drawer with some old paper money . The Northern Cheyenne have brought the skull fragment to Denver where the Colorado Historical Society has stored it for the night . The next morning , before driving down Highway 71 to La Junta , the Indians meet with historical society officials , who invite the men to a basement vault to view a table of artifacts claimed from Sand Creek . Two war bonnets , lost in the chaos . A single buckskin moccasin . This past August , President Bush signed a law officially creating the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site . To date , the federal government and the tribes have purchased almost 2,400 acres along Sand Creek , which the Park Service will manage once the massacre site is finalized . The agency and tribes are now considering a visitors center and interpretive trails and the placement of a cemetery for the repatriated remains before opening the area to the public . Roberts and the Northern Cheyenne representatives envision very little development , and hope visitors will recognize the site as a place of life and activity , and not just a historic relic . The day after the Indians arrive in southeastern Colorado , they head out to the massacre site with Roberts and other Park Service staff , and the connection between past and present is evident in the prayers of Lee Lone Bear , a Northern Cheyenne spiritual adviser . Like the others who have made this journey from Lame Deer , Lone Bear is a direct descendant of Sand Creek victims . His paternal grandfather married a daughter of White Antelope . His great-grandfather was Lone Bear , or One-Eye , a chief who also died at Sand Creek . On this November afternoon , Lee Lone Bear is leading a prayer on a bluff overlooking the cottonwoods and dry creek bed of the massacre site . He chants in the Cheyenne language , and Allen Joe Black Wolf , who is learning the spiritual ceremonies from Lone Bear , stands at his side . Lone Bear later explains that his words are part of an ongoing invocation that began before he left Lame Deer . His prayers include words for the young people of the tribe , and those in the Armed Forces fighting in Iraq . The Reparations Thirteen years before Sand Creek , the United States government and the tribes signed the Fort Laramie Treaty , establishing the first reservation for the Cheyenne and Arapaho . The territory encompassed 51 million acres across four present-day states , including 27 million acres in Colorado . One year after the massacre , still reeling from the devastation and violence , some Cheyenne and Arapaho chiefs signed a new treaty on the Little Arkansas River in Kansas , surrendering claims and rights to Colorado Territory . But the U.S. government also accepted blame for Sand Creek . Fast-forward a century when the U.S. Indian Claims Commission negotiated land-claims settlements with Indians whose territory was taken without compensation . But Sand Creek descendants still retained the right to unpaid reparations . A huge home theater TV towers over the living room , and a litter of kittens bounce around her back porch amid rows of old cars and trucks . The Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho of Oklahoma face similar challenges . Despite the economic potential , Sand Creek descendants among the tribes took offense . But after a chilly reception from Congress and continued opposition from Gov. Bill Owens and the northern tribes , the investors regrouped and targeted the city of Pueblo for the casino site . The project received approval from county commissioners this August before the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho tribal council ultimately rejected the land exchange a month later . He found his pregnant wife alive and riding the same horse for warmth a few days later . So , they were left totally destitute . Braided Hair lived to be 102 years old , dying in 1934 . By then , most of the old ways of life had disappeared . In the years following the massacre , bands of Cheyenne and Arapaho alternately pushed for peace and war with the United States , losing either way . By 1890 , the government had relegated the northern and southern tribes to scrawny reservations , scraps of their once-expansive dominion . Members of the tribes needed permission from the government Indian agent to leave a reservation . Elders were discouraged from sharing their heritage , and many chose to suppress stories of the past . Children learned little about their native language , culture and history . Few residents of the Northern Cheyenne reservation have ever journeyed to Sand Creek , and the tribes had even lost track of exactly where their ancestors had camped and been attacked . The repatriations . Lee Lone Bear , the spiritual adviser , conceived of the healing run as another way to actively remember and reconnect with the history of the Cheyenne and Arapaho people . In the early morning of the run that first year , Lone Bear held a pipe ceremony along the creek with Braided Hair and a private landowner . Lone Bear says the men heard a woman crying , only to realize it was a chorus of coyotes circling them . The Future A few weeks after the repatriation , both Braided Hair and Lone Bear return to Colorado for the seventh annual healing run . The night after Thanksgiving and the run at Sand Creek , members of the northern and southern Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes have gathered for a candlelight vigil at the Denver Art Museum . Braided Hair follows with a long yelp that gives chills even on a 30-degree night . The massacre site is on the verge of becoming a national historic site run by the federal government . The healing run is bringing attention , and receiving support from the city of Denver . The Cheyenne and Arapaho are learning how to make sure their heritage and their stories live forever with the rocks .
