Russian gas pipelines interconnected into Europe are the crown jewel of Putin 's geopolitical arsenal . Yes , the very ` vote ' that granted ascendancy to Trump as the 45th president of America . Many believe that Russia with a volatile , if not belligerent , President aided Trump in no mean measure . Well , this and Russia 's geopolitical importance in the world energy market are fascinating subjects . Unfortunately much confusion and misinformation has been spread about what is happening with Russia and where this is headed . It is the largest country on Earth by far , almost twice the size of the US . It also has the largest known reserves of natural gas with double that of Qatar . Russia is also the second largest crude oil exporter behind Saudi Arabia . Like Saudi Arabia , the Russian state depends on higher oil prices for its funding . Unlike typical Middle Eastern oil producers , Russia also cultivates talent in other industries not the least of which is military equipment . News outlets , aside from recently , are relatively quiet about Russia on a regular basis . Part is due to the legacy of the cold war . Not long ago , historically , everything emanating from Russia - especially ideas - was silenced in the West and it went both ways . The ruling Mongols established trade routes with the Ottoman Empire and Asia and centuries later , modern-day Russia inherited these trading relationships . It comes as no surprise , after all , that Putin gets along with some high ranked officials so well . More on this later . Well , it takes Czar-minded leaders to hold together such a vast nation neither lacking in crude oil , natural gas or land . However , Russia soon found itself on the receiving side of colonization when Hitler 's armies barged in a few centuries later . As it turned out , winter was the wrong time to attack Russia and once Germany was defeated Russia ventured out West for the first time and created a buffer zone - essentially colonizing Eastern Europe . Russia also extended its political influence into western Europe , planting and providing logistical support to then burgeoning socialist parties throughout western Europe , in an unveiled attempt to influence western electoral process . Today these parties are established and shape the -LRB- lack of -RRB- EU vision . This relationship dynamic with the West , prioritizing geopolitical dominance over trade still exists today under Putin , be it with the control of energy supplies , their routes or influence over the electoral process . Russia 's got talent We mentioned earlier that a major distinction between Russia and Middle Eastern energy producers is Russia 's ability to cultivate talent . Indeed Russia does have talent in the realm of science and engineering . Look , until recently Russian chess players were the measure by which IBM 's Big Blue supercomputer was evaluated . Professional prospects for this talent within Russia - that 's another story . The flock of talent into the private sector inspired by Silicon Valley successes has made it difficult for US agencies to acquire and retain said talent . This left them no choice but to turn to private contractors . Unfortunately in the aftershock of the Edward Snowden debacle , increased scrutiny has shrunk the pool of qualified applicants . The answer : Russia has come real close to cornering Europe 's gas supplies and requires reduced interference from Washington in order to proceed . The story is one of intrigue and clever planning . Let 's take a closer look . Non-Russian Gas Pipelines into Europe In recent years the US and EU have attempted to create new gas pipelines , on multiple occasions , to help diversify Europe 's natural gas away from Russia . This came to a crescendo in 2009 when Russia cut off gas for 13 days without warning following royalty disagreement with Ukraine . It was n't the first or last time , either . Russia had cut off Ukraine 's gas because of price disputes in 2006 , repeating the teaser in 2009 and 2014 . Within days , several East European countries that were entirely dependent on Russian gas had to stall key industries and declare a state of emergency . Ordinary people bore the brunt because Russia 's cameo move came in mid-winter . As a matter of fact , when gas was cut off in 2014 , more than half of Ukraine 's and all of Slovakia 's gas came from Russia . It was a massive and dangerous dependence , to say the least . Naturally , this prompted European powers to consider diversifying away from Russia , encouraged by the US perception of a geopolitical threat in Russian pipelines . Granted its proximity to Europe gives Russia a tremendous logistical advantage over any contending natural gas supplier . There are only a handful of candidates able to satisfy Europe 's natural gas needs aside from Russia : Iran , Qatar and Azerbaijan . Nabucco The Nabucco pipeline would have transported gas from Caspian states -LRB- Iran and Azerbaijan -RRB- through Turkey , Hungary , Romania bypassing Russia altogether . It was planned as an alternative route for the thirsty European market . Turkey signed the agreement for the project in 2009 . Pegged as a great opportunity , the cost of the pipeline was relatively cheap at 6.2 billion dollars . Originally the planned length was about 3,900 km which was reduced to just 1,300 km later on . With a proposed capacity of 31 billion cubic meters -LRB- bcm -RRB- per year , Nabucco was funded by European Union and backed by the US . Touted as the ` fourth corridor ' of gas transport to Europe , Nabucco , unfortunately failed . Moldering for some time , the project was cancelled by Azerbaijan in 2013 in favor of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline , said to be shorter by 500 km . Southern Gas Corridor Termed the Southern Gas Corridor , SGC is a set of ambitious infrastructure projects conceived to improve energy security and diversification of resources by supplying gas from the Caspian to Europe . In other words , it 's a complex amalgam of several energy projects like South Caucasus Pipeline , Trans Anatolian Pipeline -LRB- TANAP -RRB- and Trans Adriatic Pipeline -LRB- TAP -RRB- Trans Anatolian Pipeline -LRB- TANAP -RRB- Azerbaijan has more than three trillion cubic metres of gas reserves . Putting these resources to good use , the 1850 km pipeline will carry natural gas from Azerbaijan to Turkey and Europe . A memorandum of understanding -LRB- MoU -RRB- for the pipeline was signed in 2012 between the governments of Turkey and Azerbaijan and subsequently , construction of TANAP started on March 2015 . Europe will get 10 billion bcm of gas a year , while the share of Turkey is expected to be 6bcm of gas . In fact , Turkey can get gas as early as 2018 . Compared to Nabucco , TANAP was not only shorter but transit countries were smaller , reducing cost and risks involved . This pipeline would enable Turkey to become a prominent player on the gas trade map . Trans Adriatic Pipeline -LRB- TAP -RRB- The 878 km long , Trans Adriatic Pipeline -LRB- TAP -RRB- will supply gas from the Shah Deniz 2 field in Azerbaijan to Europe . TAP will connect with TANAP at the Greek - Turkish border and pass through Greece , Albania , and Adriatic Sea before reaching Italy . Construction of TAP started in 2015 and the pipeline is expected to start operation in 2020 . However , the timeline also depends on TANAP project which is being delayed . TAP will have ` physical reverse flow ' mechanism so that gas could be diverted should there be any disruption . The project has the capacity to transport 10 bcm per year with further potential expansion of 20 bcm a year . South Caucasus pipeline South Caucasus pipeline -LRB- SCP -RRB- is a 629 km long gas exportation pipeline transmitting gas from the Shah Deniz fields in Azerbaijan , through Georgia to Turkey . SCP follows parallel to the Baku - Tbilisi-Ceyhan crude oil pipeline -LRB- Incidentally , the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline was built to counter over dependence on oil from Russia and Iran -RRB- . In 2016 , the daily average throughput was around 20 million cubic metres . Expanding SCP , the South Caucasus Pipeline expansion -LRB- SCPX -RRB- project was conceived in 2013 , while construction began in 2015 . SCPX will add another 16 bcma to the existing capacity . Also , as part of SCPX many new facilities like intermediate pigging stations , block valve stations are also being constructed . SCPX will carry natural gas from Russia as well as Central Asia and the Middle East to Southern Europe . Like TANAP , SCPX will start operations in 2019 . Qatar-Turkey pipeline and Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline Qatar-Turkey pipeline was a proposed natural gas pipeline transporting the resource in question from South Pars - North Dome Gas fields -LRB- Iran and Qatar -RRB- to Turkey from where the gas would have eventually reached Europe . The 1500 km pipeline routed through Saudi Arabia , Jordan , Syria and Turkey would have elevated Qatar as a crucial player in the global natural gas market . Qatar 's gas is delivered through tankers which makes it more expensive compared to Russian gas . The pipeline would have made gas from Qatar cheaper . At the same time , the project would have diminished the market share of Russia in European gas imports . know that we have extensively covered these pipelines . As we mentionned in our article titled Oil prices and the Syrian civial war , in 2009 Syrian President Bashar-al-Assad rejected the agreement allowing the 10 billion dollar pipeline to run through Syria to protect the interest of military ally Russia . Instead , in 2012 and under Russia pressure he endorsed the Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline from Iran to Lebanon passing through Syria . The shift was considerable from Sunni Qatar to Shia Iran . Incidentally , the Syrian civial war erupted with Assad 's rejection of the Qatar-Turkey Pipeline . Now both this and the Iran-Iraq-Syria pipelines are unlikely to see the light of day - much like all other non-Russian pipe dreams that were supposed to free Europe from Russia 's gas monopoly . European bureaucracy combined with the lack of coordination and leadership among Caspian gas producers has resulted in minimal progress in any of pipelines mentionned above - meanwhile Czar-lead Russian pipelines are steaming ahead . Russia 's European pipeline collection Several key attributes make gas pipelines a valuable strategic asset . For one thing , pipelines bring natural gas long distances very efficiently , much more so than crude oil . The high viscosity of Crude oil requires heavy pumps and causes significant friction loss , whereas natural gas flows effortlessly with simple pressure differencials . It works so well that gas pipes - a miniature version of gas pipelines - brings natural gas to most every home . Moreover natural gas , while a fossil fuel , burns much cleaner than coal or crude oil by-products . This is why many European electrical power plants run off natural gas . Consequently everything powered by electricity - including the computer you are using to read this article - is dependent on natural gas to some extent . While getting approval for and building a pipeline is hard in the first place , building another competing pipeline is next to impossible . The demand for gas is expected to increase in 2017 because of robust consumption in Italy , France and UK . Close on the heels of OPEC 's decision to cut oil production , gas supplies from Russia to Europe are expected to remain vigorous . Europe just ca n't afford to let such a large share of its gas transit through the Ukrainian warzone . So , pipelines bypassing Ukraine altogether come into the picture eliminating the country 's role as a major transit zone , with blessings of both the EU and Russia . Nord Stream Pipeline This gas pipeline , with two parallel lines , carries Natural Gas from Russia directly into Germany via Baltic Sea . Though it has the ability to deliver 55 billion cubic metres per year , the gas supplied in 2015 amounted to just about 39 billion cubic metres . According to our latest data , the pipeline supplies more than 150 million cubic metres of gas per day . Being shorter , the gas pipeline is very cost effective , so it 's hard for any other foreign power -LRB- such as Qatar -RRB- to build a competing pipeline into Western Europe that would be cheaper . The multi-billion dollar Nord Stream 2 , with two pipelines , is scheduled for 2019 . Each will carry 27.5 bcm per year . Nord Stream and Nord stream 2 will thus supply a total of 110 billion cubic metres per year of gas across the Baltic Sea to the European Union . Turkish Stream Turkish stream , in short , is a chess master 's dream . In the last month of 2014 , Russia abandoned the South Stream pipeline project after disagreements with the EU . In a spectacular turn around , Russia went in for the jugular . So , instead of South Stream , work on two pipeline strings running under the Black Sea carrying 64 billion cubic feet of gas was taken up , after a meeting between Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan . In fact , the pipes and other infrastructure parts ordered for the South Stream project was diverted to the Turkish Stream . The sea section alone is set to cost Russia about 7 billion Euros . The pipe laying under the Black Sea is scheduled for late 2017 . The first string of the project would supply gas to Turkey , while the second string would carry gas to Europe . Also , the south Balkan pipeline which delivers Russian gas to Turkey via Ukraine will be made redundant by the first string of the project . This is a significant strategic victory for Russia . Gazprom , will have rights to the sea part of the project , while the land stretch will be owned by Turkish customers in the first leg and by a joint venture in the second leg . So , Turkey would collect royalties on gas going into Europe to the dismay of Bulgaria , losing royalties , transit revenues and strategic advantage to its former Ottoman overlord . Indeed , Moldova and Romania too lose out in terms of transit fee . Turkish Stream 's main objective is for Russia to bypass existing Ukrainian gas routes . At any rate , Russian target is to stop all gas transport through Ukraine by 2019 . Revenue from export duties will benefit Russia too . Russia and Turkey have also stepped up partnership in defense in the area of anti-missiles . Furthermore , Russia will also build Turkey 's first nuclear power plant . For Turkey , this is a major achievement to show the world that it has the guts to implement major projects without support from Europe . Further , it strengthens Turkey 's geopolitical aspirations in the region . In addition , Turkish stream aligns Russia and Turkey 's interest and dissuades Turkey from building a pipeline to Qatar via Iraq which would have fed into Europe and sap Russia 's market share . Of course , Turkish Stream 's 63 billion capacity outdoes the expected demand in the area . However , the moot point is different . It 's the story of winner gets all . Russia , thus , directly competes with Europe 's plan to diversify away from Russia . It also sabotages Iran 's aspiration for a pipeline . Conclusion Putin sits pretty . US secretary of state is Exxon 's CEO Tillerson , a friend of Putin . Michael Finn , the proposed national security adviser is a strong advocate of Russia . The Russian President has tons of influential friends in Washington , ready to sway things in his favor . In the coming months , US support for energy diversification in Europe will erode quickly , branding the renewal of US-Russia ties as a priority over interfering in foreign energy markets . US progress towards energy self-sufficiency in the sight of persistently low oil prices has also reduced geopolitical concerns over control of foreign energy sources . So it comes as no surprise that the US has started a reform to drastically reduce its Strategic Petroleum Reserve -LRB- SPR -RRB- . Slowly but surely , Russia has laid the groundwork for dominance over the European energy market . For now , Russian ploy seems to be working well . And , Washington has been reined in too . The southern Gas corridor could well be the tipping point . On target , Russian monopoly on natural gas is set . Unsubscribe at any time .
