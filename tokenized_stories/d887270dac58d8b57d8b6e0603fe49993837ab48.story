In 1975 , during a confrontation involving AIM members , two FBI agents were shot dead . Peltier was convicted of their murders , but has always denied killing the agents . Amnesty International is concerned about the fairness of proceedings leading to his trial and conviction . Given that all legal remedies have been exhausted and that Peltier has spent 40 years in prison and is in poor health , please write to President Obama to grant clemency on humanitarian grounds and in the interests of justice . I acknowledge that Leonard Peltier was convicted of a serious crime . I have tremendous sympathy for the relatives of Ronald Williams and Jack Coler . They have the right to justice . Parole examiners have thus far failed to take account of the mitigating factors in the case . Amnesty is concerned about coercion of an alleged eye-witness who said she had seen Leonard Peltier shoot the agents , but who later retracted her testimony , and who was not allowed to be called as a defense witness at his trial . I urge you to ensure that he is given access to appropriate medical treatment and is moved to a facility that can address his medical needs as a matter of urgency until he is granted release .
