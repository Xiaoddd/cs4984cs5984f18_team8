What began with a small beachhead last April on the banks of the Cannonball River on land belonging to LaDonna Brave Bull Allard has expanded to both banks of the river and up the road , to multiple camps that have housed as many as 7,000 people from all over the world . Because of them , first the Obama administration and then a federal court stepped in to temporarily halt construction of the pipeline near the campsite . As the lawsuits proceed , other members of the camp have been involved in nonviolent direct actions , locking their arms around construction machinery to prevent digging . Dozens have been arrested as part of those actions , including 22 people on Sept. 12 , the day I arrived at the camp . In addition to the legal battles and the direct actions , though , the people of the Oceti Sakowin and Sacred Stone camps were preparing for another challenge : a North Dakota winter . Already at night , the temperature drops to 40 degrees Fahrenheit ; deliveries of blankets and warm clothing were constant , as was the chopping of wood for fires and discussion of what kinds of structures would allow the camps to stay in place through the bitter cold months ahead .

To him , as to many others in the camp , that the action is led by Native people , that it is built around their belief in nonviolence and in the spirit of prayer , is vital . It is , to them , much more than a protest . The first camp you pass once through the checkpoint is a small one on the side of the road overlooking the construction site . Further along , signs , flags and banners hang from the barbed-wire fence along the road . People ride through the camp on horseback . At the entrance , when you drive in , you are greeted by security and a man with burning sage to smudge your car . Behind , people march from the Oceti Sakowin camp to the Dakota Access Pipeline construction site , Sept. 13 , 2016 . She is from northwestern North Dakota , the Fort Berthold reservation , and the oil that would travel through the Dakota Access Pipeline is extracted from her community . At first , she remembered , the camp had anywhere from five to 30 people . Then , when Energy Transfer Partners , the company behind the pipeline , put out notification that it was going to begin construction , the camp swelled to 200 , then 700 . It spilled over the river , into what was at first simply called the overflow camp . But as that camp grew , the campers began to feel it deserved its own name . Oceti Sakowin is the name for the Seven Council Fires , the political structure of what is known as the Great Sioux Nation . Faith Spotted Eagle is also part of the Seven Council Fires , from the Ihanktonwan or Yankton band . She too was there on what she remembered as a wintry , blowing day in April when the Sacred Stone camp first opened . An elder and grandmother , she had also been part of the successful fight against the Keystone XL Pipeline , and pointed out that the networks activated by that fight were coming together again in North Dakota . In 2013 , she said , a dream of her grandmother sent her to look at the 1863 treaty between her people and the Pawnee . On the 150th anniversary of that treaty , Jan. 25 , 2013 , those nations , along with the Oglala and Ponca , signed the International Treaty to Protect the Sacred from Tar Sands Projects . Since that time , other nations have joined , and the treaty was renewed with prayers and a donation to the Sacred Stone camp . Standing Rock will do the same thing for the next one .

So do the people who live around it , she argues . Then , just our cultural freedom . Winter will be hard , Spotted Eagle concedes . Kandi Mossett on a hill overlooking the Oceti Sakowin camp . Some of the campers were planning trips back and forth , while others were committed to staying . The nature of the camp has been to swell and shrink ; on the weekends , Kandi Mossett said , it grows exponentially . The estimate of 7,000 at one time does not count all the people who have passed through briefly , bringing messages of solidarity from places like Charlotte , North Carolina and Flint , Michigan . Mossett said . click to view this map on LittleSis There are petitions , Facebook pages for the Sacred Stone and Red Warrior camps , and a call for Barack Obama to visit the camp . The long-term strategy , she said , is similar to that of the Keystone XL project . They told us that about the Keystone XL and they are telling us that now about Dakota Access , that it is a done deal . If the permit is granted , she said , they will continue to hold the space , to risk arrest , to halt construction . The sentiments of Mossett and Spotted Eagle underscore what is perhaps most significant about the camps along the Cannonball River : What is happening here is something more than just a fight to stop a pipeline . In the speak-outs and prayer circles , speaker after speaker , from the Pacific Northwest and from the Amazon , from New York to Arizona recalled the historic violence committed against Native American people not far from where the camp stood . Many recalled the Battle of the Greasy Grass , what is taught to schoolchildren as the Battle of Little Bighorn , which LaDonna Allard wrote was the last time the Oceti Sakowin came together . But for her and others , the massacres at Wounded Knee and Whitestone were closer to mind . It was the anniversary of the Whitestone massacre , where 250 women and children were killed by the US military , when private security guards turned dogs on the protesters at Standing Rock . She was raised speaking Dakota , and counted herself lucky to have her language and the worldview that came with it . The grass-roots organizing that brought together the camp , she said , was helping the Standing Rock people and other tribal governments to look past the structures imposed on them by the process of colonization . In the camp , they experimented with bringing back the long-ago structure of the Oceti Sakowin . We are going to do this and make it happen . The lack of good cell phone service , Lay Ha noted , forces people to be more present . A nurse from the medic tent made rounds , making sure that people knew that at night , the Standing Rock ambulance parked on the grounds would leave but the medics would be on duty . At night , campfires burned and tepees glowed , lit from within , as the open mic for speak-outs gave way to singing and dancing . Bringing in porta potties . Waste disposal . The coming together of the nations was something Mossett wanted for as long as she could remember , and that more than anything helped her envision a victory , not just against the Dakota Access Pipeline , not just against the whole extractive industry but for something much bigger .
