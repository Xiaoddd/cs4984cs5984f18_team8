The Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner-of-war camps , now called reservations . The Pine Ridge Reservation , the subject of today 's slide show , is located about 75 miles southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota . It is sometimes referred to as Prisoner of War Camp Number 334 , and it is where the Lakota now live . Now , if any of you have ever heard of AIM , the American Indian Movement , or of Russell Means , or Leonard Peltier , or of the standoff at Oglala , then you know Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the US . So I 've been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with the Lakota , and that 's a very difficult one for me , because , if you have n't noticed from my skin color , I 'm white , and that is a huge barrier on a Native reservation . You 'll see a lot of people in my photographs today . I 've become very close with them , and they 've welcomed me like family . So take a look around this auditorium today . We are at a private school in the American West , sitting in red velvet chairs with money in our pockets . And if we look at our lives , we have indeed taken the best part of the meat . So let 's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain , and know that when you see these people 's faces , that these are not just images of the Lakota ; they stand for all indigenous people . On this piece of paper is the history the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family . The following is a time line of treaties made , treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles . I 'll begin in 1824 . What is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the War Department , setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native Americans . 1851 : The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made , clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation . According to the treaty , those lands are a sovereign nation . Ten years later . The Homestead Act , signed by President Lincoln , unleashed a flood of white settlers into Native lands . 1863 : An uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota ends with the hanging of 38 Sioux men , the largest mass execution in US history . The execution was ordered by President Lincoln , only two days after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation . We appropriated land for trails and trains to shortcut through the heart of the Lakota Nation . The treaties were out the window . In response , three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the US army , many times over . I want to repeat that part : The Lakota defeat the US army . 1868 : The second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakotas ' ownership of the sacred Black Hills . The government also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states . We promise that the Powder River country will henceforth be closed to all whites . The treaty seemed to be a complete victory for Red Cloud and the Sioux . In fact , this is the only war in American history in which the government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy . 1869 : The Transcontinental Railroad was completed . It began carrying , among other things , large numbers of hunters , who began the wholesale killing of buffalo , eliminating a source of food , clothing and shelter for the Sioux . 1871 : The Indian Appropriation Act makes all Indians wards of the federal government . In addition , the military issued orders forbidding western Indians from leaving reservations . All western Indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war . Also in 1871 , we ended the time of treaty-making . The problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations , and we ca n't have that . We had plans . 1874 : General George Custer announced the discovery of gold in Lakota territory , specifically the Black Hills . The news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers into Lakota Nation . Custer recommends that Congress find a way to end the treaties with the Lakota as soon as possible . 1875 : The Lakota war begins over the violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty . 1876 : On July 26th , on its way to attack a Lakota village , Custer 's 7th Cavalry was crushed at the battle of Little Big Horn . 1877 : The great Lakota warrior and chief named Crazy Horse surrendered at Fort Robinson . He was later killed while in custody . 1877 is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties . Only 10 percent of the adult male population signed . The Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three-quarters of the tribe to sign away land . That clause was obviously ignored . 1887 : The Dawes Act . Communal ownership of reservation lands ends . Reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections , and distributed to individual Indians with the surplus disposed of . Tribes lost millions of acres . The American dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left . The move destroyed the reservations , making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation . Most of the surplus land and many of the plots within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white ranchers . Once again , the fat of the land goes to wasichu . 1890 : A date I believe to be the most important in this slide show . This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre . On December 29 , US troops surrounded a Sioux encampment at Wounded Knee Creek , and massacred Chief Big Foot and 300 prisoners of war , using a new rapid-fire weapon that fired exploding shells , called a Hotchkiss gun . To this day , this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle . More Medals of Honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in World War One , World War Two , Korea , Vietnam , Iraq or Afghanistan . The Wounded Knee Massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars . Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee , I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux , but as a grave for all indigenous peoples . When I look back now from this high hill of my old age , I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch , as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young . And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud and was buried in the blizzard . A people 's dream died there . With this event , a new era in Native American history began . Everything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after , because it was in this moment , with the fingers on the triggers of the Hotchkiss guns , that the US government openly declared its position on Native rights . They were tired of treaties . They were tired of sacred hills . They were tired of ghost dances . And they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux . So they brought out their cannons . Fast-forward . 1980 : The longest-running court case in US history , the Sioux Nation versus the United States , was ruled upon by the US Supreme Court . The court determined that when the Sioux were resettled onto reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders , the terms of the second Fort Laramie Treaty had been violated . The court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken , and that the initial offering price , plus interest , should be paid to the Sioux Nation . As payment for the Black Hills , the court awarded only 106 million dollars to the Sioux Nation . 2010 : Statistics about Native population today , more than a century after the massacre at Wounded Knee , reveal the legacy of colonization , forced migration and treaty violations . Unemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent . The housing office is unable to build new structures , and existing structures are falling apart . Many are homeless , and those with homes are packed into rotting buildings with up to five families . Thirty-nine percent of homes on Pine Ridge have no electricity . At least 60 percent of the homes on the reservation are infested with black mold . More than 90 percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line . The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge is approximately eight times higher than the US national average . The infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent , and is about three times higher than the US national average . Cervical cancer is five times higher than the US national average . The school dropout rate is up to 70 percent . Teacher turnover is eight times higher than the US national average . Frequently , grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents , due to alcoholism , domestic violence and general apathy , can not raise them . Fifty percent of the population over the age of 40 suffers from diabetes . They 're killing each other . This is how we came to own these United States . This is the legacy of Manifest Destiny . Prisoners are still born into prisoner of war camps , long after the guards are gone . These are the bones left after the best meat has been taken . A long time ago , a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me , by wasichu , eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills . Those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end . I have been told that there must be something we can do . There must be some call to action . Because for so long , I 've been standing on the sidelines , content to be a witness , just taking photographs . Because the solutions seem so far in the past , I needed nothing short of a time machine to access them . The suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix . It 's not something everyone can get behind the way they get behind helping Haiti , or ending AIDS , or fighting a famine . The United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms of the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota . Give back the Black Hills . It 's not your business what they do with them . success is not measured in money . I have no financial security , I have no savings account .
