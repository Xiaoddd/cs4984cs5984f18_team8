The story of the Germans from Russia had its beginning in 1763 while Catherine II , a former German princess of the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst , was Empress of Russia . The Czarina found herself in possession of large tracts of virgin land along the lower course of the Volga River in Russia . Catherine was determined to turn this region into productive , agricultural land as well as to populate the area as a protective barrier against the nomadic Asiatic tribes who inhabited the region . Then on July 22 , 1763 , Catherine issued a manifesto inviting foreigners to settle in Russia , in the vast uncultivated lands of her domain . As an inducement to encourage emigration to Russia , the manifesto offered the following rights and privileges to incoming foreign settlers : Free transportation to Russia . The right to settle in segregated colonies . Free land and the necessary tax-free loans to establish themselves . Religious freedom and the right to build their own churches . -LRB- Implied in this was the right to establish their own schools -RRB- . Local self-government . Exemption from military or civil service . The right to leave Russia at any time . Therefore mentioned rights and privileges were guaranteed not only to incoming settlers but also to their descendants forever . These rights and privileges offered a chance for a better life and many thousands of people emigrated to Russia from the Germanic states and principalities of Central Europe . The reasons that so many Germanic people took up this Russian offer were many . The Seven Years ' War had just ended in 1763 . Whole regions in Germany lay devastated and poverty was widespread . Many Germans emigrated at this time to other lands , including the New World , in order to make a new start in life . The first German-speaking colonists who responded to Catherine 's manifesto were directed to lands along the Volga River in the years 1764 to 1767 . Later , as Russia acquired the Ukrainian lands north of the Black Sea from Turkey , colonists were invited to settle in those areas . Similarly , when the Crimean Peninsula and Bessarabia were added to the Russian Empire at Turkey 's expense , colonists settled there . These later emigrations occurred 40 to 50 years after the great Volga emigration . The Black Sea Germans responded to an invitation that was issued in 1803 by Alexander I , the grandson of Catherine . Since so many responded to the Czar 's invitation , the Russian Crown feared that unsuitable immigrants might enter Russia . Accordingly , in 1804 , a restrictive decree was issued that embodied the generous terms of Catherine II but required that all future immigrants must possess cash or goods worth at least 300 guilders , be skilled in farming or handicrafts , and be people with families . No single fortune hunters were desired . The colonists of 1804-1818 had either a long and difficult overland journey or had to travel by river barge down the Danube . Those who traveled to Russia in 1817 went by boat down the Danube and , due to inexperience , many thousands died of disease and exposure . Approximately 300 mother colonies were founded throughout Russia during the settlement years and as the population grew , more acreage had to be acquired for the landless . Thus , numerous daughter colonies were founded . Eventually there were more than 3,000 ethnic settlements in Russia . Their schools and churches provided instruction in their native language , German . Life was generally good for the colonists and they maintained the distinct customs , dress , musical tastes , and dialects of their ancestral homelands . Many adjustments to Russian ways , however , were inevitable . In 1871 , Czar Alexander II revoked the preferential rights and privileges given to the colonist settlers by the manifestoes of Catherine II and Alexander I . The colonists , as a result , were reduced to the level of the Russian peasants and under the same laws and obligations to which they were subject . In 1874 , the colonists ' sons were drafted into the Czar 's army for the first time . The natural result was that the colonists were dismayed and angry , feeling that the Russian Crown was guilty of a breach of contract . As there was nothing they could do , their thoughts turned toward leaving Russia . To return to Germany did not enter their minds , for when their ancestors had left Germany years before , they had no intention ever to return to their native country . During the summer of 1872 , Ludwig Bette , a former colonist , who had led a party of 83 friends from the Black Sea to the United States in 1849 , decided to visit relatives and friends in the Black Sea colonies . Noting the unrest and dissatisfaction among the colonists for having lost their privileged status , he extolled the virtue of the United States , urging emigration there . Shortly after his return to the United States , an emigration movement to the United States , Canada , and South America was set in motion which continued more or less unabatedly until the outbreak of World War I halted further emigration . Alexander III came to the throne of Russia in 1881 after his father , Alexander II , had been assassinated . Russification became the official policy and greatly affected the former colonists . Classes later had to be taught in the Russian language and business was required to be transacted in Russian . Also , it became increasingly difficult for the German-speaking colonists in Russia to purchase the land necessary for their expanding numbers . All of the rights of self-government in their villages were lost by the colonists under the changed conditions . Hesitating to make the long journey over the ocean , many colonists decided to stay in Russia in spite of the Russification policy . In actual number , perhaps more of the German colonists remained in Russia than emigrated to the countries of North America and South America . Because of the requirements of the U.S. Homestead Act of 1862 , the German-Russians who took up homesteads in the United States were required to live on their 160-acre farms . They could not live in villages or colonies as they had in Russia . Many Volga Germans settled in cities in the Middle West of the United States , while the Black Sea Germans acquired land and homesteaded in Nebraska , Kansas , and the Dakotas . Others settled in western Canada by purchase and homesteading . The Volga Germans became closely associated with the sugar beet industry in Colorado and western Nebraska , while most Black Sea Germans became wheat growers in the Dakotas and in Canada ; some later became orchard and grape growers in California . Today descendants of those early Germans from Russia are now living in Colorado , California , Kansas , Nebraska , Michigan , Illinois , Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota and Washington , as well as Alberta , British Columbia , Manitoba , and Saskatchewan in western Canada . Some also emigrated from Russia to South America . A large number of German-Russians , descendants of those who elected to remain in Russia , still live in the Soviet Union . The census of 1959 counted over 1,600,000 Germans living in the Soviet Union and that number grew to 2,300,000 by 1983 . The outbreak of World War I in 1914 caused great difficulty for the ethnic Germans in Russia . Although they fought and died in Russian military campaigns , they , as a class , were accused of being spies and saboteurs . The German language was forbidden in their schools and churches , and German-language newspapers were prohibited . With the Russian Revolution of 1917 , a period of lawlessness prevailed throughout Russia for several years . Robber bands raided the German villages , ruthlessly murdering many of the Germans . Germans living on estates were driven from their homes with only an hour 's notice . Russian regiments revolted , killing their officers , and the Russian soldiers added to the period of lawlessness . The Russian Revolution brought much misery to the German-Russians with many displaced to Siberia and Middle Asia . Those in Bessarabia were spared the hardships and chaos of the Russian Revolution . When the revolt of the army 's soldiers took place , Bessarabia appealed to Romania to restore law and order . This was done and later Bessarabia voted to be annexed by Romania . Russia never acknowledged the legality of this annexation and in 1940 -LRB- since Stalin and Hitler were allied -RRB- Hitler agreed that Stalin could have the return of Bessarabia providing he would agree to the resettlement of all ethnic Germans to Germany . This was agreed upon and the Germans packed their suitcases , abandoning all else , and returned to Germany . As there was no place for most of them in Germany , those who were unskilled were settled in the Warthegau , an area along the Warthe River in western Poland . When the war broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union on June 22 , 1941 , the already planned displacement of all Germans was executed without any exception . The German settlement areas on the Crimean peninsula , the Caucasus , and in the Ukraine were as equally affected as the Germans living in the cities . In connection with the forced resettlement , family and home communities which existed up to then were systematically split . Generally men between the 16th and the 60th birthdays were separated from their families and held in the so-called Trudarmija -LRB- a special kind of prison camp -RRB- where they were treated as enemies of the state . Women and children received poor residences among Russians , Kazachs , and other nationalities . All Germans were told , with threat of punishment , not to return to their former settlements . They had to give up any claims to their possessions , which were confiscated at their former settlements . When the Red Army advanced toward Berlin in World War II , there began for the displaced Russian-Germans in the Warthe region a hasty flight in the wintry cold and snow . Vehicles and train cars , as well as personnel for organizing proper transportation , were missing . One could not stop at protective shelters , so many died along the way from exposure , exhaustion , and starvation . The rapidly advancing Red Army caught up with thousands , captured them , put them in cattle cars , and took them on a long journey without supplies to the northern regions of Russia or to Siberia . Fortunately , some 70,000 were able to make their way to Germany where they and their descendants are living today . Most of the German-Russians who lived on the Volga and in areas not coming under Hitler 's reach were evacuated to the far away Asiatic portions of the USSR . According to the census of 1979 in the Soviet Union 1,936,000 people claimed to be Germans and thus ranked fourteenth among the more than one-hundred nationalities in the USSR . The very first settlement of the German-Russians in the Middle West , specifically Dakota Territory , occurred in the spring of 1873 . This settlement was a direct result of Ludwig Bette 's visit to the colony Johannestal in 1872 when he influenced four groups from the Black Sea area to emigrate to the United States . The four groups , numbering 175 men , women , and children , were united at Sandusky , Ohio , where they spent the winter . In the spring , scouts were sent out in search of land who determined that Dakota Territory was the place for them to settle . They loaded their belongings on a special freight train , possibly one or two passenger cars , and a few box cars , and took off for Yankton , Dakota Territory . They arrived there in one of the worst blizzards on record , and many thought the country was worse than Siberia . This is known as the Easter Sunday Blizzard , occurring in April of 1873 . After the weather cleared , they searched for suitable land on which to homestead , finding land where Lesterville , South Dakota , is now located , about eighteen miles northwest of Yankton . Following the settlement near Lesterville , thousands of Germans from the Black Sea areas of Russia poured into Dakota Territory in the years following . Their homesteads spread westward and northward until most of the arable land was homesteaded in what later became South Dakota in 1889 . As more and more immigrant Black Sea Germans continued to arrive in Dakota Territory in search of land , their homesteads spread in 1884 into what is now North Dakota . Eventually , their homesteads were located in all arable parts of North Dakota . As a result , North Dakota numbers twice as many Germans from Russia than does any other state in the United States . By 1920 , it was estimated that 116,539 German-Russians were in the United States . The largest concentration was in North Dakota , where some 70,000 lived in 1920 , coming from the Black Sea region and Bessarabia . Other large settlements were in Colorado , Kansas , and Nebraska who came primarily from the Volga region . Today , the families of Germans from Russia are spread throughout the United States and Canada concentrating in the Great Plains states , California , Colorado , Oregon , and Washington as well as the prairie provinces of Western Canada . Finally , with the major political changes in the former Soviet Union beginning in 1991 , a significant immigration trend began of ethnic Germans receiving permission to immigrate to Germany . Since 1991 , an estimated more than two million Germans have immigrated to Germany from the former Soviet Union . Immigration to Germany has become more difficult but continues .
