But the Exxon Mobil pipeline spill , initially estimated to have released at least 157,000 gallons of crude oil and driven more than 20 families from their homes , represents only a fraction of the regular oil losses from the huge network of pipelines stretching across the United States . In 2010 , a historic inland spill of 819,000 gallons of diluted bitumen -- a kind of oil from the tar sands in Alberta -- shut down the Kalamazoo River for miles after a pipeline break in Marshall , Mich. . That spill was overshadowed by the cataclysmic BP Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , also in 2010 . Arkansas Atty. Exxon said Thursday the cause of the spill was still unknown and that officials were planning to excavate the damaged portion of the pipeline soon for further investigation . The company remains barred by regulators from reopening the pipeline until the company submits plans for further tests and evaluations . The residents ' attorneys , the Little Rock-based Duncan Firm , noted that the company had once violated federal regulations for not inspecting part of the 65-year-old pipeline for flaws between 2002 and 2010 . Exxon had inspected the portion of the pipeline that cracked in 2010 without finding flaws , but it was still awaiting the results of a February scan conducted on the same segment , according to the Pipeline & Hazardous Materials Safety Administration . As of Thursday , Arkansas health officials had agreed to a plan to open 10 of the evacuated homes to residents , pending air-quality tests , if the residents want the tests . Exxon is paying for the cleanup and says it will honor residents ' claims for damages ; 208 claims have already been filed . Four snakes , 21 turtles and a toad were released back into the wild Thursday , and officials said about 27 animals were still being cleaned .
