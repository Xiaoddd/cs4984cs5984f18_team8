At stake is a 153 square-mile region in the Golan Heights , demarcated by Israeli authorities as exclusive territory for Afek to perform exploratory testing , which began in 2015 , through early April 2017 . But none of this bothers Murdoch , Cheney , Rothschild , and the others , as the Golan Heights to Big Oil represents little more than an exploitative business opportunity . Syria , in fact , has been systematically torn apart primarily because foreign powers and radical groups seek to protect their varied oil interests . And such insistent international meddling at the behest of corporate oil interests so destabilized the entire region , it led to the formation of Daesh -LRB- ISIS -RRB- and similar radical groups . Winning this battle is as simple as choosing to abstain from the violent corrupt old system and participating in the new and peaceful system that hands the power back to the people .
