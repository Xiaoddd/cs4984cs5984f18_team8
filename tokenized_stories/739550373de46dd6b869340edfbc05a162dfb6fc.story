And those earlier disputes over their rights to the land , like the one over the Dakota Access pipeline , pitted the tribes against a persistent force , the Army Corps of Engineers . The federal government has been taking land from Lakota and Dakota people for 150 years , tribal leaders say , from the seizure of land in the Black Hills of South Dakota after the discovery of gold in the 1870s to the construction of dams in the Missouri River that flooded villages , timberland and farmland in the Dakotas in the 1950s . Through the ages , the warring tribes of the Northern Plains lived , hunted and fought across a sprawling expanse of land . Many were migratory , moving with the seasons . Each treaty with the U.S. government , most notably the 1851 and 1868 treaties of Fort Laramie , restricted their movement further , although they left them large areas west of the Missouri River and recognized them as sovereign nations . In freezing temperatures , police used water cannons on protesters just north of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota Nov. 20 . Land was later taken to make way for homesteading . In 1889 , Congress passed legislation that created the modern reservation system , pushing the Sioux , also known as Lakota , into smaller areas . And later in the 1900s , a series of dams across the Missouri River rolled back the scope of those reservations , too . Lake Oahe illustrates his point . The lake , the site of the current dispute , exists because of a dam project built by the Army Corps of Engineers , the same agency that has been weighing whether and where the Dakota Access pipeline could be built . Empowered by the Flood Control Act of 1944 , the Army Corps erected the Oahe Dam in central South Dakota , forming a reservoir that extends about 250 miles upstream to within a short distance of Bismarck , N.D. . In 1962 , President John F. Kennedy dedicated the dam , hailing it as a symbol of a free society tapping its natural resources . It buried them . Caption An encampment has grown near the work site , where security guards face off with demonstrators . The Army Corps simply condemned the land and paid little to no compensation . After building the dam , the Army Corps seized strips of land on either side of the river . Those strips are the areas in dispute now , giving the Army Corps a central role in letting Energy Transfer Partners complete the line , or not . The pipeline battles of the past three months have taken place near the Cannonball . The Standing Rock Sioux are not alone in harboring old grievances , many involving the Army Corps and its dams , Sachse says . The Kinzua Dam in Pennsylvania on the Allegheny River , built in the 1960s , forced more than 600 Seneca families to leave their homes and submerged 10,000 acres of ancestral land . Indians say the project , built by the Army Corps , broke a 1794 treaty signed by President George Washington . The Colville Confederated Tribes sued the government over the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington state , which blocked salmon fishing sites the tribes had used for centuries . In Minnesota this year , the Prairie Island Indian Community bought 112 acres of agricultural land near St. Paul to secure a future home . On its reservation , about 30 miles southeast of the Twin Cities , the tribe has wrestled with flooding from the Mississippi and Vermillion rivers . The reservation has about 3,100 acres of land held in trust by the U.S. government . Located in the 100-year floodplain , the land is unusable for development . Native American disputes are not just history ; they are still alive . But the Sioux rejected the money and continue to seek the return of the land . Energy Transfer Partners did not advance its cause when its chief executive , Kelcy Warren , said in an interview on PBS that he wished the tribe had consulted with the company earlier . Nor did Julie Fedorchak , the North Dakota Public Service Commission chair , who told NPR that the Standing Rock Sioux failed to take part in the 11-month permit process or in 30 hours of open hearings , and that their efforts to reach chairman Archambault were futile . Archambault said in an interview with The Washington Post that the tribal council had in fact met with Energy Transfer executives at the tribal headquarters in September 2014 and that the tribal leaders had clearly stated their opposition to the pipeline . Shale oil produced by fracking in western North Dakota is the main source of crude for the Dakota Access pipeline project . Energy Transfer Partners , which on Monday announced a merger with Sunoco in an exchange of shares , had once hoped to keep the Dakota Access pipeline out of the limelight . A natural gas pipeline lies along a similar route . And railroads pose similar hazards . This pipeline , the company says , is just one of hundreds of pipelines that carry crude oil , natural gas and refined petroleum products across the country . The Standing Rock Sioux have raised concerns about a possible pipeline leak in the Missouri River ; other pipelines have leaked into rivers over the past five years , including some relatively new ones . The pipeline , he says , is made of extra-thick steel and will run 90 to 115 feet below the bottom of Lake Oahe . But the Native American opposition to the pipeline project runs much deeper than that . Steven Mufson Steven Mufson covers energy and other financial matters .
