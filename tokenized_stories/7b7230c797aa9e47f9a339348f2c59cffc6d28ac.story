The arrests , of 46 people , came a day after an evacuation deadline issued by Gov. Doug Burgum . Most protectors left Wednesday of their own volition , and others departed Thursday by crossing the frozen Cannonball River to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . Those who remained at the main campsite were taken into custody . It is a new beginning . About an hour after the protest camp was cleared , Mr. Burgum signed into law four bills that had been passed largely as a result of the protests . They expand the scope of criminal trespassing laws , make it illegal to cover your face with a mask or hood while committing a crime , and increase the penalties for riot offenses . Katarina Bask says : 04:39 my heart is breaking Keyboard Warrior says : 15:02 Why be so rough the water protectors were calm and standing in one spot . Chief Runs With Retardation could not call upon his spirit animal protectors this time around . I also see such tremendous strenght & beautiful unity of the tribes . I give thanks for & honor the new beginning of focus on our future , in our youth & elders in Standing Rock .

There will be a return to respect and truth . Mary Zarts says : 18:21 I am ashamed for my country . Thank you to the elders ... thank you to all who stayed to demonstrate dignity and freedom . Joan McGregor says : 20:24 This is a very sad and tragic day . I too am ashamed of this country and it 's treatment of the Native Americans , and all marginal minorities that we treat like throw away people . It is sickening . Jimbeads says : 22:23 Ayukii - Hello , Reading this article and seeing the photos of this makes one 's heart break , but at the same time , made one angry . When you can arrest our elders , native vets or any vet , and someone for smudging themselves with sacred medicine on our Tribal sacred lands , something is definitely f. ... ked up with this country , but then on the other hand , have they ever treated our Tribal People -LRB- s -RRB- as Human , HELL NO , not since day one . One day maybe they will listen to us and learn a few things , till then all we can do is pray for their sorry asses , the ones that know of nothing but greed , for them , money is their way of life no matter what the cost , PERIOD . Abuse of power . . militarized police force . . aggression . . lies & deceit from ND Government easily proven by ALL the Live feed video Millions around the World have seen & hopefully downloaded . Their own deceitful , hate filled propaganda will visit them shortly in the Federal Courts . You would think after Hundreds of Years , their mindset would have evolved . But their hearts are dark . That speaks volumes . Wake up America . That same police force & All the Constitutional Laws & Articles affect your rights too . Big oil is trying 1 last grab before green energy ALL over the USA , from Canada to Texas . Their running pipelines by schools , water sources & housing plats . They do n't care . Very Soon Their will be NO CLEAN , CHEMICAL FREE WATER LEFT . Then Water will be as costly as GOLD . If not , you die . STAND FOR THE WATER .
