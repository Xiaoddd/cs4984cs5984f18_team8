The 232-mile pipeline carries carbon dioxide to oil fields in Wyoming and Montana for use in enhanced oil recovery . File , Star-Tribune Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save An energy company is seeking federal approval to build a pipeline in eastern Montana that would transport the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide for use in oil production along the North Dakota border . Carbon dioxide is considered a prime contributor to climate change , but it also can be used to breathe life into old oil fields . Companies pump the gas deep underground to push out more oil from tapped-out reserves . Cedar Creek Anticline has potential reserves of 260 million to 290 million barrels of oil , Mayer said . Denbury , based in Plano , Texas , specializes in using carbon dioxide for oil recovery with projects completed or pending in Texas , Alabama , Wyoming , Mississippi and Louisiana . A second Denbury pipeline proposal would link the Shute Creek site to an existing pipeline network that extends into Montana . The U.S. Bureau of Land Management is seeking public comment on the Montana proposal through Nov. 3 . Denbury has not released a construction timeline or specifics on the volume of carbon dioxide that would be transported . Stop watching this discussion .
