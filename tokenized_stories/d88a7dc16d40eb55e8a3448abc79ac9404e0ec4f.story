The governor lists interest in ExxonMobil and dozens of other companies on an attachment separate from his Merrill-Lynch retirement plan . That is unbelievably tone deaf . And a little arrogant . The people have a right to know . Now his office is throwing fuel on the fire . Dalrymple should have been out in front of this , disclosing to the public his financial interests and explaining how they impact his decision making if at all . Instead his office is rebuking inquiries , turning what might be a small and irrelevant financial holding into a big deal .
