In the morning dark , Alpine resident Lori Glover clamped a U-lock around her neck and chained herself to an access gate . Roger Siglin and Arah Joe Battista did the same at other gates . Supporters gathered around and lit candles . That 's when the Pumpco , Inc. , employees began to arrive . It took a succession of bolt cutters to free the trio from the gates , said Mark , before Lori , 44 , and Siglin , 80 , were taken to Brewster County Jail , charged with criminal trespass , and released . Battista , 30 , chose not to be arrested . Residents in Alpine have been resisting the pipeline for more than a year , but with trenching and welding finally reaching their front doors , their tactics have ramped up . And this project opens the door . It 's a planned 148-mile natural-gas pipeline intended to link the fracklands of West Texas ' Permian Basin to the deregulating Mexican economy to the south . Of course , to reach Mexico , it has to cross beneath the Rio Grande first . This week 's lockdown represents the first arrests in this escalating conflict targeting Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- soon to do business as Sunoco -RRB- and its CEO , Kelcy Warren . In late September , about 200 area residents from around the state , including a variety of tribal representatives concerned with the preservation of sacred sites and protection of precious ground and surface water in the region , marched from downtown Alpine to the Pumpco pipe yard and nearby construction site . Attendees peacefully dispersed after an hour of agitated fence rattling . The march was billed as Big Bend standing with Standing Rock . A Brewster County Sheriff 's Deputy speaks with Lori Glover , chained to a fence . A second Big Bend march , this time gathering in late November at the Marfa Mystery Lights Viewing Center and ending at a pipeline construction site about 10 miles east of Marfa , concluded with roughly 20 people illegally entering the pipeline easement to conduct an indigenous ceremony and prayer beside the pipeline trench . After four months of lawsuits , consultations , and numerous direct action protests , the resistance finally wrested a permit denial over the weekend from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , ordering ETP not to drill beneath Lake Oahe and the Missouri River . In response , the Morton County Sheriff 's Department with support from regional law enforcement and an assortment of private security interests like TigerSwan , have countered the non-violent protests with an overwhelming and often indiscriminate display of force that has drawn rebuke from United Nations investigators . The latter is believed by family members and eyewitnesses to have been what exploded on a 21-year-old woman delivering water to those engaged on the front line , nearly separating her arm from her body . Another woman , shot in the eye with a tear gas canister , according to the complaint , suffered a detached retina and is facing possible permanent blindness . In spite of the dramatic level of violence directed against them , and the freezing temperatures that have gripped the camp in recent weeks , the Standing Rock resistance has been tenacious . It is this level of resistance that Warren should expect over the Trans-Pecos and related projects within the state , warned Houston 's Jakki Hagans , a member of the newly formed Society of Native Nations . We 'll bring people here . We 'll have a camp if we have to . Lori Glover is agitating for a full environmental impact review of the pipeline , which she said so far has been denied . Whatever happens at Standing Rock with Lake Oahe on the Missouri River , Glover expects that same spirit of resistance to continue its burn in Texas .
