They bought the allegiances of the two main political parties . The destruction of democratic institutions , places where the citizen has agency and a voice , is far graver than the ascendancy to the White House of the demagogue Donald Trump . The coup destroyed our two-party system . It destroyed labor unions . It destroyed public education . It destroyed the judiciary . It destroyed the press . It destroyed academia . It destroyed consumer and environmental protection . It destroyed our industrial base . It destroyed communities and cities . And it destroyed the lives of tens of millions of Americans no longer able to find work that provides a living wage , cursed to live in chronic poverty or locked in cages in our monstrous system of mass incarceration . This coup also destroyed the credibility of liberal democracy . Self-identified liberals such as the Clintons and Barack Obama mouthed the words of liberal democratic values while making war on these values in the service of corporate power . The revolt we see rippling across the country is a revolt not only against a corporate system that has betrayed workers , but also , for many , liberal democracy itself . This is very dangerous . It will allow the radical right under a Trump administration to cement into place an Americanized fascism . They are the financiers , bankers , politicians , public intellectuals and pundits , lawyers , journalists and businesspeople cultivated in the elite universities and business schools who sold us the utopian dream of neoliberalism . We are entering the twilight phase of capitalism . Wealth is no longer created by producing or manufacturing . It is created by manipulating the prices of stocks and commodities and imposing a crippling debt peonage on the public . Our casino capitalism has merged with the gambling industry . The entire system is parasitic . Casino magnates such as Sheldon Adelson and hedge fund managers such as Robert Mercer add nothing of value to society . They do not generate money but instead redistribute it upwards to the 1 percent . They have given themselves the legal power to carry out a tax boycott , loot the U.S. Treasury , close factories and send the jobs overseas , gut social service programs and impose austerity . They have , at the same time , militarized our police , built the most sophisticated security and surveillance apparatus in human history and used judicial fiat to strip us of our civil liberties . They are ready should we rise up in defiance . These mandarins are , if we speak in the language of God and country , traitors . They are parasites . Financial speculation in 17th-century England was a crime . Speculators were hanged . Donald Trump is not an anomaly . He is the grotesque visage of a collapsed democracy . The Snopeses filled the power vacuum of the decayed South and ruthlessly seized control from the degenerated , former slave-holding aristocratic elites . They embody the moral rot unleashed by unfettered capitalism . comes next , history has shown , will not be pleasant . A corrupt and inept ruling elite , backed by the organs of state security and law enforcement , will unleash a naked kleptocracy . Workers will become serfs . The most benign dissent will be criminalized . The ravaging of the ecosystem propels us towards extinction . Magical thinking will dominate our airwaves and be taught in our public schools . Art and culture will be degraded to nationalist kitsch . All the cultural and intellectual disciplines that allow us to view the world from the perspective of the other , that foster empathy , understanding and compassion , will be replaced by a grotesque and cruel hypermasculinity and hypermilitarism . Those in power will validate racism , bigotry , misogyny and homophobia . Our only hope now is an unwavering noncooperation with the systems of corporate control . We must not be seduced into trusting the power elites , including the Democratic Party , whose seven leading candidates to be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee demonstrated the other night at George Washington University that they have no interest in defying corporate power or backing democratic populism . We must also acknowledge our own failures on the left , our elitism , arrogance and refusal to root our politics locally in our communities . Rosa Luxemburg understood that unless we first address the most pressing economic and physical needs of the destitute we will never gain credibility or build a resistance movement . Revolt , she said , is achieved only by building genuine relationships , including with people who do not think like us . Revolt surges up from below , exemplified by the water protectors at Standing Rock . Politics is a game of fear . Those who do not have the ability to make power elites afraid do not succeed . The platitudes about justice , equality and democracy are just that . Only when power is threatened does it react . Appealing to its better nature is useless . They did so imperfectly . They provided only enough reforms to save the capitalist system from widespread unrest or , with the breakdown of capitalism in the 1930s , from revolution . They never addressed white supremacy and institutional racism or the cruelty that is endemic to capitalism . But they had the ability to ameliorate the suffering of working men and women . This safety valve no longer works . When reform becomes impossible , revolution becomes inevitable . The days ahead will be dark and frightening . We fight for the sacred . We fight for life . It is a fight we must not lose . To be a bystander is to be complicit in radical evil . Revolt is a political necessity . It is a moral imperative . It is a defense of the sacred . It allows us to live in truth . It alone makes hope possible . The moment we defy power , we are victorious . The moment we stand alongside the oppressed , and accept being treated like the oppressed , we are victorious . The moment we hold up a flickering light in the darkness for others to see , we are victorious . The moment we thwart the building of a pipeline or a fracking site , we are victorious . And the moment those in power become frightened of us , we are victorious . I do not know if we can build a better society . I do not even know if we will survive as a species . But I do know these corporate forces have us by the throat . And they have my children by the throat . I do not fight fascists because I will win . I fight fascists because they are fascists .
