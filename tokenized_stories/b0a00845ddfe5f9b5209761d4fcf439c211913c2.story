Gov. R. Snyder For those that want to do something for Flint , Mi ; I hate to tell you this , but , this is the truth . Before they can put their water back on Detroit water like it was , they must replace all the pipes through out the whole city . The Pipes In Flint If you want to protest whats going on in Flint then push for the Governor to be put in prison for the murder of all people of Flint . The news is not reporting everything , The info that I have is that they are replacing the pipes in most of the homes and will do so through the city starting this spring and then place the water back on the Detroit system . account .
