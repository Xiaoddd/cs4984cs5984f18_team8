The ruling is seen as a rare legal setback for Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners , which is stirring controversy with separate projects in Texas and in North Dakota . The parties to the suit are to meet Nov. 28 to see if they can reach an agreement before the Dec. 7 hearing , one of the orders said . There was a partial collapse in the first canal under which the pipeline crossed in September . The federal government , which owns the infrastructure that brings water to the district from New Mexico , joined the suit and moved it to federal court in October . A collapse could also damage the pipeline , a spokeswoman said Tuesday . The project , the Comanche Trail Pipeline , is one of several Energy Transfer Partners projects generating controversy . It and a sister project , the Trans Pecos Pipeline , will carry natural gas from near Fort Stockton to two different points in Mexico . In both cases , Texas regulators have said they have little power to control the routes of the projects . On Sunday , opponents in Marfa held another protest of the Trans Pecos project , which they say has already destroyed important archeological sites . Indian groups danced as part of the protest . A third Energy Transfer Partners project , the Dakota Access oil pipeline , continues to generate international headlines . On Monday , 16 were arrested in protests over concerns that the project will pollute the water supply of an Indian tribe whose reservation it passes near . Opponents to the project also say it is destroying archeologically significant sites . In the El Paso dispute , local officials want the pipeline to be dug more deeply under irrigation canals and for other precautions to be taken . Reyes said that instead of boring at the 10-foot depth that Energy Transfer Partners wants , his district wants the pipeline 25 feet deep . The district also wants the pipeline encased or covered in concrete to protect it from future digging . In addition , Reyes said , the irrigation district wants Energy Transfer Partners to share its schematic diagrams so that irrigation officials will always know where the pipeline crosses district canals . The irrigation chief said he knew of no other instance in which Energy Transfer Partners was forced to modify its plans in court . Their content is produced independently from our newsrooms .
