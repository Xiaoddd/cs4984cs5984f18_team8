That is what the Water Protectors of Standing Rock have done for me . After months of watching events unfold in Cannon Ball , my husband and I decided that we could no longer sit idly while the biggest fight for environmental & human rights of our lifetime was being fought . I proposed the idea of driving to Standing Rock to help with the camp and two days later , we made the 12 hours drive with our baby and our dog . The standoff at Standing Rock is an age old story of colonialism . But after 500 years of systemic oppression , the Standing Rock Sioux tribe decided enough was enough and took on the fight to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline . They also argue that the pipeline goes through miles of land which rightfully belongs to the tribe . Officials from Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- the company behind the pipeline -RRB- claim that the pipeline is safe and does not encroach on native lands . The Army Corps of Engineers approved the pipeline despite objections by three government agencies including the EPA . The full document can be found here . The DAPL was originally routed to cross the Missouri River north of Bismark . This route was rejected because the citizens of Bismark , a predominantly white town , expressed concern for its potential threat to their water supply . Oh the irony . You can read more about the original route here . Then On the drive to Standing Rock , I was unsure what to expect . Reports of clashes between the water protectors and militarized police monopolized my social media feeds . Temperatures were beginning to drop and it happened to be our very first camping occasion as a family . For some reason , these banners quelled my worries . When we found a spot to set up camp , we were greeted by warm campfire lit smiles of our would be neighbors . One lady told me that the tent next to ours was vacant , left by a friend of hers in case someone was in need of shelter . By the time Mitz finished setting up our tent , the sun had set so we made our way around the camp to observe our surroundings . Drums , chants and singing filled the air . People were gathered arround campfires listening to stories or up on their feet dancing like noone was watching . Our exploration was short due to exhaustion from the drive . We decided to call it a night early in preparation for the next day . That night was cold albeit bearable . What stood out was the constant sound of a helicopter flying over head . This went on all night . I learned the next day that this was a nightly experience , they were being monitored by law enforcment despite the area being a no fly zone . We started the next day with a quick breakfast followed by a drum march to the river . There , elders led a prayer and people waited patiently in line to bless the water . An action in Bismark was scheduled that morning . We missed the caravan by a few minutes so we decided to stay behind and help with winterizing the camp . While walking around , I was so impressed by how self sufficient the camp had become . Day in and out , volunteers worked the kitchen to provide lunch and dinner for everyone in need . At another tent , blankets , jackets , and other supplies were sorted free for anyone lacking . By the Sacred Fire , a ceremonial fire at the center of the camp that people kept burning day and night , people of different races and ages converged to listen to elders speak , pray , and partake in ceremonies . The People By the Sacred Fire , we met a fellow Filipina from San Francisco . Her time there , like ours , was brief as she had to be back for parent teacher conferences come Monday . When I asked her why it was so important that she personally came , she said it was because there was no way she could justify not helping to her children . He had been there for weeks already having left his job and sold his home in Georgia to be there with the Water Protectors . There is a woman named Diane Hart who made the 2000 mile drive from California to North Dakota . She said her heart was drawn there and she had hoped that her presence makes a difference . At the end of the buffet line , she waits to greet every person served and gives them the type of embrace only a grandmother full of love can offer . Every day , they organize actions-mass ceremonies , prayers , and marches to the front line where police await . Direct action orientations are held daily . They emphasize that all actions must be peaceful and encourage the water protectors to pray for the opposition . Now Over the past few weeks , the camp has been in rush mode to prepare for the North Dakota rush winter . With temperatures below freezing , the water protectors were sprayed via a water canon on top of an armored vehicle . Tear gas , rubber bullets , and concussion grenades were reportedly used . Many were treated for hypothermia and one young girl now faces losing her arm after she claimed law enforcement threw a concussion grenade right at her . Days later , on November 25th , the Army Corps of Engineers served the camp with a notice to vacate by December 5th or risk facing arrests citing public safety concerns . Yesterday , the International Indigenous Youth Council along with the tribal elders held a press conference imploring President Obama to honor the promise he made to protect the tribe a few years prior . Send supplies for the water protectors . You can find a list of their needs here . Donate directly to the camp here . Funds will be used for sanitary , supplies , and emergency purposes . Donate to the protesters legal defense here . A list can be found here . More than ever , they need people with special skills -LRB- legal , medical , carpentry , etc -RRB- , bodies to stand in solidarity , and voices and prayers . Keep the conversation going . Familiarize yourself with the events going on at Standing Rock . Talk to your friends and family about it . I find it magical that you took your little one . We need more people like you to make our voices be heard . Thanks for sharing about it . Thank you for sharing your experience .
