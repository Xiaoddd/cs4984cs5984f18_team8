Initially , HMWSS&SB planned to generate power through turbines from Gunagal to Sahebnagar water reservoirs . As the system has not been tried anywhere in the country and companies are unaware of it , there is a possibility of tying up with foreign companies for implementing the project . MAUD Minister KT Rama Rao suggested HMWS&SB go for generation of power through turbines as it produces green energy . The in-pipe water-to-wire power systems are considered to be innovative for generation of power from an excess head pressure of water pipelines which can be a solution for the growing energy demand . The in-pipe water-to-wire power system would be helpful to recover the energy that is used to supply water . The energy is obtained from the pipe water , where the turbine will rotate due to flow and pressure of water , and the rotating turbine is connected to a generator . HMWS&SB wanted to undertake the project from the agencies who are empanelled with Energy Efficiency Services Limited -LRB- EESL -RRB- , HMWS&SB Chief General Manager -LRB- Transmission Circle -RRB- , B Vijay Kumar Reddy said . The advantage of this technology is that it produces neat and clean energy which does not affect the environment . It does not depend upon weather conditions . It does not affect the quality of drinking water . It is one of the cheapest ways to produce power whereas in case of solar and wind they cost more to produce the same amount of energy . The system depends upon two main components in-pipe hydrodynamic turbines and generators . The idea of the system is that one can fix turbines in gravity fed water pipes that would start rotating as the water flows through the pipe . More the velocity of water more will be the speed of rotation of the turbine , which will result in more extraction of energy . The turbine shaft is connected to generator set and power is generated at the terminals of the generator . But we need to be judicious while moderating your comments . editorial .
