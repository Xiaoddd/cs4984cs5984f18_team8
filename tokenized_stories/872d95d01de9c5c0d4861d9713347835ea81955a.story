The blanket charges that we -LRB- and 139 others -RRB- face are : criminal conspiracy to endanger by fire -LRB- felony -RRB- ; engaging in a riot -LRB- misdemeanour -RRB- ; maintaining a public nuisance -LRB- misdemeanour -RRB- . Katriona and I are graduate students at the University of Northern British Columbia and traveled to Standing Rock both as people , and as writers , committed to the protection of water and to decolonization . At the time of our arrest we were standing as allies with Elders in prayer . We feel deeply privileged to have stood in solidarity . We welcome and are thankful for letters and petition signatures from everyone . As it stands , building more infrastructure to get oil to market is not consistent with Paris Agreement targets The result of these charges will indicate whether the United States justice system is able to treat peaceful dissidents fairly Below is a template letter that you can copy and paste into a document , adjust as you see fit and send to Nicole to be delivered to The North Dakota Supreme Court . I am writing to request the charges laid against Nicole Schafenacker , Katriona Auerbach , and the 139 water protectors arrested on October 27th , 2016 , be dismissed at the preliminary trial . This support and understanding , enhanced by their academic work , strongly advocates engagement in current events representing historical patterns and an effort to change typical historical outcomes . I strongly urge you to reconsider your actions and to release the detainees . Misdemeanours still stand at the moment but I 'm visualizing them evaporating too . Your words , well wishes and signatures are walking this walk with us . Sending MUCH LOVE AND GRATITUDE and the knowledge that your goodness will be reflected back to you .
