Our question instead is what does this mean for the Left in this country . Paralyzing myths have now been shattered , and this situation could , with a lot of work , passion , and clear thinking , lead to a strategy of action and a far greater positive change than voting for the status quo . The change we are talking about is generational and will have a far greater effect than any string of elections , no matter how repugnant they may be . Yes , there is absolutely a conflict between the rich and the poor , but that has never been the only division in this country . Those that see the Greatness of America as being misogynist , nativist , anti-urban , and homogeneous in race , sexuality and faith are fighting a rearguard battle against the future which they can not hope to win . What is distressing is that this desperate rhetoric has captured the imagination of many who have suffered real humiliation and pain under the neo-liberalism of the one-percent . From this vantage point , American electoral politics has been nothing more than a zombie horde of defunct worldviews along with oppressive and dangerous ideologies lurching across the blue and red states . No president can overturn the demographic reality that this country will continue to urbanize , will become more and more diverse , and that the mythologized manufacturing jobs of the past will remain dead and buried . The second shattered myth is that electoral politics is a valid arena for populist leftist change . Whether it is Syriza or Trump , Podemos or Hillary , in the end the Left must confront the oppressive powers of the State and capitalism , none of which can possibly be subverted by superficial electoral games . This is not to say there would be no difference between a Trump administration and a Bernie administration , rather it is to say that the latter would only serve to stall the inevitable confrontation . Electoral politics holds out the promise of slow-moving , incremental socio-political advancement , but real evolution only comes about with a radical change of environment , and this can only be achieved through social revolution . Revolution is not an event that suddenly happens , but something that is carefully prepared , built towards , and eventually implemented by those aligned with the future . All governments , whether they are liberal or conservative , will fight equally hard against threats to the State or the capitalist power structure . Liberal and conservative governments are both inherently reactionary and resistant to any kind of meaningful change , if only because their very existence is dependent on freezing the present and obscuring all possible futures . We have seen this play out recently in places like Spain , Greece , the UK , and countless other countries . It is always the same paradigm : the political structure refuses to truly change and will continue an endless cycle of lurching back and forth between liberal and conservative . This brutal and blind impulse towards self-preservation is not only found in rightist regimes . The third myth is that the government has ever been our government . The government is the tool of the State , it is an occupying force now , just as much as it was before . All occupying forces of the twentieth century pair an outward benevolence with a healthy dose of fear and repression . We have always understood this formula , and have been struggling against it . The situation has changed and will continue to change during the next four long years . Attacks on women , LGBTQ , POC , immigrants , political dissidents , and so many others , have been par for the course for too long , and the coming years will be no different . We need to pluck up our courage , ready or not , and do what we can to stand up to the bullies . We need not only audacity , but imagination . Our theater of action must move beyond the co-optable symbolic opposition to the lived reality of everyday struggles against oppression . Our actions need to be bold like the Greek anarchists who squatted a hotel to house refugees or the German Leftists who physically shut down and re-purposed a neo-fascist radio station . We need to continue to expose the systemic brutality against those racially targeted by the police . While the Trumpists spew their fevered conspiracy theories we will double down on reality . There is no cavalry coming , no courts , no congressional gridlock , no petitions , no media ; now it is clear the only recourse is action from the ground up . We can cower in the corner , or we can stand up and make new comrades with whom we will grow our resistance . We must become ungovernable to the occupation and unwavering in our support of those that feel targeted . This is how resistance is born and how it achieves victory . The liberals promised to protect everyone with nothing but a ballot , and now they have been routed and are publicly conceding on all fronts . They are asking us to passively accept whatever injustices Trump has planned for us , for our neighbors , for our friends , for our co-workers , and for those comrades we have not yet met . We have never believed in hiding who we are or being ashamed of our liberatory aspirations . We know the power of solidarity . We have relied on it for generations and we know it is a stronger , more honest way to protect ourselves and ensure our future . Four years is too long to hide in fear or to look the other way . Let us not be afraid , let us not offer concessions , for we know our work has begun and the future is coming .
