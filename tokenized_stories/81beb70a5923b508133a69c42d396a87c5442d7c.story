Here 's what you need to know about him and his plans for the agency . Pruitt has spent much of his energy as attorney general fighting the very agency he is being nominated to lead . And he has gone on to challenge the administration not just over the environment but over a host of other areas . He has also sued the administration over the Affordable Care Act , saying the health-care mandate on religious employers to provide coverage including contraception was unconstitutional . He has sued over the Dodd-Frank financial reform . An ally of the energy industry , Pruitt , along with Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange , came to the defense of ExxonMobil when it fell under investigation by attorneys general from more liberal states seeking information about whether the oil giant failed to disclose material information about climate change . Environmental groups reacted with alarm Wednesday at the nomination . Pruitt has also fought to limit the scope of the federal government in regulating pollution of rivers under the Waters of the United States rule . Industry representatives expressed satisfaction with the choice Wednesday . Although oil and natural gas production sagged in the 1990s and early 2000s , the surge in horizontal fracturing , or fracking , has boosted output . For the week ended Oct. 28 , there were 73 drilling rigs in operation in Oklahoma . Pruitt has served as head of the Republican Attorneys General Association , a group that has relied heavily on funds from ultraconservative groups and the oil industry . Pruitt , a Kentucky native who moved to Oklahoma to attend the University of Tulsa law school , has also been active in religious groups . He serves as deacon of the First Baptist Church of Broken Arrow . In 2012 , Pruitt was named a trustee of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary . Before serving as attorney general , he was a member of the state legislature . However , the precise fate of the regulation most immediately turns on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit , which has not yet ruled in the lawsuit brought by Pruitt and his fellow attorneys general against the agency Pruitt is now named to lead . Environmental groups would likely sue the agency over such a move . The United States is already burning less coal and more natural gas , meaning fewer carbon dioxide emissions . In 2030 , the EPA projected in its final Clean Power Plan rule , coal would be reduced to providing 27 percent of U.S. electricity , with natural gas at 33 percent . Yet this very year , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration , natural gas will provide 34 percent of U.S. electricity , and coal 30 percent .
