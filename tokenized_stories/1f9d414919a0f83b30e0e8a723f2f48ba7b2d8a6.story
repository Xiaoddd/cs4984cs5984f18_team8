The U.S. government temporarily halted construction of the planned Dakota Access pipeline on federal land after it angered the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . On Sunday , protesters attempted to remove a barricade on the Backwater Bridge on Highway 1806 , which the Indigenous Environmental Network said had been blocking emergency vehicles from reaching the Standing Rock Tribe . Police say the bridge is n't safe to cross . The clash quickly escalated . Some protesters started fires to keep warm in the 25-degree-Fahrenheit temperatures . Police sprayed water on the fires , reportedly to put them out . But some activists said the police started some of the fires when they flung tear gas canisters at the protesters . Kevin Gilbertt , an activist who posted several Facebook live videos Sunday night , said he witnessed protesters trying to put canister fires out while police fired the water cannon on other groups peacefully demonstrating . Either way , many protesters were doused with water in below-freezing temperatures . At 25 degrees Fahrenheit air temperature , as it was near Standing Rock on Sunday , frostbite can set in within 30 minutes . Even being in water under 50 degrees Fahrenheit can cause exhaustion or unconsciousness in 30-60 minutes . This video , captured by a drone , shows a bird 's eye view of police spraying protesters with the water cannon . Scientists have found that vehicle-mounted water cannons like the one the cops were using can knock a full-grown man down , and cause severe injuries to the eyes , ears , and genitals . Police also fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters , attempting to get them to disperse . By 1:30 a.m. , Indigenous Rising Media reported that one elder went into cardiac arrest and had to be revived , 12 people were hospitalized for head injuries , and almost 200 were injured . A protester posted this video on Facebook of people getting sprayed with the water cannons . The protesters continued their standoff with police on Monday , though tensions were much calmer . Police may use a water hose again on protesters in the future , an officer said at the press conference on Monday . All rights reserved .
