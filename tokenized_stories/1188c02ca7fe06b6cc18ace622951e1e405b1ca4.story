I was sitting in a coffee shop in Tegucigalpa , Honduras , the night it hit me : I had to go to Standing Rock to document all sides of the ongoing Dakota Access Pipeline fight . This has happened before , a film choosing me , rather than me choosing it . During the interview , Pearl was visibly grieving , and yet seemed to possess incredible strength . When we reconnected at Standing Rock in September , I was in the midst of my own grief . I had recently lost a baby in a second-trimester miscarriage . Shortly thereafter , I lost my relationship with her father . Only one was with a man . As it turns out , women are the backbone of the movement . The women of Standing Rock are willing to risk their lives to stop the pipeline construction that desecrated their ancient burial and prayer sites and threatens their land , water , and very existence . They exemplify what it means to be an authentically empowered woman in the matrilineal way of being . A woman 's strength is motivated by a desire to serve the greater good . More than a phrase , it is a guiding principle for living that extends to all beings . This includes the land and waters , both of which are feminine in nature . It is an entity that you have a relationship with and you respect , like your grandmother , mother , and aunts . We have to be good stewards . We have to take care of the land . We have to feed her and offer her prayers . In return , we are blessed with good health . Our enemies are also our relatives . One afternoon , I witnessed an exchange between an elder and a young cook who had cursed the pipeline executives . You dishonored Mother Earth and the bounty that came from her . You lowered the vibration of the opposition . I asked one of the organizers how , after nearly 525 years of oppression , the 300 tribal nations represented at the camp could believe that peace will prevail . At Standing Rock , service can be literal , as is the case for the women who prepare and serve food to thousands at the camp each day . Washing dishes , caring for the children , or readying the warriors for their marches may be seen through Westernized eyes as subservient . Here , these acts are performed with honor . We believe our ultimate weapon is prayer . This , I was told , does not mean that women should emulate men . In interview after interview , the women of Standing Rock said that we are at the end of the patriarchal era of competition , aggression , and force . As Pearl explained , we are now in a new era called the Fifth World by the indigenous peoples of North America . That energy resonates with the highest frequency , which is love . Compassion . One morning , a 14-year-old girl asked those sitting before the sacred fire to reflect upon the trauma that may have occurred in the lives of the pipeline security guards who attacked members of the camp with dogs and pepper spray . They need kindness . The women of Standing Rock remind us that strength can be subtle or forceful , and that both are necessary . 3 . A woman 's strength is sustained by a sense of responsibility . Their vow to protect Mother Earth and all her inhabitants is their responsibility to the ancestors , and to the seven generations to come . Many decisions are made without any consideration for the future . This struggle is very real . Not just as indigenous people . The more time I spend with the women of Standing Rock , the more I see that Pearl was right . I admire the strength of these women , who even in the face of adversity and devastation , care for themselves , their families , their communities , their nations , and the earth on which we all depend . Because of them , I have greater hope for the future . Theirs is the story that the world must see . Shannon Kring is a contributor from the United States .
