Palestinians began stepping up diplomatic pressure of France on the issue of recognition in wake of Israel 's passing into law legislation that under some circumstances legalizes the presence of West Bank Jewish settlements constructed on privately owned Palestinian land . France hosted an international peace summit last month . After meeting Abbas on Tuesday , French President Francois Hollande called on Israel to repeal the law . Speaking at the end of their meeting , Abbas said the new law creates an apartheid regime in the occupied territories that the international community should act to reverse . The legislation along with announced new settlement construction constitute aggression against the Palestinian people , Abbas said . Abbas said the Palestinians have adopted the concluding statement of last month 's Paris peace conference on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , which speaks of the need to protect the two-state solution , for a freeze on settlement construction and an end of the occupation . The international community should act to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 , which condemned Israel 's settlement policy as illegal , the Palestinian president said . He also called for convening an international conference to bring the parties together by the end of the year . Abbas said the Palestinians are firm in their position that East Jerusalem must become the capital of a Palestinian state and that the transfer of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would wreck the peace process . The Palestinian Authority , he added , would seek to redress their grievances via the International Criminal Court in The Hague . Ramallah has said that the reports about dismantling the Palestinian Authority or stopping security coordination are not on the agenda , because coordination means the continued operation of the authority and dismantling it would only serve Netanyahu 's interests .
