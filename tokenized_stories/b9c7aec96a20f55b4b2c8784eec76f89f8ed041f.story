This story was part of that reporting . Police have stopped manning a roadblock near the camp in what they said is an effort to de-escalate tensions . But law enforcement authorities are still facing intense criticism , including a class-action lawsuit after a number of protesters were injured during confrontations . For months , the Backwater Bridge has been the line of scrimmage between protesters and police . About three quarters of a mile north of the main protest camp , the small concrete span carries North Dakota Highway 1806 over a narrow creek . The highway is the shortest route to Bismarck , about 41 miles to the north , but it remains closed to all traffic . Protesters and police clashed late at night on Nov. 20 , as protesters sought to push past a bridge leading to the Dakota Access pipeline construction near the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota . In late November , just before police left the bridge , they used a PA system to warn one protester . Police did not arrest the man . He eventually ambled away . But the situation 10 days earlier , on Nov. 20 , was much more tense . With temperatures just below freezing , independent filmmaker Jake Westly Anderson of Utah had his camera rolling when police started dousing protesters with water from a fire hose mounted atop a vehicle . Several dozen people , many holding makeshift plywood and plastic shields , were about 15 feet from the roadblock when officers launched what appear to be tear gas canisters directly at them . A number of protesters were hurt that night . Vanessa Dundon of Arizona , a member of the Navajo Nation and the lead plaintiff , said a tear gas canister struck her in the face , blinding her in the right eye . Law enforcement formed a line to prevent protesters from crossing a bridge Nov. 20 . Sophia Wilansky , 21 , who 's not part of the class action , nearly lost her arm that night . She has undergone multiple surgeries to save it . At a news conference at Hennepin County Medical Center last month , Wayne Wilansky described his daughter 's injuries . It just blew out . It was n't caused by a fire or anything else . This was a grenade . Wilansky said police threw the grenade ; authorities strongly dispute that . Two members of the Stutsman County SWAT team talk while deployed to watch protesters . Many protesters contend law enforcement is over-militarized . But Laney said a small segment of the movement is looking for a fight , and officers must defend themselves with helmets , shields and bulletproof vehicles . Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said the ATF and North Dakota 's Bureau of Criminal Investigation are looking into what caused Wilansky 's injury . Protesters had set up camp on private property owned by the pipeline developer , Energy Transfer Partners , before they were forcibly removed by law enforcement in October . Even though police and protesters who were at the Backwater Bridge Nov. 20 have widely divergent views about what happened , one outside observer who 's experienced with street protests said law enforcement has been overly aggressive . Officers in riot gear clashed with protesters near the Dakota Access pipeline in November , hitting several dozen with pepper spray as they waded through waist-deep water in an attempt to reach property owned by the pipeline 's developer . Stamper said he regrets that decision , and contends a combative response to peaceful protesting can escalate violence . Police in North Dakota say they 've shown restraint even in the face of violence . They 're quick to point out that one protester , Red Fawn Fallis , 37 , of Denver , is facing a federal firearms charge after a handgun she was allegedly carrying discharged as police arrested her during another incident at the Backwater Bridge in October . Fallis , who 's one of more than 570 people arrested since August , is being held in the Stutsman County Jail . The federal public defender 's office said Fallis could face trial as soon as February . Must be age 13 .
