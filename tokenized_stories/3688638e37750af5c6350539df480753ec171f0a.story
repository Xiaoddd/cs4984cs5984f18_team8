With excellent access to shipping lanes and supposedly massive untapped wealth -LRB- perhaps as much as 110 billion barrels -RRB- it is no surprise that multinational oil companies are intrigued , but responsible investors would be wise to think twice . by Alex Dick-Godfrey Last month , Soma Oil and Gas , a London based energy company , searching for hydrocarbon deposits off the coast of Somalia , announced that it had completed a seismic survey to ascertain the potential for recoverable oil and gas deposits . Although further details have yet to be released , chief executive Rob Sheppard announced that the results were encouraging . However , Somalia , and potential investors , should proceed with caution when considering entering this frontier market . East African oil exploration , and in Somalia specifically , is not a secret . Energy firms like Royal Dutch Shell and Exxonmobil operated in Somalia before the government collapsed in 1991 . But recent gains against the insurgent group al Shabaab in the south and the decrease in piracy off the coast have sparked a regeneration of the industry . The paper discusses how the oil industry in Somalia could have a promising future , but it also explores the risks facing Somalia if the development of its petroleum resources is not carefully managed . The historic challenges that have limited business opportunities in Somalia , domestic insurgency and piracy , have diminished for now , but these threats have not disappeared . Al Shabaab has been largely pushed out of southern Somalia by multinational forces , but has recently proven that it is still able to operate in the north of Kenya . As Kenya flexes to counter al Shabaab in its own country , it could provide an opportunity for al Shabaab to return to its previous strongholds in Somalia . And even as piracy has largely stopped , it is conceivable that al Shabaab or others could see oil tankers as opportunities to resurrect that practice as well . Beyond these security challenges there may be political disadvantages to developing the hydrocarbon sector in Somalia . Balthasar notes , among other things , that oil will likely exacerbate existing rifts and political tensions . In the context of the recent political turmoil and contentious federalism process , it is clear that any foreign oil companies would face a high degree of political instability and uncertainty . Balthasar also points out that the legal and constitutional conditions in Somalia are ambiguous in determining who can enter or negotiate contracts with oil companies . Without a well-defined regulatory environment for oil and gas resources , federal states , semi-autonomous regions , and the central government could all separately negotiate and enter into conflicting extraction agreements with private companies . The opaque regulatory nature of these resources has already proven problematic in the semi-autonomous regions of Puntland and Somaliland . This is all likely to lead to further turmoil and maybe even conflict over profitable fields and the distribution of revenues . Somalia is probably not ready for oil development . With excellent access to shipping lanes and supposedly massive untapped wealth -LRB- perhaps as much as 110 billion barrels -RRB- it is no surprise that multinational oil companies are intrigued , but responsible investors would be wise to think twice . The underlying political instability and security challenges of Somalia will likely inhibit the long term feasibility and profitability of these projects . View the discussion thread .
