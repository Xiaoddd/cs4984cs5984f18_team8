Veteran . Surfer . Member of Congress . Doing my best to be of service . Miles away on the mainland , thousands are standing up for this reality each day in what has become the largest Native American protest in a century . The Dakota Access Pipeline also represents a threat to hundreds of thousands of people downstream , the nation , and the world . Moreover , it is a relic of an outmoded energy paradigm , an unneeded acceleration of a fossil fuel economy that is hastening the effects of climate change . Those two things are intimately intertwined . This movement owes its roots to the original stewards of the Earth . Our Founding Fathers also took great inspiration from Native Americans and their forms of governance , and the democratic principles they were founded on . Their unique form of governance was built on an agreement called the Great Law of Peace . This recognition of our debt to the Creator and our responsibility to be thoughtful members of this great web of life , was there from the beginning of Western democracy . Last month , a panel of three federal judges took a step towards this recognition by temporarily halting construction of a 1,134 mile stretch of the Dakota Access Pipeline intended to transport crude oil . This legal struggle is only just beginning . We can affirm Peace , Equity and Justice by calling on President Obama and the Army Corps of Engineers to respect the sacred lands of the Standing Rock Sioux , to respect their right to clean water , and to acknowledge our shared responsibility to stop investing in dirty oil and start investing in a clean energy economy for the wellbeing of our nation and the world .
