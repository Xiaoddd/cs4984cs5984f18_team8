But according to an updated estimate , the amount of oil that leaked from Bell Fourche was significantly higher , making it one of the largest pipeline spills in the state 's history . That 's three times as much oil than was initially estimated , and that does n't even include the hillside area of the spill , which Belle Fourche estimates could contain up to 20 percent of the spill 's total volume . Fracking . Tight oil . The leak occurred after the company shut the pipeline down on November 30 last year for routine maintenance after a heavy , wet snowfall . The weight of the snow caused a hillside to slump , and this , combined the absence of the usual pressure inside the pipeline , caused the pipeline to bend . One of the bends happened around a weld in the pipe , and the pipe cracked . Because the leak was not detected electronically , officials had to visually estimate the amount of oil that had leaked , leading to the underestimation . North Dakota 's recent oil boom has left the state particularly vulnerable to these kinds of failures . Less than a third has been cleaned up . ... . A farmer noticed the smell of oil permeating the air for days on end , and the wheels of his combine became coated in the stuff . Yet Bill Suess , a North Dakota Health Department environmental scientist , worries that much of the oil may never be removed . Whenever a failure occurs , companies will put protective measures in place to prevent further leaks . But failures continue to crop up to strengthen the resolve of many who oppose them , despite pushback from the Trump administration 's pro-pipeline policies . There are no cases of livestock or wildlife deaths that were shown to be directly related to the spill , though there have been some cattle deaths and one dead beaver in the vicinity of the leak .
