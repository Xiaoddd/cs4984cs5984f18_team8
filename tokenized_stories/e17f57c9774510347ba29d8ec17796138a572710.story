By Associated Press Feb 23 , 2017 AP Most of the Dakota Access pipeline opponents abandoned their protest camp Wednesday ahead of a government deadline to get off the federal land , and authorities moved to arrest some who defied the order in a final show of dissent . The camp has been home to demonstrators for nearly a year as they tried to thwart construction of the pipeline . Many of the protesters left peacefully , but police made some arrests two hours after the deadline .

Their conditions were n't given . After the deadline passed , as many as 75 people outside the camp started taunting officers , who brought five large vans to the scene . Police took about 10 people into custody for failing to heed commands to leave , authorities said . With darkness falling , Lt. Tom Iverson said police would not enter the camp Wednesday evening , and he offered no timetable for doing so . Levi Bachmeier , an adviser to Gov. Doug Burgum , said about 50 people remained in the camp at dusk . Hours before , about 150 people marched arm-in-arm out of the soggy camp , singing and playing drums as they walked down a highway . It was not clear where they were headed . One man carried an American flag hung upside-down . Authorities sent buses to take protesters to Bismarck , where they were offered fresh clothing , bus fares home and food and hotel vouchers . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers set the deadline , citing the threat of spring flooding . At the height of the protests , the site known as Oceti Sakowin hosted thousands of people , though its population dwindled to just a couple of hundred as the pipeline battle moved into the courts . The camp is on federal land in North Dakota between the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and the pipeline route that is being finished by Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners . When complete , the project will carry oil through the Dakotas and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois .

New camps are popping up on private land , including one the Cheyenne River Sioux set up about a mile from the main camp . Others , including Dom Cross , an Oglala Sioux from Pine Ridge , South Dakota , said he planned to return home after living at the camp since September . Law enforcement officers and first-responders were on hand from several states . Charles Whalen , 50 , an alcohol and drug counselor from Mille Lacs , Minnesota , said he and a group of about 20 people were not going to leave on their own and were willing to get arrested to prove their point . Some campers said they were leaving with mixed feelings , both energized by the long protest and saddened to leave new friends . Some people set off fireworks . Matthew Bishop , of Ketchikan , Alaska , has been in North Dakota since October . He planned to move to another camp . Bishop said as he tied his possessions to the top of his car . A massive effort to clean up the camp has been underway for weeks , first by protesters themselves and now with help from the Army Corps in removing debris . Some vehicles and pedestrians were having trouble getting through the muck created by recent rain and snow , and cleanup efforts were suspended in part because camp officials did not want heavy equipment making conditions worse .
