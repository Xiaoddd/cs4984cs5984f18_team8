People say two West Texas pipelines being built by the Dallas-based company are damaging the environment , destroying cultural treasures , jeopardizing safety and giving a raw deal to the owners of land through which they pass . A spokeswoman said good community relations are paramount to company because its employees are members of those communities . However , not everybody sees it that way . The tribe and its supporters are fighting the 1,200-mile ETP Dakota Access oil pipeline that is planned to run from North Dakota , through South Dakota and Iowa and then connect with an existing pipeline in Illinois . Then on Sept. 3 , when members of the Standing Rock Sioux tried to stop construction in what they regarded as a sacred site , they were set upon by private security guards with police dogs and pepper spray . Opponents of the project held a protest march on Friday morning in Alpine . Lisa Dillinger , another spokeswoman for Energy Transfer Partners , denied the company had destroyed an archeologically significant site . Many environmental scientists say that if we are to forestall catastrophic climate change , relatively clean-burning natural gas is an important bridge to time when more renewable sources of energy are available . The two ETP pipelines running through West Texas will carry gas to Mexico , a country where demand for power is growing . The irrigation district and the pipeline company ended up in court when ETP invoked eminent domain . ETP won . Friday afternoon , Reyes reported that the district was now blocking Energy Transfer Partners from boring under a canal that it never sought permission to cross . When ETP doubled its offer , the farmer , Ramon Tirres , took it , even though it was still only half what he believed he should get . That means 195 miles of the Comanche Trail Pipeline and 148 miles of the Trans Pecos Pipeline are regulated by the Texas Railroad Commission , while just over 1,000 feet of each is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission . The federal stretches are near San Elizario and Presidio , where the pipelines will cross under the Rio Grande to the middle of the riverbed and connect with their Mexican counterparts . Railroad Commission spokeswoman Ramona Nye acknowledged that her agency has little power over where pipelines are built . Safety concerns San Elizario Mayor Maya Sanchez said federal approval of the 42-inch Trans Pecos Pipeline means her town will have yet another big pipeline crossing near her town and even closer to San Elizario High School . The ETP project comes in addition to the 30-inch Roadrunner Pipeline owned by Tulsa-based ONEOK Partners that also is under construction . Energy Transfer Partners says that safety is its top priority . She said that regulators and governmental officials have been less than forthcoming about the hazards the projects pose for her community , much less given residents a chance to stop them .
