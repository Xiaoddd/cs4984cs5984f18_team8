Yes , she thought , she absolutely could . Haaland is a citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe and one of a record number of Native American women running for office this year . The daughter of military veterans , Haaland attended 13 schools before she graduated high school . To pay her way through college , she decorated cakes and started a salsa business . She earned a law degree while raising a daughter as a single mother and working part time at an antique auction shop . At times , her family relied on food stamps , a reality she said many New Mexicans face as the state has one of the highest poverty rates in the country . She also supports calls to eliminate the Immigration and Customs Enforcement -LRB- Ice -RRB- agency and to impeach Trump . If she wins , Haaland says her top priorities in Washington would be protecting the environment and growing a clean energy economy . She would also fight for more funding and resources to combat violence against women , a scourge that disproportionately affects Native women . Political analysts view it as safely Democratic . Hillary Clinton won the district by more than 16 percentage points and Democrats have held the seat since 2009 . Haaland is part of a broader trend of Native Americans increasingly running for national office , after centuries of systematic persecution , marginalization and disenfranchisement . The United States did not grant citizenship to Native people until 1924 . There are currently only two members of Congress who are Native American : the Oklahoma Republicans Tom Cole and Markwayne Mullin . Sharice Davids , a member of the Ho-Chunk nation , is running in a competitive Democratic primary in a swing district in Kansas , and Amanda Douglas , a member of the Cherokee nation , advanced to a runoff election in the Democratic primary for a deeply conservative Oklahoma congressional district . She worked for years in Democratic politics before an unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor in 2014 . She then served as the state party chair . She sailed past her opponents in what was expected to be a competitive race by turning out a coalition of progressive voters that agreed with her on issues such as climate and healthcare . In a Democratic district , she is positioned favorably ahead of the general election . A victory in November would seal her place in American history .
