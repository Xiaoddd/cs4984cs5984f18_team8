Some plan to stay indefinitely . Not only would the DAPL threaten the safety of their water supply , but it also violates the land that is sacred to the tribe . Construction was supposed to take place through Bismark , North Dakota , but the plans were allegedly rerouted because of concern over possible water contamination .
