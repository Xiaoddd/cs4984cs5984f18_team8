Monday night , Trump appointed Steve Bannon , alt-right head of Breitbart News and a known white supremacist , as chief White House strategist . And swastikas are appearing all over churches , schools , and bathrooms walls across the country . Now , with white supremacists at the helm , civil rights are in a bad way . Kaepernick is a stealth yoga teacher . A few weeks after Kaepernick kicked off his peaceful protest , I led a yoga philosophy training for current teachers . We covered philosophy basics from old school yoga texts like the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita , and revisited the often-murky history of yoga . She brought up Colin Kaepernick . Brilliant , I thought . Yes ; this is what yoga looks like in the real world . -LRB- Before I go any further , I want to be really clear here : I have deep respect and gratitude for the incredible folks who serve in the armed forces . My nieces are proud members of the military , and I am daily inspired by their passion , intelligence , and dedication . I believe you can protest the broken aspects of oppressive American society without disrespecting the brave people who put their lives on the line in service . I grew up in Nebraska . I spent my teenage Saturdays sprawled out on the living room carpet listening to play-by-play radio analysts rave about stellar mid-1990s Husker teams . So after living in San Francisco for a decade as an adult , I already had Kaepernick on my radar . When he declined to stand for the anthem , his gutsy patriotism rippled throughout my social networks . The engaged Buddhist in me was hooked . The intersectional feminist in me raised a fist in agreement . And the yogi in me took a deep bow . Most importantly , though , the parent in me realized what a powerful yoga teacher Kaepernick could be for my own young son . My little man is just shy of 3 , too young yet to attend one of my yoga classes . But for now , our job as parents is to model and teach him the philosophical principles underlying the practice . You can stretch this concept -LRB- bad pun intended -RRB- to apply it to every relationship , every conversation , and every job , so that your life becomes a vision of moving through the world in steadfast grace . 2 . Speak your truth . Satya urges you to be brave enough to be real , and to call out injustice , making a case for progressive change . It reminds you to own your morality , even amidst criticism . I said from the beginning I was against oppression , I was against the system of oppression . -LRB- His words , unpopular as they might be , do have a civil rights precedent . 3 . Keep learning . 4 . Protest peacefully . The Buddhist and yogic precept of ahimsa , or nonviolence , encourages us to live in a manner that creates less suffering . Kaepernick is modeling peaceful protest while making a powerful case for justice . He got a lot of flak in his time , too . -RRB- 5 . Practice asana . The pose becomes a tool for watching where your mind and breath go in the process . 6 . Suffering is real . Dukkha is at once an inescapable part of being human and an existential inconvenience we can try to alleviate . And it is our own suffering that makes us capable of feeling empathy for one another . 7 . Everyone has the same amount of God . In other words : no matter the color of your skin or the religion you practice or the amount of money in your bank account , you , too , are a unique manifestation of the divine , and deserve to be treated as such . 8 . Oneness . There is no other ; there is no separation . Your suffering is my suffering . My peace is your peace . 9 . Keep breathing . Even when folks rage against you . Especially when folks rage against you . 10 . Hold your drishti . He reminds us to stay focused , to direct our gaze with intention , and to hold it confidently , in spite of any detractors . My little guy may not yet be able to rock Vasisthasana , but he can most definitely practice being grounded and peaceful and strong . He can learn to see the spark of divinity in everyone . And he can work with his breath to stay calm when things get intense . Colin Kaepernick modeled it first . My son is white . He was born into privilege just because of his gender and the color of his skin . This is yoga . And we should all join Kaepernick in taking a knee . Her work has appeared in The Washington Post , On Being , Yoga Journal , Tricycle , Yoga International , HuffPost , and more . Very peaceful and quiet , so very quiet . Of course , it is also filled with joy and wonder , but it is not what you imagine . It is much , much less . Many mistake the intoxicating power of otherworldly charisma for enlightenment . More often than not it is simply otherworldly , and not necessarily free or enlightened . I think we have to reevaluate what strength looks like . This election result is so hard to face . All these grounding and courage building tools will be required to fight hatefilled attitudes while maintaining the attitude of love that we value . This will be a battle as epic as the Bhagavag Gita . Evil uncle and all . Reply Link Matt Yes , you should totally tell your preteen son that he is guilty of Original Sin , and start making him atone for it early . that happens on december 19 , 2016 . until then , what we have is a presumptive president-elect , who trails in the popular vote count by about 1.7 million votes . Reply Link Mark Colin kaepernick is a very brave guy . He put his career on the line just to get out a message for change . It worked well because he did get the president to talk about and alot of other americans including ousiders . He is a true modern day hero . No one should be forced into a vow of loyalty -LRB- except maybe the military -RRB- . I understand that the anthem does not speak to where he thinks this country should be . However , not voting is another issue . Perhaps if he had written in someone he thought might be better , I could accept that . Or tell us what changes should be implemented to make this a true democracy . Reply Link Dave The military has a code of ethics that seems to follow along with yoga principals as well . There are 3 to look at , military codes of ethics , conduct and standards of behavior . To be thorough . your niece is of course excluded . Think before you spew you hate . There are many Red Yogi patriots in the USA . Reply Link Lindsey Agreed . Reply Link Mary Byerly I love this . Thank you . All Rights Reserved .
