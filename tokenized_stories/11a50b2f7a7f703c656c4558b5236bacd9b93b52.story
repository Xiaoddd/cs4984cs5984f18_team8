Looking more like scenes from a forgotten foreign corner of the world than anything in our own First World country . Their most current and public plight , the controversy of the Dakota Access Pipeline , has been brought into the Main Stream Media spotlight over the past nine months . But even that has only shed light on one plight , one battle , that one Nation is fighting , out of 562 Nations encompassing 4.12 million people -LRB- National Congress of American Indians -RRB- . Approximately 229 of these ethnically , culturally , and linguistically diverse nations are located in Alaska ; the rest are located in 33 other states . The United States Constitution recognizes that Indian Nations are sovereign governments just like Canada and California . The Supreme Court , Congress , US Presidents , and hundreds of treaties have repeatedly reaffirmed that Indian Nations retain their inherent powers of self-government . The camp that was once Oceti Sakowin has been evacuated , bulldozed , and completely cleared of Water Protectors . But the fight still continues . But the battle is still real . They have called on all Native Nations . They need all of us . This is not just a Native American issue . It is for all Americans to stand with them . They are on The Mall in D.C. now . They March tomorrow . Actions and Organizations : MARCH with Native Nations Rise in D.C. , tomorrow , Friday , March 10 , 2017 . PETITION Congress to demand a FULL and fair environmental review of DAPL . WATCH the ABC documentary on the International Indigenous Youth Council of Standing Rock -LRB- IIYC -RRB- and hear the stories from those who , with next to nothing , made the brave decision to stand against an entire country for their rights and their beliefs .
