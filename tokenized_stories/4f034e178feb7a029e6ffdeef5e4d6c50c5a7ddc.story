The impeachment was a victory for many of South Koreans who have taken to the streets for the past six weeks in massive street rallies to demand her resignation . The first anti-Park candlelight vigil was relatively small , but grew with each passing week as more Koreans became enraged by the series of revelations implicating Park in the scandal and her refusal to step down . -LRB- Yonhap -RRB- The president made an apology a day later , saying she sought advice from Choi , who had previously helped her through difficult times , on public speeches . As her apology fell short of clarifying suspicions , the first protest in central Seoul drew about 30,000 people . At that time , the protestors , mostly unaffiliated citizens who came with their family and friends , demanded the truth from the president . Only a few called for her resignation . The following week , Park reshuffled her Cabinet and presidential staff to diffuse public anger . But such actions were only seen as clinging to power amid the spiraling scandal . A day before the second rally on Nov. 5 , Park made a second apology , saying she would accept prosecutorial questioning and an independent counsel investigating her . Its stance was that a new , neutral Cabinet should be formed and Park should relinquish some of her presidential power to it . The second protest on Nov. 5 saw a nearly ten-fold increase in participants . Startled by the massive outpouring of public fury , opposition parties leaned towards removing Park from office . It was also the first time that protestors were allowed to get as close as 200 meters to the presidential palace of Cheong Wa Dae . The ruling Saenuri Party started to falter , with the pro-Park leadership and defiant rebels clashing over what to do with the embattled leader . Despite the large-scale rally , Park was still seen fighting back resignation calls , appointing a new culture minister and ordering the prosecution to thoroughly investigate a lobbying scandal involving a real estate development project in the southern city of Busan . Then came the fourth weekend rally on Nov. 19 , which attracted 960,000 people at 60 locations across the nation . A day after the rally , public prosecutors investigating the scandal named the president a suspect in the influence-peddling scandal and accomplice to Choi Soon-sil and her presidential aides on charges of extorting donations from local conglomerates . Then the rally on Nov. 26 set a new record -- 1.9 million participants across the country . Stung by the undying public censure , pro-Park loyalists within the ruling Saenuri Party came up with a plan in which the president steps down in April , allowing the next presidential election to be held in June . The impeachment vote was delayed , as Saenuri lawmakers who had earlier supported the opposition-led motion changed their mind . It was again the people who showed up in even bigger numbers to lash out at both Park for refusing to resign and the lawmakers for so far failing to remove her from office . The rally forced the grey-zone lawmakers within the ruling Saenuri Party to switch sides again and rejoin forces to oust Park .
