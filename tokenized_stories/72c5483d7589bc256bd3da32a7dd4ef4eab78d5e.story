shocking the NFL , ESPN , and 70,000 person stadium . provided to Public Herald One of those rappelling was John Nicholson , a Pennsylvania activist , and Team member of Public Herald who took part in the recent 30-month fracking investigation that made public for the first time 2,309 investigation records from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection . I caught up with John shortly after his release from jail to find out more about the protest and what he thought it means for fracking in Pennsylvania . The full 30 minute interview with John Nicholson is also available on the Public Herald SoundCloud account . To republish from newsCOUP please review the Permission page . Oh , it was a great view . Luckily the Panthers won , I was happy about that . As they stand now , those files are incredibly inaccessible to the general public . John Nicholson scanning complaint records and fracking permits at the Department of Environmental Protection with Public Herald . Oh , absolutely . So , everything from that side , the personal relationship side with the state , as well as how permits are issued , what are inside those permits , what is addressed , and what is overlooked . The banner drop that we did on Monday is related to a liquid natural gas -LRB- LNG -RRB- export facility that is currently under construction in southern Maryland , in Lusby . The facility lies in Calvert County , and in the most populated area of the county . I was at the game and I was on the rappel line for over 45 minutes before I lowered myself down and was then abrubtly and swiftly detained by both private security ushers and Mecklenburg County Charlotte police . As I stated before this is a huge project . To switch it from import to export is unprecedented and takes an enormous amount of infrastructure . And Bank of America is the largest recorded backer of this project . The project itself is completely over budget , and not on time . Dominion has a very checkered track-record in the way of safety and as well as emissions . And so , this was at the Cove Point facility and that was before construction started . That was emissions of ammonia before it had started to become an export facility . Bank of America knows all this . How they operate is they do all kind of financial risk assessments before ever even thinking about putting money and investment into a project this large . We know from the air emissions alone that if this facility is completed and is operating at best conditions that there will be a spike in childhood leukemia , asthma , and birth defects . If the facility is completed and again operating under best conditions it would emit annually 22.5 tons of toxins into the air . I think the media response has been great and a lot people have been checking out the website and wanting to know more about the issue . With this permit , or with any other permit under FERC . Thousands of lives literally will be in the balance if this facility is completed . To give you some numbers on the risks , the Department of Energy usually recommends for a LNG facility to have a 2.2 mile evacuation zone , and 2.2 miles from Cove Point would include 8,000 people . And , there has been resistance the entire time that this permit has gone through the FERC process and under construction . There have been protests at public meetings , there have been people that have locked themselves down to construction equipment , even a crane at one time . There have been all sorts of marches through the county and through the town of Lusby . I felt like this action was need to further visibility . I feel like members of the Lusby community and people in southern Maryland and around the country who have been concerned about this have been talking about it for a very long time , and nothing has come of it . And I felt like an escalation in the tactics were necessary . Escalating how we get messages to people utilizing the internet was really needed in this case . For me , getting that message out really outweighed any personal discomfort or financial loss for participating in something like this and then being arrested . I think for a lot of reasons , categorizing fracking as a done deal within the state boundaries of Pennsylvania is really false . The type of mentality that is continually pushed through PR and all the different arms of these companies to small communities is very calculated . I see this over and over again , and I see so many correlations with how Dominion interacts with the residents of Lusby . I think these companies are very calculated in where they choose to do and to not do business . WeAreCovePoint obtained documents that clearly state multiple individuals from the Calvert County police department are on special payroll with Dominion Energy . I have witnessed this . I went to visit someone for interviews in Calvert County and was pulled over and the officer who pulled me over had a lanyard that said his name and Dominion Energy on it . I think the most important thing to take away is that if this facility is built there will almost positively be more fracking in Pennsylvania . Being from Pennsylvania and understanding the dynamics of fracking and all that comes with that I feel very strongly in opposition to this export facility being built . And inevitably that will happen more at a faster rate if this export facility is built . As soon as first responders started to touch that system and try to literally pull me back up is when I was most unsafe . And that , if landowners want to see any money from their lease they would need to get behind the export facilities and pipeline production on deck for places like Cove Point and the commonwealth . My charges are all misdemeanors . The first one is trespass in the second degree ; failure to obey a public officer or law enforcement , also misdemeanor ; the third charge is dropping or throwing an object at a sporting event which I think is specifically a North Carolina law ; and the last one they tacked on before I left the jail is labelled as a city violation but in the description it specifically speaks to me rappelling and displaying a banner . I think the easiest and most important is for people to educate themselves . The lack of education highlights a huge problem in our country where large corporations are operating without the control or even check-in with the people . webpage . On there is a history of the project . If people want to go further than that they can always donate to the cause . Third , and lastly , I think people can plugin , contact us . This is egregious . You want to come into a community and put that entire community at risk for an indefinite amount of time is unacceptable . If you wish to donate part of your footage or business space to a newsCOUP installation please contact us with your information . It gives me an opportunity to briefly explain the often overlooked way that the business of supplying power to people is interwoven in complex ways . The project was begun in the 1960s and is still only half finished . As it stands , it reliably provides my current home state with about 14 billion kilowatt hours of electricity each year without producing any greenhouse gases or other types of air pollution . Those additional kilowatt hours are produced by a combination of plants that burn coal or natural gas and produce substantial quantities of greenhouse gases , fly ash , SOx , NOx , and mercury . The company began efforts to complete the facility about ten years ago , but it has been a slow process . Part of the slowdown has been due to organized resistance from people who claim to be afraid of the new unit even though the existing facility has an admirable record of being a good -LRB- locally popular -RRB- neighbor , paying good salaries , providing reliable power , participating in the local community , paying large tax bills , keeping both workers and the public safe and healthy and even providing a warm place to water ski in the cooler months of the year . I suspect that at least some of the resistance is also coming from the people involved in the business of supplying the coal and natural gas to the plants that would be made redundant if the clean energy facility is completed . There are big numbers involved ; the amount of fuel burned in the plants that could be displaced produces several hundreds of millions of dollars per year in revenue . The permitting and construction process for the expansion of the existing clean energy facility has also been slowed because Dominion accountants , planners and decision makers convinced themselves that their stockholders would see more immediate profit from fracking , building pipelines , and converting the Cove Point facility into an export terminal than completing a facility that would supply a couple million of my fellow Virginians with 60-80 years worth of clean electricity . The financials associated with the projects needed to make that export facility work look good because it enables irreplaceable American natural gas to be sold at higher prices under 20-year contracts with European customers than can be obtained in our temporarily oversupplied market at home . There is no an infinite supply of capital or human resources ; companies have to make choices about how to best deploy their limited assets . It is also difficult to capture attention and find fellow activists who want to help push a company towards building a needed facility instead of organizing them to stop building something . I hope this comment is a step towards making contact with passionate people like you and John to explain how we can help each other and make the world a cleaner , safer , and more equally prosperous place .
