It was one year ago today that the Oceti Sakowin camp , one of the main staging areas for the protest movement in Morton County , was shut down . Last year , the field was still the home of nearly 100 protesters awaiting the arrival law enforcement for one last confrontation . Fire and ice sounds like something out of a fairy tale , but in southern Morton County it was a reality . It was the conclusion of the historic seven month saga we know as the Dakota Access Pipeline protests . Despite all of the outside noise , those at the heart of the movement are adamant that their motivation was consistent . Protecting water rights of indigenous people . Evidence shows however law enforcements worst fears were never fully realized . While the North Dakota chapter of history ended on February 23rd , some hope it 's not the end of the story . After the camp was clean and cleared , law enforcement closed the gates with barbed wire and put up no trespassing signs . And if you were n't here to see it happen , you may never know that this was anything other than a field for grazing .
