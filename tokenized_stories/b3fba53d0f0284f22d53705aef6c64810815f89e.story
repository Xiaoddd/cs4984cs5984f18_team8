However , these defenders are often met with abuse and extreme violence ; it is imperative that they are granted the legal recognition , security and protection of the state they deserve . Just days before the current climate negotiations a group of indigenous leaders from the Amazon rainforest demanded recognition for the key role their communities play in conserving the iconic forest . However , the intimidation of people defending land , waterways and forests from extractive industries is increasing . This year alone the violent attacks against peaceful protestors have been shocking . There was the tragic loss of life of environmental activists protesting a coal plant in Bangladesh . Both were protecting indigenous peoples from the onslaught of big industry including hydro-electricity projects and large scale logging . Almost half of human rights defenders killed in 2015 were environmental , land and indigenous rights activists . This is unacceptable . The threats the climate and the human rights and social justice movements face are linked at their roots , and we can not fight for climate justice without fundamental human rights protections for those most impacted . The devastating effects will touch everyone , from ravaging communities due to extreme weather events , increasing the risk of health epidemics and aggravating food shortages . The threats the climate and the human rights and social justice movements face are linked at their roots , and we can not fight for climate justice without fundamental human rights protections for those most impacted . With thousands of fossil fuel projects proposed all over the world -LRB- even with the recent decline of coal , there are 2,400 coal-fired power plants currently under construction or being planned -RRB- , more needs to be done . Governments need to recognise the important and incredibly high risk work that environmental defenders do , by offering recognition and legal protection to them . There is also a need for clear safeguards in the climate financing mechanisms for environment defenders as they go about their work defending the planet and livelihoods of the marginalized and those people living in poverty . The fossil fuel industry is , after all , one of the most profitable industries ever , and no stranger to fights with movements . Thankfully , the people fighting the extractive industries are increasingly united , and intimidation will not make these movements go away . We will defend the defenders by carrying on , building on their work and standing in solidarity honouring their accomplishments . Intimidation will not stop the movement . More than ever we need to hold our governments and the fossil fuel industry accountable for the harm they continue to cause . Our demand to world leaders meeting in Marrakech is this : stop new fossil fuel projects from being built .
