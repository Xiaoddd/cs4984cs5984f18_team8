BuzzFeed News spoke to him about what he witnessed during the camp 's closure on Feb. 23 . Since August . I 'm from Los Angeles originally . He made a call for me to come out and document what was going on in his territory . What happened is that the people who remained in camp through the winter were given an eviction notice to remove themselves . Through my photos , I was able to document the forced removal of the Oceti Sakowin Camp , which I believe was the end of a chapter . I will continue on here for another week and then go back to my family and rest and get ready for whatever is next . I know the opposition to DAPL is not over and people wo n't stop until the project is dead . They held their ground in a peaceful way , rooted in prayer . Even though the people were forcefully removed from unceded treaty land and they are out of the camp , it 's like a turn of a page . A Dine -LRB- Navajo -RRB- water protector asked his elders back home what they should do about the traditional structures that they built in camp . The elder said that because of the previous behavior by law enforcement disposing of tips and ceremonial items in a disrespectful way in October , the structures should be burned in a ceremony to protect them from disrespect . In order to document them , I first had to have a clear intention on why I wanted to be part of them . A lot of the ceremonies and traditions were illegal until 1978 , and because of the the American Indian Freedom of Religion Act , we are able to practice them today . For people at the camp , these ceremonies and songs were the last things they had , so I honored that and made sure my approach was gentle and respectful . At Standing Rock , I became a majority , and that is something I never experienced before . As a journalist , I was able to educate other journalists about the power in these prayer camps . It makes you feel more confident in your right to be indigenous and in your ability to be a journalist . There was a core group of us as indigenous filmmakers and journalists that were here throughout . A lot of times when you go to indigenous communities there are a lot of non-native reporters trying to tell the story of those people . In this movement , you saw native people doing simple things , such as grabbing their phones and starting a livestream ; you saw native people taking charge of their narrative ; and from that , larger media outlets would contact us for our footage because they never sent their correspondents in the first place . We need more indigenous journalists to document their communities so that we get culturally accurate portrayals of who we really are and not what people think we should be . What I saw at Standing Rock , non-native journalists and filmmakers were really intrigued by the culture , they saw the Native Americans , the tipis , the feathers , the horses , but they were lacking the understanding of who Native Americans are in modern history . They were anthropologists in a way , and it 's not fully their fault , it 's just the lack of education in the history of our communities . I would encourage people to document their own communities ; it makes you more connected to the story . It 's a little more accurate and more honorable . I would tell the world that what happened at Standing Rock really is the epicenter of the modern civil rights movement . Before there were protests against Donald Trump , there were prayers here . People got inspired by Standing Rock to eventually continue to stand up to other issues , as all these issues are connected . And it came from a prayer . The second thing is the importance of having proper , consistent coverage from indigenous people on the ground . Before we are journalists , we are human beings . And I think that indigenous journalists understand the importance of approaching the story with intimacy and not just getting the story that is on the surface . We understand how to report from an ethical place , not an extractive place . The more time I spend here on the ground , the more I understand how my work will preserve the story of Standing Rock for future generations . Submit it here .
