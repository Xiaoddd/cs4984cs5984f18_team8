North Dakota Department of Health , provided Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save BELFIELD -- A federal agency has ordered Belle Fourche Pipeline to improve leak detection , remediate any pipeline in unstable land areas and take other steps to protect the environment following an oil spill that contaminated a Little Missouri River tributary . The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued a corrective action order to Belle Fourche , part of True Cos. of Wyoming , stemming from its investigation into the spill discovered Dec. 5 by a landowner northwest of Belfield . The agency identified a 58-mile segment of the oil pipeline that traverses similar topography and ordered the company to conduct a risk assessment . The company also must evaluate other segments that were installed using the same method . More than 1,900 barrels , or 79,800 gallons , of oil has been recovered with cleanup efforts still ongoing , said Wendy Owen , spokeswoman for True Cos. . Crews are skimming oil off the creek and doing some controlled burns , said Bill Suess , spill investigation program manager for the North Dakota Department of Health . The spill was not detected by monitoring equipment on the pipeline . The corrective order requires Belle Fourche to install leak detection equipment within six months , with a high priority placed on areas associated with the Little Missouri River and other water crossings more than 100 feet wide . A 19-mile segment of the pipeline has been isolated and shut down . The corrective action order requires Belle Fourche to take several additional steps prior to restarting the pipeline : Conduct daily aerial patrols of the affected segment of pipeline for the next 14 days , including the use of an infrared camera to locate any areas of potential oil leaks . Complete testing and analysis of the failed section of pipe within 90 days and submit a root cause failure analysis within 120 days . Conduct an in-line inspection of the pipeline with a tool capable to detecting stress caused by ground movement . She noted that some of the measures in the order were already being addressed by the company . A PHMSA inspector is expected to be on-site for the excavation . The Laborers District Council of Minnesota and North Dakota has urged regulators to provide strong oversight of True Cos. , citing a track record of spills and environmental incidents . The North Dakota Oil and Gas Division , the North Dakota Department of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency also are investigating the incident . This can be removed when origin is fixed .
