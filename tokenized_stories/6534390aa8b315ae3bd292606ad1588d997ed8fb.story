Friends of Science Calgary The Sun is the main driver of climate change . Not you . Not carbon dioxide . Indeed , over the past seven years , more than 20,000 miles of oil pipelines have been approved and built in the United States , almost none of them requiring more than 18 months of review . Instead , the decision in this case became hopelessly politicized because the United States environmental lobby decided to make it a symbol of their ideological opposition to greenhouse gas emissions . They think they have won the game . I have news for them . They have been watching the wrong ball . Canadian crude oil exports to the United States have been growing steadily since 1990 . In 1994 , the exports were about 40 million barrels per year and they grew to 110 million barrels per year in 2015 . Well , it was primarily because U.S. refiners wanted it and were prepared to pay for it . There are 70 pipelines across the Canada-U.S. border . Keystone XL would be better and cheaper , but its denial will only raise costs , it will not block movement . The fact is that the Gulf refineries were built to process exactly the kind of heavy crude oil that is available from Canada . Most of the growth in U.S. production is light crude oil . So , the Canadian crude is displacing heavy oil from Venezuela . The U.S. State Department Environmental Impact Statement devoted pages and pages to analyzing this subject and waffled in its observations . This can be demonstrated in percentage terms . If you multiply those figures -LRB- i.e. . In other words , it is one five thousandth of annual global emissions . That is much less than the rounding errors used for statistical analysis . So , in the worst case , the emissions that would be avoided by rejecting the Keystone XL project can hardly be measured . They are delighted that the international price of crude oil has declined sharply over the past year , because that will offer less incentive for investment in new oil supplies , especially in higher cost sources like oil sands . They believe that their efforts will be successful in reducing oil and gas development and infrastructure construction . Lower oil prices just mean increased demand for the fuel . With lower oil prices , the demand increases may be even faster . Crude oil pipelines under construction now that will be completed in future years total 3,885 miles in the United States and 2,968 miles in Canada out of a global total of 10,626 miles .
