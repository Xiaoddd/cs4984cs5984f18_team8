Fonda was with child and wore a yellow floral maternity pant outfit . She came over to my friend Corrine and I. I was wearing an all Jean two piece suit . She said it was my clothes and long hair that brought her to sit with me . Fonda spoke about Viet Bam at the rally . Suzanne 2 years ago I applaud people who are providing help , big and small . The oyate will be there during the harsh winter . If I knew a way to send stuff , and who to send it to , I have some things to send also . Peace to everyone . Blessings to all , including Ms. Fonda and her assistants . They are heading back to Standing Rock today . I am sure the bison being donated came from his private herds . Raymond Hurst 2 years ago I like Jane . She apologized for some Vietnam comments she made when she was younger . I forgave her because that is what you are supposed to do . This Army Veteran supports her . And I support the right of Indians to control their own land-finally . -LRB- all due respect . Good one . They collect donations and deliver them to the site . They are especially focused on providing supplies for the upcoming harsh winter there . They have a GoFundMe account to help defray the cost of travel from California to North Dakota and a list of supplies the camp needs most . Those four yurts are just the kind of thing the protestors need to withstand a harsh winter . Sonny Skyhawk 2 years ago Thank you to all those featured in this article , and in answer to the comment about butchering , how do you think our people survived for thousands of years . The difference is when people eat a steak , they rarely thank the steer for having sacrificed its life for the sustenance . As Native people , it is essential to our existence , to give thanks , both in song and prayer , to their sacrifice of spirit and life . Jane Fonda , Shaileen Woodley , Marc Ruffalo , Leo DiCaprio , and countless other celebrities have come to stand in solidarity with all those at the STANDING ROCK encampment at SACRED STONE . The stand is about protecting the water source of human beings . May the Creator bless everyone . I was wrong . Crystalsword 2 years ago It is a wonderful thing when artists understand the role they play within the status quo . How with their silence they legitimise every crime and how , when they stand up like this , they legitimise Life . I believe her ex-husband Ted Turner has a herd that he recently gave to a tribe along with maybe 10,000 acres . I find her doing this very touching . smith 2 years ago I understand your feelings I do . I wish the planet was not built on the ecosystem that it is But it is . To trophy hunt is not necessary . There will be feast we where told . Told to stay away if that is what people are planning . Kat 2 years ago I meant to write NO feast , sorry .
