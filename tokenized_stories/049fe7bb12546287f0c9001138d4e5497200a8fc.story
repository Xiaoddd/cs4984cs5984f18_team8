United Methodist Women members know this history from our mission study , Giving Our Hearts Away : Native American Survival -LRB- 2008-2009 -RRB- . Today , United Methodist Women is responding to that call by providing concrete solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota -LRB- members of the Dakota and Lakota nations -RRB- who are defending their lands against an oil pipeline . What is often cited as long ago history of oppression of Native peoples is very current in this struggle . United Methodist Native American sisters and brothers have urged us to join them in this struggle for sovereignty , racial justice , climate justice and protection of land and water for all . During the Thanksgiving weekend , United Methodist Women General Secretary and CEO Harriett Jane Olson joined Oklahoma Indian Missionary Conference and other United Methodist leaders at the 3000-strong encampment blocking the final link of a pipeline that will run from the Dakotas to oil refineries in the Gulf . The struggle links many key concerns of United Methodist Women , including climate justice , criminalization of communities of color , racial justice and Native American sovereignty . The push for oil speaks to our dependency on fossil fuels that continues to heat the planet even as it threatens our water . The decision to route the pipeline on Native territory echoes many cases of environmental racism that many indigenous communities around the world face . The current repression of peaceful protests speaks to systematic and militarized state violence against Native peoples and communities of color , where Native people are killed at a higher rate by police than any other group in the United States . The Sioux are protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- . The 1,170 mile pipeline , being built by Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners , would carry 470,000 barrels of crude oil per day through both Dakotas , Iowa and Illinois . It is almost completed except for the segment at Standing Rock , which would run under Lake Oahe . This is currently on federal land managed by the Army Corps of Engineers , but in fact , is on land granted to the Sioux through federal treaties . The Sioux have protested for months in a growing encampment that has swelled with the solidarity of Native peoples from across the U.S. and the Americas , serving as water protectors . In September the Obama Administration postponed the final approval of a permit . While easement has yet to be granted , construction has continued . Seventeen people were reportedly hospitalized , including some suffering from hypothermia . Some have been attacked by security dogs in scenes reminiscent of Mississippi during the civil rights movement . Over 400 have been arrested since the peaceful protest began . United States history is replete with documented mistreatment and deception in the government 's dealings with native people . Let 's not allow this issue to become another incident in that long history . She serves on the 2016-2020 Program Advisory Group and served as a director from 2012-2016 . Her Omaha heritage led her to be a member of the inaugural United Methodist Women Act of Repentance Working Group . The situation became urgent on November 25 , 2016 , when Colonel John Henderson of the Army Corps of Engineers directed a letter to Sioux leaders demanding that Oceti Sakowin , one of the camps North of the Cannonball river , be vacated by December 5 or face trespassing citations . Two days later , the agency stated they had no plans for forceful removal , while still noting that any who remained could be subject to citations . At the same time , the state will not provide emergency services as snow sets in . United Methodists have been active in supporting the Sioux , including several trips led by Oklahoma Indian Missionary Conference -LRB- OIMC -RRB- pastor David Wilson , visits by the General Secretaries of the General Commission on Religion and Race -LRB- GCORR -RRB- and United Methodist Women , a visit and statement by Dakotas-Minnesota Area Bishop Bruce R. Ough , who serves as the President of the Council of Bishops , a letter by Western Jurisdiction Bishops to President Obama , and a letter to Energy Transfer Partners by Wespath , The United Methodist Church pension fund .
