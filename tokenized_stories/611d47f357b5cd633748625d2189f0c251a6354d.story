As far as I know , Seattle is the first city to have divested from Wells Fargo . The example that we have set today can be a beacon of hope to activists all around the country , looking to change the economic calculus of corporations who think that investing in the Dakota Access Pipeline will be good for their bottom line . I want to acknowledge the victories that have already been achieved . The real power of this ordinance is that it can be used as a tool by movements to put real financial pressure on Big Business by first putting pressure on politicians . And what an honor it is to have been part of this inspiring movement . We had a little snow in Seattle yesterday , but that is nothing compared to the images of the courageous people in Standing Rock who battled blizzards to hold the line against the oil lobby and against banks . That is truly inspiring . Some of you have personally traveled to Standing Rock to join the protests . Others have demonstrated in solidarity here , through our NoDAPL Seattle movement , and together we are building the power of regular people to fight to take our world back from Trump , the billionaires , and the oil lobby . I want to thank all of you . But I still wanted to name a few names . But special thanks to Matt Remle , Millie Kennedy , Alec Connon , Rebecca Deutsch , Rachel Heaton , Ray Kingfisher , Paul Wagner and Jesse Ross , all activists and leaders from the Indigenous community . My fellow activist , Nikkita Oliver , who has made this important recognition that the struggles of all oppressed peoples are united . Thanks also to my staff member , Ted Virdone , who many of you know , and Rachel gave a gift for him , too , which I have accepted on his behalf , and which I will be conveying to him soon . This further shows that the rights of workers as a whole , and the survival of the labor movement , is so tied to the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline , the fight for black and brown rights , and the fight against climate change . Thanks to everyone who has sacrificed , sweated , and bled to build this movement . And I want to thank the Indigenous community as a whole for showing so clearly to all of us that our fight for our planet is paramount . That is , in my view , completely irrational . And nowhere is that more starkly visible then with the big banks and oil companies . In any rational world , the trillions that are in the hands of multinational oil companies would not be used to lobby for wars in Iraq and pipelines poisoning our water and climate . If we had any democracy over our economy , those trillions would be used to transform the energy infrastructure into renewables and to create decent living standards for all human beings . But , sisters and brothers , it is not a rational world under capitalism . So our fight today is very much linked to our larger fight against Big Business , against Wall Street , against Trump and the Billionaire Class , and against capitalism itself . When we build movements to challenge the status quo , and when these movements are powerful enough that they force corporate politicians to take a stand in favor of the movement when it is not their instinct , that is radical . Fighting against the status quo is radical .
