JBE : La. . We lived in it for over 40 years , and though the Vermilion River swelled nearby during heavy rains , I never felt threatened . But times have changed , and after the August floods of 2016 the new owners splashed Facebook with pictures from our flooded living room . If we continue to build pipelines like the Bayou Bridge Pipeline , we risk more floods . The most obvious connection between the Bayou Bridge Pipeline and flooding is that the proposed route is through 600 acres of wetlands . Hurricanes Rita and Katrina painfully taught us the value of wetland protection . We should be building up our wetlands , not building on them . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration further explained the connection between our use of oil and flooding . In a study after the flood , the agency concluded that the warming in our atmosphere made the floods 40 percent more likely . Burning fossil fuels , like oil , warms the atmosphere . When the air is warm , it holds more moisture which causes more rain . The Bayou Bridge Pipeline propels us down a road that no one wants to be on : toward more warming , more destruction of our wetlands , more flooding and more pollution . The National Response Center , the federal point of contact for oil spills , received reports of 144 pipeline accidents in Louisiana in 2016 . And those are just the ones that were reported . Cypremort Point , Grand Chenier and the Chandeleur Islands were some of the locations of the spills . This is what happens to our favorite fishing spots . The oil industry minimizes these spills , but supposedly small spills over 65 years have an impact . Oil industry spokespeople claim that the Bayou Bridge Pipeline is the safest way to transport oil , but 144 accidents in a single year speaks for itself . People in Louisiana realize these risks . While Louisiana continues to pursue oil and gas , one of the fastest growing job sectors in the United States is renewable energy . We are laggards missing out on a growing industry as the same old thinking and the greed of a few keeps us locked into oil . The jobs in the renewable energy sector are good , safe jobs that do not require weeks away on a rig . Those who insist on projects like the Bayou Bridge Pipeline are like a man at a poker table who , caught in the adrenaline of the game , bets his home on the next round . But building on wetlands and continuing to burn oil is a bad bet . Reject the Bayou Bridge pipeline and pursue renewable energy .
