Both of these entities have the ears of congress domestically and global decision makers at gatherings such as the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland -LRB- Gwertzman , 2014 ; Wade and Rascoe , 2014 -RRB- . Stepping up hydrocarbon and extraction technologies is not universally espoused : This is not an immediate-term solution . This rhetoric is now the focus not just of Washington , DC think tanks but academics -LRB- Bordoff , 2014 -RRB- . The EIA estimates Russia and China sit atop an estimated 107 billion barrels of shale oil and 1,400 TCF of shale gas . This proposal will stretch across heretofore relatively undisturbed and isolated communities and the ecosystems they have evolved with across the Eurasian Steppe and Siberia -LRB- Einhorn , 2014 -RRB- . Figure 1b -RRB- Global CO2 Per Capita Emissions -LRB- Tons -RRB- Vs Oil Consumption Per Day -LRB- Barrels -RRB- across 204 countries The fomenting anger and geopolitical combativeness that result from these conditions put the global hydrocarbon transport network at risk . It was at this time that the economy collapsed due to its singular reliance on one input source . Thus , many private and state actors are proposing new and expanded hydrocarbon pipeline networks to reduce reliance on single-large networks emanating from or traveling through volatile regions . Proposals range from the large Nabucco pipeline proposal connecting Asia and Europe or the Nord Stream AG Baltic Sea Gas Pipeline to small regional or inter-state proposals in Africa , the Persian Gulf , and Eastern Europe . With this map , which was initiated in January 2014 , we have attempted to accurately quantify as many existing and proposed pipeline routes as possible in Europe , Africa , South America , Asia , and the Persian Gulf . This conversation will be accompanied by additional pipeline proposals for inter - and intra-region transport , all of which we will incorporate into this map on a quarterly basis . If you know of proposals that are not currently shown on the map , please let us know . Table 1 . Major Worldwide Flows of Oil -LRB- Thousand Barrels Per Day -RRB- . References Bordoff , J. , 2014 .

In the south it may have to devise a wider concept of its interests stretching out to the Sahel , the Horn of Africa and the Middle East .
