Five activists shackled themselves to TD Bank in Amherst , Mass. , and prevented customers from gaining entrance . Their actions are part of a coordinated effort to stigmatize banks financing the pipeline . The Army Corps of Engineers rejected Dec. 4 the previously approved easement necessary to complete the pipeline . A bureaucrat appointed by President Barack Obama was responsible for signing off on the rejection notice . Anti-DAPL activists are not satisfied . They are also targeting TD Bank for investing in the equally controversial Keystone XL Pipeline . Many of the same environmentalist groups opposing the DAPL pipeline helped scuttle Keystone .
