Passionate , Informed , Driven , Progressive . These historical protests regarding the right to water , are not receiving adequate news coverage , especially in light of an impending order from the governor to remove protesters from the camp . The recent announcement of the clearing of protesters came a day after Thanksgiving , a holiday related to the oppression of native communities in America . The truth behind thanksgiving is that in 1637 , over 700 men , women , and children were massacred by the English and Dutch colonists . This important part of history not widely accepted in America , the holiday is centered around the false narrative of victory and celebration . Americans enjoy their freedoms , including their free-flowing water -- often taken for granted due to easy access . Meanwhile , Native Americans are being beaten , gassed and shot in North Dakota . The violent crackdowns by law enforcement and private contractors are a violation of human rights . Violence against peaceful protests is usually condemned by the U.S. government when it is taking place in a foreign nation . These violations have prompted a United Nations investigation into the violence that has been taking place at Standing Rock . The Obama administration has failed to protect peaceful protesters , sacred native lands , and more importantly has failed to protect vital water sources . With recent advances in clean energy and the huge drop in oil prices , large costly pipelines are unnecessary . They pose a huge risk to the environment , outweighing any monetary gains the big oil companies may see from these pipelines . With recent advancements in wind , solar , hydro , and other types of clean energy , and the recent losses of the oil and gas industry , the U.S. should shift its focus away from oil and gas production . With three this month alone , and more than 3,032 since 2006 . Often times these cleanup efforts are ineffective and have lasting damage to ecosystems , habitats , wildlife , drinking water , which endanger the American people . On average after all the cleanup efforts which only partially does the job , roughly 31,000 barrels of oil are not able to be cleaned up per year . A recent report states that two law enforcement officials have turned in their badges , in regards to the tactics and violence being used against peaceful protesters . The tactics being used are unprecedented against peaceful protests in the United States , with over 300 people injured and reportedly 26 people being hospitalized . Meanwhile , there are over 1,000 U.S. veterans mobilizing to continue their duty to protect the American people , as they will deploy to Standing Rock on Dec 4th . The Obama administration has failed to protect peaceful protesters , sacred native lands , and more importantly has failed to protect vital water sources . Over his two terms , President Obama has spoken on protecting native land ; made campaign promises to change the U.S.-native relations , and declared November as Native American Heritage month , such actions mean very little in due to his inaction on this issue . Obama needs to take action to de-escalate the situation at Standing Rock , and uphold the rights of the protesters . In light of the recent election , it is being reported Donald Trump owns a stake in the parent company building the pipeline . Trump faces a number of conflict of interests this being no different , recently the CEO of Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners Kelcy Warren , was quoted telling the Associated Press it is an expectation that Trump will make it easier for such projects to be completed . The pipeline would almost certainly be completed under a Trump Administration . He has stated publicly that global warming is a ploy by the Chinese , and has expressed support for the oil and gas industry . A previous plan for the pipeline had the route crossing the Missouri river , the neighbourhoods of Bismark North Dakota spoke out about the damage a leak could cause to their water supply . This pipeline endangers the main water source for many , with water being a necessity for life , there has been speculation of a possible reroute . A recent report published states that if the January 1st deadline for completion is not met this could place the entire pipeline in Limbo , as contracts will have to be renegotiated between contractors and investors . Obama needs to take action to de-escalate the situation at Standing Rock , and uphold the rights of the protesters .
