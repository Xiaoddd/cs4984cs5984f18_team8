A disturbing video out of Standing Rock shows a female water protector being rushed by a BIA officer and repeatedly hit with his baton . The woman was unarmed and walking away from the officer when he attacked . Will Barton uploaded the video to his Facebook page shortly after the attack occurred . The attack was said to have occurred along the road going into Sacred Stone Camp . Since being uploaded just an hour before this article was released , the video has already received over 25,000 views . The video starts with two water protectors walking down the dirt road with two BIA officers walking up behind them . The officer closest to the two water protectors clearly has his baton out and is walking towards the two in a very aggressive manner . The female water protector appears to be questioning why the agents are coming up behind them when she gets rushed . Barton turns to get away , and we lose sight for a moment , but he turns around in time for us to clearly see the officer with the baton swing on the unarmed water protectors three times . The officer makes two hits to the leg area , then as the camera pulls away again , we can see the officer doing an overhead blow to the woman after she had been hit in the legs . You can hear the female screaming as the officer demands for the wounded female to put her hands behind her back . As she lays on the ground , both officers stand over her before throwing her on her stomach . Three people were said to be arrested during the incident . Bookmark the permalink . 1 Comment .
