The easement was granted Wednesday after the Army Corps told a federal court and members of Congress that it intended to do so , and that it would bypass the customary 14-day waiting period to move quickly on the project . The decision came just days after President Trump signed an executive order to continue construction of the pipeline , despite months of tense protests in North Dakota , where the pipeline remains unfinished . Thousands of protesters , including members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , have camped at Standing Rock to stop the building of the 30-inch underground pipeline , which will carry light crude oil . Their main dispute involves a portion that is to be placed under Lake Oahe . When the Army announced it would not grant an easement in December , then-Assistant Army Secretary for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy said the decision was based on a need to look for alternative routes . But in a court filing Tuesday , the US Army Corps of Engineers signaled it was ready to reverse course and get construction of the pipe underway . In a letter to members of Congress delivered Tuesday , the Department of the Army said it was waiving its usual 14-day waiting period from its notice of Congress before issuing the easement . The Army 's decision to grant the easement was expected after Trump issued an executive order to continue with construction of the Dakota Access and Keystone pipelines in January . After the executive order was signed , opponents of the pipeline appeared ready for another confrontation . Opponents of the pipeline , however , argue an environmental study of the possible impacts of the pipeline is needed before any construction is begun , which is expected to include a section spanning 1.25 miles under the Missouri River . Amnesty International also criticized the decision to not seek out an environmental study before issuing the easement . Amnesty plans to send human rights observers to the construction site in anticipation of additional protests there . Jan Hasselman , attorney for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , suggested it would continue work to stop the pipeline through the courts . The Standing Rock Tribe is expected to challenge the decision on the grounds that the environmental study was wrongfully terminated , it said . Energy Transfer Partners said it expects the Dakota Access pipeline to be in service by summer of this year . Submit it here .
