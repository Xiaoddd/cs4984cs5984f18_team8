Redway and Simon were sentenced to four and 12 days in jail , respectively , as the first defendants convicted from the protests to serve incarceration for convictions . They appealed , claiming insufficient evidence to sustain their convictions , as well as First Amendment-protected activity . The high court disagreed . Attorney Sam Saylor , who represented Redway and Simon at oral arguments in April , said he was disappointed by the opinion , and worries other attorneys may now cite it . Saylor said he 's also concerned by the circumstances of his clients ' convictions when they were not prohibited by a landowner from marching in the pasture on private land . As of Aug. 23 , 15 of the 831 state-level criminal cases from the protests were open , according to South Central Judicial District figures . About 700 cases have been adjudicated two years after arrests began in August 2016 in the monthslong protests . About 90 arrest warrants remain inactive . Redway 's and Simon 's joint appeal was the second protest case to be heard before the North Dakota Supreme Court , which also upheld a previous defendant 's conviction . Five other appeals related to the protests are pending before the court .
