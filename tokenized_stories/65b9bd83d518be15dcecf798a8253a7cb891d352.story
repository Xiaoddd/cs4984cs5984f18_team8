Your weather is set to . You can change the location at any time . The Comstock Township Planning Commission voted unanimously late Thursday to deny a special exception use permit for an Enbridge dredge pad located in Comstock Commerce Park . Commissioners said Enbridge did not show the burden of proof it needed to with regard to potential health concerns their activity could cause . The planning commission currently has eight commissioners , but the decision on the Comstock Commerce Park Site was made by a six-member vote because commissioners Dan Balkema and Ron Sportel own property within the site and recused themselves from discussions concerning the location . A public hearing for the Miller Drive dredge site was tabled until next Thursday due to the length of the first hearing . A vote had to be taken before the meeting began to see if commissioners wanted to proceed after Bell 's Brewery made a formal request the meeting be adjourned until a later date because of what it perceived as a conflict of interest in Monday 's zoning board of appeals ruling . Township Attorney Ken Sparks said Bell 's and its attorney , James Marquardt , said the concern was raised because zoning board member Art Austin , who owns the excavating company Art Austin , Inc. , twice sold gravel to the company Precision Pipeline in 2012 and sold gravel to a landscaping company in 2013 that did work for Precision Pipeline . In each instance , Precision Pipeline used the gravel on Enbridge projects . Austin never had a contract with Enbridge , according to Sparks . Sparks said Austin approached him with this information before the ZBA made its decision Monday to rule Enbridge 's activity at both dredge locations was similar to special use activity outlined in the township 's zoning ordinances for the respective locations . Sparks said he reviewed Austin 's information and decided there was no wrongdoing . Both decisions passed narrowly by a 3-2 margin , with Austin voting in favor both times . Marquardt disagreed with Sparks assessment that there was no wrongdoing . Furthermore , Sparks said the ZBA does not have authority to rehear an issue unless there is a township provision that allows for that , which there is n't . Commissioners voted 5-1 to proceed with the meeting , with commissioner Jeff Ampey being the only one to vote in the negative .
