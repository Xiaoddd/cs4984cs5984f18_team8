Dog Soldiers From Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search This article is about Cheyenne warrior society . For other uses , see Dog Soldiers -LRB- disambiguation -RRB- . A modern Dog Soldier headdress at a pow wow . After the deaths of nearly half the Southern Cheyenne in the cholera epidemic of 1849 , many of the remaining Masikota band joined the Dog Soldiers . It effectively became a separate band , occupying territory between the Northern and Southern Cheyenne . Its members often opposed policies of peace chiefs such as Black Kettle . In 1869 , most of the band were killed by United States Army forces in the Battle of Summit Springs . The surviving societies became much smaller and more secretive in their operations . Porcupine Bear , chief of the Dog Soldiers , took up the war pipe of the Cheyenne . He carried it to the various Cheyenne and Arapaho camps to drum up support for revenge against the Kiowa . He reached a Northern Cheyenne camp along the South Platte River just after it had traded for liquor from American Fur Company men at Fort Laramie . Porcupine Bear joined in the drinking . He sat and sang Dog Soldier war songs . Two of his cousins , Little Creek and Around , became caught up in a drunken fight . Little Creek got on top of Around and held up a knife , ready to stab Around ; at that point , Porcupine Bear , aroused by Around 's calls for help , tore the knife away from Little Creek , and stabbed him with it several times . By the rules governing military societies , a man who murdered or accidentally killed another tribe member had blood on his hands and was prohibited from joining a society . The Dog Soldiers were disgraced by Porcupine Bear 's act . The other chiefs forbade them from leading war against the Kiowa . Wolf reformed the Bowstring Society , which had been nearly annihilated in the fight with the Kiowa . Though outlawed by the main body of the Cheyenne , Porcupine Bear led the Dog Soldiers into battle against the Kiowa and Comanche at Wolf Creek . Prominent or ambitious warriors from other bands also gradually joined the Dog Soldier band . Over time the Dog Soldiers took a prominent leadership role in the wars against the whites . The Dog Soldiers contributed to the breakdown of the traditional matrilineal clan system of the Cheyennes . Customarily when a man married , he moved to the camp of his wife 's band . Losses in the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864 further disrupted the traditional Cheyenne kinship system . The Third Colorado Cavalry caused heavy casualties among the Wutapai -LRB- Black Kettle 's band -RRB- ; and killed perhaps half of the Hevhaitaniu under Yellow Wolf and Big Man , and half the Oivimana under War Bonnet . They also killed many among the Hisiometanio -LRB- Ridge Men -RRB- under White Antelope . The Cheyenne began to intermarry with the Lakota in that territory . During the mid-1860s , Dog Soldier leaders , including Tall Bull and White Horse , frequently called on the great warrior Roman Nose , a Crooked Lance society member , to lead Dog Soldier strikes against white civilian and military assets . He led an attack on Fort Wallace in June 1867 . By the 1860s , as conflict between Indigenous people and whites intensified , the militaristic Dog Soldiers increased their influence , together with that of the warrior societies of other Cheyenne bands . Dog Soldiers refused to sign treaties that limited their hunting grounds and restricted them to a reservation south of the Arkansas River . They attempted to hold their traditional lands at Smoky Hill , but the campaigns of General Philip Sheridan foiled these efforts . After the Battle of Beecher 's Island , many Dog Soldiers were forced to retreat south of the Arkansas River . In the spring of 1867 they returned north with the intention of joining Red Cloud and his Oglala band in Powder River . Attacked by General Eugene Carr , the Dog Soldiers began raiding settlements on Smoky Hill River in revenge . Eventually , Chief Tall Bull led them west into Colorado . Hell on Wheels features a band of Cheyenne Dog Soldiers in the first season of the series . They fight back against the railroad men who are attempting to build the first segment of the Union Pacific Railroad through Cheyenne territory .
