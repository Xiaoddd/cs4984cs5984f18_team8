Energy Transfer Partners , the Dallas-based company behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline , now wants to build a pipeline through Louisiana 's ecologically important Atchafalaya Basin . Announcing the decision on Sunday , the Army said alternative routes should be explored . That would mean environmental reviews that could delay construction for months or even years . Hours later , Energy Transfer Partners released a statement that decried the decision and struck a defiant tone : The White House 's directive today to the Corps for further delay is just the latest in a series of overt and transparent political actions by an administration which has abandoned the rule of law in favor of currying favor with a narrow and extreme political constituency . Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way . Indeed , Energy Transfer Partners appears to have a powerful ally in Republican President-elect Donald Trump . Days before the Army announced it was blocking the proposed Dakota Access route , Trump said for the first time that he supports the pipeline 's completion . But last month , a spokesperson for Trump said he sold his shares in the company over the summer . ` Quietly building resistance ' The day after the Army handed down its decision on the Dakota Access Pipeline , it announced a public hearing on water permits for another controversial Energy Transfer Partners project : the Bayou Bridge Pipeline , which would cut through the ecologically important Atchafalaya Basin wetlands in south central Louisiana . The hearing will take place in Baton Rouge on Jan. 12 . Energy Transfer Partners owns Bayou Bridge Pipeline LLC , whose name appears on the project 's Louisiana permit applications . Energy Transfer and Sunoco already built a pipeline carrying crude oil from the Texas coast to Louisiana 's Lake Charles area , and this new leg would extend it to St. James just west of New Orleans . It 's part of Energy Transfer 's pipeline network carrying North Dakota crude to an Illinois tank farm and then on to Gulf Coast refineries and ports . Along the way , the 162-mile-long , 24-inch diameter pipeline would cross eight Louisiana watersheds including the Atchafalaya Basin , where the river of the same name converges with the Gulf of Mexico . It 's an ecologically important area as Louisiana 's only growing delta , and it contains the largest river swamp and largest contiguous bottomland hardwood forest in North America . It 's also home to nine federal - and state-listed endangered or threatened wildlife species and six endangered or threatened bird species . The Atchafalaya Basin already faces threats from Louisiana 's oil and gas industry , among them oil waste pollution and canal dredging that 's causing water quality problems . Those issues would be compounded by pipeline spills and other accidents , which are not rare events . Meanwhile , an ongoing effort to catalog oil and gas industry incidents in Louisiana documented six pipeline accidents in that state alone over a two-week period . While the media spotlight has focused on protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline , opposition to the proposed Bayou Bridge Pipeline has been growing , as The Daily Advertiser reports : Environmental groups , some landowners and concerned citizens are quietly building resistance to the Bayou Bridge Pipeline project , gathering thousands of signatures from as far away as New Zealand and South Africa , forcing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to call for a public hearing where they plan to demand a thorough environmental impact assessment of the project . The Atchafalaya Basinkeeper program , part of the Waterkeeper Alliance , collected almost 75,000 signatures on a petition calling on the Corps to hold public hearings and prepare an environmental impact statement for the project . The environmental advocacy groups Bold Louisiana and Gulf Restoration Network are also petitioning for a thorough environmental assessment and calling on Energy Transfer to consider alternative routes .
