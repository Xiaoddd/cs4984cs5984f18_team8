Oil and Water A network of pipelines threatens Spokane 's drinking water . By Nicholas Deshais click to enlarge Billings Gazette Absorbent pads try to contain the oils in the Yellowstone River . At least 42,000 gallons of crude oil spilled into the Yellowstone River near Billings , Mont. , two weeks ago after an ExxonMobil pipeline burst . The rupture reportedly has the potential to release 7 million gallons into the river , but the company says the spill was an accident and is contained . Yes , say those who keep a close eye on the Spokane River , including the top water officials at both the city and county of Spokane . Three major pipelines run through the area . The Chevron pipeline carries the same hazardous liquids for a shorter distance north of the city , and the Williams pipeline carries natural gas . Beyond those , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Washington State Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council watch over the siting and abandonment of pipelines , and various other local , state and federal agencies regulate land use , environmental and spill prevention measures . Spokane attorney Breean Beggs lived in Bellingham during the pipeline explosion that killed three children and he eventually represented the family of a boy who died because of the spill . However , the city has the responsibility to maintain the integrity of the well .
