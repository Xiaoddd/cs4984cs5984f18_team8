Christians have been protesting for 500 years against the injustices of their own people toward each other . The year 2017 marks 500 years since Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to the Wittenberg door . Something extraordinary is happening at Standing Rock Something extraordinary is happening in Standing Rock , North Dakota . Now , the oppressors will account for their injustice . However , according to the experts , the same people who brought us the financial crisis of 2007 are not going to give up power quite so easily . All that money went somewhere . Well , all I know is that we can not serve both God and money . No one can serve two masters . Either you will hate the one and love the other , or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other . Now is the time to take a stand to protect the water , that gives us life , and to protect the air we breathe , that moment by moment sustains us , from being polluted by the work of our own hands . The oceans , lakes , and rivers are being polluted by our reckless disregard for the animals who call these waters home . The air is warming up , throwing off the delicate balance of the fragile ecosystem . The atmosphere could be considered the inner ear of the earth , analogous to the organ that controls our own sense of balance . The human race has had a visible and measurable effect on the climate that is governed by the air inside this inner ear . The earth hears our hatred , violence , and indifference in the way we live . If we throw off this delicate balance , we will not be able to stay upright . We will fall . Vestibular system - Wikipedia Since the world is three-dimensional , the vestibular system contains three semicircular canals in each labyrinth . Given this divine ultimatum , the choices are becoming more and more clear by the moment . God has always been pretty clear about choosing sides . Good or evil Life or death Blessings or curses This day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death , blessings and curses . Now choose life , so that you and your children may live and that you may love the Lord your God , listen to his voice , and hold fast to him . Faith or certainty Hope or oppression Love or indifference We should all know which way to go . Now eagerly desire the greater gifts . And yet I will show you the most excellent way . 1 Corinthians 12:31 You see , good things always come in threes . And now these three remain : faith , hope and love . The last words of Jesus on earth make reference to three entities : Therefore go and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you . We know that there is a Father , and there is a Son . Naturally , Christians will respond that Mary was the mother of Jesus . Jewish people will object . They are still waiting for their Messiah to appear . They do not believe in the Christ of Christianity . Jews would already be objecting , because they do not believe in the concept of the Trinity . For there is only one God . Deuteronomy 6:4 Still , Christians insist that there is no contradiction , since the Trinity refers to God as a single being consisting of three parts , a mystery that we humans find hard to fathom . But I think the objection to the concept of the Trinity seems to fall apart when we think about how humans generally conceive of themselves as having three parts : a mind , a soul , and a body . Yet , we are still one person , one being . Now then , my children , listen to me ; blessed are those who keep my ways . Listen to my instruction and be wise ; do not disregard it . Blessed are those who listen to me , watching daily at my doors , waiting at my doorway . For those who find me find life and receive favor from the Lord . John 3:6 The Apostle Paul reiterates the idea of the feminine when speaking of the Spirit . -LRB- I am going to change one word . I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us . For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed . For the creation was subjected to frustration , not by its own choice , but by the will of the one who subjected it , in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God . We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time . Not only so , but we ourselves , who have the firstfruits of the Spirit , groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship , the redemption of our bodies . For in this hope we were saved . But hope that is seen is no hope at all . But if we hope for what we do not yet have , we wait for it patiently . In the same way , the Spirit helps us in our weakness . We do not know what we ought to pray for , but the Spirit herself intercedes for us through wordless groans . It sounds to me that the Spirit is always involved in the activities that are related to women : creating and bringing forth life . Family Paul talked a lot about adoption and families . Jesus referred to his heavenly Father . That makes him the honoured Son . It always puzzled me that there was no mention of a mother . I suppose it just means that thousands of years of patriarchy have blinded us to the fact that our mother has always been there . Jesus was just being a good son by coming to the defence of his mother . Transcript : Einstein 's God Ms. Krista Tippett , Host : I 'm Krista Tippett . We owe our very existence to the existence of something that has come before us : the universe , which we often refer to as time and space . In that sense , time is our father . Mother Now think about what the hippies liked to call this big blue marble in space : Mother Earth . Some people even came up with an idea called the Gaia hypothesis , suggesting that the earth is actually a single organism . In the same way , the Spirit helps us in our weakness . We do not know what we ought to pray for , but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans . No one can quite agree on who the Son of God is . The Jews believe that there is but one God , and Messiah is yet to come . The Christians believe in a Trinitarian God , and that the Christ has already come , and he is coming again . The Muslims appear to believe that there is but one God , and Jesus might have been a good man , but not a Son of God , and that the Holy Prophet was Muhammad . Setting these discrepancies aside , let us consider that there might be merit in the concept of a Trinity . I know this is going to be a stretch for the Jews and Muslims , but please give me the benefit of the doubt for a moment . But no one knows what it really is , except for the Beatles . They sang that love is all you need . Call the divine what you will . That is merely a matter of interpretation . We live in a world confused by different languages . But we have the tools to listen and to interpret . We have two ears to listen and one mouth to speak . That should say something to us . We have these three great world religions and some other faiths and beliefs , but these certainties expressed in holy writ have been our greatest sources of conflict as human beings trying to find our way in the world . Well , maybe . We know what happens when Glenn Close goes off the rails in Fatal Attraction . I think their child would look like love . In the physical universe , I suppose the phenomenon might be known as gravity , the fundamental force that holds everything together , from the smallest particles to the largest galaxies . The Son is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn over all creation . For in him all things were created : things in heaven and on earth , visible and invisible , whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities ; all things have been created through him and for him . He is before all things , and in him all things hold together . And he is the head of the body , the church ; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead , so that in everything he might have the supremacy . We are then the image of the divine , because we share the same basic characteristics of conscious life . And the place where we go to learn about the complexities of the universe is meant to help us find the way to learn about this unity in diversity . It is called a university . However , if we focus on only one subject , we will miss out on the grand adventure that life offers . There is more than one subject , but there is so little time in one human life . God says , No . There is more . Much more . Ultimate Destiny What can we say about our ultimate destiny . One thing that we have heard is that God wants to take us to a new home . Some Christians have the misconception that the good people will be taken to heaven , but the bad people will go to hell . The bad people may even have been prepared in advance for eternal conscious torment . What was revealed in the actual story was that a new city would come from heaven to earth . Well , if anyone remembers Star Trek and the Borg , it sounds a lot like that , except that the Borg is nice . They just want to assimilate . Resistance is futile . They were made for each other . Borg -LRB- Star Trek -RRB- - Wikipedia The Borg are a fictional alien race that appear as recurring antagonists in the franchise . The Odd Couple -LRB- 2015 TV series -RRB- - Wikipedia The Odd Couple is an American multi-camera television sitcom that premiered on February 19 , 2015 , on CBS . According to Isaiah , things are going to go back to the way they were at the very beginning , a garden paradise : The wolf will live with the lamb , the leopard will lie down with the goat , the calf and the lion and the yearling together ; and a little child will lead them . The cow will feed with the bear , their young will lie down together , and the lion will eat straw like the ox . The infant will play near the hole of the cobra , and the young child put his hand into the viper 's nest . Isaiah 11:6-9 That sounds like the restoration of the original paradise in Eden . The Disciple , John , appears to agree that Eden will be restored : Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life , as clear as crystal , flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of the great street of the city . On each side of the river stood the tree of life , bearing twelve crops of fruit , yielding its fruit every month . And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations . No longer will there be any curse . The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city , and his servants will serve him . They will see his face , and his name will be on their foreheads . There will be no more night . They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun , for the Lord God will give them light . But lets get back to now . I mean , we live in a paradise compared with the chaos of the rest of the universe , which looks like it could be a vast , barren stretch of nothingness filled with bits of dust and gas . Maybe there are extraterrestrials . Maybe one day we will meet some . That sounds so depressing . Well , there is the alternative . God is the singularity . We are the amazing , physical embodiment of who he is . That means the Earth really is our mother . And our mother is in the pangs of childbirth , about to birth a new creation . Just like Paul said , the pain will be worth it . These really are just momentary troubles . This too shall pass . The air represents the breath of life that sustains us moment by moment . We even refer to weather events as acts of God . The internet was born in the mind of a man who helped defeat the evil empire of the 20th century , by cracking a code called Enigma . Given that a gay man saved the world from an evil dictator , I would think that we might celebrate him , rather than demonizing him for not being like the majority . I marvel at how the Internet has collapsed space and time . We can virtually see everything that is happening around the planet in real time , because of this network of wires that connects us all . If the son of God is the head , the entire human race is his body . We stand or fall together , depending on how well we can balance . But our equilibrium is being thrown off by an ecosystem that is being threatened by the way humans are neglecting their duty to care for the earth , for their own mother . Well , of course , the Father is going to be angry if we are killing our own Mother . The World Wide Web came online in 1991 . The Internet is only a very young , newly formed universal consciousness . As our central nervous system has just been formed , the body is starting to come alive and to wake up . Ephesians 5:14 But , we are killing our mother and killing ourselves in the womb . This is the greatest form of abortion the world has ever seen . Animals are dying in the prisons we have created for them . Jesus came to renew the entire earth , to set the captives free . Our brothers and sisters of the animal kingdom are losing the will to live . The earth cries out for the blood of our brothers and sisters , whom we have killed mercilessly with our own hands , by active violence or grave indifference . That has always been the goal . The first book of the Bible and the first chapter are not a scientific treatise on how the universe began . It is poetry . God is teaching his children the basics about meaning , purpose , and belonging . He is defining his terms , the words that he uses to create are the same words he uses throughout his Word to communicate the supernatural meaning of the natural world . Hebrews 10:1 We belong in the garden that he gave to us as our responsibility . But we may abdicate our position as guardians of his estate by refusing to listen to him . There is an interesting parallel structure to the history of Israel and the history of the Church . It is interesting to note how Jesus is always referring to the three days that it will take him to build the temple . He was killed on a cross and rose on the third day . He definitely makes a strong point about the symbolism by the reference to the three days that Jonah spends inside the fish , symbolic of his own descent into the depths to release the captives from death . I would suggest that the three days refer to the parallel structure of the Genesis narrative . The first trimester separates light from darkness . The second trimester separates water and sky . The third trimester separates life from inanimate matter . The third day always represents the birth of a new form of life . Day 1 : Light and darkness Day 2 : Water and sky Day 3 : Land and vegetation Day 4 : Light and darkness Day 5 : Water and sky Day 6 : Land animals and mankind Day 7 : Rest Let us remember that flesh gives birth to flesh , but the Spirit gives birth to spirit . But men tend to be the leaders of the Church and have little context to personally understand the pregnancy and birth process . That is , except for this verse : Whoever is pregnant with evil conceives trouble and gives birth to disillusionment . God released his oppressed people from slavery and brought them through the water and into a promised land . The Jewish temple symbolizes the presence of God among his people . It could never contain God . But through Israel , through a long process of gestation , God birthed a Saviour , a completely new form of life , a perfect human , who had the power to overcome death . This is the Age of the flesh . God released his oppressed people through the water of baptism into the world , scattering them to every land on the earth . The Christian temple is the heart of everyone who believes . This was where God had intended to dwell from the beginning . This is the Age of the Spirit . Romans 11:25 Love It has been said that God is love . It has also been said that God so loved the world that he sent his only Son to save the world . Now is the time to choose .
