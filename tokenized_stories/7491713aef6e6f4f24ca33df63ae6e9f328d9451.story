We have a three-pronged campaign . One has been broadly building worker committees in banks in the United States . The Bank Workers campaign , the Committee for Better Banks , the Communications Workers of America -LRB- CWA -RRB- and a whole series of community groups , which we will come back to , were the whistleblowers on the Wells Fargo scandal , where they were opening fake accounts . There is an ongoing , growing campaign with workers in all the major US banks , but what we are focusing on now is a bank called Santander , which a Spanish-owned bank . In the United States they are primarily in the Northeast . There is now a global demand on the bank that they agree not to fight the union and be neutral , the same in the United States as in other countries . Workers should not be forced to sell predatory products or cheat people as a condition of employment . There has always been a dual demand . The traditional demand about how workers should be paid and treated decently , and simultaneously that workers should not be forced to sell predatory products or cheat people as a condition of employment . That is why the work with Wells Fargo has been so exciting , because literally thousands of workers have signed petitions saying these outrageous sales goals could only be met if they cheated customers . SJ : One of the things that is interesting about this is the connection with these international unions that represent bank workers . SL : What is unique about the bank workers organizing is the Brazilian Bank Workers , one of the biggest bank workers unions in the world and one of the most progressive , have aggressively and wonderfully called on the American labor movement to organize bank workers . It is not just out of solidarity . They can not maintain the standards they have won in Brazil and around the world if the largest country with the biggest finance industry is nonunion . It is almost hallucinogenic to have workers in so-called developing countries say that their wages and benefits are threatened by the level of nonunion staff in the United States . There is this fantastic group led by the Brazilian Bank Workers and UNI , the global bank worker federation , that is working both to support the campaign and pressure the company , but also , around the globe , has lifted up this call , which I think is really unusual for unions , for workers to not be pressured to cheat people as a condition of employment . We are going to the Santander shareholder meeting in Spain . They just failed their Community Reinvestment Act test and we did a report on that . We are building a campaign not just about what is good for workers , but about workers who will make the company healthier in terms of how it engages with customers . Essentially , the Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to provide resources to the communities that they are in , to invest in them . We did a report showing that their lending practices ignored or skipped over poor communities and communities of color . There is a test that is done under the CRA Act to see if you have loaned enough money . The bank failed it . The bank also failed the stress test . We think there is a relationship between mistreatment of workers and the underpinnings of the bank being threatened because they are engaged in all sorts of risky practices that may make them a little bit of money in the short run , but then blow up on their face in the long run . SJ : One of the things that connects a lot of the work you do is mapping where the power and the money comes from for bad policies and bad politicians . Those are policies that are bipartisan , we should say . In the age of Donald Trump , in particular , talk about the importance of this kind of work and why it is important to know who is funding your politicians . Our little joke is that we have either been incredibly prescient or Trump picked his entire cabinet by looking at who we have been fighting . SL : The Hedge Clippers campaign looks at hedge funds and private equity , thus hedge clippers clipping their power . Our little joke is that we have either been incredibly prescient or Trump picked his entire Cabinet by looking at who we have been fighting . Pre-Trump winning , we were saying whether it is Goldman Sachs or Steven Schwarzman from Blackstone , these are the people who are really running the government . Lots of folks are laughing saying we are a conspiracy cult or something . Then , when Trump got elected , he put all of these people directly in charge . We are doing a lot of work on mapping the different Trump worlds . Then , there are the Steve Schwarzmans and the Carl Icahns and this other set of players that run committees for him . So , they can essentially create government policies that will further enrich their companies . Then , there is a third set of people like John Paulson , who made all his money in the housing crisis , who may not be directly working for Trump , but who supported him and is now going to reap the benefits . For example , he is heavily invested in Puerto Rico . What we have been looking at is , how do you identify the corporate collaborators with Trump , and then look at ways to start putting pressure on them so that they pay a price for the fact that they are in bed with Trump . One thing is that many of these folks have significant investments from public employee pension plans and college endowments . We have an ongoing campaign saying that pension funds and endowments basically are getting lousy deals from these guys , meaning they pay a lot of money to invest in them and they get poor returns . An example is Robert Mercer whose family owns part of Breitbart and Cambridge Analytica . We want to start raising the issue for a bunch of these people that we should cut off their capital . Another thing we are doing is introducing legislation on a state-by-state basis to tax the carried interest exemption . This is a loophole that lets them take the regular income that most people pay 30-35 percent on and they get to take 15 percent . I think there is a sweet irony of their greed , that in getting into bed with Trump , it may make them much more susceptible to cutting off their capital . One of the ways we can hurt them is by cutting off tax breaks and cutting off investment . I think there is a sweet irony of their greed , that in getting into bed with Trump , it may make them much more susceptible to cutting off their capital . This is one of the pieces that I think is the most critical , which is showing that the people that Trump has put in charge , like Wilbur Ross , are job destroyers . It is not evil foreigners or immigrants . That lets you raise a whole set of issues in terms of showing who they are and then , all the different ways that they gamed the system to enrich themselves at the expense of workers . SJ : This campaigning has been going on around the Dakota Access Pipeline with people and cities , in fact , divesting from Wells Fargo and other banks that are invested in that pipeline . SL : Wells Fargo workers exposed how they were cheating consumers , but there is now a campaign called Forego Wells . They treat their workers terribly . They rob consumers . They are a funder of the Dakota Access Pipeline . They fund private prisons . They fund , in some ways , payday lending . Wells Fargo is a wonderful example of the corruption and debasement of the system . They have binding arbitration . If you have an account with them , you automatically give up the right to sue them . The way I think about it is , we have to make Trump guilty of every evil and sin they commit . If Trump picked Elaine Chao , then he is supporting fake accounts . He is supporting all of these things . On the other hand , anybody who associates with Trump has to be guilty of all of his sins . Jamie Dimon from JPMorgan and Lloyd Blankfein from Goldman Sachs like to pretend they are at least social progressives . Gary Cohn , who is a Goldman Sachs guy , went over to the administration and stood behind Trump when he signed the Muslim ban . We need to hold Goldman Sachs accountable . I think there is a fantastic opportunity to force these contradictions , drive some wedges in the ruling class , and really tell the story about what used to be secret . These are the guys that are running both the economy and the government .
