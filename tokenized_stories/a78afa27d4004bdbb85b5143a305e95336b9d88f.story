After getting overwhelmed by Standing Rock supporters , Morton County deleted their page and created a new one . The new Facebook page featured the classic Thin Blue Line American flag , the staple symbol of Blue Lives Matter , as a profile picture . The page quickly gained over a thousand followers before it was again swarmed by comrades online . Morton County supporters praised officers for brutally suppressing Water Protectors during the November 21st attack . Others posted comments with explicit white nationalist and Alt-Right views . Blue Lives Matter is the counter-movement to Black Lives Matter , a network of Neo-nazis , white supremacists , pro-white militia gangs , and cop supporters , many of which are former and current law enforcement . When a police department endorses Blue Lives Matter this signifies that they have aligned their interests with Donald Trump and the Alt-Right . This revelation will also empower the already hostile local white community that has already been responsible for autonomous rightwing violence against Water Protectors . On December 5th , 2016 the Army Corp of Engineers will close public access to Oceti Sakowin , effectively quarantining Standing Rock off from outside support . Comrades , supporters and allies all across Turtle Island must come together and defend Standing Rock from the oncoming repression this December .
