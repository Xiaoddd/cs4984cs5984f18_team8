Additional shipping charges will not apply . Please try again later . My mom says Scott 's toilet paper will last you longer then any brand . It does n't matter how thin it is . It does n't matter how much you use , it will last longer then other brands . So I decided to put it to the test . At the beginning of February I purchased cottonelle ultra comfort 32 count . Only used that for the month of feb , then at the end of the month I counted 8 rolls left . It 's is now May 19 , we are still using Scott 's 27 count purchased in March . 7 rolls left . In the past I had an irritation ... -LRB- yes , I know it is too much information but I 'm hoping I can help someone else -RRB- , I went to the doctor and he said it was from the toilet paper I was using ... the soft brands . He said that when a person wipes with the soft paper sometimes pieces stay behind and that can lead to an irritation or worse an infection . He suggested my family use Scott 1000 Toilet Paper . He said it may be rougher but it wo n't leave any fragments behind . I have to say that no one in my family has had any irritation or infection using Scott 's brand Original Toilet Paper . The only complaint I have is that this item is n't the individually wrapped rolls . This is just a package of unwrapped rolls . I personally prefer the individually wrapped ones but hat is just my preference .

September 23 , 2014 Verified Purchase This is Scott 1-ply toilet paper . If you are not familiar , perhaps you will find this helpful . We had been using Charmin Ultra Strong for years . Our sewage backed up twice in 3 years , Rotorooter came twice to unclog it . Once they were able to unclog it , but the other 3 times they were unable to . They said I would need jetsetting service -LRB- a 4 figure service -RRB- , and if that did not work I would need to dig up the lines -LRB- destroying the radiant floor heating , a 5 figure service -RRB- . He was able to clear the line in 20 minutes . He also said that Roto Rooter is notorious for not clearing lines -LRB- just by not using augers on the snakes or other practices -RRB- . They do n't make money by clearing lines , so they always claim much more is wrong so that they can keep rolling in the big bucks . He also explained that Charmin is made of cotton , which does n't dissolve in water . So with consistent use they will ALWAYS clog . Scott was the nicest of all of the toilet papers that are safe to put in toilets . We have it subscribe and saved .

I consider this a bargain when I can get it for around 75 cents or less per roll ; sometimes that 's here on Amazon , sometimes at local stores . September 26 , 2016 Verified Purchase I love this TP . Toilet paper is a weird thing to be picky about , but i HATE HATE the soft tp that breaks apart and leaves lint all over . This does n't do that , the rolls last forever , and although I have never had a problem with toilets clogging this apparently also is good for the plumbing . I also really like Kirkland from Costco , I feel like the two are pretty similar .

The paper is so thin , and you have to use twice the amount than regular toilet paper . The Scott Ultra Soft Quilted toilet paper is ten times better . If you are on a tight financial budget , I would recommend this product , but if you like quality this is not for you . The plumber says , though it 's dated , it does n't really need to be replaced until it gives out -- a costly psrospect , when the time comes . After going a few rounds with it backing up , and paying my very nice plumber hefty fees for his services , I was about to break down and go for the update . Couple of years and counting , and the difference is amazing . I have had a minor back up or two , but nothing a good drain opener could n't easily deal with . Usually a fifteen minute gel type will clear it . I also found a main line cleaner , -LRB- gallon size jug you pour in , leave overnight -RRB- , I use a couple of times a year for maintenance , or if the gel does n't clear it , and that has always taken care of any problem . However , incidents are now few and far between , and really no more than you 'd likely have with any plumbing from time to time . And I have n't had to call the plumber since . The saving grace is this tissue breaks down much more quickly and easily than other types , and that makes all the difference with ` sensitive ' plumbing . It is thinner than the hyped brands , it 's one ply , not two . It is not coarse or rough , though , and use whatever you need , the rolls still last much longer . This is the product I 'd buy now even it was n't saving me a fortune and much angst over plumbing issues . I have it on Subscribe and Save now , so I do n't have to worry about forgetting to order it .
