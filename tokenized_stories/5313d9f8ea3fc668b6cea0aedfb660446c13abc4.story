Most protesters left peacefully Wednesday , when authorities closed the camp on Army Corps of Engineers land in advance of spring flooding , but some refused to go . Eighteen National Guardsmen and dozens of law officers entered the camp from two directions shortly before midday Thursday , along with several law enforcement and military vehicles . A helicopter and airplane flew overhead . Officers checked structures and began arresting people , putting them in vans to take to jail . About two dozen people were arrested in the first half hour of the operation , according to Levi Bachmeier , an adviser to Gov. Doug Burgum . The operation began shortly after authorities said Corps officials had met with camp leaders . The Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux , whose reservation is downstream , say Dakota Access threatens their drinking water and cultural sites . Dallas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners disputes that . When complete , the pipeline will carry oil through the Dakotas and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois . American Indian elders have told police there are people willing to resort to drastic measures to stay in the camp , Iverson said . Similar sentiments have been expressed by protesters on social media , Iverson said . At its peak , the camp was home to thousands of protesters . Burgum estimated Wednesday night that as many as 50 people remained in the camp . Police early Thursday said an additional 15 crossed a frozen river and entered the camp on foot . Before authorities moved in , Burgum had said those remaining at the camp still had a chance to leave without facing charges . The state sent a bus to the site on Thursday to transport anyone to Bismarck , where officials were doling out basic necessities , along with hotel and bus vouchers . No one took advantage of the offer Thursday , Bachmeier said . Only nine people used the center Wednesday , he said . The Corps had warned that the protesters need to leave the site before the spring melt floods the land and spreads debris from the camp downriver . Early Wednesday , protesters burned some wooden structures on site in what they described as a leaving ceremony . Authorities said about 20 fires were set and a 7-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl were taken to hospitals to be treated for burns . Shortly before the 2 p.m. deadline to leave , about 150 people marched out of the soggy camp , singing and playing drums as they walked down a highway , carrying an American flag hung upside-down .
