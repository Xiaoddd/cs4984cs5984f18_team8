Pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners originally was expected to finish the pipeline before the end of this year , but the Army 's move likely delays it by several months . That will be costly to the Dallas-based company , but industry experts say it 's unlikely to kill the project completely . The Army 's decision likely halts progress on the project until after President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20 . Trump , who supports the pipeline and holds stock in Energy Transfer Partners , has n't said whether he will try to overturn the Army 's decision . Dakota Access has said tunneling under Lake Oahe is likely to take at least 60 days once digging begins and some industry experts say it could take as long as 90 days . So , if the Trump administration were to immediately reverses course and authorize construction , the pipeline likely would n't be completed until April or May . He said the company has long-term transportation contracts with nine shippers indicating the pipeline will be in service by Jan. 1 , 2017 , and the shippers have the right to terminate those contracts if terms are n't met . Industry experts say the contracts likely have several target dates including project start date , in-service date and differing start dates for the nine shippers . Shippers say they 're not concerned yet . Hess Corp. spokesman John Roper says the company can just continue using current transportation methods . Dennis Nuss , a spokesman for petroleum company Phillips 66 , which owns a 25 percent stake in the pipeline , expressed confidence the project will be finished early next year . Yes . In Iowa , about a dozen landowners forced to allow the pipe on their farmland through a state eminent domain law are pressing forward on their own legal challenge . They contend , among other arguments , that a 2006 Iowa law prohibits an industry from using eminent domain to take agricultural land . They 're asking a judge to throw out what they consider to be illegal easements granted by the Iowa Utilities Board . If they win , they want the pipeline dug up and removed .
