Listen to the PBS NewsHour podcast . Leave a respectful comment . But at the same time , I feel a sense of caution . I have a general feeling that this is not the end . Long Soldier , a member of the Lakota Sioux Tribe , wrote a poem about the standoff earlier this year . It interweaves an interview she conducted with Waniya Lock , one of the Standing Rock activists , with the official guidelines that were developed by tribal elders about how people at the camp should conduct themselves . The poem is part of a collection that will be published next spring . The problem for Long Soldier was the way the apology was issued . No tribal leaders were invited to witness the signing . Long Soldier was so angry she immediately sat down and wrote a poem . It also contains seven resolutions and a disclaimer , just like the apology . I had never written overtly political subjects . I want things to be different for my child . I want us , our people , to be seen . The Obama apology , she says , is no different . She compares the poor execution of that apology to the most moving apology she has ever received : when her father said he was sory for not being around for her childhood . I had never seen him cry . I could feel his sincerity in that one moment . All those years of heartache and disappointment and grief , it went away . It was done . Reprinted with the permission of Graywolf Press .
