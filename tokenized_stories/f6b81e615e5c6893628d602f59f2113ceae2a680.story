Share story By Lynda V. Mapes Seattle Times environment reporter In a dramatic turnaround , a federal judge has ruled that permits to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline must be reconsidered , and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has demanded the flow of oil through the pipeline be stopped . Completion of the controversial pipeline was stopped by the Obama Administration last December , with a call for an environmental-impact statement to assess risks . Related Ruling on Dakota Access pipeline surprises oil industry President Trump called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to issue the permits , which it did shortly after he took office . Completion of the pipeline swiftly followed , as contractors drilled under a lake formed by a dam on the Missouri River , to hook up the two ends of the pipeline . The flow of oil began June 1 . About the DAPL protest The Trump administration has advanced the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipeline projects . And here 's what we 're reading related to the controversy . March 28 : What the completed Dakota Access pipeline means for key players . Feb. 22 : Preparing to leave , Standing Rock protesters ceremonially burn camp . Feb. 1 : Hundreds rally as the Seattle City Council considers divesting from Wells Fargo because of its role as a Dakota Access Pipeline lender . The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says it will push back . He said the tribe in a status conference before the judge next week will also demand that the flow of oil be stopped while the remand is underway . Hasselman noted the court found three separate violations of legal standards when the Corps issued the permits to complete the pipeline . An analysis of the potential for spills by an outside analyst was not adequately addressed . Finally , the environmental-justice concerns raised by the tribe were also not adequately addressed , nor the highly controversial nature of the project . The tribe argued the pipeline , routed within a half mile of its reservation , puts its water supply in the Missouri River and tribal lands , including sacred sites , unduly at risk . Its fight against the pipeline was joined by tribes from around the Northwest and the nation , as well as opponents from all walks of life from around the globe . Energy Transfer Partners has argued the pipeline is safe and preferable to either tanker trucks or oil trains for the transport of an essential commodity .
