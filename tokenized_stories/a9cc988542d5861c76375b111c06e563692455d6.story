My Lakota name is Waunsila Win . It means compassionate woman . My English name is Brenda White Bull . I served 1989 to 2009 . I come from Kenel , South Dakota . My parents are the late Albert and Maxine White Bull I 'm the great great granddaughter of Sitting Bull . I am very proud and honored to be a descendant of Sitting Bull , and to carry out his legacy . And I encourage everyone to come home again and visit . We talk about the seven generations . I believe that we are their dreams come true , so for these next seven generations that come along , I will never know my great-great-grand children , but I want to know that they will have the same fight in them as we do today . Our ancestors that fought before us never gave up , never once , because they had us in mind . He cared about their safety and their life and all the children and the elderly . And he always provided for them first . Before he would give to himself , he gave to them . So when you are looking at me , you are looking at him . I tell them , tell those stories , so that they can come back . Pray . BeenThereDoneThat says : 14:30 Waunsila Win , yes , your Great Great Grandfather is with you always .

Much love and deep respect . spirit guide says : 04:11 just found out ash coulee dam near Belford n.d. has a pipeleak of oil in our waters . this is why we stand today , I cant be there , but in spirit . I am part Cherokee Indian on my mothers side I learned about the different tribes in college -LRB- late in life -RRB- graduating in 2003 with a BA in Comparative Religions . I related more to the Native American spirituality , along with some other more spiritually driven practices in the world than the typical mainstream Christianity . I have gotten so much out of learning about all of the different religions and there is a thread of spirituality in each , while also having a different thread of more religious dogma and restriction , based on convenient judgement to ` separate ' . It has been my hope ever since this awareness , that we all come together in solidarity against the oppressors and the elite who really are not part of the American ideal , but more the British and other European perspective we tried to get away from because of religious oppression and abuse . The ideal of democracy -LRB- which your Eastern tribes helped create in the fashion of their own constitution ... is a far cry from what some leaders want for this country and its people . We all want safety , security and happiness with the freedom to reach our highest potential and for that of our children and grandchildren . And with those natural remedies that are compatible with our bodies , minds and systems of this world . I am foremost a Truth Seeker and am searching always for what is truth and a higher vibration . Because of that , i am open to looking and listening to all the practices throughout history . . and that is a rich source to consider all of it and see what is the spiritual essence in each idea . Its all one Spirit , and that has no nationality or separation from another . This is a positive development for this nation . Good for you folks . JEANNE says : 14:40 THANKS FOR SHARING .
