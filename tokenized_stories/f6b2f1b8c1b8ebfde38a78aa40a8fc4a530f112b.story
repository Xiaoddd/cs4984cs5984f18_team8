For months , the Standing Rock Sioux have been blocking the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline , which cuts through their tribal lands . The federal government has harassed them , using water cannon , rubber bullets , percussion grenades , and other forms of low-level violence . Protestors from across the country have joined them in solidarity . The most comprehensive report on the dispute appears in the Washington Post , describing the long history of treaties broken by the U.S. government . And those earlier disputes over their rights to the land , like the one over the Dakota Access pipeline , pitted the tribes against a persistent force , the Army Corps of Engineers . The federal government has been taking land from Lakota and Dakota people for 150 years , tribal leaders say , from the seizure of land in the Black Hills of South Dakota after the discovery of gold in the 1870s to the construction of dams in the Missouri River that flooded villages , timberland and farmland in the Dakotas in the 1950s . Through the ages , the warring tribes of the Northern Plains lived , hunted and fought across a sprawling expanse of land . Many were migratory , moving with the seasons . Each treaty with the U.S. government , most notably the 1851 and 1868 treaties of Fort Laramie , restricted their movement further , although they left them large areas west of the Missouri River and recognized them as sovereign nations . Land was later taken to make way for homesteading . In 1889 , Congress passed legislation that created the modern reservation system , pushing the Sioux , also known as Lakota , into smaller areas . And later in the 1900s , a series of dams across the Missouri River rolled back the scope of those reservations , too . Lake Oahe illustrates his point . The lake , the site of the current dispute , exists because of a dam project built by the Army Corps of Engineers , the same agency that has been weighing whether and where the Dakota Access pipeline could be built . Empowered by the Flood Control Act of 1944 , the Army Corps erected the Oahe Dam in central South Dakota , forming a reservoir that extends about 250 miles upstream to within a short distance of Bismarck , N.D. . In 1962 , President John F. Kennedy dedicated the dam , hailing it as a symbol of a free society tapping its natural resources . It buried them .

We forgot to write into the treaties that the Sioux can have their lands until the U.S. Government wants them . Reply Catherine Blanche King says : November 26 , 2016 at 12:25 am I forgot to say ... OR until some oligarchic big company wants them . Reply Ellen Lubic says : November 26 , 2016 at 1:39 pm What I fear will happen under Trump , is that the military and police will use real bullets against all peaceful protesters , and it will happen much earlier on in their protests . Trump will emulate his hero , Putin , and will have mass graves dug and quickly dispose of the bodies . Nope . Reply Joe says : November 26 , 2016 at 12:34 am Tweet from Bernie : The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the people of North Dakota have shown the importance of standing together against injustice . Reply retired teacher says : November 26 , 2016 at 7:44 am Those of us in education should take notice as we may well be on the road to civil disobedience . If the courts can call almost anything public education , teachers , parents , and concerned citizens may have to demonstrate to make our point . This happened in Chile when privatization was forced on students . Reply NYSTEACHER says : November 26 , 2016 at 8:50 am RT , Really important point . We may finally realize at some point in the very near future that this type of action is all we have left in order to protect our jobs , unions , and public education as an idea . My fear is that the protesters against the Dakota pipeline are going to lose and lose badly , especially if the upcoming Trump admin takes over the standoff . I suspect it will get ugly . This will unfortunately be something that scares off real resistance for some time . This is my fear . Teachers went on strike , and picketing was common . I taught in New York too where we went on strike for twenty weeks . We were subject to the Taylor Law and lost two for one on our salaries . I feel the climate is worse now . If teachers went on strike , they would probably try to fire everyone and try to implement privatization . Billionaires have no skin in the game about privatization . It will be up to parents and community members to fight to have a certified human teacher in an authentic public school . Otherwise , the oligarchs will be happy to put children in front of screens , and call it public education . and preferably at home . The one guy that was shot and killed had to point a weapon at the cops for them to finally respond with force , but a bunch of peaceful , nonviolent protesters are regularly brutalized for defending land that is actually theirs . Amerikkka . In recent months , many of our fellow commentators have noted how we are looking more and more like Weimar Germany , which had a notorious judicial and administrative leniency toward the right as compared to the left . Ellen Lubic says : November 26 , 2016 at 1:49 pm Thanks Linda of reminding us of those 8 Georgia teachers who are still in prison for changing test answers . And thank you Jon for the comparison of the law breaking , gun toting , White ranchers who were never accosted and driven out of public lands , with the Native Americans whose reservation , their true assigned homeland , is once again stolen from them as the government uses physical violence against them to get them to disperse . Yesterday I saw a photo of one lone young Indian woman sitting on her horse , unarmed , facing the phalanx of armed police in riot gear who were about to advance on her . She is a person who Obama should give the Medal of Honor for bravery . Catherine Blanche King says : November 26 , 2016 at 2:16 pm Ellen Lubic : As I read your post , I was reminded of that famous painting of a Native American sitting on his horse where both of their heads were bowed . The several-hundred-year-old problem with the United States is coming to a head right there , right now . Montana Teacher says : November 26 , 2016 at 1:38 am Thank you so much , Diane , for posting this information . As a white person who grew up in this area , I did not learn the truth of how Indians had been treated until I was an adult . There is still widespread prejudice out here . American Indians are the forgotten minority in the United States . There are several things we can do to support these courageous people . Reply Montana Teacher says : November 26 , 2016 at 1:45 am P.S. . A couple of my former Native students are at the protest now , and one of my white students returned from there and told us how very scary it was to have guns pointed at her . One student told me the Water Protector camps can use teachers for the youths there , so perhaps retired teachers might consider going out there ... Reply Ellen Lubic says : November 26 , 2016 at 2:18 am Obama is protecting the oil company -LRB- which was refused pipeline rights in the nearby White city , but is forced on the reservation land -RRB- . He has recently pardoned a few hundred prisoners who committed terrible crimes , but he did not pardon Leonard Pelletier , nor even the very White Gov Siegelman . Thanks Diane for publishing this disaster . It is so shameful how the US Government and the oligarchs treat Native Americans . The original indigenous people have no real representation in our government , and evidently neither do We the People . Reply Joel Herman says : November 26 , 2016 at 8:53 am Precisely why Trump must be de-legitimized from the start , obstructed every inch of the way -LRB- they wont -RRB- . . But it is dismal Democrats who empower Republicans . Add Standing Rock to the Obama Hall of shame. , Up there with Flint and Wisconsin and countless other failures . Failures of leadership that had little to do with Republican obstruction . Failures that dilevered the Nation to the right . Look at the map . Would there be any question had the election been reversed . They would challenge the results if they were absolutely certain beyond any reasonable doubt they were legitimate . They would do this to delegitimize ; a legitimate President , one who had won both the popular and electoral vote . Just as the birther movement was fanned for that purpose . Thank God for the Greens . The fear of ceding power to the Republican right . Not a good enough reason . They are two sides of the same coin . retired teacher says : November 26 , 2016 at 11:02 am We have to believe if they can step on one group of people , in this case native people , they can step on all of us . We just have to get in line and wait for our turn to be crushed . Linda says : November 26 , 2016 at 9:45 am Obama is busy giving the Medal of Freedom award to oligarchs , like Bill and Melinda Gates , a mockery of America . The Medal of Freedom award should be conferred on Diane Ravitch . pnwarriorwoman says : November 26 , 2016 at 12:44 pm I only disagree with your substitute awardee . The Medal of Freedom belongs to the Stand Rock Sioux . I love Diane too . Linda says : November 26 , 2016 at 8:17 pm Both qualify . Montana Teacher says : November 26 , 2016 at 2:39 am Sometimes , I get so tired trying to teach and give my energy to students while fighting difficult outside forces ... but maybe I will hang in there as long as I can so that I can share the truth . It helps to find similarly concerned people on this blog . We are with them and with you . Reply Montana Teacher says : November 26 , 2016 at 3:11 am Thank you , Ellen . I have always appreciated your comments on this site . Reply Roy Turrentine says : November 26 , 2016 at 7:11 am When I taught in North Carolina , I sang in the choir with a lawyer who had led the fight against the dam on the New River , which flows out of the Blue Ridge Mountains near Boone north to the Knawaha near Charleston , WV . He led a coalition of opponents who fought a proposed dam from the early 1960s until it was declared a wild and scenic river around 1976 . The New River Controversy , a book written soon thereafter , describes the politics and the pathos . It was quite a fight . The project was meant to provide electricity for Ohio towns . A cost benefit analysis did no good . They proved with army corps figures that the benefit had been wildly exaggerated , and that 5000 people were in danger of losing their homes for nothing . Basically , an urban area was asking a rural area to sacrifice so that they could live a lifestyle the folks in the mountain could only dream about . Still it took years to delay and finally defeat it . Other dams in Tennessee were not so lucky . I can recall reports of old Cherokee women being carried off their porches in their rockers in East Tennessee . One dam on the Duck River was defeated after massive cost overrun in the 1980s . These battles were hostile and personal . I can not say much about the present pipeline , but the recent rupture of one that carries gasoline in Alabama reminds us that infrastructure must be maintained and is costly . It always seems that rural places have to give up so that urban places can have something . Be they power lines or pipelines , dams or interstates , the few have little chance against the many . This is one of the major forces driving the rural people to despise government and support those who oppose it . Of course , the Souix experience , right down to the French word we use on that group , is born of the same exploitative period in European history that gave us so many more atrocities . Read about Standing Bear and the Ponca , or visit the wonderful museum at Ponca City , OK . Ironically , the museum is just down the road from a refinery . We owe it to the reservation to stop and listen for a while . Even if their objections were ridiculous , the history of broken treaties and abusive treatment of their culture merited much discussion a long time ago . We rerouted a Tennessee highway around a sensitive ecological area in the 1990s . There are always alternatives if someone is willing to pay . In the lat 1800s , the Poncas were forced off their ancestral land on the Missouri River in Nebraska for no reason . It took a journalist and a gargantuan movement that eventually got something done about it . Seems we are indeed returning to a Guilded age of corruption and jingoism . Reply Montana Teacher says : November 28 , 2016 at 1:07 am Roy , Thank you for sharing this history , even though it was sad to read . This is a pristine , undammed river whose headwaters are in Yellowstone National Park . database . Reply Montana Teacher says : November 28 , 2016 at 1:16 am Thank you for the info . Albert asked . How ironic that many of the current Water Protectors fought for the United States and now must face armed law enforcement officers fighting against them . Reply Joe says : November 26 , 2016 at 9:57 am All this is happening under the aegis of a Democratic president -LRB- with a very hostile GOP controlled Congress -RRB- . The horror show that is Trump is not even in charge yet . Sell-out that Obama was , we will be looking back at him with fondness once the billionaire reality show goes into high gear . Bernie has made a strong statement against the treatment of the protesters , the Standing Rock Sioux and the rape of their sacred lands . Reply Joel Herman says : November 26 , 2016 at 10:24 am I will look back at him as the man who came in with a mandate and no agenda for the American People . Heritagecare with its sell outs to Pharma and big insurgence ; when it is gone will set back true reform another half century . I look back at LBJ as a crass SOB with an agenda to make the lives of all working class Americans better . A man whose legacy was losing the South for generations to come , but doing what had to be done because it was the right thing to do . Reply Joel Herman says : November 26 , 2016 at 10:25 am Insurance -LRB- oh god -RRB- Roy Turrentine says : November 26 , 2016 at 10:46 am I like insurgence . Fits . we will be looking back at him with fondness . . Close your accounts . The site lists the targets . Reply Ed Ciaccio says : November 26 , 2016 at 12:13 pm Of course . The Corporate Police Surveillance State will always protect the corporate plunderers long before the people and the planet . As with privatizing public schools , which most Repubs and too many Dems support , the private sector overwhelms the Common Good nearly every time . Reply Joe says : November 26 , 2016 at 12:27 pm I concur with just about everything you said . But I will have to agree with Noam Chomsky , we all should have held our noses and voted for HRC to block the far worse evil of Trump . Public education continues to be on the chopping block , Medicare and Social Security could be destroyed . we all should have held our noses and voted for HRC . . If you click the link and read the article , you might think what I did , that G. W. Bush learned from President Grant when Bush lied about WMDs so he could start the war in Iraq .
