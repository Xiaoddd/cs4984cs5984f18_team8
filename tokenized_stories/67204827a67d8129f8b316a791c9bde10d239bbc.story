Emergency responders struggled to keep up with rioters as they marched through Philadelphia streets leaving destruction in their wake . That 's why they were rioting . As football fans riot , I am reminded that , in response to the unjust deaths of young Black men like Trayvon Martin -LRB- who would have been 23 today -RRB- , rioting is considered an affront to humanity . Not endorsing violence . Endorsing honest examination of WHY & eradication of racism . Not endorsing violence . A riot with mostly white people often gets turned into jokes . Imagine the blowback if the majority of these people were black .
