Please upgrade to a supported browser . Although a terrible thing has happened and Donald Trump has emerged as the victor in our most visible democratic process , democracy happens every day . Our communities exist every day . You might be too mad or too sad to have this conversation right now . first . who you are . If you have any marginalized identity at all , this conversation might hurt personally . If you have any friends with any marginalized identities , there is likely pain ahead in the conversation . Remember who you are and who you love . If you are approaching the conversation from a lateral place of privilege , then use this to your advantage if possible . Many people that lean right view social equality as a threat to their own social position . If you can approach the conversation on equal footing , then you remove the possibility that they will use this potential defense mechanism . You are not going to talk to a Trump voter once and emerge from a single conversation a social justice warrior . This is the opening of a long haul . Be ready for the long game . Make space for people to move into . When you fundamentally disagree with someone , Facebook fights are not the way to go . the lingo . Your social justice language is not going to work here . But you can only bite off so much at once . lecture . from inquiry . Ask questions . Find out why they voted the way they did . Find the most basic thing that you agree on , let them know you agree , and add a caveat . humor if you can , acknowledge the absurdities . This is a tricky one , because humor can go horribly wrong too . But humor over common experiences of unfairness , absurdity -LRB- e.g. , bureaucratic tangles -RRB- , and sheer ridiculous situations can help break up the tension if it is reaching too much of a point . Going right for the hardest part is risky . Build up to it by establishing common ground . The truth is , there are many common areas of frustration with inequality , unfair treatment , and pain of living in this modern commercialized segregated bureaucratic world . We can find these common points to build bridges . Common points of mutual enjoyment can be found . Common frustrations with the DMV , the voting process itself , cost of living , information overload , can be found . their interests , not their positions . and stories , not facts . means affirming their feelings too . Let them know you hear their fears . Talk to them about why . Be ready with some stories of times you changed your mind . This might be the scariest thing to do , but if your loved one loves you back , your own stories of what Trump policies will mean for you can be incredibly impactful . where they identify confusion . This is NOT about finding where you think their position is ideologically inconsistent . breaks . Run to the bathroom and text a friend . Get a glass of water . them to try something new . Be ready with a few actions they can take that you think might be just on the edge of their comfort zones . Time to prove it . Invite them to say something about that kind of rhetoric when they hear it . Be there with them . them space . If there are vulnerable groups that they have an affinity with , invite them to find a way to get involved supporting that community . They have no other home -- they grew up in the United States and consider this country home and they love the United States just like you and I do . You have to be open . Now that he is president he will be more careful with his words . Our president is the role model for all of us ; his words hold great weight . And at the same time , I take your point that politicians often say certain things when they are campaigning and then do other things once they are in office . This is how they appeal to their base . His campaign promises are the only words that we have to go off of . addition , his words have made a lot of people scared that their families will be broken apart . say : I just believe we need pro-life judges . Abortion is wrong . say : It sounds really important to you that your politics align with your faith . He very much advocated that we should look out for the poor and marginalized . continue : Maybe we could talk about some of the complexities of the issue . But no one is pro abortion . An abortion is always a tragic decision . No one wants to have to make that decision . we are serious about reducing the number of abortions in the US , we should look at effective ways of reducing unwanted pregnancies . v , Wade passed in 1973 . Women were dying , and illegal abortions were seen as a public health issue . Emergency medicine is expensive and when people use the emergency room as a last resort , those costs gets passed on to you because all medicine becomes more expensive and thus your own health care gets more expensive . may also want to emphasize that Obamacare is hugely important for people who have pre-existing conditions . You almost certainly have someone in your family or friend group with a pre-existing condition . Previously , it was legal to discriminate against such people . As an analogy , if 97 doctors told me that I needed my appendix out and three thought my ailment might be caused by something else , I would probably get my appendix out . A lot of people in mining communities are suffering and need our help , but even without any environmental regulations , natural gas would be cheaper than coal , and automation would mean fewer people need to work the mines . We need to find a way to create new kinds of jobs or even consider a universal basic income . Either way the issue has to addressed . So the issue of dealing with the consequences remains . I find this gets me to a more civil place in the discussion . Focusing on future environmental issues is not on the same level as the immediate and very real issue of not being able to feed your family . We need a way to vet them . You are actually far more likely to die from falling out of bed or having furniture collapse on you than you are from a terrorist . You are vastly more likely to die in a car accident -LRB- hundreds and hundreds of times -RRB- than from a terrorist . Yet you still have furniture . You still sleep in a bed at night . And you still choose to drive each day . Terrorism wins when you let your fear drive your actions . Terrorism wins when you let irrational fear change what you believe and how you treat others . The best way to fight terrorism is to bravely continue loving and welcoming people . say : Freedom of speech does not guarantee freedom from the consequences of that speech . Otherwise , that in itself would encroach on the freedom of speech of others . For example , the First Amendment protects against incarceration by the government from your views , but it does not protect you entirely from civil litigation , termination of your employment , and societal backlash . People are legitimately fearing for their lives because of human rights . can say : I understand that many Democrats and Republicans are fed-up with politicians who seem to do nothing . But some of the things Trump has said strike me as dangerous . Like when Trump encourages South Korea to develop nuclear weapons . say : I can agree that there is way too much testing happening in schools . As states have come to believe that they are not preparing college and career-ready students , they have turned to testing as a way to measure student growth . In many states , this has resulted in a wide range of tests and standards that can seem contradictory and confusing to good teachers . Districts spend a ton of time and money trying to understand what the results even mean . Common core was originally designed by educators to offer some concrete guidelines about what being on track for college and career would mean at different grade levels . It was never mandated by the federal government , through its adoption was encouraged . We voted for Trump because of economics and policy . course not . I absolutely believe you and am in no way calling you or Trump supporters racists . Obviously , we are all good people just trying to move our country forward . For me , I really did not like the way that he called Mexicans rapists . also think bringing up history can help . I asked him his opinion on race jokes , he honestly said they were funny and permissible . He was appalled and I asked him that there is harshness when tell those kind of jokes . Having the same rights as everyone else is not special treatment . Being able to marry is not special treatment . Not having to do conversion therapy is not special treatment . By infringing on marriage rights of any citizen , the government would be infringing on property rights . Making this more relevant to today : denying the right to marry to certain groups denies them the right to community property and , for example , payouts from a life insurance policy from a deceased spouse . Equal protection . The laws can not be applied to just some citizens . Either government relinquishes its jurisdiction over marriage entirely or it must allow any citizens wishing to marry to do so . agree no one should be attacking anyone . It would make me feel a lot safer if Trump were to stand up and do the same , to plainly condemn violence and say that the hate speech and attacks in his name are not OK .
