Witness what happened on Sunday in North Dakota , when law enforcement officers escalated their tactics against unarmed American Indians and allies who have waged months of protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline . They drenched protesters with water cannons on a frigid night , with temperatures in the 20s . According to protesters and news accounts , the officers also fired rubber bullets , pepper spray , concussion grenades and tear gas . The confrontation happened at Backwater Bridge , on a highway linking the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and Bismarck , N.D. Burned-out trucks and a police barricade have made the bridge impassable . The violence erupted after some of the protesters tried to remove the truck carcasses on Sunday . The pipeline , all but built , is meant to ship crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois . Built almost entirely on private property , the pipeline crosses ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux , passing less than a mile from the tribal reservation . Tribe members fear contamination of their drinking water and damage to sacred sites . They are trying to persuade the federal government to deny permits allowing the pipeline to cross the Missouri River near their reservation . The Army Corps of Engineers has called for more study and input from the tribe before it decides on whether to grant a permit . The pipeline company has asked a federal judge to give it the right to proceed with its plan to lay pipe under the river . There is no firm timeline for either decision .
