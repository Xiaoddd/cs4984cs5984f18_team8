Winds NNW at 5 to 10 mph . . Tonight Mostly clear . Low 66F . Winds NNW at 5 to 10 mph . I felt powerless . For a week or so , I fell prey to these feelings . Then , I drove west with my wife , Mary ; my son , Elijah ; and a friend and her two boys to South Dakota , to Standing Rock . I wanted to regain a sense of power , to regain a modicum of agency in a world where the reality was exactly the opposite . After nearly three days , we finally found ourselves at the gates of the Oceti Sakowin camp , otherwise known as Standing Rock . I think we were all bruised from the trip that had taken far longer than we expected , and I felt anxious about what I would find at the camp . At the gate was a checkpoint manned by a handful of young men , all Native American . They were brusque but respectful . They asked us who we were and checked out the six occupants of the minivan . No Drugs . From the very beginning of our stay , the seriousness of the camp , its energy , its mission pervaded the atmosphere . At first I only glimpsed this because I simply could not take in what I was seeing . The camp was large and extensive . As we drove to find a campsite for our tent , I saw RVs , teepees , cars of all shapes and sizes , huts , tents inhabiting a space bordered by the road and the river . Flags fluttered in the wind , and signs offering slogans , directions , identifications peppered every surface . People of all shapes , sizes , races wandered about , some with purpose , others seemingly without , taking no notice of our vehicle . As I came to understand , people arrived and left constantly . We were just one group among many groups of supporters . We already knew that this was not a vacation and that we would need to contribute to the camp . What I did not see at the beginning was the nature of this contribution . I could not understand how this thing worked but , putting aside my confusion , I set out to find a place for myself . I found myself in a kitchen but not quite like any kitchen where I had ever worked . Lit by a series of bare bulbs , it was dim and enclosed . The floors were covered with layers of straw and cardboard , slowly decomposing into the South Dakota soil . Everywhere I looked , I saw shelves and tables loaded with miscellaneous bags and boxes of donated food . A young woman was running the kitchen , and I asked her if there was anything I could do . She handed me a knife and told me to cut up a box of apples that they would then roast and use in a soup . This was how I could contribute : a small task that helped feed some people who would then contribute their own efforts . I was beginning to see how Oceti Sakowin worked . The next day , we gathered in another Army surplus tent to listen to the orientation . None of us knew how long we would be there or what form this orientation would take . But there must have been close to 80 people crowded into the tent facing two young women who , in no uncertain terms , laid out the ground rules for us all . We were told that we were part of something bigger than ourselves and that we needed to be humble in the face of this . No pictures , no appropriation or New Age embrace of Native American culture . These I could stand by . Our orientation facilitators stepped aside to introduce a young Native American from New Mexico named Graham . It was through his words that I really began to grasp the true nature of what I had become involved in . The tent began to grow stuffy . Most of us were standing in a semi-circle . I could feel the fatigue in my legs . I could feel the fatigue of us all . And yet , this young man offered us words that somehow energized us . He spoke of a struggle that had been going on for centuries in which Standing Rock and the Dakota Access Pipeline were just one more battle . He spoke of respect for the sacred traditions of all indigenous peoples no matter where on the globe they might live . It was not just his words but his whole demeanor . Idealistic but firmly grounded . Energetic but disciplined . I was to see this same powerful presence the next night . Looking for warm drinks for our company , we had entered a mess tent offering tea , coffee and hot chocolate . As we entered , a pre-meal prayer ceremony began . The focus of the ceremony was another young Native American man , this time from Northern California . He spoke of the history that lay behind Standing Rock . He spoke too of the 400 years of struggle , saying that , whatever the outcome , struggle would go on . Behind his words , I heard a message that our actions were merely a part of a much greater struggle of which we were just a small part and that , in essence , that victory was inevitable . We had only to do our part . And he asked us to see that whatever choices we had made in the past , whatever had happened to us , whatever roads we had traveled to get to Standing Rock , they had led us to this moment , this place , and that this was good . The morning before we left the camp , all of us took part in a direct action . It was to be a peaceful response to the violence that had taken place the previous week . It was an odd sight . In the middle of nowhere , at least 30 cars parked along a two-lane road and perhaps a couple of hundred activists got out . At a junction stood two handfuls of deputies dressed all in black riot gear . We stood in a circle . As the U.S. Border Patrol SUVs pulled up , we all walked peacefully back to our cars and left . No more than 30 minutes had passed , but I thought that we had somehow made a point and that our actions were just another part of a long series of actions that tried to move us all forward . We left that afternoon , and three days later , we were home . It took some days to really process what we had seen and done . I am not sure about how I will now direct my efforts nor do I know what form my actions will take . But I no longer feel powerless . Standing Rock helped me understand that .
