Energy and Environment The company behind the Dakota Access pipeline is in another controversy By Steven Mufson Steven Mufson Reporter covering energy and other financial matters Email Bio Follow April 27 , 2017 The last Dakota Access Pipeline protesters march out of the Oceti Sakowin camp in February , just before the deadline set for evacuation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . Energy Transfer Partners notified the Ohio EPA that it spilled as much as 2 million gallons of drilling mud and cuttings from underground on April 13 , affecting an area 1,000 feet long and 500 feet wide south of the town of Navarre . And on April 14 , it spilled 50,000 gallons of the same fluids , affecting a smaller area of 30,000 square feet near Mifflin Township more than 100 miles away . Both incidents happened during the construction of the Rover pipeline , a 710-mile project that includes 207 sensitive water crossings . Energy Transfer was drilling horizontally under the crossings . Energy Transfer Partners has also been in the political limelight . Its chief executive Kelcy Warren has given heavily to Republican candidates and political action committees . Its board of directors included Rick Perry , who resigned Dec. 31 after he was nominated to become energy secretary . And Donald Trump was an investor , but his lists of stock holdings indicate that he sold his shares . The company has asserted that there is no danger from the spills . It said the chemical is used in household products such as sugar , honey , creams , lotions , laundry detergents and hand soaps . At the larger spill site , Energy Transfer Partners , has erected a barrier to keep the material from leaking into the nearby Tuscarawas River and has been using vacuums to clean up the spill , according to the state EPA . Lee said the agency would consider possible fines after the company finished cleaning up the area . Energy Transfer has told investors and customers desperate for more pipelines out of the gas-rich Marcellus shale region that much of the line would be in operation by July , and it would be fully in operation by November . FERC has not ruled on another pipeline that would serve producers in the Marcellus shale region . The regulator lacks commissioners to make up a quorum and can not approve new projects until President Trump nominates new members . Those members must also be confirmed by the Senate . Ohio lost the bulk of its wetlands more than a century ago as settlers and farmers drained and developed the Great Black Swamp that stretched across the northeast portion of the state . He said the spill affected less than half of the wetland at the site , and that most of the higher quality areas did not immediately appear to be affected .
