by Andreanne Catt Indigenous activists arriving at Standing Rock by canoe in September 2016 . Vic Camp , a member of the Oglala Nation , would greet us . Load your pipes and meet at the South Gate . Before the camps got bigger , the wakeup would only be played on the Sacred Fire Circle speakers . But as the camps grew , and thousands upon thousands came , announcers started driving around the camps with speakers in their trucks , so everyone would hear the call . The International Indigenous Youth Council camp would wake each other up in our council tipi , and make sure we were all at the morning prayers . We were all there for the Earth . For the People . For the water . I spent 5 months at Oceti Sakowin , from August to December 2016 . Everybody would gather at the South Gate every morning , and we would sing the Lakota pipe-loading song with the pipe carriers as they loaded their canupas , sacred pipes . We would smoke canupa , and pray with each other and for each other . We would pray for safety for ourselves and Mother Earth . Then we would head out to either halt construction for the day , or to pray where pipeline workers were desecrating the earth .

We gathered and shared laughs . Not much changed after the thousands came either , except that there was a lot more love and laughter , and then some . There was a sense of breathtaking goodness when you drove down into that river valley and saw the tipis and tents set up by the thousands . A layer of campfire smoke came every evening along with a murmur of songs coming from all the different camps of different nations . At the Sacred Fire Circle there was always another nation sharing a story or singing a song . There were elders sitting around sharing stories of the old times . You could walk up to any camp and share a meal . It was like the old days . We traded food for labor . We bartered songs for stories . We had round dances . We had socials . The young sat with the old and learned what it was to be an Indigenous person . We learned culture and traditions . We learned how to live in a good way with good intentions . We learned that we are people of the Earth and we need to go back to that . We lived like old souls . We were all there for the Earth . For the People . For the water . We were there for the future . It was a feeling I will never ever forget for as long as I am alive . Literally , there were Indigenous nations from across the Americas that came to be with each other again , just like we did before colonization . Pre-Columbian ways were being brought back and it was so goddamn amazing . Every day when we would come back to camp from wherever the construction was happening , there would be food and our family waiting for us . People would greet you , tell you that they love you . They would smudge you off with cedar and sage and offer you food , ask you how your day was . Some of us have never known what a real family felt like , some of us have never felt that kind of love before . No matter what kind of trauma went on that day , we had love back at camp waiting for us to return .

Over and over again , it got worse every time . More people got hurt , more people got arrested , the jails got colder , and there were more and more officers showing up . Sometimes they would tap into our radio conversations . So many things went undocumented , or were censored out through mainstream news outlets and social media sites . But no matter what was happening at the actions , we stayed unarmed , we stayed in prayer . This was a ceremony . It was a prayerful , traditional ceremony . We were in ceremony constantly . Every time you stepped foot in those camps , it was a ceremony . We prayed . We danced . We shared stories and songs . We shared culture and traditions . We were always in prayer . Always . Praying for the water . For the people . For life . This is why weapons and other explicit items were not allowed in the camps . Well , the same rules applied for the camps . That was a sacred place . It still is . The spirits were there guiding us , praying with us , singing with us , and loving with us . We had designated persons that held security positions , and they would be set up at the entrance -LRB- North Gate -RRB- and exit -LRB- South Gate -RRB- . At the entrance , they would ask why you were there and who you knew in camp . They would ask if you had any drugs , alcohol or weapons with you . Just like the Wounded Knee Occupation , it was a moment that created change . A fire was lit in Oceti Sakowin , a fire that every single person who was there , who watched , who supported , carries with them everywhere that they go . They spread that fire in the work that they do for our youth , for our Earth , for the world .
