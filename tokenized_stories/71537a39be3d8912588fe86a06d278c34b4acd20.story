Wampum is soft to the touch , lighter than stone and warms with your skin . Delicate , but not fragile , as with any semi-precious material , it should not be dropped onto hard surfaces . This wampum jewelry is meant to be worn day , night or indefinitely ; rain , shine or salty sea spray ; with your regalia , on the town or in the woods . With time the natural linen between the wampum will loosen as the piece begins to yield to your particular pattern of wear . These ocean animals are primarily used as food , their shells being discarded as waste -LRB- or found on the shores by beachcombers -RRB- . Quahogs and whelks are not farmed for the making of wampum . However , given that shells are an animal byproduct , and the fact that each finished piece is rubbed with beeswax to protect the natural materials , this jewelry can not be considered strictly vegan .
