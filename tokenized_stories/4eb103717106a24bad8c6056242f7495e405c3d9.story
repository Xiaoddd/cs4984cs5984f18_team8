Photo : Greenpeace Indian Country is n't the only one paying close attention to the new directives coming out of the White House . Judge James E. Boasberg scheduled a hearing next week to address the latest developments regarding the Dakota Access Pipeline . The move was unexpected because the parties were n't due to appear in court until sometime in February . But with Republican President Donald Trump now calling the shots , Boasberg wants to know how a memo issued on Tuesday impacts the litigation . He scheduled the hearing for 11 am on January 30 in the federal courthouse in Washington , D.C. Boasberg has been blindsided by the executive branch before so it 's familiar territory . He expressed shock last September when the Obama administration , in an extraordinary statement , put the final portion of the pipeline on hold after he spent a considerable amount of time and effort into the first major ruling in the case . It took 20 minutes for a senior official to apologize for the way things unfolded . The judge , who was nominated to serve by Barack Obama , was already anticipating change after Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States . By now everyone knows . Archambault noted that the Department of the Army already initiated an environmental impact statement , or EIS , for the final portion of the pipeline , less than a half-mile from his tribe 's reservation . A crucial government notice was published in the Federal Register just two days before the January 20 presidential inauguration . But Trump , in his memorandum , did not require his administration to consult with the tribe or any of the communities affected by the pipeline , whose final portion runs under the Missouri River , a waterway that serves millions of Americans . Instead , he opened the door for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to approve construction without addressing treaty rights , oil spills or other significant issues . Trump 's directive , on the other hand , embraces arguments made by the wealthy backers of the pipeline and their Republican supporters in Congress . It would allow Dakota Access to complete the costly project without having to rely on Judge Boasberg , who was n't planning to issue a decision on the firm 's cross-claim until sometime after a hearing in February . These activists deserve a big THANK YOU for their strength . Additionally , Trump said his Department of the Army , which will be coming under new leadership , might be able to withdraw the EIS notice that appeared in the Federal Register on January 18 . Boasberg had refused to block publication despite a last-minute request from Dakota Access . Beyond the new occupant of the White House , changes are underway in the handling of the case . An otherwise routine notice that was filed with the court on Tuesday bears the mark of a high-ranking , Trump-approved official with close ties to Sen. Jeff Sessions -LRB- R-Alabama -RRB- , who has been nominated to serve as Attorney General of the United States . Sessions has not yet been confirmed to the post .
