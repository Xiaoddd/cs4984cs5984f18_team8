LaRoy Kingsley , spokesman for the reservation casino in Yates , North Dakota , said this week that the venue has undertaken a public relations campaign to lure patrons put off by months of upheaval and clashes with law enforcement . In this case , the drop in casino business is outweighed by the long-term threat of an oil pipeline , said Jade Begay , spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network . The gaming downturn comes as an unexpected byproduct of the lengthy pipeline protest , which became an international cause celebre after kicking into high gear in August with the arrival of thousands to the makeshift camps near Cannon Ball , North Dakota . After months of protests and 700 arrests , the pipeline is expected to be completed by May 1 after securing a federal easement for the final 1,100-foot section under Lake Oahe . Tribal opponents seeking to derail the project are scheduled to appear Thursday in federal court . Reaching the casino has been made more difficult by road and bridge closures , but resentment over the disruption caused by the protests has fueled an anti-casino backlash among some of those living nearby in Bismarck and Mandan . Local residents have also been inconvenienced by protest-driven school and road closures , while activists have been blamed for incidents of vandalism and livestock deaths . Do not patronize their casino . The casino wound up sheltering activists who sought refuge from an early December blizzard , some of whom slept in sleeping bags in the common areas . Several Facebook commenters said they have switched to the resorts in Deadwood , South Dakota , as well as the 4 Bears Casino & Lodge in New Town , North Dakota , which is owned by the Three Affiliated Tribes . The end may be in sight . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has set a 2 p.m. Wednesday deadline for the few hundred remaining at the camps on federal land to evacuate , citing the imminent flooding danger . Mr. Kingsley , president of the marketing firm KK Bold , which represents the casino , acknowledged the frustration over the protests , but said he was confident customers from the Bismarck-Mandan area would return once the pipeline issue is resolved .
