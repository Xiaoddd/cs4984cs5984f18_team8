FILE PHOTO : A workman walks past steel pipe to be used in the oil pipeline construction of Kinder Morgan Canada 's Trans Mountain Expansion Project at a stockpile site in Kamloops , British Columbia , Canada May 29 , 2018 . Shares fell on the decision . The Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the National Energy Board -LRB- NEB -RRB- regulator wrongly narrowed its review of the project to exclude related tanker traffic . Additionally , the federal government failed to adequately consult First Nations , as required by law , it ruled . Trudeau has portrayed himself as a friend to aboriginal people and tried to build national support for a carbon emissions reduction plan , even while backing Trans Mountain to support the oil industry . He said the project is suspending construction . Canada has the option to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court but Morneau said the government had made no decisions and needs time to study the ruling . An appeal to the higher court would drag out the project at least another couple of years , Harrison said . The Trans Mountain expansion would nearly triple capacity on an existing line from Edmonton , Alberta , to a port in the Vancouver area for export . It was approved by the federal government in 2016 . Shares of Canadian oil producers fell in Toronto , led lower by heavy oil producers MEG Energy Corp and Athabasca Oil Corp , which are especially hurt by price discounts connected to clogged pipelines . Enbridge Inc is rebuilding Line 3 from Alberta to a hub in Wisconsin , while TransCanada Corp is considering construction of Keystone XL from Alberta to Nebraska .
