The decisions are once again touching off major disagreements with environmental groups and Native American communities that had opposed the construction of both pipelines , in large part on grounds that pipelines are inherently risky and dangerous because of frequent leaks . A recent report by CNBC is typical of the kind of coverage given to this topic , focusing only on pipeline spills , which , of course , do happen . The same piece noted that transporting oil by tractor-trailer involved the fewest number of accidents , but that experts noted the preference is to transport oil via pipelines . Miles and miles of pipelines are buried underground and thus are not subject to traffic , weather conditions and aging rail lines . That changes the dynamic considerably . transporting oil by rail is by far the most dangerous , but trucks present special dangers , too , in transporting an oil byproduct : gasoline ; nearly all gasoline sold in the U.S. travels at some point by truck . Pipelines are damaging , too , in that they can often leak for months or years without anyone knowing . The U.S. government estimates that 70 percent of all oil is transported via pipeline , and yet given that massive amount , multiple sources have noted that generally speaking , it is the safest , most efficient and cost-effective way to transport the very resource that powers our economy .
