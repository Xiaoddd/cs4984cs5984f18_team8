TransCanada , the foreign company behind the Keystone XL project , will attempt to use eminent domain to sue American landowners and seize their private property in order to pipe this dirty fuel across the U.S. for export . Despite his previous remarks concerning NAFTA , Trump did not address the company and its lawsuit before approving the project . Following months of national opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline , the Department of the Army ordered an environmental review of the project in December of 2016 . The pipeline was originally proposed to cross the Missouri River just above Bismarck , North Dakota , but after complaints , it was rerouted to cross the river along sacred Tribal grounds , less than a mile from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . Trump had invested in Energy Transfer , the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline . His spokespeople have claimed that he has since divested , but no proof has been presented . Donald Trump has been in office for four days and he 's already proving to be the dangerous threat to our climate we feared he would be . But , these pipelines are far from being in the clear . The millions of Americans and hundreds of Tribes that stood up to block them in the first place will not be silenced and will continue fighting these dirty and dangerous projects . Trump claims he 's a good businessman , yet he 's encouraging dirty , dangerous tar sands development when clean energy is growing faster , producing more jobs and has a real future . Trump claims he cares about the American people , but he 's allowing oil companies to steal and threaten their land by constructing dirty and dangerous pipelines through it . Trump claims he wants to protect people 's clean air and water , but he 's permitting a tar sand superhighway that will endanger both and hasten the climate crisis . The Keystone pipeline was rejected because it was not in the country 's interest and the environmental review of the Dakota Access Pipeline was ordered because of the threats it poses to the Standing Rock Sioux . Nothing has changed . These pipelines were a bad idea then and they 're a bad idea now . Simply put , Donald Trump is who we thought he is : a person who will sell off Americans ' property and Tribal rights , clean air and safe water to corporate polluters . The scorecard shows that 140 House members voted against chemical safeguards every time , while 149 members consistently voted for chemical safety protections . However , the action fund praised the lawmakers that bucked their party to vote for chemical safety , including Reps. voted for funding chemical reviews and against a farm bill that included pesticide safety loopholes . Florida Reps. A Preview of the People , Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule , two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Updated and reissued every five years , these guidelines are the nation 's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations . supply . These nominees will be well-known in their fields , and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers , academics and practitioners . part of the process is happening in real time . what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors . Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff , and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally . Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries . And here 's the first place you 'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition : rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected , USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first , soliciting public comments in the process . In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts , it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance . And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious . After the committee is announced in early 2019 , it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report . all appearances , the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs . though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable , plant-based diets have been all but stymied , there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle . Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance , including the meat industry , dairy industry , and sugar-sweetened beverage associations , as well as formula companies , which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers . -LRB- This may be happening in real-time , too . Exposure can be caused by contact , ingestion or inhalation . Short-term health effects can range from skin irritation and numbness to fever and headaches . Long-term exposure can lead to cancer , liver failure and sperm damage . is traditionally called blue-green algae is actually a class of microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria . Cyanobacteria can be toxic and can also produce various types of cyanotoxins that have different hazards . With their small , developing bodies , children are especially endangered by algae exposure . was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption . But it probably wo n't be the last , especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year . Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets . If you believe your pet may have been exposed , be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy , seizures , diarrhea or vomiting . And as climate change gets worse , the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks , creating a toxic feedback loop . The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish . Communities that struggle with regular , serious toxic algae outbreaks , like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie , can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation . The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth . The women were all non-smokers , had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies . Macrophages , which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body , protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles , such as bacteria and pollution particles . The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants . That 's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA 's Office of Inspector General -LRB- OIG -RRB- , the agency 's internal watchdog . EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement , and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was required to respond to the April 2017 petition within 90 days , but nearly 17 months have passed with no finding . more than 97,000 giraffes remain in the wild , and the species is gravely imperiled by habitat loss , civil unrest , hunting for meat and the international trade in bone carvings , skins and trophies . U.S. provides a large market for giraffe parts . for their six-foot-long necks , distinctive patterning and long eyelashes , giraffes have captured the human imagination for centuries . But so , under this definition , are multi-thousand-acre corporate entities using automated machinery to grow genetically engineered corn . Size of the farm is not a factor ; neither is the style of agriculture . A family farm may not even have a family that owns or works the land . issue with such a broad definition of family farming is primarily in the discourse . Aid is divvied up by revenue among family farmers , with additional programs going to some specialized farmers , like young or beginning farmers , organic farmers , and sustainable farmers . Canadians can legally buy and consume cannabis starting this Oct. 17 .
