It 's a nation that is far more solid in some ways -LRB- economics -RRB- and shakier in others -LRB- terrorist attacks -RRB- . We have gathered together dozens of statistics to show how the nation that Trump inherits -LRB- and the rest of the world -RRB- has changed over time . Economy Over the course of Obama 's presidency , one basic trend was clear across a variety of economic indicators : After he took office , things got worse before they got better . That 's not his fault , of course ; President Obama took office in the middle of a devastating recession , and he introduced a stimulus bill that helped pull the country out of its plunge . Since then , many areas of the economy have -LRB- slowly but surely -RRB- recovered nicely . However , many Americans remain permanently scarred by the recession . In addition , many structural problems -LRB- inequality , better incomes for men , whites and Asians than for other Americans -RRB- remain . Politics One big way that politics has changed under President Obama : His party has lost major ground . A majority in both houses of Congress helped him pass major legislation early in his first term , like the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank financial regulation reform law . But after that , Republicans gained ground , taking away Democrats ' hold on power . Democrats are now at their lowest point of power than at any time in nearly a century . However , there are some hints of trouble . There was a slight uptick in violent crime in 2016 , especially in some cities , which may or may not simply be a statistical blip . There has also been a recent uptick in the shooting deaths of police officers , though levels are still lower than they were in the 1990s . Immigration Trump 's immigration proposals created some of his biggest headlines during the campaign : building a wall along the southern border and a proposed ban on Muslims entering the U.S. made waves as being particularly restrictive policies . In addition , he railed against bringing in more refugees . That means these numbers could change considerably , depending on how much he gets his way on immigration policy . Foreign Policy As President Trump takes office , several dynamics from Obama 's presidency remain : Several thousand troops remain in Afghanistan and Iraq , although far fewer than when Obama came into office . But there are some new dynamics in the world that did n't exist when Obama took office : The Syrian civil war rages on and North Korea has conducted more nuclear tests and China has acquired or built additional islands in the South China Sea . One more big change , of course , is that the U.S. now has diplomatic relations with Cuba . It 's unclear just yet how Trump will manage that transition . Just this week , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the warmest global temperatures on record , the third record-breaking temperature in three years . Health Policy The big health policy story of Obama 's years was -LRB- duh -RRB- Obamacare , which helped drive the uninsured rate down to historic lows . Not only that , but the rate of cost growth has slowed down . Still , costs of premiums continue to grow , and to keep costs controlled for customers , companies put a lot more emphasis on high-deductible plans . Health Outcomes America continues to have some dismal stats in a few health areas . Also potentially troubling , data show life expectancy declined slightly in 2015 -LRB- though that may be an aberration from the upward trend -RRB- . However , there are a few bright spots , particularly among America 's youth : There has been a dramatic drop in smoking among high school seniors ; drug and alcohol abuse among teens is likewise at relatively low rates ; and childhood obesity appears to have leveled off .
