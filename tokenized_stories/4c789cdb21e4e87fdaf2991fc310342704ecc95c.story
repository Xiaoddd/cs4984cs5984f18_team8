Nov 28 , 2016 Standing Rock : A Moment of Clarity for Progressive Activists Earth-force meets money-force at Standing Rock . It scares me to think that I might have missed this . We get up at dawn . Four hundred people walk slowly in a light snow to the river by the camp . A teacher is talking . His headdress is a crisscrossing of long , narrow feathers . He is of the Havasupai , the people who live by the blue-green waterfalls at the bottom of the Grand Canyon . He calls out across the river . They run around in the mud and ice . There are 80 tribes here . Some say many more . The Earth-force is represented by this river and these eagles and these water protectors . We see the Money-force , standing over there on the bridge , just a couple hundred feet from the edge of long meadow of white tipis along the Cannonball River . The police look like a long row of Darth Vaders . In the environmental movement , we have yearned for the success of the Civil Rights and the Gender Rights movements . Few of us , though , face the police like the freedom-fighters of old . As environmentalists we fall back on soft confrontation dominated by data . Data is bloodless . Lobbying , position papers , endless graphics and electronic petitions might as well be abandoned in the age of Trump . I think of Wangari Maathai and her billion trees , Edward Abbey and Earth First and the dreams of freeing western rivers of their dams , Judi Bonds and Larry Gibson in their danger-filled opposition to mountaintop removal coal mining . The transformation of Standing Rock needs to be carried to many towns and cities . We need to press up against militarized and consumerized citizens at all points , and then convert them to life . Suddenly there is clarity for Earth activists . With extinction accelerating and climate changing , we must transform with the intensity that one associates with religion . We have the time if we take the time . Three movements in recent years galvanize us . In these citizen movements we did take the time , took the risk , and made a difference . Occupy Wall Street , Black Lives Matter and Standing Rock . The lesson in all of them , the thing they have in common is that so many changed their own individual lives in order that they could then change the rest of us . In all three , the spiritual element is carried by the act of living together , literally living together , without the supervision of the corporations or government . Here is where activists cared for each other and shared food , clothing and medicine . The force that upsets entrenched power the most is this compassionate living , this community in plain sight . Standing Rock offers us our moment of clarity . We can physically commit now . We must face the Devil . It is life and death . And living actively in a time of life and death must be a spiritual act . It should be you and I in service getting something done , in our daily life . Public caring and going through the quasi-religious transformation must go hand in hand . It was always so , from Pettis Bridge to Stonewall . When we are at peace with the Earth , we are able to hold our ground . The ground is the point . We hold our ground and the Earth holds us . In prison and in pain and in loss the Earth holds us . Give Reverend Billy Talen a round of applause . From a quick cheer to a standing ovation , clap to show how much you enjoyed this story . preacher with the Stop Shopping Choir .
