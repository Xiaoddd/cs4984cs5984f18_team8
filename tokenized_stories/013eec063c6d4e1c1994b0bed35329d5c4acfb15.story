Tom Stromme Buy Now Journalist Jenni Monet testifies Friday in Morton County during a trial on a criminal trespassing charge stemming from the Dakota Access Pipeline protests . A judge found Monet not guilty . Tom Stromme Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save A journalist arrested last year while covering the Dakota Access Pipeline protest was found not guilty Friday of criminal trespass after a daylong court trial . The camp along Highway 1806 was erected across from the main protest camp on property owned by the pipeline company , but participants in the protest claimed it as treaty land . A Morton County prosecutor argued Monet was guilty of criminal trespass for remaining on the property after law enforcement ordered the group to leave and return to the main protest camp . But defense attorney Edward Barnidge argued it was the state that treated Monet differently and gave her a different set of instructions than other participants . Monet testified that Lt. Tom Iverson , public information officer for the North Dakota Highway Patrol , asked her and three or four others who said they were journalists for their press credentials . Monet testified she took his order to mean she should stand behind police lines and she moved down the hill . She said she was the only credentialed journalist there and she believed Iverson had consented to allowing her to remain on site and report . Iverson testified he believes he clearly communicated to Monet she needed to leave the private property . During the trial , the court heard audio recorded by Monet that included sound of her footsteps in the snow walking away from the demonstration and her narration as she watched the mass arrests . Monet said she was then approached by a different officer who told her to walk or go to jail . She testified she was leaving the demonstration when two other officers stopped her and she was arrested . He added that Iverson could have arrested Monet and he did not . The officer who arrested Monet , former Beulah police officer Dustin Pekas , did not testify at the trial . Months after the protests , Pekas was charged with sexual assault and was convicted earlier this year . Sgt. The prosecution showed a video during the trial that showed officers in riot gear struggling with protesters , at times bringing them to the ground . The court trial also involved charges against another defendant , Julian Bear Runner , a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe who is running for election to become tribal chairman of the Pine Ridge Reservation . Schneider found Bear Runner guilty of criminal trespass and engaging in a riot , both misdemeanors . The judge ordered unsupervised probation with a deferred imposition , which means the convictions will not stay on his record if he completes the sentence . In an interview with Monet that was played during the trial , Bear Runner said he had an obligation to protect water that his relatives depend on , and he talked about the land being treaty territory .
