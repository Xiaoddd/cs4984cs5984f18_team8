But he made clear the government was resuming consideration for both pipelines , describing them as a potential boon to construction workers . According to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer , Trump directed agencies to approve it without delay -- and told agencies to expedite reviews and approvals for the remaining parts of the Dakota project . The president also signed three other orders related to pipeline construction , including one expediting the environmental permitting process for infrastructure projects and one directing the Commerce Department to maximize the use of U.S. steel . Looking ahead , Trump also announced he planned to nominate a justice for the Supreme Court next week , moving swiftly to try to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia . The president was summoning top senators to the White House later Tuesday to discuss his upcoming nomination . The moves on the pipelines had been widely expected , as Trump last year blasted his predecessor for effectively blocking the projects . Former President Obama stopped the proposed Keystone XL pipeline in late 2015 , declaring it would have undercut U.S. efforts to clinch a global climate change deal that was a centerpiece of his environmental legacy . The pipeline would run from Canada to Nebraska where it would connect to existing lines running to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast . The U.S. government needs to approve the pipeline because it would cross the nation 's northern border . Separately , late last year , the Army Corps of Engineers declined to allow construction of the Dakota Access pipeline under Lake Oahe , saying alternative routes needed to be considered . The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters say the project threatens drinking water and Native American sites , though Energy Transfer Partners , the company that wants to build the pipeline , disputes that and says the pipeline will be safe . The pipeline is to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois . The project had been the subject of fierce protests until the Army Corps of Engineers stepped in . The moves are likely to spark a new fight with environmentalists . Nothing has changed . He met Tuesday morning with representatives from the auto industry including GM and Ford , after meeting a day earlier , separately , with business and union leaders . The pipelines were among the few issues that put the Obama administration at odds with labor unions , some of whom have voiced hope the Trump administration can work with them to promote job creation . The pipeline orders follow earlier executive actions covering everything from trade to ObamaCare . Trump on Monday signed measures withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal , and instituting a hiring freeze for most of the federal government . He also ordered federal agencies on his first day in office to ease the regulatory burden of the Affordable Care Act . All rights reserved . All market data delayed 20 minutes .
