But layers of federal regulation - applying only to tribal lands - slowed them down for years , frightened away investors and cost them millions of dollars . Fort Berthold has since caught up to become one of the state 's most productive regions . But the initial delays undermined the MHA Nation 's sense of sovereignty and cost it badly needed revenue - an experience echoed in widespread complaints from other tribes and from energy firms , including some owned by Native Americans . Now , with U.S. President Donald Trump in office and oil prices rising , their frustration is fueling a renewed push to streamline approvals for drilling and mining on Indian reservations . Clearing regulatory hurdles for a single project on tribal lands can take as many as 50 steps , compared to a half dozen for oil wells on private property . The process can take three times as long to complete , according to tribal leaders , lawyers specializing in Native American issues , oil company executives and federal regulators . Officials at the agency overseeing that process - the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs -LRB- BIA -RRB- , a division of the Department of Interior - did not respond to repeated requests for comment . A spokesperson for Trump , who campaigned on a promise to slash energy regulation , declined a request for comment . The stakes are high . Native American reservations cover just 2 percent of the nation 's surface , but by some estimates contain as much as a fifth of all U.S. oil and gas reserves , along with vast coal stockpiles . Some tribes , for environmental or cultural reasons , have shunned the idea of developing these reserves , but many others want to tap the vast wealth beneath their homelands . A coalition of Native Americans appointed by Trump 's team to guide his Indian policy is researching proposals to make energy development easier on tribal lands - including the controversial idea of transferring them to private ownership . Representatives of the coalition did not respond to requests for comment . Congress , now firmly in Republican control after November 's election , also appears poised to act . The Indian affairs committees in the House and Senate are planning to re-introduce legislation this year that would streamline Bureau of Indian Affairs approval processes for tribal energy resource agreements , said Senator John Hoeven , a Republican from North Dakota and the new chair of the Senate Indian affairs committee . As Trump takes office , Wells Fargo website to aid employees vanishes U.S. Representative Raul Grijalva , a Democrat from Arizona , has opposed previous efforts to relax energy regulations on tribal lands , including a 2015 proposal he argues would have undermined public input before project approvals . That could weaken the legal arguments of residents impacted by environmental damage , he said in an interview . Wait , wait , wait The United States holds title to about 56 million acres of tribal lands , a vestige of the treaties made between 1778 and 1871 to end wars between indigenous Indians and European settlers . On Fort Berthold and other reservations , energy development requires a uniquely large number of easements and environmental permits , all of which must be approved by multiple federal agencies in a process overseen by the Bureau of Indian Affairs . Former North Dakota Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan - who was in office when the shale boom hit his state - said he understood that regulations can preserve Native American culture by keeping tribal lands environmentally sound and off the real estate market . But he also said he recognized them as a bottleneck . A 2015 report by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found that the problems went beyond the processes in law and regulations . Poor management by the Bureau of Indians Affairs has hindered energy development and resulted in lost revenue for tribes , the office concluded . The report also found that BIA offices were understaffed and had failed to keep adequate records . Dave Williams , CEO of MHA Nation-chartered energy company Missouri River Resources , said his firm has learned how to work around the regulatory process , but called it frustrating . Deregulation could also benefit private oil drillers including Devon Energy Corp , Occidental Petroleum , BP and others that have sought to develop leases on reservations through deals with tribal governments . Those companies did not respond to requests for comment . Burgum , tribe hold five-hour meeting at Standing Rock Tribal opposition , solidarity A substantial segment of the Native American community continues to oppose energy development on tribal land or would like to see it limited . The Northern Cheyenne in Montana , for example , live atop rich coal reserves but have shunned mining it because they fear it will bring pollution and undermine their way of life . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota has galvanized the U.S. environmental movement with its ongoing protests against a pipeline constructed near its reservation . But many tribes that supported the Standing Rock protests were motivated by protecting a tribe 's right to govern itself rather than by opposition to fossil fuel development . Among the tribes backing the protests were the Southern Ute Tribe in Colorado , the Ute Tribe of Utah , the Montana Crow and the Navajo Nation across the Southwest , all of which are pursuing energy development on their own lands . Tribes are also seeking to curtail what they call unjust taxation of energy projects on tribal lands by states in which their reservations are located . For many tribal leaders , the desire for more control over drilling projects is as much about self-determination as money . Back in Fort Berthold , MHA Nation Councilman Fred Fox said he felt it was time for Washington to hand more responsibility for tribal lands back to the tribes .
