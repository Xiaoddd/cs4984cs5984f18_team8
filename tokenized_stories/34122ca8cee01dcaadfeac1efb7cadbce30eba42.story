The company behind the pipeline , Energy Transfer Partners , has pushed on with the project , despite covering up its dangers and circumventing the law . Now , as the pipeline enters its final phase of construction in North Dakota , where most of the resistance to the pipeline is located , Energy Transfer Partners and its hired contractors have escalated tensions with protestors to protect the project as it enters its final phase . The State of North Dakota has also taken to protecting the pipeline . In one notable example , a filmmaker now faces up to 45 years in prison for only filming the protestors . Now , it appears that the native wildlife are also targets . Yesterday , Indigenous Rising Media released a video showing a large group of wild buffaloes being herded into an enclosure surrounded by 8 foot deep trenches and razor wire . Current reports from the area claim that the buffaloes are being held without food or water for days . The Animal Legal Defense Fund is currently investigating the situation and the legality of the treatment of these buffaloes . Herds of wild buffalo near the construction site captivated protestors when they appeared in a seeming show of support for the protestors during a confrontation between protestors and police . Buffaloes are sacred to the Sioux , serving as a symbol of the divine as buffaloes once provided abundant food and materials for the tribe . Due to this well-known spiritual significance of buffaloes , it is possible that their entrapment in these barbaric enclosures is intended to be used a psychological warfare against the Sioux and those that stand by them . With the pipeline nearing completion and Energy Transfer Partners getting more and more desperate , it appears they will do anything no matter how immoral or abhorrent it may be .
