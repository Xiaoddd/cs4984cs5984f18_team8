A U.S. indigenous people 's movement to keep fossil fuels in the ground is growing , as is work to implement renewable energy solutions The first few months under the Trump administration seem on track to wreck Mother Earth as we know her . From slashing environmental protections to granting permits for the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines , Trump is clearing the way for polluters to increase profits while ignoring the climate crisis . We will put forth a vision of the world we need , grounded in the just transition to a 100 percent renewable energy economy that works for all , and demand that elected officials take action . This will be a flashpoint of the powerful work of communities at the frontlines of climate impacts and environmental racism , including indigenous peoples defending sacred lands and waters from the fossil fuel industry . This defense began before the Trump administration , garnering global attention as Native Nations and tribal grassroots led a movement to stop the Dakota Access pipeline . Millions signed petitions , joined international days of action , and put their bodies on the line at Standing Rock . Individuals and communities worldwide have divested billions from banks and financiers backing the pipeline . This peaceful resistance of prayer built collective power and carried the critical message that the rights of indigenous peoples and climate justice are inseparable . From Alaska Natives in the Arctic losing salmon populations to warming waters , to the Houma tribal members along the Gulf Coast being forced from their land by rising seas , the fate of our climate , of indigenous peoples , and of all life , is tied together . This message is not new , but through this indigenous-led fight , it has reached farther than ever before . A spark was ignited : now pipelines everywhere are met with resistance by Water Protectors , indigenous-led encampments , and creative tactics to stop these projects in their tracks . Even as oil begins flowing through the Dakota Access pipeline , fights are ramping up against the resurrected Keystone XL pipeline in the Midwest , the Bayou Bridge pipeline in Louisiana , and the Atlantic Coast pipeline along the eastern seaboard , to name a few . Because of these movements , awareness of Native-led resistance to fossil fuels has grown among the public , in the media , and within the offices of lawmakers . As the movement to keep fossil fuels in the ground grows , so does the work to implement renewable energy solutions that tackle climate change , cut emissions at the source , and give all communities ownership of the power they use as part of the transition to energy democracy . In Nevada , the Moapa Band of Paiutes - subjected to half a century of toxic coal waste - launched a solar power project while organizing to shutter a nearby coal station . This indigenous-led work will find no support from the Trump administration , which is threatening to privatize and fast-track Native lands for fossil fuel extraction that will only contaminate the land , air and the water . Within his first 100 days as president , Trump has filled his ranks with climate deniers , slashed the Environmental Protection Agency , and attempted to revoke rules governing polluters . Meanwhile , no effort has been made to have meaningful consultation with Native Nations or recognize their inherent rights to exist as sovereign nations . To make the changes needed for a safe climate , and to support those underway , we must wield our greatest tool : people power .
