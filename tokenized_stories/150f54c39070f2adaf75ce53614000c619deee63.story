ETP , Energy Transfer Partners , says the pipeline will create some 8,000-12,000 jobs . However , transporting all that oil is never a good thing . Not only would this pipeline affect this tribe , but it would also contaminate the Missouri River , which supplies water to many cities . The protests stopped construction in August , the tribe saying they never agreed to allow ETP to build a pipeline in their home . The tribe has even called the UN Human Rights council . Barack Obama has done little to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline , as it is continuing its construction on privately owned land only . The protesters now fear with Donald Trump being elected president , the Dakota Access Pipeline will be able to be continued to be built , despite their enormous efforts to save the beautiful lands . The CEO of ETP , Kelcy Warren , has come out recently and said a Donald Trump presidency means there is a one hundred percent guarantee the pipeline will be finished . Although , Trump has not made any comments on his stance with the Dakota Access Pipeline , he shared his stance on the controversial Keystone Pipeline , which Barack Obama rejected in 2015 . The Dakota Access Pipeline may bring more jobs to the USA , but the damage it will do is irreversible . It will ruin reservations , homes , and our planet .
