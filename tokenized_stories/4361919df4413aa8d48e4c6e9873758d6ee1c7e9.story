An administrative law judge at the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission -LRB- PUC -RRB- issued her emergency order on Thursday in response to a petition filed by state Sen. Andrew Dinniman -LRB- D -RRB- , who requested a halt to work on the pipeline project in West Whiteland Township , Pennsylvania , a part of Chester County that he represents . Sunoco Pipeline LP , a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners , owns the existing Mariner East pipeline , an eight-inch-diameter pipeline built in the 1930s . The company also is building two additional natural gas liquids pipelines located along the same route . Mariner East 2 is a proposed 20-inch-diameter pipeline and Mariner East 2X is a proposed 16-inch-diameter pipeline . The natural gas industry is finding the Marcellus and Utica shales in southwestern Pennsylvania rich with natural gas liquids . Wider-diameter pipelines are needed to get all of the natural gas liquids to terminals where they can then be shipped to overseas petrochemical plants . She also noted that water supplies have already been damaged in West Whiteland Township . Last November , Energy Transfer Partners also faced a separate lawsuit from the State of Ohio against Rover Pipeline , operated and majority-owned by the pipeline company , for allegedly polluting state waterways as it constructs a 713-mile pipeline that would transport natural gas from southwest Pennsylvania across Ohio and into Michigan and Ontario , Canada . Advertisement The Mariner East pipeline shutdown comes less than a month after the PUC lifted an emergency order and allowed Sunoco to restart operations on the pipeline . When it allowed operations to resume in early May , the PUC said construction of the two new pipelines posed no threat to the integrity of the existing Mariner East pipeline and that it was safe to resume operations . The emergency order will remain in place until the conditions detailed in the order are met or until the PUC takes other action , commission spokesperson Nils Hagen-Frederiksen said in an email to ThinkProgress . Advertisement Parties wishing to dispute the order have seven days from the issuance of the order to file briefs with the PUC , and the commission has 30 days from the date of the order to act , Frederiksen said . The existing Mariner East pipeline delivers natural gas liquids extracted in the Marcellus Shale to the Marcus Hook terminal near Philadelphia . From the terminal , the natural gas liquids are exported by ship to a petrochemical plant in Norway .
