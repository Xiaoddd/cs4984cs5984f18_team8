CPJ has documented at least 10 journalists still facing charges in relation to the protests , including nine in Morton County . Two of the journalists -- Christopher Schiano and Nicholas Georgiades , from the nonprofit media collective Unicorn Riot -- face trial on misdemeanor criminal trespass charges today and tomorrow respectively . Police arrested them September 13 while Schiano and Georgiades were filming protesters who had locked themselves to construction equipment . Other journalists still facing charges include freelancers Sara LeFleur-Vetter , Jihan Hafiz , Adam Schrader , Jenifer Stum , and Jenni Monet , and Lorenzo Serna , from Unicorn Riot , and Myron Dewey , from Digital Smoke Signals . On February 28 , five press freedom and journalist groups , including CPJ , sent a letter to your office asking that it return equipment to freelance photographers Tonita Cervantes and Tracie Williams , who were arrested last week and still face charges . We are glad to hear that their equipment was returned to them yesterday . At least five of the journalists facing charges , with whom CPJ spoke , said they were arrested despite attempting to follow police orders to disperse or remain behind police lines . Monet said in a column for Columbia Journalism Review that she was arrested while following an officer 's order to leave an area where protests were taking place . Most of the journalists facing charges are freelancers or from smaller , independent outlets that lack the resources to pay attorney fees or mount a public defense for the reporters . The fact that these journalists do not have the backing of large media companies may make them more vulnerable -- but it does not lessen their First Amendment protected right to report the news . Journalists have an important role in documenting incidents in the public interest , including instances of civil disobedience and law enforcement operations . This role often draws them near to the scene of action . Trespass and rioting laws should require criminal intent , and journalists who are simply doing their job should not face criminal charges . Prosecutors and the courts often use discretion to avoid charging journalists arrested at protests . There is recent precedent for this : the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia announced that it dropped charges against at least six reporters who were swept up in arrests on inauguration day in Washington D.C. . We are concerned that the arrests of journalists can have a chilling effect on press freedom and discourage media from covering stories that are in the public interest . In the case of Standing Rock , several journalists told CPJ they have shied away from covering protests or getting too close to police action to avoid being arrested again . While we acknowledge that journalists are sometimes temporarily detained in emergency situations , a case where several journalists face criminal charges for simply doing their job is unacceptable .
