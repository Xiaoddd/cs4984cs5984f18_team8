Thousands of Water Protectors , people from all over the world , have gathered in and around the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation to stop its descent , and terminate the Black Snake . The Missouri River ravaged Omaha , laying waste to the city with frightening efficiency in 1943 . In response , Congress passed the Flood Control Act of 1944 , commonly known now as Pick-Sloan . The Army Corps of Engineers and Board of Reclamation were assigned responsibility to enact Pick-Sloan and took control of the river . Even for those living right on the Missouri River , the name Pick-Sloan is obscure but no legislation changed the nature of the Missouri more . The government took the opportunity to put a wider , more comprehensive plan covering other commercial and safety aspects of the river in place . Pick-Sloan assigned the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation the task of caring for eight categories related to the river : flood control , navigation , irrigation , power , water supply , recreation , fish and wildlife , and water quality . The Army Corps of Engineers created a gaggle of hydroelectric dams , including Lake Oahe on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . Lake Oahe Reservoir and hydroelectric dam was created when the Army Corps of Engineers flooded the fertile river lands and displaced a village on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in 1960 . Bison died . Burial grounds were submerged . Homes were lost . Standing Rock encampment . Photo by Mark Charles Just a few miles up the river from Lake Oahe Reservoir are the Water Protector camps . On a hill just above the largest of the Water Protector camps , Oceti Sakowin , the pipeline the pipeline is near completion . Energy Transfer Company , the owner of the Bakken Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- , is just waiting for a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to drill under the river and place their pipeline under the river . Wild Water : Flooding is prevented by the Army Corps of Engineers by controlling the flow of water streaming down to Omaha through a series of flood planes , levies , and dams . A tragic , and possibly prophetic event occurred in Michigan in 2010 . Black sludge crept from a pipeline for 17 hours before anyone knew it was escaping . Before the spill was confirmed and contained , the million gallons of oil had taken over 40 miles of the river . It was called the Dilbert Disaster . The crew monitoring the pipeline near the Kalamazoo River had ignored several pressure warnings , allowing the oil to flow freely into the river . A hydroelectric dam down river was used to contain the spill . Clumps of oil were still being pulled from the water five years after the spill . The lessons of the Dilbert speak directly to the factors which The Army Corps of Engineers must consider for the Missouri River . The Oahe Reservoir and flood plains , act to stem the tide of water flowing down the river . Flood plains around the river swell as the water builds up during heavy rains , dissipating the water pressure and increasing the width of the river . The dam would be unable to continue to hold both the contaminated water and rushing water from the storm in the event of an oil spill during heavy rain . The flood plains would have to be utilized . Contaminated water would overflow onto the flood plains , greatly increasing the land mass affected by the spill . Even a minor flow onto the flood plains would have a major catastrophic effect on the wildlife . Animals , plants , and vulnerable soils which would otherwise not be affected would be contaminated . Burrows of subterranean plains creatures ; rodents , snakes , ground dwelling birds , and insects ; would fill with contaminated water , creating vertical contamination . Each vertical tunnel would also have horizontal contamination from soil moisture absorption . Contaminated water could seep several feet underground and have lateral permeation of millions of cubic feet of soil . The animals which survived direct contact with contaminated water would themselves become contaminated . The grass which did not die from the flood or polluted would become begrimed . Animals which eat the grass or the animals in the grass would experience ruinous food shortages from the die off . A large portion of the food left would be contaminated . The contamination of small animals would hit birds of prey , snakes , and coyotes hard . Deer and rodents would be vulnerable to the loss of grasslands . The entire ecosystem of the prairie flat lands acting as flood plains could collapse . Normal protocols for removing oil from water and land would be insufficient , as the spill would not be on the land or on the water but soaked into the topsoil , and subsoil . Using Lake Oahe dam would mean ecological ruin . It is nearly 150 miles away . It would mean a leak went undetected or unstopped for 25 hours . It would require complete failures of both human and automated systems . However , evidence is mounting that the leak detection devices do not work . A Nexin Energy pipeline burst in Alberta in July 2015 , sending 1.3 million gallons . The pipeline was less than one year old . Leak alarms failed to alert the company of the spill . InsideClimateNews.org studied 10 years of pipeline spill information . The gross majority of spills are detected by people who happen to come across the spill , be them average citizens or oil workers . Nexin Energy could not even tell the public how long the Alberta pipeline was leaking because of the automated warning systems failure . The Center for Biological Diversity studied the numbers significant of pipeline incidents between 1986 and 2013 . In 2013 North Dakota had one of the largest oil pipeline spills . A wheat field was deluged by 840,000 gallons of crude when lightening hit a pipe . Unlike in Alberta and Kalamazoo , the Missouri River is the primary water source for millions of people , including the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . The reservation starts approximately just 2,400 feet from where the Bakken Dakota Access Pipeline is proposed to dip under the Missouri River . The time it would take to confirm a spill under the best conditions would probably be long enough for an oil spill to reach the reservation . Many states and area farms rely on the water from the Missouri to irrigate their farms . Should oil slip into the irrigation lines , the food supply could become interrupted for years as farms suffer from oil contamination . Lake Oahe offers reservation members and members of the public numerous recreational opportunities ; including swimming , boating , camping , and wild life observation . Lake Oahe provides hydroelectric power for the surrounding area . Any interruptions in the creation or distribution of power because of a spill would diminish the welfare of the people who rely on it for power . Standing Rock Sioux preserved their right to the bottom of the Missouri River during the imminent domain acquisition outlined in Pick-Sloan . Winters Waters : In June 2016 , the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe , whose reservation is on the Missouri River south of Standing Rock Sioux Reservation , argued in a lawsuit that the federal government squandered their water rights to the Missouri River . The Supreme Court was asked to rule on the tribal sovereignty of water in a reservation in Winters v. United States . They ruled that because the goal of reservations was independent , self-sufficient native communities and water is essential to self-sufficiency , tribes must have secure , ample access to water . The ruling established reserved water rights . Reserved water rights apply to water and bodies of water in and directly around the reservations . Winters allocated each tribe enough water to sufficiently irrigate each irrigable acre on the reservation . Impact : Energy Transfer Company , the company which owns the Dakota Access Pipeline , prepared an environmental impact assessment for the Army Corps of Engineers . However , the environmental impact assessment failed to address the requirements of Pick-Sloan or the Winters ruling . Environmental impact assessments are required to explain the impact of a project on humans , flora , fauna , and the land . The Missouri River is the primary water source for the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . Any contamination would shut down the majority of their guaranteed Winters water . No alternatives for the acquisition of Winters water in the event of a spill or contamination incident has been provided by Energy Transfer Company or The Army Corps of Engineers . The Supreme Court guarantee of sufficient irrigable water for the reservation is a human impact requirement which is not addressed in the environmental impact assessment prepared by Energy Transfer Company . Given the geography , topography , and infrastructure , failing to address the eight federal agency requirements in Pick-Sloan means the Environmental Impact Assessment has failed to meet the flora , fauna , and human impact requirements of the an Environmental Impact Assessment . Should the Army Corps of Engineers fail to require a full environmental impact statement , they are permitting their known legal duties to go unaddressed . The Army Corps of Engineers is now faced with the full weight of their legal charge for the health and care of the river . They must decide if issuing a permit to drill under the Missouri River will be a direct violation of the statutory requirements for protecting the river and of the Winter water requirements . The Water Protectors are waiting to learn if the Army Corps of Engineers will honor their legal duties under Pick-Sloan and pipe the snake way , or if it will charm it under the water . IT WILL POLUTE THE WATER SOURCE , FOR HUMANS , ANIMALS FARMING , WHY DESTORY THE WATER , PEOPLE TAKE SHOWERS , COOK , DRINK , IT WILL BREAK NO MATTER WHAT Patricia D.
