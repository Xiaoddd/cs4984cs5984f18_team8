The Alberta oil sands lie under thousands of square kilometers of boreal forest , wetland and muskeg . Bitumen is a viscous substance found in small concentrations amid the rock and soil . It is either mined out from huge open pits , or pumped out through in situ production , injecting hot water deep into the ground to loosen it . Either way , the resulting product is highly polluting , very expensive to produce and of low value . Bitumen is a solid . To be refined , bitumen must undergo costly upgrading . Before the 2008 global financial crisis , there were upgraders and refineries being planned . But when the recession hit , those investments , along with any new oil sands mines , retreated . When the economy recovered , oil sands expansion came back . But not the upgraders and refineries . Instead , for the first time , industry began to promote pipelines . Keystone was the first pipeline proposed to run north-south to take Canadian bitumen to other countries for processing . Since bitumen is a solid , there is nothing logical about proposing to move it through a pipeline . Stirring in fossil fuel condensate -LRB- essentially naptha -RRB- creates a mixture sufficiently liquid to flow through a pipeline , without the expense of upgrading it to synthetic crude . The resulting mix of condensate -LRB- called diluent -RRB- and bitumen is called dilbit . And it is very challenging to clean up . The 2010 dilbit spill in Kalamazoo , Michigan was the first time regulators realized dilbit behaved very differently than conventional crude . The diluent is highly toxic and volatile . Diluent separated from bitumen and bitumen sank to the river bottom . By the 2011 election , pipelines had become a political issue . Former prime minister , Conservative Stephen Harper , an Albertan who stood four-square for fossil fuel development , opposed any pipelines heading to the British Columbia coastline . Justin Trudeau announced support for the Kinder Morgan pipeline . In doing so , he violated election promises to respect indigenous rights Within months of that election , difficulties in gaining US permits for Keystone led to an entirely new position . In 2013 , Texas-based Kinder Morgan asked to build a second pipeline more or less along the lines of the Transmountain pipeline purchased from a Canadian company from Alberta to Burnaby , not far from Vancouver BC . It would increase tanker traffic , loaded with dilbit , seven-fold . To grease the gears for pipeline approval , Harper gutted environmental laws . The resulting environmental review of the Kinder Morgan expansion was the worst in Canadian history . No longer reviewed by our environmental assessment agency , the pipeline was before the National Energy Board . Intervenor rights , such as cross examination of industry witnesses , were eliminated . In the 2015 election campaign , Justin Trudeau pledged that no project could be approved based on such an inadequate process . Trudeau promised evidence-based decisions , respect for indigenous rights , the end to fossil fuel subsidies and an aggressive climate plan . In 2016 , the Liberals turned down the Enbridge pipeline due to the court ruling the previous government violated indigenous rights . Simultaneously , Trudeau announced support for the Kinder Morgan pipeline . In doing so , he violated election promises to respect indigenous rights , to base decisions on evidence , and to pursue real climate action . Having approved Kinder Morgan , he and his ministers became increasingly pro-pipeline . Meanwhile fifteen different court cases were working through the federal court of appeal . The new BC government raised its concerns about the threat of a dilbit spill and to survival of the endangered southern resident killer whales . In March , I was one of the several hundred people arrested protesting against the Kinder Morgan pipeline . As opposition built in British Columbia , Trudeau insisted the pipeline was in the national interest and must be built . On 8 April , Kinder Morgan upped the ante and demanded the federal government remove the uncertainty created by all the court challenges to the project by 31 May . Astonishingly , the government announced on 29 May that the government of Canada will buy the existing Transmountain pipeline . As well , the Trudeau administration says it will get the controversial expansion pipeline built . We await the court decisions . This battle is a long way from over .
