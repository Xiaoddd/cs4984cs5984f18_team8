While I could have opted for a direct approach , and may still do so , it has been my experience of late , that transparency is better served by the people , than by the government . Please allow me to tell you a little bit about myself . On December 8 , 1986 I took my own Oath of Enlistment at the Jacksonville , FL MEPS Center . In 1994 I went onto active reserve status with a unit out of Charleston , AFB where I continued my proud military service until December of 1999 , when my then husband was assigned to Japan . At that time I was placed back on inactive reserve status until such time as my reserve enlistment came to an honorable end during our tour of duty in Japan . All total , I have 12 years of combined honorable service in the United States Air Force . Which is why I feel compelled to write to you . As Adjutant General of the North Dakota National Guard , you are essentially its commander . In this capacity , you are ultimately responsible for the actions and behaviors of each and every member of the North Dakota National Guard while he or she is on active duty . This must certainly be a rather tremendous responsibility for you . Similar to how the President of the United States is Commander in Chief of the Army during times of war , the Governor of North Dakota is Commander in Chief of the ND National Guard at such times that he has declared a State of Emergency , and then subsequently called it into active service . Now that Governor Dalrymple has taken such actions , it would seem to me that you are now beholden to answer to him . Yet , there is something that has been bothering me since the National Guard in North Dakota was initially pressed into service along the highways leading to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and the various camps nearby . At first it appeared that the Guardsmen were only performing highway checkpoint operations . While this may seem innocuous enough on the surface , these same Guardsmen were seen in various videos to be working in tandem with local law enforcement personnel . The law enforcement officers were seen questioning drivers and passengers , taking photographs of same , as well as photographs of license plates and the contents of the vehicles . To put it succinctly , they were violating the Fourth Amendment of individuals , meaning that your personnel were violating the Constitution by association . This brings me to recent events . While highway checkpoints one and two months ago are bad enough , just this week we have a contingency of law enforcement officers from Morton County , and at least seven other State jurisdictions , move in to set up a forward operation base very near the new camp . Your National Guard personnel arevwith this law enforcement contingency . I know that you know that hooding is against international law . demonstrates that you are no neophyte in the Army . While I was enlisted , one thing that was impressed upon me and my fellow Airmen was the rather important duty of following orders . However , a very important caveat to this was that all orders must be lawful . As such , it was equally important that we were duty bound to NOT follow unlawful orders . Yes , it can be difficult and potentially career ending to defy an unlawful order . Sir , with all due respect to you , I suggest that you are following unlawful and Unconstitutional orders from Governor Dalrymple . Major General Dohrmann , I beg you to reflect upon your Oath of Office . Please defy the unlawful and Unconstitutional orders from Governor Dalrymple and pull your Guardsmen out of the Standing Rock arena . If not , at the very least place them along the lines of the land under the care , custody and control of the Army Corps of Engineers to assure the Lakota Nation and the United States that Dakota Access LLC will NOT be allowed to drill under Lake Oahe until such time as further review and negotiations with all tribal leaders has been completed . Give Constitutional Truth a round of applause . From a quick cheer to a standing ovation , clap to show how much you enjoyed this story . 6 BlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Constitutional Truth I 'm Constitutional Truth on Instagram and Facebook - check out my page .
