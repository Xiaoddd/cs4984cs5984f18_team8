With the help of his mom , he wrote a children 's book about his experience . In August , the Oceti Sakowin Camp was setting up while more Indigenous people from across North America began to gather at the site where the Dakota Access Pipeline was to pass through the traditional territory of the Sioux . ` There were a lot of tents and teepees at the camp . There was a school and a medical tent , ' says Aslan of Oceti Sakowin , the largest camp at Standing Rock . When the family returned in October it was a different scene . Kelly Tudor says there were many children at Standing Rock and the community kept them safe . -LRB- Submitted by Kelly Tudor -RRB- The children spent time at the Defender of the Water school , which was set up to look after the children of the camp while their parents were at the pipeline site or volunteering their efforts in other areas . Even as the conflict escalated , his mom Kelly Tudor said the camp where the children were kept was a safe place . Tudor , 33 , works as an emergency medical technician and was volunteering in the medical tent at the camp . She is a third generation American Indian Movement member and the representative for Indiana . Her family is originally from southern Texas , and she said she has raised her children as traditionally as possible in lines with her Lipan Apache culture , which has n't always been easy living in Indianapolis . When she heard the call out for support at Standing Rock , she said she did n't hesitate to pack up the kids and drive 17 hours to the site . She said taking the children to Standing Rock helped bring them closer to other Indigenous people . Aslan Tudor at age 8 at the Standing Rock Reservation in South Dakota . -LRB- Submitted by Kelly Tudor -RRB- After having had time to reflect on the experience , Aslan and his mother realized there were no resources for children about what happened at Standing Rock . Aslan 's mom typed out his words as he dictated and assisted with grammar and syntax . In just under a week , they were looking at a 12-page children 's book . The book was released Aug. 8 . Aslan said he hopes to write more in the future . She wants to contribute to turning the page on how Indigenous peoples are covered within Canadian media .
