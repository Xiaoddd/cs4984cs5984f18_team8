It will run under a lake that the Standing Rock Sioux use as a source of drinking water , meaning any potential leaks will contaminate it . At the symbolic center in Standing Rock , protesters aiming to halt construction continue to clash with police . Meanwhile the CEO of Dakota Access , the firm behind the pipeline who believe it will bring jobs and is a safer way to transport oil then rail , has maintained that it will be built and has now gone to a federal court to get a final permit so it can be completed . Bentel wants to give away these signs to as many protesters as possible and also show them how to make them in the face of what appears to be increasing violence against the protesters .

Bentel does n't want to start fires but instead wants to use the mirrored signs as a disruptive technique . The signs , along with having slogans written on them , will focus and aim light . Bentel also believes they could be used to send non-electronic messages , heliograph-style , across the plains . Watch the video below to learn more about the project .
