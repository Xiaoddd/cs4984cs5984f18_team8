Winds light and variable . I am on the edge of the encampment , looking out across the prairie . A full super-moon rises over the Cannonball , washing out the stars . To the north is high ground , commanded by a line of bright generator-powered floodlights . That is the perimeter of the Dakota Access Pipeline construction site . The call is echoed back from among the tipis , tents , yurts , and other improvised structures . That child 's family is dug in for the North Dakota winter . Their encampment is surrounded by a circle of steel fencing , the kind you 'd make a temporary corral of , lashed with tarps as a windbreak . The weather has been sunny and unseasonably warm , with highs in the 50s . Many additional campers have driven in from all across America . License plates from New York and Oregon , Texas and Minnesota . The flags of many Native American tribes fly , marking a central avenue . We share a campfire with our neighbors . A young white guy , an acupuncturist from St. Paul . A Southern Cheyenne photojournalist from Trinidad , Colorado . A woman born in China , who teaches English poetry in a college , and who travels the world collecting Buddhist-style prayer flags from rivers around the world , from people living near the Yangtze and the Ganges , and the Ohio and Illinois . She 's strung those flags from brush near our campsite . I have come to see and listen , and to bear gifts . When I announced my intention , the response was generous and humbling . People started giving me money and food . I bore a cargo of goods and their love . I bought propane , an indoor heater , and a lot of canned goods . Peas , corn , beans , tuna , noodles , sausages , and four cases of SPAM . I only eat SPAM every 20 years , but the next morning I had the stuff with oatmeal for breakfast . I will leave behind the new down bag I purchased . More white than native people are camping , though most of them will not stay the winter . White people work the kitchens supplying food for free , and sort mounds of clothing and gear donations . I do n't go to the confrontation site where people are arrested . People in camp are quiet and generous and gentle . Drinking , drugs , and guns are not allowed . It 's not a festival atmosphere . I walked across camp in the moonlight , in my new Carhartt jacket too heavy for Texas winters . A group of Native Americans paraded , softly beating a drum and singing . White people walked behind them . I joined them . We walked about a mile to the riverside , where there was a huge bonfire , and more singing . No speeches . It was the quietest walk with a couple thousand people I 've ever taken . Looked at from one perspective , there 's a logic to the pipeline being built . But the Native Americans are being asked to bear risks and suffer violation with no benefit . It 's a sad old story . For white people , the western expansion is an epic ; for the native peoples , a tragedy . I do n't really expect the American Indians to prevail . But I share their love for Creation , So I 've decided to make the drive , to offer food and warmth , and to stand for a while with them at Standing Rock .
