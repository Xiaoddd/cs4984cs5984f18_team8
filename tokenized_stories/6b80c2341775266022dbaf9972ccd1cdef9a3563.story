In turn , the government has gone to new lengths to suppress and criminalize this brand of activism . Here 's how . One FBI informant even pursued a romantic relationship with an indigenous activist . We first saw this after the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson . In 2016 at Standing Rock , the FAA instituted no-fly zones during some of the most violent crackdowns . These bills are designed to intimidate journalists and whistleblowers from investigating conditions that threaten food safety or abuse animals . The government has sought constitutionally protected Facebook activity . In March 2017 , a county prosecutor sought a search warrant for a NoDAPL Facebook group . We intervened , but the county prosecutor eventually reached out to federal officials who helped them gain access . The Constitution , however , is on the side of the protesters .
