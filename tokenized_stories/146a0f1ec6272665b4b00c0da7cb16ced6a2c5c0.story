Right : Melina Laboucan Massimo at the 10,000-person march in resistance to the same pipeline . Yesterday , ten activists peacefully blocked the entrance to a Kinder Morgan construction site in Coast Salish territory near Vancouver , Canada for several hours . Their bold action further delayed the construction of a tar sands oil pipeline that would violate Indigenous rights , threaten clean air and water for thousands of people , and contribute to global climate change . The singing has begun . started in 1971 to protect the ocean from the same types of threats Kinder Morgan is trying to bring to it today . We fought then , and we fight now . Just over a week ago , more than 10,000 people joined a march and rally in solidarity with Indigenous communities to send a clear message of resistance to the oil industry . Now is the time to join in solidarity with Indigenous land defenders : sign on to voice your resistance to Kinder Morgan and all tar sands oil pipelines today . Supporters at the Indigenous-led March 19 blockade of a Kinder Morgan pipeline construction site in British Columbia , Canada . This stupid business plan is an insult to the intelligence of thinking British Columbians . Kinder must think British Columbians are a bunch of GOP dimwits . Dump KM , to save beautiful BC .
