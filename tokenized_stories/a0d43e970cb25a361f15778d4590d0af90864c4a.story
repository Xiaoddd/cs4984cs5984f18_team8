It was supposed to cross the Missouri River north of Bismarck , ND . Having an oil pipe cross a river raises a very real risk of water contamination . It still threatens the water supply of the entire sovereign nation of Standing Rock Sioux . Last night , police injured hundreds of protesters with tear gas , rubber bullets , and water hoses sprayed in freezing temperatures . They call on the Department of Justice to investigate and intervene . There is also a long history of broken treaties having to do with the presence of non-Sioux settlers , miners and companies on the land where the pipeline is being built . And indigenous people from around the world have come to join them , as have busloads of volunteers , according to a neighbor of mine who has been out to visit the protest camps . Supporting the Water Protectors NOW The water protectors need funds and winterization supplies . And organizations like 350.org are helping indigenous leaders assemble large groups of supporters in locations around the country . There were 300 rallies in various locations last week . My little guy and I attended one near us , and many other families were there , too . I was glad to have brought kiddo out to his first rally in this sensitive time . Most of the cars driving by were honking in support . joining in Other things we can do are to sign petitions calling on President Obama , the Army Corps of Engineers , and the Department of Justice to put a stop to the pipeline project . There is hope . USA Today reports on four ways the pipeline could be stopped , including one scenario in which their customers cancel contracts because the project is not completed by January 1st , 2017 . It may make companies less likely to attempt such fraught projects in the future . We got rid of our oil furnace and are heating our home only with an electric heat pump now . But we can all set some goals for finding ways to use less oil . In terms of divestment , I broke up with the big banks long ago in terms of everyday banking . I 'm Julia .
