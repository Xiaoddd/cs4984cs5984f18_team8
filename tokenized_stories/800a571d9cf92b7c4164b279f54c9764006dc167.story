Mike Scott Contributor i Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own . Oil prices are on the up again , President Donald Trump promises to sweep away many of the restrictions the industry had imposed upon it during the Obama Administration , the former head of ExxonMobil is Secretary of State and there is even talk of watering down fuel economy requirements . Trump has pushed through executive orders to revive the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines and he has even promised to revive the moribund US coal industry , causing shares in coal miners to soar . But a new report suggests that demand for coal and oil could peak by 2020 thanks to dramatic falls in the cost of solar power and electric vehicles . The report , Expect the Unexpected : The Disruptive Power of Low-Carbon Technology , co-authored by the Grantham Institute for the study of Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College , London and the Carbon Tracker Initiative , says that the big energy companies are seriously under-estimating the speed at which low-carbon technologies are advancing and they could be left with stranded assets unless they change their approach . Carbon Tracker says that EVs will be cheaper than conventional internal combustion engines from 2020 and could have a fifth of the road transport market by 2030 . This could displace 25m bpd of oil by 2050 , in stark contrast to the continuous growth in oil demand the industry expects . The report argues that the use of Business-As-Usual scenarios should be retired and that scenarios should now apply , as a minimum , the latest cost reduction projections for solar PV and EVs , along with emissions commitments nations have made in their Nationally Determined Contributions -LRB- NDCs -RRB- under the Paris Climate Agreement , to reflect the current state of the low-carbon transition . Most major oil and gas companies do not expect coal to peak before 2030 and none see peak oil demand occurring before 2040 . I write about the intersection of business and the environment and the vital importance of environmental , social and governance -LRB- ESG -RRB- issues to businesses and the investors that help to fund them .

Oil demand could be flat from 2020 to 2030 then fall steadily to 2050 , & a ; rdquo ; the report asserts . Luke Sussams , senior researcher at Carbon Tracker , says : & a ; ldquo ; Electric vehicles and solar power are game-changers that the fossil fuel industry consistently underestimates . & a ; ldquo ; This may not sound much but it can be the beginning of the end once demand starts to decline , & a ; rdquo ; they write . That means anything from climate change to executive pay , as well as disruptive technologies from renewable energy and energy storage to nanotechnology . These issues can have a profound impact on company performance but are still largely ignored by many investors .
