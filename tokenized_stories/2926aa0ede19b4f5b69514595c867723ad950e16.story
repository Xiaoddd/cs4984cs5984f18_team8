This Thanksgiving season , we are witnessing , yet again , brutal acts against Indigenous People and their lands . It threatens the safety of land and water across the country , as well as violating treaties . Veterans For Peace understands that the struggle for Indigenous rights can not be decoupled from other movements for equality and justice . This Thanksgiving we know that there are many struggles around the globe , at home and abroad . We believe that violence and injustice must be challenged and ended in all its forms and that human dignity must be protected and defended . We know that many people have come to see this holiday as a way to value gratitude , reflection and peace . This Thanksgiving , we ask that you take action and stand in solidarity with the native resistance at Standing Rock . Organizers are now calling for a week of action starting on November 25th that will culminate in a Global Day of Action on December 1st . The main targets are financiers of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the police departments that have been brought in from across the Midwest to brutalize water protectors . Find a target and take action If you are doing a public action , register it here The financial footing of the Dakota Access Pipeline is in jeopardy if they do not complete the project by January 1st . If this deadline is missed , a majority of the stakeholders with contracts to ship oil through the pipeline will be able to renegotiate or cancel their contracts . This could be devastating to Energy Transfer Partners and the other pipeline companies behind DAPL . With its vulnerabilities exposed , our solidarity efforts are needed now more than ever . All contributions are tax deductible .
