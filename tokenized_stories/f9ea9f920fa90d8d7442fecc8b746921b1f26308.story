With its permission , it is being re-posted here on this blog : Oceti Sakowin Camp , The Horn January 28th , 2016 Local Leadership comes to decision , Oceti Sakowin Headsmen meet with ND Governor . Removing razor wire , and some of the concrete . So we , the Headsmen Council , are asking everyone respect this process and let them remove the barricade in order to ensure the task is managed safely . This was NOT a negotiated agreement between our parties . We will have volunteers bringing heavy machinery , dump trucks , drop boxes and bobcats to help . Meanwhile , we have a call out for allies and people across the country to stand up where they are , and enact mass civil disobedience as a showing of solidarity for Standing Rock . The fire of the Oceti Sakowin has been taken by 10,000 potential organizers from across Turtle Island , people who have been trained in Nonviolent direct action and we need you to hit the ground immediately to help educate others and further this movement . We continue to be thankful and encourage all to stand strong and take courage . While the evictions took place the Kenya Forest Service was funded by international donors , including the World Bank , the European Union , and the Finnish government .
