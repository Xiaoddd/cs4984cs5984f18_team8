The police assault reached a fever pitch on Sunday , with 300 people injured at the Oceti Sakowin encampment , including one woman who is now in danger of losing her arm . Mr. President , this brutality can not be allowed to continue . It is time for you to face up to what is taking place in Standing Rock , and to call this off once and for all : deny the easement to the Dakota Access corporation . This all could have been prevented months ago , in April , with your signature . It can be ended now if you will take action today in defense of Native Americans and the environment . In addition to rejecting the easement , police and private contractors who have committed acts of violence must be investigated and charged , and all arrest warrants related to peaceful protest must be dropped . Already , inaction by Democratic leaders underscores why nearly half of America could not bring themselves to vote in the presidential election . The party establishment once again has reaffirmed its loyalty to Corporate America and Big Oil , rather than defending the ordinary people who it claims to represent . Discussions around Thanksgiving dinner tables today may be some of the most tense in decades . Ordinary people must continue to build our movements , in Standing Rock now , and across America in the coming weeks and on inauguration day , to fight back against the bigoted and dangerous policies of the incoming Trump Administration . To be successful , we will need to organize independently of both these big business parties , and look to each other for real hope and change . I hope you , President Obama , will at last take action on Standing Rock . At the same time , I also call on millions of working people to continue to support the movement , to get involved , and to donate to the Standing Rock legal fund .
