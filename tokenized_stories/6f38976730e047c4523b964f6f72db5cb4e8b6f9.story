At least two people were arrested early Tuesday while protesting at the site of the Trans-Pecos pipeline in West Texas . But there were no reports of violence or injuries like those in the North Dakota protests , which have sometimes ended with tear gas , rubber bullets and water cannons . Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners , one of the companies behind the Dakota Access pipeline , is building the West Texas pipeline . The 148-mile Trans-Pecos , expected to be operational in March , was designed to connect a gas pipeline hub near Fort Stockton to Mexico . Protesters are demanding that the federal government conduct a thorough environmental assessment to ensure the project wo n't affect the Rio Grande River and several West Texas watersheds . Opponents are also concerned it would damage ancient Indian historical sites . Thank you to the patience and kind local law enforcement and to all who came out with signs and banners and hearts to stand -LRB- and sing and pray -RRB- till the sun done come up . That pipeline is expected to be 1,172 miles long and run from North Dakota to Illinois . Energy Transfer Partners has defended the Texas project as good for the environment . Officials said it will supply clean-burning natural gas to northern Mexico and help reduce the use of polluting coal . Supporters also pointed out that pollution from Mexico 's power plants is a significant contributor to haze in the Big Bend area . The Big Bend Defense Coalition identified those arrested Tuesday as Glover and Roger Siglin , a military veteran . The Brewster County Sheriff 's Department told the Houston Chronicle that a third protester , Arajoe Battista , who chained himself to a fence , was not arrested . The Army Corps of Engineers announced Sunday that it was temporarily halting construction of the portion of the Dakota Access pipeline going under Lake Oahe , near the Standing Rock Reservation . Many expect President-elect Donald Trump 's administration to allow the project to go forward next year when he takes office . Activists around the country have staged protests . But the Trans-Pecos Pipeline and its protesters have mostly flown under the radar . Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault -LRB- left -RRB- , tribal youth Garrett Hairychin and actress Shailene Woodley participate in a meeting of tribal officials and celebrities in Fort Yates , N.D. , to discuss efforts to halt construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline .
