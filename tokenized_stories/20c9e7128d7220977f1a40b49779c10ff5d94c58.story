The deal would have been one of the biggest in corporate history , combining dozens of household names . Unilever owns Ben & Jerry 's ice cream , Dove soap , and Hellmann 's mayonnaise , while Kraft 's range includes Philadelphia cheese and Heinz baked beans . More than half of the company 's shares are in the Dutch-listed entity , he told the BBC . ` Friendly basis ' Michael Mullen , a Kraft Heinz spokesman , said its interest was made public at an extremely early stage . Reports suggested that Prime Minister Theresa May had asked officials to examine the deal before it was scrapped . However , her spokesman said on Monday that Downing Street was not involved in Kraft 's decision to withdraw the offer . The takeover of Cadbury by Kraft in 2010 was controversial enough to prompt a revamp of the rules governing how foreign firms buy UK companies . Just a week after promising to keep open Cadbury 's Somerdale factory , near Bristol , Kraft backtracked and said it would close the plant . The Takeover Panel reviewed the laws and , in September 2011 , strengthened the hand of target companies , and demanded more information from bidders about their intentions after the purchase , particularly on areas such as job cuts . Analysis By Joe Lynam , BBC business correspondent Kraft Heinz is jointly controlled by billionaire investor Warren Buffett and Brazilian private equity group 3G . The latter has a deserved reputation for taking a scythe to costs - irrespective of how that might impact jobs and factories . Unilever , on the other hand , has a reputation for doing the right thing in terms of corporate social responsibility and the environment - even if that eats into the bottom line . The bosses of both consumer giants spoke over the weekend and it was clear that if Kraft really wanted Unilever it would have to launch a hostile takeover bid that could have ended up being very expensive . The higher the price , the less worthwhile the deal . So the bid was withdrawn within 55 hours of it being announced . Unilever clashed with UK supermarket Tesco in October over its attempts to raise prices to compensate for the steep drop in the value of the pound . The consumer goods giant has over a dozen sites across the UK , including three major plants in Liverpool , Norwich and Gloucester . The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites .
