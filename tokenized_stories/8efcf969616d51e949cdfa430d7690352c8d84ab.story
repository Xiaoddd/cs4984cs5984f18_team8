Below is a picture of a propane tank found on the bridge following an explosion early Monday morning . Officers witnessed protesters rolling the cylinder on the bridge , saw the explosion and then witnessed protesters running on the bridge to carry a woman from the scene . Protesters using improvised explosive devices caused an explosion on the Backwater Bridge around 3:00 a.m. Monday morning . Law enforcement witnessed protesters rolling cylinders on the bridge and witnessed an explosion , shortly after they saw several protesters run to that area of the bridge and carried a woman off the bridge . Once the scene was clear , investigators examined the bridge and found one pound coleman propane tanks that were rigged to explode on the bridge . There were actually several 1-pound propane canisters recovered from the site of the explosion by the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms -LRB- ATF -RRB- . If testing does confirm that the material on the propane cylinder is blood and tissue , then there is clearly enough to get a DNA match to the person who left that genetic material behind . The Mk3A2 is the last concussion grenade issued to the U.S. military . If Sophia Wilansky had a concussion grenade go off on her arm and she and her fellow protestors claim , she would not be in a hospital . Many people have brought up the possibility of a flash-bang . Flash-bangs are not concussion grenades .
