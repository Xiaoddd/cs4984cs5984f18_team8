It was an emotional closing prayer in front of the sacred fire at Oceti Sakowin camp , near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation , ground zero of the movement to stop the Dakota Access oil pipeline . Equipped with medical facilities , kitchens , security posts , prayer lodges , a building supply depot , a school , and a town hall , Oceti was a Native-led community built by the NoDAPL movement . On Wednesday , as many walked out of Oceti for the last time , smoke filled the air . Spiritual leaders chose to burn Native religious structures instead of allowing the police to bulldoze them . The North Dakota police had given water protectors a 2 p.m. deadline to leave the camp . But more than 100 stayed behind , refusing to leave land they consider theirs . At 4 p.m. , the police advanced , targeting both water protectors and journalists . At least two journalists were arrested , charged with obstruction of a government function . As dusk approached , the police retreated , promising to return in the morning to finish the eviction . The following day , a militarized force moved into Oceti . Dozens of military vehicles , armored personnel carriers , and Humvees were accompanied by National Guard soldiers armed with automatic rifles . Some water protectors were pulled out of ceremony as they were praying . It hurts to be pushed back . This is treaty land . This is our life . This is how we live as Native people . And nothing has changed . They have bigger weapons to kill us with . As the camp invasion was taking place , water protectors sang and prayed from the opposite side of the frozen Cannonball River . Some crossed the river in a final act of defiance . Authorities said 46 people were arrested . Now dispersed , the water protectors removed from Oceti Sakowin are regrouping in other protest camps near the pipeline .
