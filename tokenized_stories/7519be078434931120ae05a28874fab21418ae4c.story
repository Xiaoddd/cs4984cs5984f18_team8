Subscribe to tune in every week . A Clinton-era directive used mainly for natural disaster relief has drawn in law enforcement from faraway states . Subscribe to our free newsletters . When protests at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation began in April , there were only a handful of activists camping out in defiance of the Dakota Access Pipeline project . As their numbers have grown into the thousands , so has the police presence confronting them . In 1996 , then-President Bill Clinton signed the Emergency Management Assistance Compact -LRB- EMAC -RRB- . EMAC , an agreement eventually entered into by all 50 states , allows for states to share resources and coordinate emergency personnel in case of a crisis . The good-neighbor style law was invoked for disaster relief for Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and , more recently , Hurricane Matthew in 2016 . On August 19 , when North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple declared a state of emergency at Standing Rock , he relied on this language to issue an EMAC request . Per DeSmog Blog , Standing Rock is one of the few times that EMAC has been called upon to respond to social activism . About 300 state troopers from Pennsylvania and another 150 from New Jersey responded . Since the state issuing the EMAC request is on the hook for the tab , North Dakota taxpayers will pay for the out-of-state officers at Standing Rock . This will include wages , overtime costs , meals , lodging , and mileage reimbursement . Meanwhile , local courts and jails have struggled to process about 575 arrests . The increased law enforcement presence at Standing Rock has coincided with mounting concerns over police brutality . The deployment of military-grade equipment , including land-mine-resistant trucks and armored personnel carriers , as well as the use of pepper spray , rubber bullets , and alleged strip searches led Standing Rock Sioux tribal chairman Dave Archambault II to ask the Justice Department to investigate civil rights abuses . Some of the police details that have arrived in Standing Rock are among the largest recipients of military transfers from the federal government , according to an In These Times investigation . Police departments answer EMAC requests on a voluntary basis . Others are withdrawing from the action .
