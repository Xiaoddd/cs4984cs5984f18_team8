The Wampanoag were primarily farmers who also hunted in the uncultivated lands around around their villages -LRB- many villages were large enough to be considered towns in Europe -RRB- and fished the coastal waters off of what is now Massachusetts and Rhode Island . These were peoples with sophisticated language , culture , farming practices , and civilization . Like a lot of Native American groups , hospitality was a cornerstone of their cultural norms . The Wampoanoag had spent the summer before teaching the Pilgrams -LRB- who were printers and other middleclass non-farmers back in Europe -RRB- how to plant crops and the other necessities of life . When the harvest came , the Wampoanoag came to celebrate the achievements of these struggling colonists . They brought lots of food to the Pilgrims to supplement the meager rations the English were going to have to get by on . An eyewitness to the event wrote that the leader of the Wampanoag , a man named Massasoit , personally gave the Pilgrims no less than five deer . The locals then spent three days making merry with their new neighbors . Most of the male survivors were sold into slavery in Bermuda or the West Indies . The Womoanoag language was deliberately eradicated , and the culture of the people was almost destroyed . It came within a hair of genocide , which is exactly what happened to the now extinct Massachusetts people . This is why Native Americans consider Thanksgiving a Day of Mourning . The latest arsenic icing on the cowpie is the Dakota Access Pipeline that the coal and gas company Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- ETP -RRB- are running through the Standing Rock Native American Reservation , which is a Hunkpapa Lakota and Yanktonai Dakota Native American reservation stretching across the US states of North Dakota and South Dakota . This has the people living on the reservation justifiably upset . In March and April 2016 the Environmental Protection Agency , the Department of Interior , and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation asked the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a formal Environmental Impact Assessment and issue an Environmental Impact Statement . The bulldozers arrived within a day after the tribe filed legal action . Energy Transfer bulldozers cut a two-mile -LRB- 3200 m -RRB- long , 150-foot -LRB- 45 m -RRB- wide path through the contested area . Although there is an injunction and the Army Corps of Engineers say they need to asses the environmental impact further , the greedy monster of Energy Transfer Partners just keep on bulldozing through sacred ground . Their hired thugs are attacking the protestors with water-cannons , rubber bullets , teargas , pepper spray , and concussion grenades . As this atrocity happens , the US government just stands by twiddling its thumbs and Obama was too busy pardoning turkeys today to bother with saving Native American lands and water . So far , the only high profile official to defend the protests has been senator Bernie Sanders . You can find a list of organizations that are helping collect supplies to help get protesters through the winter here .
