On Friday , President Donald Trump signed a permit to allow the construction of the 1,179-mile Keystone XL pipeline that President Barack Obama had blocked in 2015 . The day for the walkers began just before dawn when a water ceremony was held . Usually conducted by women in the tribe , the ceremony began and ended with prayer songs and the blessing of a pail of water that will be carried throughout . At the end of the walk on Saturday on Porcupine Creek near Nashua and the eventual pipeline construction site , a prayer circle will be formed by the walkers and tribal members . Tribal elder Cheyenne DeMarrias said not enough people appreciate what water does for their bodies and take it for granted . The plan for the walk was developed after TransCanada officials pulled out of a public meeting with the Fort Peck Tribal Executive Board for fear of protesters at the event . Dozens of people participate in a prayer walk Friday on the Fort Peck Reservation to bring awareness to the importance of water . They are concerned about the Keystone pipeline , which President Donald Trump permitted . The company met via telephone with tribal leaders behind closed doors a few hours after canceling the public meeting . Some tribal council members have also suggested the company build on the reservation but downstream from the intake plant for the tribe to get some financial benefit from the project .
