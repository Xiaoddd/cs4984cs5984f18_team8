The months-long protests against the pipeline is largely a cry to protect tribal water from possible contamination . The DAPL is being constructed under multiple waterways , including the Missouri River . That is , if the meeting between North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple and Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II goes well . Reportedly , the two men have spoken several times since the Standing Rock protest began ; but always over the phone , never face-to-face . It has been reported that when the tentatively agreed-upon meeting does take place , the entirety of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Council will join Archambault and the governor for their talks . wo n't hurt the veterans but we all know they suck at caring about their health and welfare . Running on pixie dust and happy feelings . Hypocrites . Namely , the Standing Rock protesters want the state to eliminate a blockade of the Backwater Bridge . According to the tribal leadership , the blockade is a huge problem and has been since it was implemented in late October . Archambault has wanted it gone for quite a while , and if the state removes it , it could mend some fences . It has been reported that Dalrymple may be up for discussing the subject at the upcoming meeting .
