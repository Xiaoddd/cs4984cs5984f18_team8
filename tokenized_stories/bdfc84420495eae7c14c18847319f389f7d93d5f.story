Dozens of the over 1,000 young people who protested against the Keystone XL pipeline did a die-in on a large black tarp representing an oil spill . During the protest , almost 400 were arrested after zip-tieing themselves to the White House fence . In January , Trump had breathed new life into the pipeline project that had been stopped under Obama , asking TransCanada to submit a new application . The pipeline still has to be approved by the Nebraska Public Service Commission and local landowners , but granting the permit clears the path for final approval . Keystone XL would be another escalation in furthering an unfolding climate disaster , piping an additional 830,000 barrels of oil a day from the Alberta tar sands into the U.S. for processing . Oil from tar sands is some of the dirtiest , most carbon polluting oil on the planet . This pipeline would also trample on treaty rights of the Sioux , going through treaty lands and near several other tribal reservations . Keystone XL would cross the Ogallala Aquifer , which is one of the country 's largest sources of freshwater . A spill in the aquifer would threaten the drinking water for millions of Americans as well as the livelihood of local ranchers and farmers . Hundreds of thousands of people have participated in active resistance to Keystone XL and DAPL . More than a thousand sat in at the White House in mass arrests to stop Keystone XL in just one of many protest actions in recent years . Thousands heroically stood up to vicious police assaults on the Standing Rock Reservation to stop DAPL . Hundreds of Native tribes sent representatives to Standing Rock in an unprecedented action to protect Standing Rock Sioux treaty rights and the water and land . The resistance contributed to helping stop production of Keystone XL for years and for more than a year for DAPL , which shamefully now is being completed . Map shows the Keystone XL Pipeline route -LRB- long dotted line -RRB- going through the Ogallala Aquifer in Nebraska . This natural underground water reservoir is one of the largest in the world . Contaminating the aquifer from leaks in the pipeline is a real and dangerous possibility . They have promised to resist this in the courts , as well as with campaigns and in the streets . Approval of Keystone XL and DAPL is part of a savage war on the environment that this regime has radically escalated , with the goal of eliminating any restraints on capitalist profit-making and plunder of resources , and arrogantly expanding U.S. global domination , including over energy resources . This system and those who rule over it are not capable of carrying out economic development to meet the needs of the people now , while balancing that with the needs of future generations and requirements of safeguarding the environment . They care nothing for the rich diversity of the earth and its species , for the treasures this contains , except when and where they can turn this into profit for themselves ... These people are not fit to be the caretakers of the earth . and Revolution Send us your comments . If you like this article , subscribe , donate to and sustain Revolution newspaper .
