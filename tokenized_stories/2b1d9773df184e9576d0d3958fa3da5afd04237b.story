We the people of Oakland formally request that Mayor Libby Schaaf and the city of Oakland , CA divest our money from banks that have supported the Dakota Access Pipeline . No matter where you 're from , your signature can make a difference and just like in Seattle we can see this movement take the nation . It 's time to put our money where our mouth is . If we reinvest these funds into local credit unions not only will this support the health of the Oakland economy , we as a city will also be taking an important stand against one of the greatest dangers of our time . Stopping the pipeline will protect millions of people who depend on the water reserve surrounding Standing Rock . It also makes a definitive statement to the world that we no longer need to rely on fossil fuels , that we can direct our attention to clean energy creating thousands upon thousands of new jobs , and that we the people have the power to do whats right and protect the environmental resources that we depend on for our very lives . Stand with Standing Rock .
