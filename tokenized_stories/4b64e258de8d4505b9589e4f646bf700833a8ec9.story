A previously proposed route for the 1,172-mile pipeline had it crossing the Missouri River north of Bismarck , North Dakota , according to a document filed as part of the permitting process . The eventual route that was decided on , and is currently in construction , moved the water crossing of the crude oil pipeline south of the North Dakota capital , to just upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe 's reservation . The North Dakota Public Service Commission -LRB- PSC -RRB- refuted allegations of environmental racism , saying that the Bismarck route proposal was never submitted to the agency because permits for it were denied by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during its environmental assessment . This route was never included in the proposed route submitted to the PSC and therefore was never vetted or considered by us during our permitting process . In its environmental assessment , the Corps rejected the Bismarck route to protect wells that serve the municipal water supply , according to The Bismarck Tribune . The Bismarck route would also have been more than 10 miles longer and would have made it difficult to meet PSC requirements to keep the pipeline 500 feet or more away from homes , the Tribune reported . The current route of the pipeline , which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe argues traverses culturally sacred sites and poses a risk to the reservation 's water supply , was largely chosen because it runs along existing infrastructure such as railways and other pipelines , Dakota Access argued in its application to the PSC for permits . However , President Obama 's comments on a possible reroute come at a time when the pipeline is nearing completion , meaning there may be major hurdles to rerouting it now , according to some experts . The movement to block the pipeline has garnered nationwide support , with hundreds of environmentalists and Native American groups camping out in demonstration near the Standing Rock Sioux tribe 's reservation in Cannon Ball , North Dakota . The fate of the controversial pipeline in its current route currently rests with the Army Corps of Engineers , which is reviewing the final easement that Dakota Access needs in order to construct beneath the Missouri River .
