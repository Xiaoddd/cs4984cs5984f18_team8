More than 250 activists have been arrested over the past two years for protesting the AIM pipeline . They have staged a 60-day protest outside the Manhattan office of Senator Charles Schumer -LRB- D-New York -RRB- , handcuffed themselves to pipelines , and climbed into pipes to block further construction . The proposed AIM pipeline route will run from Lambertville , New Jersey to Boston , Massachusetts . Not only will it run under the Hudson River , it will also run within 100 feet -LRB- 30 meters -RRB- from the Indian Point nuclear power plant , the movement claims . The Indian Point facilities have been plagued with numerous safety violations over the last 18 months , and Williams worries that a pipeline being placed so close to the nuclear plant could cause problems . New York Governor Andrew Cuomo -LRB- D -RRB- has since reached a compromise with Entergy , the company that owns the Indian Point power plant , to shut down it down in the next four years . However , part of the pipeline has already started transporting gas . All rights reserved . This website uses cookies . Read RT Privacy policy to find out more .
