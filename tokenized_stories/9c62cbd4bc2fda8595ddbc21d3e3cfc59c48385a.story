The pipeline is largely complete except for the now-blocked segment underneath Lake Oahe , a Missouri River reservoir . The company constructing the pipeline , Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners , had said it was unwilling to reroute the project . It and the Morton County Sheriff 's Office , which has done much of the policing of the protests , did not have immediate comment . The route has been the subject of months of protests by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and others . The Federal Government has ordered people to leave the main encampment , which is on Army Corps of Engineers ' land , by Monday . But demonstrators say they 're prepared to stay , and authorities say they will not forcibly remove them . Photo Cheryl Angel offers ceremonial tobacco on Backwater Bridge during a protest .

The US Army is now standing in the way of the controversial pipeline at Standing Rock . This is why the protests have received international attention . Steven Perry , a 66-year-old Vietnam veteran who is a member of the Little Traverse Bay band of Odawa Indians in Michigan , spoke of one of the protesters ' main concerns : that the pipeline could pollute drinking water . Art Woodson and two other veterans drove 17 hours straight from Flint , Michigan , a city whose lead-tainted water crisis parallels with the tribe 's fight over water , he said .
