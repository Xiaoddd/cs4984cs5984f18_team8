Soon , the Emirates are expected to complete a deal with General Atomics for a fleet of Predator drones to run spying missions in their neighborhood . As the Middle East descends into proxy wars , sectarian conflicts and battles against terrorist networks , countries in the region that have stockpiled American military hardware are now actually using it and wanting more . The United States has long put restrictions on the types of weapons that American defense firms can sell to Arab nations , meant to ensure that Israel keeps a military advantage against its traditional adversaries in the region . But because Israel and the Arab states are now in a de facto alliance against Iran , the Obama administration has been far more willing to allow the sale of advanced weapons in the Persian Gulf , with few public objections from Israel . Qatar , another gulf country with bulging coffers and a desire to assert its influence around the Middle East , is on a shopping spree .

Other nations that have joined the coalition against the Houthis , like Morocco , have characterized their participation in blunt sectarian terms . But Sunni nations have also shown a new determination to use military force against radical Sunni groups like the Islamic State . A number of Arab countries are using an air base in Jordan to launch attacks against Islamic State fighters in Syria . Separately , the Emirates and Egypt have carried out airstrikes in Libya against Sunni militias there . Meanwhile , the deal to sell Predator drones to the Emirates is nearing final approval .
