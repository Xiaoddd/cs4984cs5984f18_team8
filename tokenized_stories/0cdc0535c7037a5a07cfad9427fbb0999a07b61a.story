In the last few years , state lawmakers across the country have proposed bills that would impose harsh penalties on environmental protest , particularly protests aimed at delaying pipeline construction or shutting down existing pipeline infrastructure . In energy-rich states like Oklahoma and North Dakota , lawmakers have successfully passed bills prohibiting certain kinds of protest , from protests that block highways or traffic to protests that trespass onto property containing energy infrastructure . If passed , the bills would make it illegal to conspire to protest in certain instances , like when a protest would require trespass or some other kind of civil disobedience . Then came the crackdown . The current wave of state-level anti-pipeline protest legislation has largely been seen as a response to the Standing Rock protests of 2016 , which brought thousands of indigenous and environmental groups to North Dakota in an attempt to stop construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . The successful protests against the Dakota Access pipeline have inspired the protests now being staged against pipelines in Louisiana , Pennsylvania , and elsewhere . But they have also inspired backlash from the fossil fuel industry and allied political groups . The ALEC model bill included a provision for charges to be brought against an organization that is found to have conspired with individuals to disrupt critical infrastructure . Advertisement Now , in Louisiana , Pennsylvania , and Minnesota , legislators have taken their anti-pipeline protest bills a step further than ALEC . Protesters in Pennsylvania would face similar charges for conspiring to enter a prohibited area under a bill introduced on March 26 . In most instances , these bills cover crimes already penalized under state legal codes . Trespass is already illegal in these states , and prosecutors frequently charge protesters with conspiracy . What sets these bills apart , Cherry notes , is their narrow focus on energy infrastructure , as well as the proposed severity of criminal penalties .
