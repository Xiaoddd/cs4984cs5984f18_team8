All updates are in Eastern Standard Time -LRB- GMT -5 -RRB- . President Trump invited the Canadian energy company to re-submit the pipeline for approval in an executive order on Tuesday . The application now formally sets the Keystone XL pipeline back in motion , bringing the infrastructure project closer to reality . When he signed the executive order , Trump said the construction of Keystone XL would create 28,000 jobs . In fact , most studies indicate the pipeline would create only about 3,900 temporary construction jobs , though perhaps 7,000 more might be funded through local follow-on effects . With no Keystone XL pipeline , many oil extractors have resorted to shipping oil across the continent on trucks or trains . On top of this , others have stopped exploring for oil in the tar sands , as crude prices are now too low to justify drilling . Now we find out . The death toll has risen to at least 10 Friday in the wildfires that have spread throughout central Chile . Other countries , including the U.S. , Russia , France , Peru , and Mexico , have contributed to the relief effort . You can see more photos from the fires here . Mexico has consistently said it will not pay for such a structure . You can read more about the avalanche and the recovery process here . Krishnadev Calamur Jan. 26 , 2017 , 8:40 a.m. Tweet Share Greece 's Supreme Court Rules Against Extraditing Coup-Linked Turkish Soldiers The eight Turkish soldiers are escorted by police officers to the Supreme Court in Athens on January 26 . The countries have had traditionally tense relations , but are both members of NATO and , as such , are allies . Turkey wants the soldiers , who fled to Greece by helicopter , returned so they can stand trial . Erdogan has cracked down on the military , the media , and government , and civil society after the coup attempt . Thousands of people have been arrested and tens of thousands have lost their jobs . Really , the blame rests totally on my shoulders . He was headed to a prestigious college . I was headed to a small , obscure liberal-arts college , which was a tremendous achievement , not just because I was a terrible student , but also because I had nearly killed myself as a response to what he apologized for in my yearbook .

New York City may be the logical extreme of this . Now her outspokenness on sexism could cost her everything . When Beth Moore arrived in Houston in the 1980s , she found few models for young women who wanted to teach scripture . Many conservative Christian denominations believed that women should not hold authority over men , whether in church or at home ; many denominations still believe this . In some congregations , women could not speak from the lectern on a Sunday or even read the Bible in front of men . But Moore was resolute : God , she felt , had called her to serve . In tiny church social halls , she laid the cornerstone of an evangelical empire . Conspiracy theories . Attacks on the free press . An obsession with loyalty . Recent events in the United States follow a pattern Europeans know all too well . On December 31 , 1999 , we threw a party . It was the end of one millennium and the start of a new one ; people very much wanted to celebrate , preferably somewhere exotic . Our party fulfilled that criterion . We held it at Chobielin , the manor house in northwest Poland that my husband and his parents had purchased a decade earlier , when it was a mildewed ruin . We had restored the house , very slowly . It was not exactly finished in 1999 , but it did have a new roof . To hear more feature stories , see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app . The guests were various : journalist friends from London and Berlin , a few diplomats based in Warsaw , two friends who flew in from New York . But most of them were Poles , friends of ours and colleagues of my husband , who was then a deputy foreign minister in the Polish government . We need to do everything we can to fight back . I hoped that my fears for our future were overblown . They were not . In the roughly 21 months since he took the oath of office , Trump has sunk far below the already-low bar he set for himself in his ugly campaign . Exhibit A is the unspeakable cruelty that his administration has inflicted on undocumented families arriving at the border , including separating children , some as young as eight months , from their parents . According to The New York Times , the administration continues to detain 12,800 children right now , despite all the outcry and court orders . Some 3,000 Americans died . Now Trump flatly denies those deaths were caused by the storm . The year was 2015 . The dubious notion that philosophy is a guide to calmer living is as old as the field itself . He shows off a few steps from his dance routine to a small group of acquaintances once he arrives at the Four Seasons hotel . She was 15 at the time . That he groped her , grinding his body against hers . That he tried to remove her clothes , and then the bathing suit she wore underneath them . That he put his hand over her mouth , to muffle her screams . Subscribe to The Family Weekly , our free newsletter delivered to your inbox every Saturday morning .
