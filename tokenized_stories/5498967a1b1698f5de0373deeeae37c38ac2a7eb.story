The state also needs to cut spending and do a better job of forecasting tax revenue from the oil and gas industry , which has been battered by the drop in prices , Gov. Doug Burgum -LRB- R -RRB- said yesterday in his first address to the Legislature in Bismarck . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sued the Army Corps of Engineers over the Dakota Access pipeline in July , saying the project 's Missouri River crossing could endanger the water supply on the tribe 's reservation and damage cultural sites on surrounding private land . Thousands of people flocked to join protests that the tribe led in Cannon Ball , N.D. Advertisement The protests were largely peaceful , but hundreds of people were arrested for trespassing and other charges , and police broke up some marches with rubber bullets , tear gas and fire hoses . Construction on the pipeline was halted , at least temporarily , when the Obama administration said it would review the way the Army Corps consults with Native American tribes about pipeline routes -LRB- Energywire , Dec. 4 , 2016 -RRB- . Burgum , a former software executive and venture capitalist , won election in November after the incumbent governor , Jack Dalrymple , opted not to run again . He 'll be working with a Legislature that has turned more conservative , with Republicans widening their margins in both chambers -LRB- Energywire , Nov. 7 , 2016 -RRB- . The state 's budget will be one of Burgum 's other main challenges . The oil bust that started in 2014 cut into the state 's sales tax and other revenue , leaving it 25 percent short of its forecast for the current two-year budget cycle . North Dakota already is projecting another general fund shortfall of about 20 percent for the biennium that starts in July . Dalrymple has proposed a budget that would offset the shortfall by cutting spending at most state agencies ; Burgum said he 'll offer amendments to Dalrymple 's plan in the next few weeks . Over the long run , he said , North Dakota needs to reorganize its government from the bottom up . Towns and cities can become more efficient by building smaller , denser communities that require less infrastructure , and the state can reduce spending by merging departments and eliminating overlapping functions . Burgum also said the state needs better information about oil prices in the future . A lot of farmers and agribusinesses have adopted technology to predict the price of crops , he said . pipelines Related Headlines PIPELINES FERC restarts Atlantic Coast project Energywire : Tuesday , September 18 , 2018 PIPELINES N.Y. project backer heads back to court Energywire : Tuesday , September 18 , 2018 PIPELINES Warren , Markey press company , regulators on Mass. blasts E&E Daily : Tuesday , September 18 , 2018 PIPELINES NTSB homes in on cause of deadly Mass. .
