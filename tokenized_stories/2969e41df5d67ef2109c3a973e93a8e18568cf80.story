Copy may not be in its final form . A lot of jobs , 28,000 jobs , great construction jobs . The Dakota Access project would carry up to 570,000 barrels of oil a day from North Dakota through South Dakota , Iowa and then Illinois . From North Dakota , Winona LaDuke is with us , Native American activist , executive director of the group Honor the Earth . She lives and works on the White Earth Reservation in northern Minnesota . Here in Park City , Utah , Bobbi Jean Three Legs is with us , from Wakpala , South Dakota , member of the Standing Rock Nation . WINONA LADUKE : Well , to be honest , it is pretty much a declaration of war against us all out here , not just against Native people , but against anybody who wants to drink . You know , as far as I can , you know , review his thinking on this , aside from being insane , the fact is , is that , you know , infrastructure is needed in this country . We got a D in infrastructure in this country . WINONA LADUKE : Well , our board and , you know , most people up here are very concerned about what is going to happen . And we understand the National Guard is already in there , you know , hurting some of our people . And , you know , so it has continued . You know , the same thing is true with Dakota Access pipeline . This is what a holding cell probably looks like in Bismarck . I happen to be not in a holding cell today , but maybe soon . The oil is not high enough , you know , so they dropped it . Lynn Helms is projecting that there will be 900,000 barrels of oil a day coming out of the Bakken in 2019 . That guy is going to be , you know , really busy on all of that . And I feel that he has declared war on us out here . And , you know , we are people who have the worst infrastructure in the country on our reservations . You 've got people with substandard housing . And so , all of that would be energy security for all Americans . Definitely a declaration of war on all of us by the predator-in-chief .
