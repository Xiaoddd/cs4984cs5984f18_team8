Charger was Lakota Sioux , and she had left the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota for Portland , Ore. , just a few months earlier . Charger was shocked . In the weeks that followed , more teenagers on the reservation killed themselves with belts , knives and handfuls of Benadryl . Native American teenagers and young adults are 1.5 times as likely to kill themselves as the national average , with suicides often clustering in epidemics that hit and fade . By the end of that summer , Jasilyn told me , 30 Cheyenne River kids attempted and eight completed . Their elders liked to talk about them as the future , but no one seemed to pay much attention to how their lives were hard , bordering on hopeless . Cheyenne River kids had families struggling with poverty and parents and relatives with serious drug-abuse problems . Often there was violence at home , to the point that many youths had nowhere safe to go at night . And amid all this , there was a hard-edged social pressure to drink or use drugs . Charger had seen all of this . But her mother called her in as a runaway one too many times , and the South Dakota Division of Child Protection Services took both girls , sending them to group homes on opposite sides of the state . She got so depressed she was moved to a psychiatric unit , where she often got into fights . She aged out of the system at 17 , but when she returned to the ranch developments and trailer parks of Eagle Butte , she struggled with depression . She fell into a monthslong cocaine binge , crashing in abandoned cars with other homeless kids . Her weight had dropped to 80 pounds by the time that her cousin , Joseph White Eyes , intervened . In early 2015 she moved to Portland , as far away as she could get . Together with White Eyes and their friend , Trenton Casillas-Bakeberg , she formed a youth group . They raised money for basketball tournaments and for a youth trip to the Red Nation Film Festival in California , where the kids were able to see the ocean for the first time in their landlocked lives . They went to the tribal council , demanding and getting funds for a safe house for young people . Most of all they counseled young people , urging them to look out for one another and get involved . As the suicide wave crested and broke , the youth group , now called the One Mind Youth Movement , turned to something more political . They spent that fall as part of the local campaign against the Keystone XL pipeline , whose route would cut under the Cheyenne River just upstream from the reservation that bears its name . And after the Obama State Department denied the Keystone XL permission to cross the U.S.-Canadian border in November 2015 , they moved their focus to the neighboring Standing Rock Sioux Reservation , where the company Energy Transfer Partners was trying to build the Dakota Access Pipeline . That pipeline would move half a million barrels of oil a day beneath the Missouri River , the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux , which is one of the cousin bands to Cheyenne River , as well as for other downstream Sioux reservations . The youths came to believe that the Dakota pipeline was not only a threat to their drinking water but also a harbinger of the larger environmental crisis their generation was set to inherit . Over the next six months that camp grew into an improbable movement that united conservative farmers with the old radicals of the American Indian Movement ; urban environmentalists with the traditional chiefs of hundreds of tribes . As Donald Trump pushes forward with the Keystone XL and Dakota Access , he will face a movement emboldened by a victory on Dec. 4 , 2016 , when the Department of the Army denied an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline and directed the Army Corps to consider an alternate route . It was a rare triumph for both the environmental and land rights movements , as well as for the American left in an otherwise dark moment . But little remarked upon at the time was the unlikely seed from which the movement had grown : an anti-suicide campaign among a tight-knit group of youths , most younger than 25 , impelled by tragedy and guided by prophecy . At the start , the camp seemed like a quixotic undertaking . One Mind Youth made the two-hour drive north to propose setting up a prayer camp modeled on the ones raised against the Keystone XL . The tribal council agreed to set up the camp but offered little other support , pessimistic about the effort . The youths were undeterred . In early April , a handful , joined by a few former Keystone activists , moved into tepees in a protected ravine beside the Cannonball River , on the extreme north end of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . Those days , the temperatures were in the 30s and there was still snow on the ground . The youths dubbed the camp Sacred Stone and lit the sacred fire . At first , they lived on little more than bologna sandwiches , potato chips and water . But then residents from the small reservation town of Cannon Ball , up the hill from Sacred Stone , began to bring donations : leftovers from dinner , cut-up wooden corrals for the campfires , a chain saw .

The previous fall , they rented a hotel room in Eagle Butte as an informal crash house for Cheyenne River youth , where sometimes as many as 20 teenagers stayed , sleeping and showering , safe from bullying or the lure of alcohol or drugs . The prayer camp at Standing Rock provided something similar . Members of One Mind would drive home every week to resupply and pick up youths who wanted to experience the camp . For Charger and other leaders , as important as the idea of the safe space was the idea that activism would teach children the skills to survive more immediate threats , like bullying and drug abuse . They hoped to pass on skills at the camp that they themselves had been taught by Keystone activists in their community . Every direct-action training against the Keystone XL , for example , referenced the prophecy of the black snake , a figure out of Lakota myth that in recent times has been identified with pipelines . The message was clear : The struggle against the pipeline was part of the same struggle against alcoholism , suicide and abuse .

Bobbi Jean Three Legs , a young mother and long-distance runner from Standing Rock who had become active in the camp , had a vision . Her daughter woke her one night to ask for water , and she suddenly saw a day when , thanks to water pollution , there would be no water to give . Soon after that , she and White Eyes proposed a 500-mile relay run from the Sacred Stone Camp to Omaha to deliver a letter to the Army Corps of Engineers , asking it to deny the Dakota Access Pipeline permission to cross the Missouri River . The I.E.N. began a social-media campaign announcing the run and organized a blitz of calls and letters from tribal members on various reservations . Within days , far sooner than expected , an Army Corps representative from the Omaha district agreed to meet with members of the tribe . To some , this meant the youths could call off the run . But they insisted on going ahead . Not only did they still want support from the tribal council ; they had also begun to believe that this run could bring together young people from all the Sioux reservations . One Mind saw water as an issue that could unify all Oceti Sakowin youth . And their run had rich cultural resonance : Before Europeans brought horses , long-distance messenger runners held the scattered tribes of Oceti Sakowin together . Three Legs , White Eyes and Charger mapped a route to pass through as many reservations as possible . The run would use a traditional method in which a messenger ran a short distance , about a mile , and then rested while another runner took his or her place . It allowed people who were not very good runners , like Charger , to go on a long-distance run . Daniel Grassrope , now 25 , came from the Lower Brule , a band whose reservation lay down the Missouri from Cheyenne River . As a child , he dreamed of being taken away from his family and adopted by whites , something he associated , vaguely , with having his own bedroom and a mother who came to his basketball games . The run immediately gave him what Standing Rock would later give many other youths : a sense of purpose he had been lacking . It also inspired something more radical , in a way , than antipipeline activism : the belief that a group of lost people from scattered nations could still find kinship . Grassrope wrote to Three Legs immediately . On April 24 , the runners set off south from the Sacred Stone Camp . They ran along the Cannonball River to Highway 1806 , then down toward Cheyenne River , their first stop . Grassrope ran next to Charger , who was carrying a heavy staff that represented their ancestors . When she got too tired , Grassrope carried it . In doing so , according to Lakota belief , they were literally carrying all those who had come before . At every reservation , they met not only with tribal leaders but also with reservation youths , whom they talked to just as they had in Cheyenne River , telling them about the old ways and the camp upriver where those ways were being revived . Because the Native American community has become heavily networked on social media as a modern means to keep the bands united , word spread far beyond the communities they visited . When the youths arrived in Omaha on May 3 , a representative of the Army Corps of Engineers met with them on the steps of the office . They still felt motivated as they went back to Standing Rock . Grassrope quit his job in Lower Brule and settled into the camp with them . On July 15 , 30 runners set out from Sacred Stone , adding more as they made their way along their route . She was in bed asleep when Jasilyn , passing through Cheyenne River , ran into their house , threw her clothes into a bag and urged her onto their support van . Over the course of the next week or so , a dozen more joined . But on July 26 , the runners learned the Army Corps of Engineers had approved the Dakota Access pipeline easements . The black snake was on its way . The runners decided to carry on to Washington , but the focus shifted back to the camp , as I.E.N. activists at Standing Rock urged people via Facebook messages to rise to the standard set by the youths . They loaded cars and buses and camper vans with donations and headed for Standing Rock . Twenty-six-year-old Eryn Wise moved to the camp in late August , at the beginning of what organizers called the big boom , when the population spiked from dozens to thousands . A native of Minneapolis , Wise was raised by her grandmother on the Jicarilla Apache Reservation after a suicide attempt at 11 . On the reservation , she was picked on for excelling at school but was surrounded by her siblings , with whom she formed a close bond . But she returned to Minneapolis when she was 16 to care for her mother . When she read an article about the youth run she felt a pull and quit her job . She found her twin siblings , Alex and Lauren Howland , already at the camp . Photo Eryn Wise in Washington following the inauguration . The run , Goldtooth told me , had forced their support by transforming the Dakota Access pipeline from a regional Lakota issue into an international one . Standing Rock council members began to visit the camps and pay for emergency services , propane and portable toilets . The Council Lodge was the traditional meeting place of the Oceti Sakowin in the 19th century , when the bands would gather on the Plains . It was part of a larger move toward formalizing the prayer camps under a council government . By then , the protests against the pipeline had , for the traditional leadership , become about far more : They had become a long-prophesied end to history . Not just to its people . Many of the youths that I spoke with took this to mean the Seventh Generation had a sort of messianic role to help restore order , on behalf of all beings , to a world thrown out of balance by modernity and greed . The Seventh Generation tracks roughly with millennials of all races , but they share their own unique history . The generation between Goldtooth , 34 , and Charger , now 20 , is the first to have grown up free to be Indian . Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box . Invalid email address .

In early September , the Seven Council Fires and Chief Arvol Looking Horse , who , for the Lakota Sioux , is something like their head of religion , gave the youths a gift : a chanupa , the ceremonial pipe that is the most sacred element of the Plains religion , a symbol of the knitting together of the human community and nature , ancestors with the living . It is difficult to overstate the importance of this gesture . We said they had to be of pure mind . After the ceremony , the youths , who had begun to call themselves the International Indigenous Youth Council , or I.I.Y.C. , to symbolize their desire to unite all nations behind a traditional way of life , moved together into a tepee by the Cannonball River . The I.I.Y.C. was the first experience of family for many members . She shrugged . Charger was referring to Native American history , not just what happened on the frontier but also in more recent decades . After federal campaigns reduced the Oceti Sakowin in the late 1800s , there were nearly 100 years of calculated assault as the state tried to force Native Americans to assimilate . The unified nation of Oceti Sakowin was broken into widely separated reservations , and after Congress privatized reservation land , many starving Lakota families had to sell off their property to white farmers , further cutting the size of reservations . But perhaps most devastating to their psychological health were the boarding schools , in which generations of Indians were sent to schools to be taught white culture . This system reached its nadir in the forced assimilation campaigns of the 1940s and 1950s , when the grandparents of many of the I.I.Y.C. youths were taught English literally under the lash . At Standing Rock , the youths felt they were developing the means to overcome that trauma . The key , as Charger explained it , was to let their history go , which they took as an almost holy responsibility : Forgive , and then take action to spare those who are coming in the future . For many , this provided a means to re-establish difficult relationships with parents or siblings . But it also helped bind them together into their own sort of family . In the final months of 2016 , the camps at Standing Rock grew to more than 10,000 , filling with indigenous peoples from hundreds of nations , climate-change activists , members of the Rainbow Family and Burning Man communities and those who simply felt a call . By that point , the role of the I.I.Y.C. had become a sort of advance guard , taking risks and pushing actions forward and winning new young converts to the cause .

A 24-year-old Lakota and Latino from Denver , Lopez grew up the child of AIM and Chicano activists , and as the adopted grandson of the powerful medicine man Leonard Crowdog . Once he found himself at the camp , Lopez was touched by the message of activism and reconciliation . One afternoon , he was sitting with I.I.Y.C. members , rolling cigarettes for everyone in front of a fire , as Charger talked about the role of youth . He thought about it as he drove home to Denver , and when he got there , he helped establish a local I.I.Y.C. chapter , drawing from local indigenous and Latino youths . In mid-November , the group took hundreds of Denver high-school students for a march through downtown to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline . The images of campers being maced or attacked by dogs spread anger across the country , and many brought that anger to Standing Rock . For traditional leadership , any violence was deeply concerning . Part of the matrix of prophecy that underlies their movement is the idea that should the Oceti Sakowin or their allies resort to violence , they could be wiped out . The youths took this seriously , even as they found themselves under physical threat . Wise , the camp mom , remembers , for instance , watching on Facebook Live as her sister was maced . Furious , she raced to the scene and threw herself at the police . Suddenly there were six hands on her shoulders : I.I.Y.C. members , pulling her back . She saw her brother Alex , his face white with what appeared to be war paint . But on Dec. 2 , when the department posted on Facebook soliciting donations of granola bars , fruit soda and socks , the I.I.Y.C. showed up with large plastic containers filled with granola bars , warm clothing and water . The station was on lockdown ; after a while , an officer looking sheepish in his helmet , faceplate and full body armor , opened the door and accepted the containers . Lopez half turned . It was a small gesture , but one that prompted thanks from the officers and anger from some in the camps . Wise remembers people asking . But prophecy was important to the youths ; they worried that if the movement became too violent , it would ruin everything they had been trying to build . On Dec. 4 , 2016 , as thousands of military veterans from across the country crowded the camp in solidarity , the Department of the Army announced its decision to deny an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline route . The decision was a shock and an unexpected triumph . Now , with winter bearing down , he said , everyone could begin to go home . For them , leaving was more complicated . There was also a more personal problem . Many of them had nowhere else to go . They had become dependent on the I.I.Y.C. for a support network and a place to live . Over their months spent in close quarters , the members of the youth council had bound themselves together not only as friends but as family . The stakes of dissolving the group had become obvious in a more immediate way , too : One of the youth runners had already attempted suicide and been rushed to the hospital in Bismarck . Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the camps emptied out , though , there were not enough resources for everyone to stay , and most of the young people dispersed for the winter , leaving behind a skeleton crew of 10 . Wise went home to Minneapolis to begin a job as an organizer for Honor the Earth , an indigenous environmental activist group . Grassrope went back to Lower Brule . Charger was couch-surfing with friends in Eagle Butte . But the I.I.Y.C. were in the process of setting up a 501 -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- , a nonprofit organization that would allow them to establish some formal order to what had been an ad hoc group . And in January , after a month apart , the I.I.Y.C. youths reunited in Washington for the mass protests against Donald Trump . They were still in Washington when the news came that he had signed executive orders allowing the Dakota Access and Keystone pipelines to proceed . After that , Jasilyn Charger made the trip back to Standing Rock . She planned to spend a couple of days there before heading south to Eagle Butte , where she would organize against the Keystone . He offered a practical reason as well : In December , back home in Denver , he got a call from a young person on the verge of suicide . Even if you feel no one loves you , no one cares about you , I love you , I care about you . I want to pray with you again . He paused .
