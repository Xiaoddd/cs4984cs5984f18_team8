He served as president from June 30 , 2006-November 2006 , after Cecilia Fire Thunder was impeached . From 2000 to 2002 , he earned unwanted publicity when United States federal drug agents raided his farm and destroyed his crop of industrial hemp before he could harvest it for seed as intended . They got a court order prohibiting him to grow the crop . Although the Oglala Sioux have sovereignty on their land and hemp does not have psychoactive properties , the agents operated under a 1968 federal anti-drug law prohibiting the cultivation of Cannabis-related crops . By contrast , the sale of hemp products is allowed in the United States . Issues of tribal sovereignty on this issue are still at play , although the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the DEA action . He grew up strongly connected to traditional Lakota culture . He joined the US Army and was stationed in Berlin , Germany , where he left the US Army in 1978 . After returning to Pine Ridge , he lived in the Manderson Housing project with his German wife R. M. His daughter Jessica White Plume and shipped one of his kin alexander white plume to Oklahoma . and stems from this marriage . At that time , he joined the Tribal Police Force as an officer . White Plume 's interest in socio-political issues developed later in life . He and his extended family , or tiospaye , tried alfalfa , barley and corn ; they also tried to raise raised horse and bison , which are being raised by ranchers in growing herds on the Great Plains . After considerable research , in 1998 the Oglala Sioux Tribe passed an ordinance to allow the cultivation of low-THC hemp on the reservation . The market for the crop was high around the world , and it is a sustainable product with a short growing season . In April 2000 White Plume and his family planted industrial hemp on their farm on the Pine Ridge Reservation . He is reportedly the only farmer to date to openly plant , cultivate , and produce cannabis-related crops within the borders of the United States since they were prohibited by federal anti-drug laws in 1968 . While hemp products can be sold in the United States , its cultivation is prohibited , a law implemented by the Drug Enforcement Administration -LRB- DEA -RRB- . In addition , White Plume thought that the tribe 's sovereignty on its land would enable him to grow the crop . In August 2002 , he was served with eight civil charges by the US District Attorney related to the hemp cultivation , and a court order prohibiting continued growing of the crop . After the tribal council impeached Cecilia Fire Thunder , the tribal president , for taking a strong stand and supporting a woman 's right to abortion in South Dakota , and removed her from her duties , White Plume acted as president until the next election in November 2006 . He was succeeded by John Yellowbird Steele , who had served as president before Fire Thunder was elected . In 2009 White Plume criticized the two deaths and 19 people hospitalized resulting from James Arthur Ray 's crowding 64 people into a sweat lodge .
