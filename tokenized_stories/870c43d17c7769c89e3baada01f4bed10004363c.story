That law enforcement have employed disproportionate force against water protectors is irrefutable ; and while Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier might technically be tasked with ensuring Dakota Access can proceed where legally permitted , he is indisputably responsible for protecting people exercising their First Amendment rights . It really breaks my heart . Monet explains despite the Emergency Management Assistance Compact -LRB- EMAC -RRB- , which mandates law enforcement nationwide to lend assistance during emergencies or disasters , Governor Steve Bullock had concerns the agreement was being misused . I have been in protest situations in my career and fully understand that in many cases law enforcement is placed in the middle of two emotional opposing interests and we have to attempt to balance our role as peace officer and law enforcement . Many of you emailed and called the Office to voice your concerns . As your Sheriff I was very humbled by the honest conversations we had . One of the biggest differences of an elected Sheriff from other law enforcement leaders is that I am directly accountable to the people I serve -LRB- YOU -RRB- and although I am personally torn knowing that people -LRB- Including Montanans -RRB- are hurting over there , we will not be responding . Finally I am incredibly grateful that we live in a place where we can have differences and talk about them respectfully as adults without conflict . Gootkin and the Gallatin County deputies never made it to North Dakota , but other departments briefly assisted the Morton County Sheriff , and then refused to complete planned rotations , pulled out , and never returned . However , water protectors and independent journalists on the scene contend law enforcement brutalized water protectors , disrespectfully disassembled tipis , and refused to allow anyone to gather their belongings . Some claimed when they returned to the scene much later , officers had carelessly thrown tents , clothing , and other items in a pile , leaving all of it damaged and soaked in what seemed to be ammonia and urine . In short , public pressure can be surprisingly effective . Some have since returned from those deployments while others may still be present in North Dakota . Considering the success of public outcry in forcing law enforcement to reconsider policing the Standing Rock movement to protect the water , following is the contact information from the websites for the appropriate North Dakota officials and law enforcement departments from all states , as listed by the ACLU .
