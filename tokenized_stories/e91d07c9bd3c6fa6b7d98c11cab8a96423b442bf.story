The Arctic is no stranger to oil and gas development . From 1979-1981 , Sami and Norwegian protests attempted to stop the construction of the Alta Dam in Norway . North Dakotan authorities want a pipeline because it will supposedly make shipping oil out of the state safer . Since June 2012 , more Bakken crude has been moved by rail than by pipeline due to a surge in production and resulting pipeline congestion . If the pipeline is not completed on time , rates will have to be renegotiated and DAPL may no longer be such a lucrative project . And in the North American Arctic and the Lower 48 , land is one thing that been guaranteed to many indigenous peoples through land claims agreements and settlements . The boundaries of Standing Rock were delineated in 1889 by the Dawes Act , a policy that had devastating consequences nationwide for Native Americans due to its attempt to break up the tribal system of societal organization . But it did guarantee them their rights to the land . To be fair , these projects often give jobs to native people . But they can also wreak havoc on their environment and precious resources even though they do not directly cut through their land . Pipelines placed anywhere near a water source are risky . Pipelines seem like quiet and sturdy infrastructures , but the protests in North Dakota are attempting to show that if one thing goes wrong , an entire way of life could be jeopardized . 2 . The proliferation of fossil fuel infrastructure If built , DAPL will perpetuate the spread of fossil fuel infrastructure across North America . But if there were an issue in the Arctic like DAPL that attracted the interests of both indigenous and environmental activists , it could be a lightning rod for global dissidents to come and support the movement . The events in North Dakota show that not all locals are happy about out-of-state and foreign activists coming to ally themselves with the cause . If a protest were to arise in the Arctic , it would generally be less feasible for allies and supporters of the movement to travel to the site given the sheer costs of getting up north . If DAPL is built , it will help secure and encourage the continued projection of oil from the Bakken formation . Both Bakken and Athabasca are high-latitude oil fields whose emissions can exacerbate Arctic warming . Many of the pollutants they release into the atmosphere come from the wasteful practice of gas flaring , which is done to get rid of excess oil that can not be economically shipped to market . The bright lights of gas flares can even be seen from space . Deepwater oil in the Gulf of Mexico is also considered unconventional , as is Arctic oil . Since at least 2008 , North American Arctic oil , especially in Canada where there is even less infrastructure to get product out to market than in Alaska , has been on the back burner . This is partly due to the glut created by the Bakken boom , which has made Arctic oil impossible to profitably extract . From North Dakota to the Arctic The plains of North Dakota may seem a long way away from the Arctic Ocean . Ultimately , it may be the longer staying power of the movement in North Dakota , which is centrally located within the U.S. , reachable by car , and , while cold , not insanely so in winter , which allows the NoDAPL protests to succeed . In the Arctic , similar movements might eventually have to come in from the cold . This post first appeared on Cryopolitics , an Arctic News and Analysis blog .
