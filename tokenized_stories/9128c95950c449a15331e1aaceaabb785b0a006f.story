No longer are network TV cameramen or newspaper photographers the only visual sources at crime scenes or in war zones -LRB- and anywhere in between -RRB- . The ubiquity of smartphones around the world has made everyone a potential witness and a potential broadcaster : the mother tweeting images from her home ravaged by conflict ; the celebrity who livestreams her own arrest ; the girlfriend who logs onto Facebook moments after her boyfriend was shot by police and shares the aftermath . Nor are they the most iconic ones , though all received a large amount of airtime . Rather , this is a glimpse into the ever-evolving methods of newsgathering . As a whole , they are a collective nod to the culture of sharing that defines our era . She was at the club with Mercedez Marisol Flores , a best friend , and had been posting a series of short clips throughout the night on her Snapchat account . It was in her final post that the crackle of gunfire is heard as the music blares . Alvear , in glasses , looks around and is visibly concerned before the video cuts out . More than a dozen gunshots are audible . Neither Alvear nor Flores made it out of Pulse alive . The effort , following a 15-hour filibuster attempt in the days prior , was led by Rep. John Lewis . In an interview with TIME , Clark said her frustration with congressional inaction on gun-control after Orlando prompted her to approach Lewis about a response . He suggested the sit-in . It began with the latest fatal police shooting of a black man , this time in Baton Rouge , La. . Alton Sterling was shot multiple times as he was pinned down by officers on July 5 outside a convenience store , where a claim had been made about a man selling CDs threatening someone with a gun . At least two videos of the encounter emerged , this one coming from Abdullah Muflahi , who owns the Triple S Food Mart . Muflahi said in a later interview that he quickly shot the video while standing directly behind Sterling , who is bleeding on the ground . So I kept this video for myself . The fatal shooting prompted days of intense protests , leading to an image that would rise as a symbol of the Black Lives Matter movement . The Department of Justice later said it would investigate the shooting . Reynolds was riding in a car with her young daughter and Castile in Falcon Heights on July 6 when he was pulled over at a traffic stop . In the 10-minute-long video , we hear an alarmingly calm Reynolds describe what happened before she began filming . We hear Reynolds decry her phone being taken away , impairing our eyes of what our ears could still gather . We hear her transition from witness to anchorwoman . All we could do was listen . In November , the officer who shot Castile , Jeronimo Yanez , was charged with three felonies : two counts of dangerous discharge of a firearm and second-degree manslaughter . Shortly afterward when the vehicle stopped , the officer peered in , finding two adults in the front seats , incapacitated by drugs , and a four-year-old boy in the backseat . The female passenger , who the officer noted had begun turning blue , was his grandmother . The adults were given Narcan , an overdose-preventing drug , then hospitalized and jailed ; the child was later placed with other family members . None of that is exactly news in this small town , among several hit hard by the American heroin epidemic . But it became national news the next day when the city posted the affidavit and graphic photos from the scene on its Facebook page . The blond boy in the backseat , wearing a bright blue and green stares at the camera . His face , and those of the adults , are not blurred out . The police department controversially went against standard practice to shield a victim in cases like this . We feel we need to be a voice for the children caught up in this horrible mess . The response to the photos were swift , ranging from pleas to stop sharing the pictures to understanding the necessity of showing sensitive scenes . Woodley , then 24 , was recording live on Facebook when she was detained . She later pleaded not guilty to one misdemeanor charge each of criminal trespassing and engaging in a riot . Writing for TIME , in her first full statement about the arrest , Woodley railed against federal treatment of Native Americans and called for solidarity with the water protectors . In early December , the government said it would search for alternative routes for the pipeline . The account was said to be managed by her mother , Fatemah , and gained international attention as the Syrian city collapsed around them . The first tweet came two days earlier . By December , more than 350,000 followers would keep up with the family . In between pictures and videos of Bana and her brothers , posts about the booms nearby and calls for prayers , there are moments when the war seems to fade , like the loss of a tooth . At one point , Fatemah and Bana called out to British author J.K. Rowling , wishing to read her Harry Potter books . The author later sent the girl e-books to read . For months , debate went back and forth over the authenticity of the posts . Some questioned why a girl under siege in Aleppo could speak passable English . At one point , Twitter denoted it with a blue checkmark , appearing to confirm its authenticity . On Dec. 19 , a tweet from the account announced Bana had been evacuated . The tweets until then offered a compelling and rare first-hand account inside the hell that became Eastern Aleppo as pro-government forces advanced on the parts of the city still under opposition control . Before her escape , they read like a long goodbye , never knowing if another 140 characters would come . For Bana , they did . Follow TIME LightBox on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .
