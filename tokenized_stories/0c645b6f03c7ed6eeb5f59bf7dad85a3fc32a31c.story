FILE PHOTO : A depot used to store pipes for Transcanada Corp 's planned Keystone XL oil pipeline is seen in Gascoyne , North Dakota , U.S. on January 25 , 2017 . Lawyers for opponents of the pipeline - which include landowners along the route - have argued that the commission was not permitted to approve anything but the original route TransCanada had requested in its application . The appeal was filed on Dec. 29 . A TransCanada official declined to comment . The proposed pipeline has been a lightning rod of controversy for nearly a decade , pitting environmentalists worried about spills and global warming against business advocates who say the project will lower fuel prices , shore up national security and bring jobs . The Trump administration granted TransCanada a federal permit for the pipeline in March , reversing a decision by former President Barack Obama to reject the project on environmental grounds . That left Nebraska - the only one of three states that had not approved a route for the line - as the final hurdle . TransCanada has said it expects enough commercial support to make the project viable , though it has not made a final investment decision .
