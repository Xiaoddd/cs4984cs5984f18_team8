The pipeline , scheduled to transport oil from North Dakota to Illinois , inspired massive demonstrations in 2016 and was dealt a major blow when the Obama administration denied a key permit for the project toward the end of his presidency .

Brian Walsh , an environmental scientist with the South Dakota department of environment and natural resources , said the spill was relatively minor and was caused by a mechanical failure at a surge pump . Standing Rock Sioux tribe chairman Dave Archambault II said the spill is another sign that the courts should intervene . The company and the state made no announcements about the spill after it occurred . Walsh said the department only releases public notices of spills when there is an imminent threat to a waterway or public health . A spokeswoman told the Associated Press that the corporation maintains that the pipeline is safe and that the leak was contained in the proper manner . The Associated Press also reported that no other Dakota Access spills have been documented in any other states . The company has fought in court to keep information about the status of the project confidential . Hasselman said these kinds of spills should be immediately disclosed .
