She has been involved in a variety of environmental groups including Greenpeace , the Save Happy Valley campaign and the Green Party . She has recently finished a Masters in New Zealand Literature and lives in Wellington . She is married to Green Party MP Gareth Hughes , but is proud to claim all her opinions as totally her own . Dunedin city councillor , former ACT MP Hilary Calvert . Hypocrisy -LRB- n -RRB- : the practice of claiming to have higher standards or more laudable opinions or beliefs than is the case . Oxford English Dictionary . Wrong : I support an oil-free future in the long term . I agree with divesting from oil exploration in the short term . Ultimately , I believe in moving from a fossil-dependent economy toward a sustainable and more environmentally-responsible economy . What underpins my stance is the reality of man-made climate change and the need for man-made societal change . However , there are people out there who would want me to believe that unless I am able to live my life , run my household , and raise my kids without utilising any products of our oil-dependent society , I have no right to demand anything different . They say to do so would mean that I am a hypocrite . Wrong . It is a tactic to shut you down . Unsurprisingly , many of these same people refuse to acknowledge that we are changing our climate , so reject also the responsibly we share in doing something about it . This is to tell you that it is ok to drive your car to an oil-free protest . Supporting an oil-free future is about wanting an alternative and when you passionately believe in the need for an alternative there will always be people who will fight for the status quo . The more threatened they are by your actions , the more defensive they become and the more desperate to shut you down . The truth is no matter which way you turn the reality of our extraction-dependent society is everywhere . We really should just give up . No . You have a right to demand alternatives to the only choices you have at this current moment . Do not be discouraged or shamed by people who say you can not live in society at the same time as you try and change how society is organised . Calling for a change is not hypocritical . It is the only rational thing to do . The overwhelming consensus of climate scientists tell us the problem is real , it is happening , and if we do not change it will get worse . If we do not lower our carbon emissions and replace our dependence on fossil fuels with alternatives that do not poison our atmosphere and endanger the delicate balance of our ecosystems , it will get worse . If we do not change it will get worse . What we are fighting for when we call for an oil-free future is progress . We want the call for progress to translate into action . We want the investment that is currently propping up unsustainable extraction industries to be diverted into solutions that move us toward a more sustainable fuel for our society . We want policies that transition us to a fossil-free future . We want more investment in sustainable transport infrastructure so that we can have alternatives to cars . This is why it is ok to drive your car to an oil-free protest . Because you are part of a movement of people who want change . Who want alternatives . Who want to change the grim trajectory we are hurtling along right now . Drive a mini-bus full of people . Join a convoy of cyclists . Pack out a bus , a train , walk , skateboard , paraglide in if you can . Then you would be a hypocrite . Because the other meaning of hypocrisy is believing in something and not doing anything to achieve it . A much higher chance of success as well . Log in to Reply Kiwiiano says : January 20 , 2014 at 10:30 pm Our society is so hopelessly addicted to fossil fuel it is impossible to do anything without it being involved somewhere . I could use charcoal to fire a clay pot , but the spade I used to dig the clay , the axe I chopped up the wood with , the magnifying glass I used to light the fire still needed fossil energy . The carbon footprint of the electrical infrastructure needed for even a severely constrained subset of our present lifestyles is still enormous . I suspect that the only alternative will be to ramp up a Manhattan Project research program in algae to find replacements for all the products we take for granted from coal , oil and gas . Log in to Reply Tom Bennion says : January 21 , 2014 at 12:32 am I agree that , given that climate change is hitting like a freight train , the argument made by Hilary Calvert is foolish and simply irrelevant . I also wonder how much emissions from transport would reduce if we went back to the 80 km hour open road speed limit . My guess is that the savings would be substantial , quite apart from the improvement to road safety . And the asphalt and concrete roads underneath it .

Log in to Reply Phil Scadden says : January 21 , 2014 at 10:51 am I want to put out of questions which I interest me much , because hydrocarbons research is some of what I do . This makes me very prone to mistaking reason for rationalization . It takes about 100,000 wells a year globally just to maintain the current level of oil supply . That is very quickly going to deliver a large price signal to the market . -LRB- this applying to any kind of mining really -RRB- . To me , the biggest issue for climate is coal , and specifically thermal coal . Its minor in NZ but a huge issue worldwide . You can ask the same question there . However , I think electricity production is much more easily substitutable from other sources than petrol and this would be a transition that most countries could do . If all new vehicles were electric , it would still take 15-20 years to make the transition . Log in to Reply John ONeill says : January 21 , 2014 at 1:40 pm Natural gas has taken over from coal as the largest source of electricity in the US , partly from new Environmental Protection Agency rules on carbon dioxide emissions , but largely from the current low gas prices . Unfortunately this has lowered the price of American coal , which is now being shipped to Europe and China instead . US natural gas prices are likely to rise ; fracked gas costs more to extract than it sells for , the decline in production is much steeper than for traditional wells , and no new fracking is going on except in association with oil drilling , or where drilling licences are lost if not used . Meanwhile gas prices in Europe and Asia are much higher ; once the American import facilities for LPG have been reconfigured for export , US prices will go up to match them . That might slow the surge in natural gas electricity generation ; plans to convert some of the truck fleet to LPG would probably continue . European coal consumption had been dropping till Germany closed half the nuclear reactors there ; subsequently hard coal imports and lignite production have rebounded . Of course all that is just a sideshow compared to the coal China is mining , importing and burning . Hopefully they can reduce the build time to about three years and triple their production rate .

Log in to Reply Bob Bingham says : February 1 , 2014 at 7:34 pm Oil is a fantastic fuel but it is not going to be cheap for much longer . I think we should start at the soft edges and start using small cheap electric cars for local transport and electrifying our trains and urban buses . As we get used to the new systems we can expand them . Its all about saving money and import bills . Oil is a fuel with a volatile price and I expect we will always need transport . Individual efforts can from this perspective be seen as more symbolic or exploratory rather than having an impact on reducing fossil fuel use . Without a credible carbon tax individual efforts can reduce demand hence price which can have a rebound effect . Especially considering the different planet when CO2 was 400ppm which would have taken 10,000 years to reach rather than 100 . Log in to Reply Phil Scadden says : January 21 , 2014 at 1:33 pm Well if we dont start , then we certainly wont . However , sudden withdrawal of FF and sudden climate change are both undesirable . It makes sense for the richer countries like ours to pull down FF very fast while developing nations can take longer . I do not think you can make the transition from FF for transportation is less than 30 years . -LRB- table 2.4 -RRB- . To make the transition from coal in 30 years would mean starting now too . Log in to Reply noelfuller says : January 21 , 2014 at 7:24 pm There are top down measures which affect the big picture and bottom up measures which are big for small parties but invisible in statistics . Thinking in terms of cutting production without cutting demand goes nowhere . Meanwhile I note Elon Musk -LRB- Tesla -RRB- says his proposed super lithium battery plant will recycle batteries and be solar powered and I applaud that . However , the lithium and other materials will still arrive with their carbon costs . Production chains as well as components belong in this picture . If we could see production chains in carbon cost terms we would strive to close the gaps by our own choices as well as demanding closure .

I would frankly be very surprised to hear of a Green politician advocating large families ; but I would also be very surprised to find any politician in a democracy suggesting legislative controls on family size . Way too voter sensitive . However , there is also the reality that our food sources -LRB- globally , not NZ -RRB- are very dependent on petroleum AT THE MOMENT . The critical question is how fast can we transition away from that while still increasing food production for the increasing population .

Needless to say , we should use these tools . Delaying use just pushes us closer to needing zero carbon in the future . Other developments may come to fruition and help us further reduce fossil fuel use , for instance reduction of metal ore . But pinning our hopes on what we may have in the future , while not doing what we can do now , is very silly . PS the homes that those white children could return to were probably as lice ridden as those of the native Americans . Add to that the draw of the novelty news story skewing the reporting of the respective events , happy to be home - v - not happy to be home . Soldier Blue was not a fly on the wall documentary you know . The Greens claim to be a social justice party . Agree it is . Read what Lincoln said on the slaves issue . You have to have the courage to make socially just decisions . Not on the scientific evidence , and its also not practically possible . You are making whats called a straw man argument . The technology already exists for low carbon , its a question of will power . Unfortunately our political and business leaders are steadfastly ignoring the problem , at best paying limp lip service , wasting time and money trying to maintain the status quo of infinite growth on a finite planet instead of making a serious attempt to ensure a viable alternative non-carbon economy . We will not end FF use this century I would think . But we can do a hell of a lot towards building alternatives wherever possible and practical . The incentive to build these and live a FF poor lifestyle will need to be created artificially unless somehow miraculously humanity would self-restrict FF use . This would need to come in some form of production quotas which are ramped down over a designed time scale . However , given our absolutely dismal record of negotiating international treaties on any of this so far , I am not holding my breath . I believe that the odds are very high that we will pull the trigger -LRB- if we not have done so already -RRB- to another grand extinction event . Only this time Homo Sapiens will be around to witness it and most likely have to go through Mad Max territory towards very long and very uncomfortable times . I suspect you underestimate the dependence of food production on oil worldwide and the difficulties in alternatives . You will notice that consumption of petroleum in NZ is rather insensitive to price because of the lack of available substitutes . Further carbon tax there isnt going reduce consumption that much and reduction in consumption is key to reducing petroleum exploration . Investment in oil exploration is driven by price while the price of oil is driven by consumption versus production . If you want to stop any form of mining , then stop the consumption of the product . Otherwise anti-mining protests tend to be mostly nimbyism . By contrast , a small amount of carbon tax -LRB- or even just the removal of FF subsidies -RRB- quickly make alternative generation better targets for investment compared to coal , and that is what is required to make reductions in emissions . Furthermore , targets of current exploration is gas . This is likely bound for LNG power-generation and I would say there is a good case to make for conventional gas like this being a lot better for climate than coal which it largely substitutes . But I liken the situation to you sitting with your family on the beach and suddenly the tide has gone way out & a siren is wailing up the coast a way . ultra-light vehicles -LRB- which may not even exist yet -RRB- while highlighting to need to get our act together on city planning , public transport and alternative energy . Log in to Reply Phil Scadden says : January 23 , 2014 at 10:13 pm Kiwiiano , I fully accept a tsunami is happening , but I dont think jumping up a cliff is the way to get escape . I do accept your suggested solutions . I dont accept the idea of trying to slow climate change by bans on mining . If you kill the demand , you will kill the mining . I would also posit that the most urgent , effective , fiscally and technically feasible solution to reducing emissions is getting off thermal coal . -LRB- I dont see a way to easily get off steel coal but if that is the only thing we use coal for , then the emissions are tolerable -RRB- . Now I admitted at start that I struggle with bias . I would be absolutely delighted to see petroleum exploration vanish because we didnt need it . In time , I sure it will happen . Shell thinks 2070 . I would like to think 2050 . But lets not underestimate how much effort is needed to maintain supply already . We need less that 50cc per passenger , in fact our ancestors going back forever would have regarded a -LRB- 50-125cc -RRB- Piaggio Ape -LRB- Bee -RRB- as an unbelievable luxury and I saw those cheerfully keeping up with traffic loaded with 6 Vietnamese and a cow . It would go a long way to reducing the consumption of steel if we down-sized our expectations for commuting . That will be hard to decarbonise , or to get people to vote against . Log in to Reply Phil Scadden says : January 24 , 2014 at 8:09 am John , I am surprised by that analysis . The new gas plants that I am aware of are mostly fast-starts which are a very useful compliment to wind farms . I wasnt aware of project cancellations due to gas generation and other reasons were presented for those two projects . It is of course possible to come up with renewable projects that are too costly compared to other sources -LRB- including other renewables -RRB- . While I fully agree that we waste petrol , it would seem that people just pay the cost and continue on the whole . I would add standards for fuel efficiency in cars into the mix . All measures which correctly deal with petroleum at the demand end rather than supply . shows electricity production in NZ . I see gas not changing much since around 1999 , while I see wind and geothermal rising and coal in decline . I havent found updated pricing for gas versus wind since 2004 when wind was slightly cheaper . I would be interested in an update . Log in to Reply jh says : January 23 , 2014 at 10:59 am To cut FF emissions we should start with housing and urban design . I would love to live in a new urbanist eco village . One of the problems human society faces is that huma bonding is limited to family or small groups anf peple need something to part with money - hence consumerism .

Acting locally not much help here . The 2 are not comparable . I agree with Meghan . You do not have to exit the system to comment on the system . We need to advocate for a renewably powered 21st Century .

Log in to Reply Phil Scadden says : January 27 , 2014 at 9:24 am Viv k , I am quite for protests that will result in less CO2 being emitted -LRB- eg by way of carbon tax , for afforestation etc -RRB- . I would expect economists to be able to model that . Previous constrictions on supplies should provide a good model for that will do for pricing . When supply is restricted , the price rises till enough users regard that as unaffordable and reduce consumption . A targeted carbon tax -LRB- ie in wealthy western nations -RRB- is more equitable than constriction on supply . Coal is the danger . As Hansen has pointed out , you can only do so much damage to climate with oil given the likely reserves . Not so with coal . The glaring omission is transport . Oil is running out and it has a volatile price so it would be prudent to have an alternative fuel and as I have already posted it makes good economic sense , even in the short term . As they are finding in the Northern hemisphere events are happening faster than predicted and so it pays to get started early . Log in to Reply Phil Scadden says : January 28 , 2014 at 9:07 am An alternative to oil for transportation is badly needed , but I dont think NZ government can do a lot in the short term to bring this about .

Log in to Reply Bob Bingham says : January 29 , 2014 at 5:51 pm Nothing is going to happen quickly but time is running out . We have passed peak oil and the Chinese and Indians want to drive cars so the price will become volatile . When it happens its too late to make changes which is why we have to start now . We can electrify our railways and have electric urban transport . Log in to Reply Phil Scadden says : January 30 , 2014 at 8:52 am Good question . I suspect most of that is used by trucks but lets assume half of that is for rail and urban transport . -LRB- and hopefully more wind and hydro too -RRB- . To make much of a dent in that without electric cars , you need to get a LOT more use of public transport . I have a viable plan for small scale economic electric car production which is a different route to the American model and would be a good start to get things going . It explains why Fossil Fuels should be eliminated from the global economy . It also shows that the best choice of fuels for cars , trucks , ships , aircraft , agricultural and construction equipment is petrol , diesel and fuel oil . We can manufacture carbon neutral hydrocarbons and leave fossil fuels in the ground . We have proven technology , and we have a workable plan . Log in to Reply Bob Bingham says : February 2 , 2014 at 5:29 pm Whatever fuel we use we need to start converting our transport to renewable . It seems a worthwhile financial proposition to aim for . The actual no . Useful discussion needs accurate numbers . Its not a figure I can relate to in everyday life so I did not notice the error . Its still a lot of money which we could save without changing our lifestyle . I think we should be working towards it because it takes time to convert and its best to get started before we have a problem rather than wait until it overtakes us . Another method of B2L conversion involves subjecting the plant matter to supercritical water , with temperatures over 374 degrees C and pressures above 200 atmospheres . It appears to work considerably more cheaply for coal than wood though . So far the biofuels story has been a disaster . Big Ag in the USA used their political clout to mandate alcohol from corn , with little if any reduction in CO2 emissions , but a huge impact on world food prices . The forest is often growing on peat , many metres deep , which has been sequestering huge quantities of CO2 for thousands of years . Now it is drying out and burning , fouling the air all over South-East Asia and totally eclipsing any advantage from reduced oil use . Recent research has shown that trees , as they get older , keep increasing their drawdown of CO2 ; the best thing to do with forests is just let them do their thing . Wood as a fuel gives out about the same heat as coal per gram of CO2 , but it uses more labour and area to collect . The timber industry has also been killing its workers at a rate only rivalled by the coal mining industry .

We are not short of energy from other sources and I believe we would have found a different way to power our society and would probably would have ended up at the same level as we are today but a bit cleaner . We would still have cut down the trees and have factory farming and many other destructive activities but with a much smaller amount of CO2 . Of course population growth would have been much slower in the absence of abundant energy . There is no other crop that can double its mass overnight .

Log in to Reply Kiwiiano says : February 7 , 2014 at 9:57 pm An eloquent tome indeed , Thomas , thank you for passing it onto us . May I second your offering with a thread drifting into what alternatives may befall us once the Age of Gasoline is past . Something envisaged by Steam Punk enthusiasts , perhaps . He has an intriguing thought that reminds me of the TV program back in the day about how seemingly tiny events changed history . It so happened that the winds in those weeks kept the English fleet stuck in port while William of Orange carried out the last successful invasion -LRB- so far -RRB- of England by a foreign army . As a direct result , the reign of James II gave way to that of William III , and Britain dodged the absolute monarchy , religious intolerance , and technological stasis that Louis XIV was imposing in France just then , a model which most of the rest of Europe promptly copied . I admit the crash of the global financial system is not a tiny event , but hopefully humanity will stagger on . In the mean time stock up on garden hoes , two-man saws and slide rules . We are not alone , methinks . Uranium has an energy density several thousand times that of oil , and thorium about the same . That energy density has already effectively abolished war between technologically advanced countries . No one will even invade a pissant little country like North Korea , because however much the latest Kim annoys them , he has enough energy available to inflict unacceptable damage . That energy density is enough to nullify any counter-arguments . The quantities needed , and the energy resulting , are respectively so small and so huge that we should be right for thousands of years . About the size of a drink can , per person , per lifetime , at US levels of energy squandering . The energy is there , it just needs enough people to figure out how to get it . You can make liquid fuels , just as you make electricity . With enough heat and pressure , all that is needed is a feedstock of carbon and hydrogen . Using biomass for that is possible , though it means collecting from a low density source ; using coal would not be as bad as if the coal also supplied the energy , but is no way to get atmospheric greenhouse gases on a steep downward trend . The US navy is working on making jet fuel out of sea water . The density of carbon in seawater is about 140 times that in air ; by using an electrochemical cell , most of this , plus hydrogen gas , can be extracted and processed into hydrocarbons . Hopefully most industry and shipping can be converted to electricity or direct nuclear power , but synthetic fuels can be made for the rest . A high energy advanced society with low or negative emissions is certainly possible . Whether it will happen before the climate feedbacks really kick in is the real question . Log in to Reply Thomas says : February 8 , 2014 at 9:20 am Considering the enormous challenge of transforming a sizable part of the worlds energy provision away from FFs to Solar , we must advance fast in any case . The rest being taken up by support structures , cables , inverters and so on and of cause the wages for the planing , provision and installation of the same . We are close to a plateau therefore , where waiting for future revolutions in solar tech will deliver diminishing returns to the investor . Therefore , its time to install now , as long as perhaps savings or employment earnings can support the same . As the risk of the later evaporating in due course is much greater than the promise of the next generation of collectors materializing . In the same thread of thought : Grid tie systems , as great as they are now , depend on a functioning grid . Given the relentless stupidity of much of humanity , I fear not . Never mind , given 100 million years or so , some descendant of a rat currently eating an endangered species out in the bush will achieve sentience and the whole mess can start again .

This is why I keep banging on about converting our transport to electricity . Oil can go up in price overnight and how long does it take to electrify a railway or convert our city buses to electric . And the World economy will be in chaos . If we started now we would be in much better shape when oil prices spike . We are not short of energy and our electricity companies have a market that is not expanding and yet there is this huge market called transport that they are not exploiting . The electricity companies need to find new markets fast .
