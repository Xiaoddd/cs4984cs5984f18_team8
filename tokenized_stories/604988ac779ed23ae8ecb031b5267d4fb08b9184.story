The town has hired a law firm to stop the pipeline from being built through the community . Last month , construction on the 800-mile Rover pipeline discharged more than two million gallons of a clay-like substance used for drilling into wetlands in a rural area about an hour south of Cleveland . Last week , the state sent a proposed order , requiring a contingency plan to prevent future spills and outlining penalties . ETP denied any wrongdoing in a statement emailed to ThinkProgress . The company also said that clean up was nearly complete . It does not deny that the spill occurred . The permitting process for pipelines crossing state boundaries is complicated and involves input from states as well as numerous federal bodies , including , depending on where the line goes , the Army Corps of Engineers , the Forest Service , and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -LRB- FERC -RRB- , which serves as the lead agency . These are exactly the kind of incidents and actions that worry environmentalists who are trying to stop pipelines going through sensitive areas . Improvements in hydraulic fracturing technology and horizontal drilling have spurred a boom in natural gas extraction in the Marcellus Shale basin under Ohio , Pennsylvania , and West Virginia , as well as an uptick in Oklahoma and Texas , which were already big oil and gas producers . When finished , the Rover pipeline will bring 3.25 billion cubic feet of gas each day from the region through West Virginia , Ohio , and Michigan to Ontario , Canada .
