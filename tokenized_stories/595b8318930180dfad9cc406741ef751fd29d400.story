A new report from a Stanford University lecturer predicts oil prices could collapse permanently as soon as four years from now , as electric cars and ride-hailing fleets bring a rapid end to the age of the personal combustible-engine vehicle . Using economic models based on existing technologies , the report predicts that ride-hailing services will be cheaper than owning a car by 2021 . A large oil refinery along the Athabasca River near Fort McMurray in Alberta 's oilsands . Canada 's oilsands risk becoming economically unviable as the world shifts to ride-hailing and electric vehicles , a new report says . Ride-sharing services like Uber will become more affordable than personal car ownership relatively soon , according to a report from Stanford University lecturer Tony Seba . As ride-hailing becomes more popular , more companies will jump into the market , making it more competitive . That , in turn , will convince ride-hailing companies to switch to driverless cars , making ride-hailing even more affordable . Uber and Lyft are already working on driverless car technology , as are Apple and Google 's parent company , Alphabet . The auto manufacturing industry , including the General Motors plant in Oshawa , Ont. , could come under severe pressure in the age of ride-hailing . Meanwhile , the costs of manufacturing combustible-engine cars will start going up , as they become less common . Auto manufacturing will collapse by 70 per cent between 2020 and 2030 , the report predicts . The number of cars in the U.S. will plummet from 247 million to 44 million in the same period . It will become next to impossible to sell a used fossil-fuel car , the report predicted . And the decrease in transportation costs will save households so much money it will be like a 10-per-cent pay raise , the report estimates . Ivan Glasenberg , CEO of Angle-Swiss commodity company Glencore , says the electric car revolution is happening faster than people think . The argument that this seminal shift in transportation will show up earlier than thought is gaining in popularity . Ivan Glasenberg argued there is plenty of opportunity for natural resource economies in the world of electric cars , which use batteries that require copper , nickel and cobalt . He noted that sales of alternative-fuel cars in Europe were up 36 per cent in the first quarter of this year .
