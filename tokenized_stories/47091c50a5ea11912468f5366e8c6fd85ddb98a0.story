Photo : Reuters At least 2 dozen arrested at main protest camp blocking Dakota Access pipeline The Associated Press , Feb 23 , 2017 Police in full riot gear began arresting Dakota Access pipeline opponents who remained in a protest camp in North Dakota on Thursday in defiance of orders to leave . A helicopter and an airplane flew overhead . Officers checked structures and began arresting people , putting them in vans to take to jail . About two dozen people were arrested in the first half hour of the operation , according to Levi Bachmeier , an adviser to Gov. Doug Burgum . The operation began shortly after authorities said Army Corps officials had met with camp leaders . The Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux , whose reservation is downstream , say the pipeline threatens their drinking water and cultural sites . Dallas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners disputes that .

Burgum estimated Wednesday night that as many as 50 people remained in the camp . Police early Thursday said an additional 15 crossed a frozen river and entered the camp on foot . Before authorities moved in , Burgum had said those remaining at the camp still had a chance to leave without facing charges . No one took advantage of the offer Thursday , Bachmeier said . Only nine people used the centre Wednesday , he said . The Corps had warned that the protesters need to leave the site before the spring melt floods the land and spreads debris from the camp downriver . Early Wednesday , protesters burned some wooden structures on the site in what they described as a leaving ceremony . Authorities said about 20 fires were set and a seven-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl were taken to hospitals to be treated for burns . Shortly before the 2 p.m. deadline to leave , about 150 people marched out of the soggy camp , singing and playing drums as they walked down a highway , carrying an American flag hung upside-down . New camps popping up Some of the protesters were focused on moving off federal land and away from the flood plain into other camps . Matthew Bishop , from Ketchikan , Alaska , packed up Wednesday and said he too was headed to a camp on private land . Bookmark the permalink . Leave a comment . account .
