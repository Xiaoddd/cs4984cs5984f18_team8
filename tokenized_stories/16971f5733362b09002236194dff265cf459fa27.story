The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which manages the federal land where the main camp protesting the Dakota Access pipeline is located , said it would close public access to the area north of the Cannonball River , including to protesters . It said this was partly to protect the general public from violent confrontations between protesters and law enforcement that have occurred in the area . Those who stay could face prosecution for trespassing , the Corps said in a letter to tribal leaders on Friday . Organizers told a news conference on Saturday at the main protest site where about 5,000 people are camped that they had no intention of moving . There are smaller camps on land not subject to the planned restrictions , including an area south of the Cannonball River where the Corps said it was establishing a free-speech zone . Slideshow -LRB- 10 Images -RRB- Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault said he received notice on Friday about the decision in a letter from Colonel John Henderson , an Army Corps district commander . Archambault said the best thing the federal government could do for safety is deny the easement for the pipeline . Archambault said he did not see the letter as a forced eviction and the tribe would continue to exercise its First Amendment rights to free speech . The tribe is working on a location on reservation land should people choose to go there , he said . The companies say the pipeline would carry Bakken shale oil more cheaply and safely from North Dakota to Illinois en route to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries . The 1,172-mile -LRB- 1,885-km -RRB- project is mostly complete except for the segment planned to run under Lake Oahe less than half a mile north of Standing Rock . The Obama administration in September postponed final approval of a permit required to allow tunneling beneath the lake , a move intended to give federal officials more time to consult with tribal leaders . But the delay also led to escalating tensions over the project . Last weekend , police used water hoses in subfreezing weather in an attempt to disperse about 400 activists near the proposed tunnel excavation site . Demonstrators plan a march at noon Sunday in Washington , from the Department of Justice to the Washington Monument .
