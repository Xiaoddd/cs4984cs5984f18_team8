This must be circularised over the coming year before the mission can begin full science operations . But scientists have taken the opportunity of some close passes to the planet in recent days to check out the TGO 's instrumentation . The width of the image is around 25 km There is delight at the quality of the pictures returned from camera system , CaSSIS -LRB- the Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System -RRB- . TGO sensors NOMAD and ACS also came through their early tests successfully . These are the sensors that will make a detailed inventory of Mars ' atmospheric gases . Methane is the main focus . From previous measurements , its concentration is seen to be low and sporadic in nature . But the mere fact that it is detected at all is really fascinating . The simple organic molecule should be destroyed easily in the harsh Martian environment , so its persistence - and the occasional spikes in its signal - indicate a replenishing source of the gas . The speculation is that it could be coming from microbial life somewhere on the planet . It will be CaSSIS 's job to look for possible geological forms on the surface that might tie into methane sources . A fourth instrument , FREND -LRB- successfully tested in recent days , too -RRB- , will sense hydrogen in the near-surface . This data can be used as a proxy for the presence of water or hydrated minerals . This again is information that could yield answers to the methane question . TGO was the unspoken success on the day Esa 's Schiaparelli lander crashed into Mars . The surface probe had been dropped off at the Red Planet by TGO and was making its ill-fated descent just as the satellite took up its parking orbit . The successful insertion almost went unnoticed in the fuss over Schiaparelli . TGO is the first phase in a joint venture at Mars that Europe is undertaking with Russia . The second step in this project known as ExoMars is to put a robot rover on the planet in 2021 . Research ministers from Esa member states are meeting this week in Lucerne , Switzerland , to try to resolve this budget problem . Seeing TGO perform so well should at the very least give the politicians a warm feeling as they push through their difficult discussions .
