News of the charges adds to growing concerns that law enforcement is aggressively monitoring , arresting and prosecuting people affiliated with the anti-pipeline movement . The Guardian recently reported that an FBI terrorism task force has attempted to contact at least three people tied to the demonstrations . Matthew Crane , one of five founding members of VeteransRespond , was pulled over last Friday night when he was arriving to Standing Rock with two other vets and a fourth passenger . The group got lost on a closed road , he said , and they were trying to find officers to get directions .

He lives in New York , where medical cannabis is also legal . On Thursday , police in Mobridge , South Dakota , arrested two individuals that officials claimed were VeteransRespond members .

Biolette and his friend were taken to jail in Selby , South Dakota . In a phone interview Monday night , Biolette said he spent four nights in jail and was released earlier in the day . He said that police pulled him over for speeding about six miles above the limit and that when he revealed he was going to Standing Rock , the officer launched a search . He said the hash oil is his prescribed medication , which he uses for PTSD and major depressive disorder . Biolette , who is now getting support from VeteransRespond members who picked him up from jail , said police still have his vehicle with all of his possessions , including his cold-weather clothing . Nonetheless , he was still planning on Monday night to go to Standing Rock , which he also visited last year . VeteransRespond has said it intends to help Standing Rock leaders on camp with a range of responsibilities , including cleanup efforts , kitchen help and medical aid .
