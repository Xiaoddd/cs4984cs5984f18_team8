There is a budgeted line item cost list prepared by architects , engineers , and general contractors . We have crews ready to begin construction once shipments of materials arrive . MNI WICONI SUSTAINED COMMUNITY is an offering for the future of these Youth . The donations given have given us courage that the first phases of this project will indeed be possible . With the strong collaboration of Standing Rock Tribal leadership and departments , we have made quick progress . Also , the Construction Management Team led by Mike & Jake at KURUKS were able to get a survey the site for boundary and topographic data , as well as grab soil samples for testing for strength & percolation . Thanks to the Intertribal Council on Utility Policy -LRB- iCOUP -RRB- we also saw the first load of straw bales arrive to build Security Shelters . Additionally , some structures were brought in that will be used for construction operations and storage during construction . A BRIEF HISTORY There have been a few inquiries about this project in regards to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , and all of the other activities involved with the other camps and actions happening every week . First and foremost , it should be noted this project was brought forth , sanctioned by , and is watched over by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe -LRB- SRST -RRB- . The SRST Council voted to set aside the land in October 2016 . Since then , the SRST Administration , along with SRST key departments & stakeholders , has worked together to ensure the land has the proper clearances , and has been inspected by the Tribal Historic Preservation Office . The location of this land is within the jurisdiction of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , and more specifically , within the Cannon Ball District . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has established project parameters and partners . Tribal Councilman Cody Two Bears -LRB- Cannon Ball District -RRB- has been appointed as the Project Representative to interface with a group of organizations and entities brought together by the Indigenous Environmental Network -LRB- IEN -RRB- in support of the SRST to take this project forward into reality . The design , planning , engineering , and construction efforts are overseen by IEN and the SRST , with the SRST having ultimate authority . It is important to underscore this project will be built on tribal lands , with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe being the primary authority having jurisdiction . This being a legacy project intended to serve as a sacred space for many generations of indigenous gatherings and teachings , it is important to create this space in areas that are well established within the SRST jurisdictions of today , while continuing to uphold and defend aboriginal homelands and Treaty Territories . For those seeking more details and clarification , please contact the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Administrative Offices . Also , you may wish to interact with the Indigenous Environmental Network -LRB- IEN -RRB- through through their Social Media Outlets . Please try again . I love this idea & effort . Sharing to spread the word . Donating to help make it happen . This will forever be remembered as a significant moment for Native Americans throughout the states . I applaud any tribal government that looks to honor tradition in an effort to improve the lives of indigenous people . You begged us to come , I brought thousands of dollars , a car , lots of medical supplies , but thank fully Indidnt give to you , you are traitors . Look at your shame , still begging for help while you throw yournown people in jail . I have lived all over always trying to find a place to fit in . Even feeling out of place at my own reservation . I have relatives at standing rock that I do n't know too well but would like to get to know better . I have camped at oceti sakowin 5 x 's and hope to spend the nite on the 17th as our office will be in town for a 1 day workshop at the college . I am going on 60 yrs . old and have some knowledge of gardening organically and herbal and homeopathic remedies . am not afraid of hard work and have always been an activist and a veteran of yellow thunder camp from the early 80 's . Behind the computer , the T-shirt , the vacuum cleaner is an industrial infrastructure fired by energy -LRB- fossil fuels mainly -RRB- . Each component of our car or refrigerator has an industrial history . Mainly unseen and out of mind , this global industrial infrastructure touches every aspect of our lives . It pervades our daily living from the articles it produces , to its effect on the economy and employment , as well as its effects on the environment . Solar and wind energy collecting devices and their auxiliary equipment have an industrial history . They are an extension of the fossil fuel supply system and the global industrial infrastructure . If we teach people that these solar devices are the future of energy without teaching the whole system , we mislead , misinform and create false hopes and beliefs . They are not made with magic wands . This must be one of the mantras for survival now and tomorrow . There are multiple questions that a realistic assessment of the future of these devices requires . Not , why or what do we want this electricity for . This must be one of the mantras for survival now and tomorrow . He is an Earthbag building Wizard and keen to help . I 'm so inspired by what you are doing . Also very excited about the recent news of the Army Corps of Engineers denying the easement of the Dakota Access Pipeline . I 'm interested to hear your thoughts about what will happen in the future with this movement . It raised a serious question in my mind . I would never disrespect the elders or tribe by going ahead with a project like this without their approval and support . I did n't share to FB because of this . I contacted the people who put up this go-fund-me thing asking for some kind of reassurance and have received none . I 'm going to go ahead and assumethe tribe and elders have approved and support this project and share to my social media network .
