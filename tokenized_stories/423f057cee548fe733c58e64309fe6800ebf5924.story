Protect the land of all evil . But still they send the enemies - To break the Treaties that we hold . Im camping out in Cannonball in Tipis , call us Radicals . Tired of the lies my people feeling stressed its post Traumatic . Boarding schools , its rape and murder . Torture chambers in the attic . Trying to protect waters from a corrupt Government . Pepperspray me in my Colin Kaepernick jersey . listen to me now , believe me when your family is thirsty . Thank you .
