We are concerned with numerous reports and testimony regarding the use of military-style equipment and excessive force against protesters . Protesters have a constitutional right to peacefully assemble and lawfully express their concerns about the environmental and cultural impacts of the pipeline . Our concerns are compounded by the disproportionate police use of excessive force against Native Americans , who are more likely than any other racial group to be killed by police .1 We call upon federal , state , and local officials and law enforcement to work together to deescalate the situation and guarantee the safety of protesters to exercise their First Amendment rights . We are currently preparing an update to the report , to formulate actionable recommendations for improving the lives of the first Americans . As part of this update , the Commission heard from Native experts and advocates about serious problems in Indian country including the lack of support for education , drug treatment , law enforcement , employment , transportation to civic centers for jobs , and healthcare . The federal government has an important role to ensure Indian tribes and individuals have a meaningful opportunity to participate and be heard in decisions that affect their lives . The pipeline also poses a threat to the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux , which raises issues of environmental justice and the lack of power of marginalized communities to have a say in the environmental health of their communities . State and local government receive the economic and tax benefits from infrastructure development , while Tribes are left with the environmental impact and little resources to monitor and respond to environmental risks . Martin R. Castro , chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights The Department of Justice , the Department of the Army , and the Department of the Interior have asked the pipeline company to voluntarily stop construction of the pipeline . The Environmental Protection Agency , Department of Interior , and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation have also called for additional environmental studies . We agree with and support the efforts . Finally , last week the Army Corps announced it will engage in further discussions with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and conduct additional analysis . We are encouraged by this development and call for a full Environmental Impact Study of the pipeline . Drink no poisoned water , eat no poisoned food and breath no poisoned air5 . Love and cherish each other and your animals every day . Be generous , honest and vigilant about your dealings . Honor and respect the spirits of your ancestors as you journey through life . May the peace you hold in your heart quell the pain , the fears and ghosts of your mind . I stand with The People of Standing Rock . I stand with The People of Puerto Rico . I stand with The People of the Aleutian Islands . izopnyde Leroy Pena 2 years ago Martin Castro is latino , latinos have indigenous blood.Just like Congressman Raul Grijalva of Arizona , who has done the most for native causes like Oak Flat and Standing Rock . Anita Witte 2 years ago Criminal charges should be brought against The Governor , Morton County Sheriff and all employees under the supervision of the sheriff and the County officials as well . Kelcey Warren should be arrested as well . Trespassing on Native land and the destruction of this land and sacred sites . They all ahve grossly broken the law ethically , criminally , and morally . Assault on unarmed people in most petty and violent ways is very criminal . This needs to stop and these people need to be charged . Period . Dale Knutson 2 years ago The pipeline company who moved to destroy burial ground is pretty well guilty too . I live in GA. . This is with me 24 hrs a day every day . Since around puberty when I 1st saw a real story I rejected the system . Their Homes . This has stirred me unbearably . I cry and want to fight . I believe Trumps friendship can be won . I might be wrong but I do . It could be the start of a healing , oh I wish . My dream . Embrace the Indian and their culture and their history . I too am in GA. . Years ago I lived on the Colville Confederated Tribes Reservation , near 8 years , did most of high school there . I still have quite a few native friends out there . As a white boy on the Rez I was afforded some mutual discrimination , which over time I understood more and to this day never held a grudge over . I learned plenty . Imagine that shoulder length light blonde hair through high school years . I am nearly 60 years old currently . I am so pleased to read this , this action gives me hope for our country , for mankind . More so from the way previous white men -LRB- none of my relations -RRB- have f. . ked up their word by disregarding the treaties that were in place . I welcome this move in the right direction by our government . This fast-track permitting process is used to bypass more rigorous environmental and public review for major pipeline infrastructure projects by treating them as smaller projects . NWP was never intended to authorize massive pipeline infrastructure projects and that that kind of permitting authority should no longer exist . Instead , the Environmental Collective argued that federal agencies should be required to issue Clean Water Act Section 404 permits and do a broader environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act -LRB- NEPA -RRB- . This , of course , was ignored . Also the people who were using the dogs to attack the people also should be charged for letting the dog go and attack a person . Not one . Not one . When I was a boy the Sioux owned the world ; the sun rose and set on their land ; they sent ten thousand men to battle . Yet , they say I am a thief . Hypocrites , from the President on down to this very day . The Water Protectors are revealing something that has gone on too long . TribalMember and Proud of it . 2 years ago This entire disgraceful , disgusting situation SHOULD CAUSE NATIVE AMERICANS TO FEEL A HUGE OUTPOURING OF SADNESS because it has happened before . IT SHOULD remind of us of our dear Ancestors . Then , after we have felt all we can possibly feel coming from within our bear spirits , we stand and fight . Our fighting though , is NOT THE PHYSICAL TYPE , it is A SPIRITUAL FIGHT . We fight against this evil on our knees and with our minds , in HEARTFELT NON-STOP PRAYERS . It was done in massive numbers in Thailand and France one year . All life is sacred and this world is abundant for all -LRB- Dark forces are trying to divide and make it a political appearance which it is not -RRB- . Stay optimistic for our new home planet : creators from the One Creator . First of all the phenomenal Gathering of First Nations , over 300 district tribal governing entities across Indian Country , its worldwide support , and inclusion of other tribal nations traveling to Standing Rock from different parts of the global to stand in solidarity with the young runners who originally opposed the Dakota Access Pipeline to Washington , D.C. . This massive gathering also afforded the Native Americans to tell the world about the demonic perpetration in atrocities to our ancestors and the immeasurable contributions we have made to mankind . It was a 10-year Comprehensive Plan . Also this IRMP , Section 3 identified and designated preservation of sacred burial grounds and culture sites from desecration . Had the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe completed its IRMP , DAPL would not have taken place nor its sacred burial sites desecrated . The required documents i.e. Environmental Assessment or environmental impact or any environmental justice issues would have been included in the Comprehensive Plan ; 5 -RRB- This Commission needs to assess the government-to-government relationship between the SRST and the State of North Dakota due to several Tribal Constitutional violations .
