Scientists have long known that , until fairly recently , the massive Sahara Desert was once verdant and teeming with life , until some 6,000 years ago , when rains ended and the desert became as it is today . The exact cause of the meteorological shift has been a subject of much study in recent years , as earth scientists believe it could teach us much more about the history of the planet 's climate , as well as the evolution of early human civilizations in the region . A 1997 paper suggested that the shift was a natural consequence of the withdrawal of the glaciers , and has been , until now , traditionally considered to be the most credible explanation . Some 8,000 years ago , humanity had undergone the Neolithic Revolution , as a result of the invention of farming . Humans , building farms and domesticating animals , allowed livestock to eat large amounts of plants , which lowered the amount of Saharan vegetation . Plants do more than make oxygen , as they also cool the Earth by absorbing sunlight via photosynthesis . A decrease in the number of plants over a large area can increase that region 's albedo -LRB- the amount of sunlight that reflects off the surface of a planet -RRB- . When the Sahara 's albedo rose , the surrounding atmosphere changed , enough to cause the monsoons that provided water to become far less prevalent . The drying of the Sahara caused plants to die , further increasing the albedo , further weakening the rains . This continued until early humans packed their bags and left for Egypt and Sumer , to start the first complex civilizations . Wright formed his hypothesis by collecting archaeological evidence from ancient pastoral communities in the area . It is very difficult to model the effect of vegetation on climate systems . He also mentioned that similar phenomena occurred elsewhere in the world in Europe , North America , and New Zealand . If early humans could have such an enormous impact on the climate , it begs the question of what a vastly more numerous and advanced people , such as ours , could do to our planet .
