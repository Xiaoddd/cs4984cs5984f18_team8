Of course , Sanders , like our president-elect , the Marigold Manchurian Candidate , can rightly lay claim to scoring huge , albeit majorly melanin-deficient , crowds that found kinship in campaigns rallying against a corrupt political system . So , while Sanders was successful in pushing political foe Hillary Rodham Clinton to more progressive stances , he was never a real threat to her campaign . Not only that , but he failed to make real inroads with the folks whose backs the Democratic Party stands on . This is the part where you conjure an image of a black auntie . Following the stunning win of the hatemonger and Republican nominee for president in the 2016 election , Sanders regurgitated the very rhetoric that made him a distant-second-place primary loser in the first place . Hillary Clinton ran an unsuccessful campaign , but to say she ran a bad campaign is disingenuous . According to the results of Wisconsin , Pennsylvania and Michigan , sure . Advertisement That said , Clinton had nearly 3 million more votes than our president-elect and lost by about 80,000 votes in three states heavily affected by voter suppression , an issue that the likes of Sanders and others failed to truly speak on , at their own peril . Clinton achieved this feat despite a media consumed by a nonissue about her email server as it gleefully reported on stolen material secured through hackers so ordered by the Russian government . The man is not saying anything new or remotely insightful . Clinton performed far better than he arguably ever could have with a diverse coalition that he never enjoyed or made a real effort to build . Advertisement To wit , during a recent town hall with CNN , Sanders was asked if the Democrats , like the Republicans immediately following the swearing-in of President Barack Obama , should obstruct the new commander in chief . Republicans were wrong to obstruct Obama , especially when you consider how willing he was to compromise for the sake of the greater good . We see how well that turned out . Now , as we look at a man building an administration very much in line with the demagoguery and exploitation his campaign was known for , Sanders is scolding Democrats based on mythology while pretending that he can get something down with the bigot ruler-in-waiting . He likes the attention too much for that . At this point , he very much just enjoys the sound of his own voice and the attention . And in hindsight , I wish I had never donated to his campaign . I should have put that money toward a catfish dinner . We are working to restore service .
