Those participating received a bus ticket , a hotel room voucher , and supplies . Fong told me that four hotel rooms at the Comfort Inn in Bismarck had been checked out to protesters . She said state officials were monitoring social media traffic last night urging the protesters with the rooms to invite other activists there to vandalize them . UPDATE : Fong now tells me that a total of five bus tickets were given out , only three were used . I am working on getting a police report for the incident and will update this post when I have it . Closure of the transition program was also confirmed with Mike Nowatzki , spokesman for Governor Doug Burgum .
