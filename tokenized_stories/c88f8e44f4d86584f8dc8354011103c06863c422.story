The government was notified late in the afternoon on Friday , and 170,000 liters have since been recovered , said Doug McKnight , assistant deputy minister in the Ministry of the Economy , which regulates pipelines in Saskatchewan . Oil pipelines are viewed by the oil-rich provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan as a critical lifeline to move crude to the coast , but they have drawn fierce opposition from environmental and indigenous groups . The spill came seven months after another major incident in Saskatchewan , in which a Husky Energy Inc pipeline leaked 225,000 liters into a major river and cut off the drinking water supply for two cities . It was not immediately clear how the current incident happened or which company owns the underground pipeline that leaked the oil . The incident happened in the lands of the Ocean Man First Nation 140 km -LRB- 87 miles -RRB- southeast of the provincial capital of Regina , according to the province . McKnight said the spill has been contained in the low-lying area in which it was discovered . Ocean Man Chief Connie Big Eagle said the spill was 15 meters -LRB- 50 feet -RRB- in diameter on Friday . Ocean Man has 540 residents , one-third of whom live on the reserve , Big Eagle said . She said an area resident who had smelled the scent of oil for a week located the spill and alerted her on Friday . The chief said there are no homes near the spill but it is about 400 meters -LRB- 1,320 feet -RRB- from the local cemetery . Get the latest Oil WTI price here . All rights reserved .
