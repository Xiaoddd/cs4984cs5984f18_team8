Having confirmed Trump 's support for the pipeline -LRB- not to do with his investments -RRB- , Reuters reports a Trump advisory group proposes the politically explosive idea of putting oil-rich Indian reservation lands into provate ownership . And now , as Reuters reports , a group of advisors to President-elect Donald Trump on Native American issues wants to free those resources from what they call a suffocating federal bureaucracy that holds title to 56 million acres of tribal lands , two chairmen of the coalition told Reuters in exclusive interviews . The group proposes to put those lands into private ownership - a politically explosive idea that could upend more than century of policy designed to preserve Indian tribes on U.S.-owned reservations , which are governed by tribal leaders as sovereign nations . The tribes have rights to use the land , but they do not own it . They can drill it and reap the profits , but only under regulations that are far more burdensome than those applied to private property . The proposed path to deregulated drilling - privatizing reservations - could prove even more divisive . Many Native Americans view such efforts as a violation of tribal self-determination and culture . The contingent of Native Americans who fear tribal-land privatization cite precedents of lost sovereignty and culture . Here 's our Cookie Policy .
