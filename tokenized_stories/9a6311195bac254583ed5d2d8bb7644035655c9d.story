Monkeywrenching Security Zines Read . Distribute . Fallen Warriors Obituaries to fallen warriors . Journal . As the military , police , private DAPL workers , security and investors have encroached upon and attacked inhabitants on and near Standing Rock Dakota Territory , we must encroach upon and stop their activities utilizing many creative methods of resistance . We are collectives of indigenous and non-indigenous water protectors calling upon homies and accomplices to do whatever it takes to chop the head off of this black snake . Public opinion and the privileged liberal myth of voting with your dollar are NOT going to win the day . We are here to protect our communities , NOT please the mainstream media . We also recognize that corporations and the military industrial complex are responsible for the vast majority of worldwide pollution , NOT individuals or any one group of people . The most violent thing we can do is to allow construction to continue uninterrupted ; it is only a matter of WHEN , NOT IF the pipeline bursts , and by then it will be too late . We are setting a precedent for the world , and the kinds of communities that we want to build and live in . In the spirit of Sitting Bull , stand up with strong hearts , help dismantle peace police and liberal disease mentality ; these modes and positions of privilege only reinforce our collective enemies and the fascists systems they uphold , and the rich and elite few that they protect . May prayer and strategic direct action collide as one . Embrace harmony not unity - we do NOT all have to do the same thing or sing the same notes to be a part of the same song of resistance . Let actions and protests also send the message that we will not acquiesce to tyranny or accept Trump as President , nor recognize decisions made by IRA tribal council leaders . Journal Collective .
