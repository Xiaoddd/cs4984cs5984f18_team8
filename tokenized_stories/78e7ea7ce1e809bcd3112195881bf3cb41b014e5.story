Listen to the call of the wild . Brother , sisters carrying signs . Breathe deep before it 's too late ; The sky is falling , burning your eyes . Down in New Orleans river 's boiling . Nothing living , nothing to eat . Thank the Lord , daddy 's working 8-5 . Paying the doctor , baby 's got cancer . Give and take . Look around at what we 've been given . Maybe we 've taken too long .

Ca n't solve the problem overnight . Resistance - Listen to the call of the wild . Burning coal . Got to keep the company warm as the rain keeps killing the trees . Cut 'em down quick . Out in the midwest , hear the roar of the plough , turning grassland into sand . Got to feed the people more every day but the wind keeps blowing the land away . Give and take . Look around at what we 've been given . Maybe we 've taken too long . Photos Resistance - shouts the man on the right . Ca n't solve the problem overnight .
