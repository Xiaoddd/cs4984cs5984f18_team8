All Rights Reserved . Fast-flowing springs run through an endless matrix of underground conduits and caves . A lifelong hunter and outdoorsman , Edwards bought the property in 2013 , for its proximity to the Suwanee River and what he thought were conservation protections on the land . The entire parcel has a conservation easement on it , meaning it can never be developed for any purpose . And yet , bulldozers are currently trenching through his land , making way for the Sabal Trail pipeline . But the project had the support of Gov. Rick Scott . Scott has previously noted that investment was held by a blind trust . Two months after it raised objections to the project , after meeting with pipeline officials , EPA reversed itself . Earlier this month in Georgia , drilling mud leaked into the Withlacoochee River from drilling operations below . She did not directly address the question of whether the intrusion was an indication that drilling could penetrate protected waterways . With legal challenges exhausted , Edwards is resigned to the pipeline destroying part of his land . Protests continue Saturday at the Guy Lemmon Boat ramp in Live Oak . All Rights Reserved .
