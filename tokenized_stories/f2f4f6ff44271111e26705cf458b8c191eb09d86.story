He has vowed to dismantle the EPA , has promised to kill America 's first-ever national limits on the dangerous climate pollution spewing from our coal plants , and has pledged to undermine America 's international leadership by pulling us out of the UN Paris Climate Agreement . It would be easy to give up , to lose hope , and to walk away from the fight . We will fight for the clean energy future that Americans deserve . We will do everything in our power to persuade Mr. Trump that he should listen to the scientific experts on climate change and recognize that a clean energy transition is already underway . America 's economic future depends on embracing this trend . Message I will not back down . I will strongly oppose any attempts to dismantle the crucial environmental protections already in place , and I will continue to fight for meaningful climate action at the local , state , federal , and even global level . Because we can not give up . Our only option is to keep moving forward . All Rights Reserved .
