That bill , which would reduce or eliminate the penalties for drivers who struck and killed protesters who are blocking the roadway , has gotten some national attention , not all of it positive . I thought it was somewhat odd that Kempenich introduced the bill . He has , after all , voted yes on eight different proposals that would criminalize or restrict access to abortion in the past 10 years , and in 2014 was congratulated as a pro-life legislator by North Dakota Right to Life . I would think being pro-life would extend to adults , but I completely understand how enraging traffic tie-ups can be . People come from all over the country to take part in our outdoor activities . Rather than thinking about the Dakota Access pipeline protests as a negative , like Kempenich and others seem to , we could turn it into a positive . That way the state could issue protester licenses , the same as they do for deer . It might prove even more popular if the state limited the number of available licenses . In 2016 there were only eight bighorn sheep licenses available for more than 10,000 applicants . It could be a marketing boon , as well . I , for one , would love to be able to run down someone who is driving 10 miles an hour below the speed limit when I really , really , really need to get somewhere . I am positive there are other high crimes and misdemeanors that deserve to be added to my list . It might make sense to put the measure on the 2018 ballot with some options , so the people can decide which offenses should be punishable by being run over . And if it were a case of driver negligence , then prosecutors would look at the entire circumstances when deciding whether to press charges . This can be removed when origin is fixed .
