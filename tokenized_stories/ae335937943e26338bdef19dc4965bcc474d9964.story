Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated . This map depicts the proposed locations of the Keystone XL Pipeline . The massive project has been a seven-year political football during presidential and congressional elections that has pitted oil companies and Republicans against environmentalists and liberal activists . The proposed pipeline would span nearly 1,200 miles across six U.S. states , moving more than 800,000 barrels of carbon-heavy petroleum daily from Canadian oil sands through Nebraska to refineries in the Gulf Coast . The Environmental Protection Agency this summer put forward new regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants . And next month , Obama will attend the Paris climate talks run by the United Nations , he announced Friday . The White House is hoping to broker an international agreement committing every country to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and enact other policies to curb global warming . The President has also stepped up his rhetoric on the need to address global warming , pushing back against Republicans and climate skeptics fighting his agenda . So the time to heed the critics and cynics is past . The time to plead ignorance is surely past . In a statement Friday , Kerry said the climate impact was the key factor . The project was a major issue during the 2012 presidential campaign , when GOP candidate Mitt Romney said he would approve the pipeline . Republican candidates in the 2016 race have also pledged to let the project go forward . Obama also cited falling gasoline prices as another argument against the project . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has also been caught up in Keystone politics . Sanders noted his long-standing opposition to the project in a statement Friday . The lobbying fight over Keystone has been expensive , with all sides spending millions of dollars in an attempt to influence the White House and Congress . The Canadian and Alberta governments , in particular , have pushed Obama to approve the project , and Obama and Kerry noted the sensitivity of their decision . The President spoke with Trudeau before the White House made the verdict public . Kerry , in his official determination rejecting the project , said the U.S. government understands the impact it would have . Earlier this week , Kerry rejected a request by the company to halt its review of the pipeline as it awaits a separate process at the state level . TransCanada said it could take up to 12 months for the Nebraska process to be completed , adding further delay to the already lengthy approval process . Obama vetoed legislation green-lighting the construction of the pipeline in February . Republican candidate reaction Proponents of the project , including Republican presidential candidates , say the pipeline would advance energy independence in North America and construction of it will create jobs .
