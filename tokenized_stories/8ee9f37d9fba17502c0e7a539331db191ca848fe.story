Date November 27 , 2016 Posted by Peter Sachs , Esq. . There is something very troubling about that , especially given the widespread accounts of militaristic law enforcement tactics , many of which have already been documented by drones . Let me make it clear that I am not anti-law enforcement . Whether that is also the reason it was requested and granted is a matter of opinion , of course . What is not a matter of opinion is what the law requires for the issuance of a TFR . The Notice to Airmen will specify the hazard or condition that requires the imposition of temporary flight restrictions . -LRB- b -RRB- When a NOTAM has been issued under paragraph -LRB- a -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- of this section , no person may operate an aircraft within the designated area unless that aircraft is participating in the hazard relief activities and is being operated under the direction of the official in charge of on scene emergency response activities . SFC-2000FT MSL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATION . PURSUANT TO 14 CFR SECTION 91.137 -LRB- A -RRB- -LRB- 1 -RRB- TEMPORARY FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS ARE IN EFFECT . ONLY RESPONSE ACFT IN SUPPORT OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE NORTH DAKOTA TACTICAL OPERATION CENTER AND ACFT APPROVED BY ATC IN COORDINATION WITH THE DOMESTIC EVENTS NETWORK ARE AUTHORIZED IN THE AIRSPACE . NORTH DAKOTA TACTICAL OPERATION CENTER TELEPHONE 701-667-3224 IS IN CHARGE OF ON SCENE EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTIVITY . MEDIA CONCERNS REGARDING THIS TEMPORARY FLIGHT RESTRICTION SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO FAA PUBLIC AFFAIRS THROUGH THE WASHINGTON OPS CENTER AT 202-267-3333 . 1611260000-1612022359 . Well , if they are flying carelessly or recklessly , that would certainly present a hazard . Peter Sachs , Esq. .
