Listen to the PBS NewsHour podcast . Leave a respectful comment . Nation Mar 10 , 2017 6:16 PM EDT Despite bitter cold , wind , rain and hail , hundreds of members of Native American tribes and supporters from around the country turned out Friday to march on the White House , in an effort to turn the momentum of the Standing Rock protests into a more sustained movement for native rights . The march and a rally in Lafayette Square across from the White House came after four days of protest , prayer and lobbying on Capitol Hill , where Native communities called for the protection of natural resources and demanded the new administration honor treaties with indigenous peoples . Those issues were drawn into sharp focus last year during the months-long fight over the Dakota Access Pipeline at the Standing Rock reservation . On his fifth day in office , President Donald Trump gave the green light to the Dakota Access Pipeline , as well as the Keystone XL pipeline , which indigenous groups have also protested . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which issues permits for all water crossings , granted a final easement required to complete for the Dakota Access Pipeline last month . The executive order and Army Corps decision was a blow for opponents of the pipeline . But Goldtooth said the momentum from the fight signaled the start of a larger movement . On Friday , indigenous groups were joined by Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii , along with celebrities , environmental groups , peace activists , veterans , college students and nonprofits working on First Amendment and LGBT rights . In fall 2016 , thousands marched against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline under Lake Oahe and near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation , North Dakota . Douglas Ryder , 70 , a veteran from Durham , N.C. who attended the march , said he was concerned that President Trump was too focused on strengthening the military instead of providing more federal funding for issues like environmental protection . But the community remains wary . Still , he said , he appreciated that people were becoming aware of the issues . The Society of Native Nations has erected a camp there to help stop the pipeline , in collaboration with local communities . Native American leaders are protests at several other pipelines around the country this year . Environmentalists say the Sabal Trail Pipeline could damage the Floridan aquifer system , which provides drinking water to millions of people in the region . Protests over the Sabal Trail Pipeline have already led to dozens of arrests . The march on Friday was about more than just pipelines , however . According to NOAA , Alcoa and General Motors plants dumped toxic pollutants into the Grasse and St. Lawrence rivers around Akwesasne over several decades . Thompson-Oakes said the showdown at Standing Rock encouraged him and White to fight back in their community .
