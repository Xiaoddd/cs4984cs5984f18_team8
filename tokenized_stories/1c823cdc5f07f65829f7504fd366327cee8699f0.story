But this was no ordinary assignment . Nyemah 's older sister first shared news of the assignment on her Twitter account on Nov. 9 . Greenhouse and her daughter agreed that Nyemah should attend school as a protester against the Dakota Access Pipeline , a crude-oil pipeline stretching form North Dakota through southern Illinois . Since August , authorities have arrested over 500 protesters hoping to shut down the project , which runs through Native American land and has potential environmental repercussions , including potentially tainting locals ' water supply . When Nyemah wore the outfit to school , her older sister shared photo of Nyemah on Twitter . The tweet featuring Nyemah has been retweeted over 1,000 times . Although she may not know all the nuances of the situation , Greenhouse says her daughter does have an understanding of the DAPL protests . Greenhouse collaborated with her daughter on the final design . More important than the quality of the garment was the lesson that Greenhouse tried to pass on to her daughter . Greenhouse said she speaks to her children at an age-appropriate level about issues like DAPL and police brutality to educate them about what 's going on in the world . Greenhouse said she did n't get feedback from her daughter 's school about the outfit and that Nyemah did not get in trouble . The situation ended up being a win-win : Nyemah completed her assignment and she got to participate in activism . All rights reserved .
