1 . Global Gag Rule Reinstated On Monday , he reinstated the Global Gag Rule . The Mexico City police , or the global gag rule is an executive order that prevents international health organizations from providing abortions to patients , mentioning abortions to the people they treat , or lobbying against local abortion restrictions . If they break that rule , they will not receive U.S. foreign aid . This rule only impacts non U.S. based organizations that receive U.S. funding . The Gag Rule makes it also difficult to access contraception . Since women can not have abortions from qualified practitioners , they seek illegal abortions , which can have grave health consequences . The World Health Organization documented , 21.6 million women have unsafe abortions each year , with 18.5 million of them occurring in developing countries and 47,000 of those women die from those unsafe abortions annually .

Horse Soring Ban Put on Hold President Donald Trump has issued a memorandum for all unpublished rules to be withdrawn and sent back to the relevant agency for review . One week before President Barack Obama left office , the Department of Agriculture announced that it had finalized a new regulation to update the Horse Protection Act . To become effective , the rule must be published in the Federal Register . The practice of soring involves placing chains , caustic chemical agents or other devices on the legs and hooves of Tennessee walking horses and similar breeds . The practice is often used to give horses an advantage in show competitions , Original article : Trump administration places horse ` soring ' ban on hold It is still to be seen if Trump will accept this ban .

Trump Administration Orders Media Blackout at EPA The Trump administration has gagged employees at two federal agencies . Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Agriculture are now blocked from communicating with the public and the press . But not just that , at the EPA , grants and contract budget have also been frozen . Scientists at the research division of the US Department of Agriculture are no longer allowed to communicate with the public about taxpayer-funded research . The EPA is responsible for passing and upholding regulations on issues such as clean air and water and the carbon emissions responsible for global warming . The USDA is less politically sensitive than the EPA , though it does do some research into genetically modified food and pesticides and it has used research money to investigate how to cut down methane , a greenhouse gas that is a major cause of climate change . There will be a Science March on Washington . This is a non-partisan issue that reaches far beyond people in the STEM fields and should concern anyone who values empirical research and science . There are certain things that we accept as facts with no alternatives . The Earth is becoming warmer due to human action . The diversity of life arose by evolution . Politicians who devalue expertise risk making decisions that do not reflect reality and must be held accountable . Other Republican lawmakers would like to limit logging restrictions under the act , stop lawsuits to protect species , or force one species off the list for every species added to the list . Wolves are in the cross-hairs because Republicans are pushing to open up trophy hunting , and lawsuits from environmental groups have been the wolves ' last defense . The message is : Resistance to Trump 's climate denial , racism , misogyny , homophobia and bigotry . for more news and updates on how to help . They have started also a hashtag Resist Often .
