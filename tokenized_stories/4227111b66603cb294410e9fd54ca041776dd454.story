Word had spread that day in early February that federal agents had arrested the Standing Rock activist James White at the Prairie Knights resort in North Dakota , sending his friends and relatives into a panic . White , who goes by the name Angry Bird , is one of at least six Native American activists facing serious federal charges tied to the nearly year-long fight against the Dakota Access pipeline .

Ollie , who is Eastern Cherokee , Sicilian and Greek , did not want to use her full name out of fear for her personal safety . She is one of many loved ones and friends of five indigenous men who recently faced a federal grand jury indictment on charges of civil disorder and use of fire to commit an offense .

Although local law enforcement have made roughly 700 arrests since last year and filed a wide range of state-level felony charges , the federal justice department prosecutions have dramatically heightened anxieties . Trump has invested in the oil corporation and taken donations from its CEO . The Guardian also recently reported that an FBI terrorism task force is investigating Standing Rock activists . Sandra Freeman , attorney with the Water Protector Legal Collective , who is representing Rattler , said he was being prosecuted under a law that is rarely used in federal court , passed in 1968 to control the Black Liberation Movement and Vietnam war protests . She said the charges were clearly meant to repress free speech rights . But federal agents have said that the men set fires to barricades separating police and demonstrators on 27 October . They are trying to disempower this movement . The couple met at camp last year when they worked together as akicita , a Lakota word that water protectors used for one of the security teams . But instead of letting him leave after his Morton County hearing , federal agents took him into custody , she said . The slew of cases against activists has also fueled prejudice and racism toward indigenous people in North Dakota , said Anthony Gazotti , a 47-year-old Apache man . While helping set up a new camp site , he recounted the discrimination he faced at a supply store in Mandan , an hour north of Cannon Ball .

Some supporters have compared Rattler and Red Fawn Fallis , another demonstrator taken into custody last year , to famous indigenous protesters such as Leonard Peltier , whose activism has led to decades of federal incarceration .
