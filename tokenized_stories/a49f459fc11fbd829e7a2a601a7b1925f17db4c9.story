Download the letter for print here . To President Obama , We , the Board of Directors and staff of The Science and Environmental Health Network -LRB- SEHN -RRB- , affirm our support of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the water protectors gathered in both North Dakota and Iowa to safeguard the Missouri River , a vital source of water for millions . For over two decades , SEHN has provided expertise in science , medicine , policy and law to inform effective decisions that protect public health and the environment , and preserve a livable , just planet for future generations . As such , we have been involved in challenging the Dakota Access pipeline and its imminent threat to drinking water for the last 2.5 years . We ask that you , President Obama , use your power to protect drinking water , treaty rights , tribal sovereignty , and sites sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . On the night of November 20th , over mainstream and social media , the world witnessed the militarized , violent and unjust treatment of those assembled as water protectors at Standing Rock . Water cannons were discharged in below-freezing temperatures , along with tear gas , percussion grenades and rubber bullets . The Indigenous Environmental Network reports that one hundred sixty-seven people were injured , and seven hospitalized . This was not an isolated incident . We can not be silent in the face of such violence , nor can you , President Obama . We write to denounce the unjust treatment of those committed to protecting the safety and sanctity of land and water . We ask that you deploy the Federal Marshalls to cease construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline , for which the 408 permit to drill beneath the Missouri River has not been secured . To weaponize water against those committed to its protection adds further insult to already grave injury . The Science and Environmental Health Network stands with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and indigenous peoples from across the United States who act in defense of water , too . With this letter , we speak in affirmation of treaty rights , tribal sovereignty , and for the protection of water , sacred sites and a livable climate . Swift federal intervention is critical . Standing Rock is a watershed moment in your administration , and your legacy hangs in the balance . Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 United States License .
