We apologise for the miscommunication which we saw via a previous blog post . We had a flood of hundreds of messages come in from veterans and only a couple of us manning our page . You should all be able to travel ok til you get to Denver after that things could geta little racist ... you might start running into racist people and businesses ... there have been some incidences where camp supporters have been refused services while travelling to camp.I would hate for our vets to get turned away when they are tired or hungary ... it 's probably best to have a scout to check things out first . I do n't know about Montana and Wyoming but I know the Dakotas have many racist people . Travel safe and much much gratitude for coming to support the cause . My husband and I are both Veterans and would love to stand in solidarity with Standing Rock . Our son has been there for 3 months now , we would love to see him . I 'm reaching out for help in contacting the Veterans Office in TC . Thank you . November 30 , 2016 at 5:07 PM Unknown said ...

Dear people , You probably have planned your route , but just in case , here is advice from a friend who lives on Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation , which is right next to Standing Rock Reservation . I asked her how people can get to the camp at Standing Rock with being stopped by the county police etc. . She said to go up through South Dakota and onto Cheyenne River reservation , and go from there to Standing Rock . That way you will be entering from Indian country where the police do not have jurisdiction . Also you should know that the closest grocery store is hours away . Also I recommend following Kevin Gilbertt -LRB- yes , that 's the spelling -RRB- who is the man who provided the live feed that showed the brutality there by the mercenaries and police , so it was seen around the world . He is an excellent source of information on Facebook . Go with God . I hope they stay safe . December 2 , 2016 at 6:56 AM Unknown said ...
