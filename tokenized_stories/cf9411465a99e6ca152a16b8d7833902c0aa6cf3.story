Archer The bloom in 2015 was the largest on record , spreading scum for 300 square miles . Great Lakes states enacted significant legislation banning the use of phosphorus in detergents and fertilizers , focusing on residential uses . Yet , several decades later , we are facing the same issues . Fears that this was only the beginning of similar occurrences were realized this summer , when the 2015 algal bloom was worse , closing beaches and threatening water supplies . According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the blooms are created by wet springs that cause fertilizer to run off in great amounts followed by warm temperatures . Fearing another serious public health issue , the states of Michigan and Ohio , along with Ontario , signed the Western Basin of Lake Erie Collaborative Agreement , which sets a goal of 30 percent reduction of phosphorus entering into Lake Erie by 2025 . Although the agreement establishes a goal , its success will depend on what the participating jurisdictions do to reduce effluent containing the stuff that algae loves to eat . For its part , Michigan issued a draft of an Implementation Plan in October . Actions proposed by the state include : Maintaining the reductions in phosphorus discharges from the largest point source discharge into Lake Erie , the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department . Reducing phosphorus discharges from the Downriver Wastewater Treatment Facility . Developing a watershed management plan for the Maumee River basin , while working closely with Indiana and Ohio . Determining how much responsibility for harmful algal blooms is related to invasive mussels . Identifying how to reduce River Raisin phosphorus reductions , including an evaluation of the Monroe Wastewater Treatment Facility . It seems a bit disingenuous to state that the causes of algal bloom are not well understood , as a wealth of study has been developed since the 1970s . Also , there is no specific discussion of the contribution of concentrated animal feeding operations to algal blooms , although the draft plan does discuss the existence of CAFOs and other potential agricultural nonpoint sources in the Maumee River basin . Neither the collaborative agreement nor the draft plan mentions the effect of discharges of , and the need to control , effluents containing nitrogen , a contaminant understood to contribute to algal blooms . As with the control of phosphorus in the 1970s , the focus of the draft plan is on discharges related to residential uses and not as much on uncontrolled agricultural runoff . The draft plan is just that , a draft . The public comment period for the draft plan remains open until Dec. 7 , and a public hearing on the draft plan will occur Dec. 1 6-9 p.m. at the Monroe Middle School auditorium .
