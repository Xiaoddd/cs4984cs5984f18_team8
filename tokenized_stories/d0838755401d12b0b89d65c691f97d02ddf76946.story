The book is constructed around in-depth interviews with frontman Iggy Pop , and a slew of of rarely seen memorabilia , which together tell the story of the Stooges . Those praising the band via their own contributing essays include Johnny Marr , Joan Jett , and Jack White , as well as noted scribes Johan Kugelberg and Jon Savage . We have exclusive excerpts for you from TOTAL CHAOS . The text and images revolve around the seminal Stooges LP Fun House , one of the greatest albums of the entire rock era . In the first interview excerpt , Iggy talks about the stage name he has used since the time of Fun House . Jim P-o-p-p was one of the delinquent friends of Ron and Dave and one of the people that hung out with that group . He had sniffed too much glue and lost a lot of his hair early . He was laying there sleeping in one of the booths . Townies would go over there to get cheap food . Sneak into the Student Union and just hang . So yeah , I nicked it from Jim Popp . So I got him to try an arrangement . He just had it as sort of a chord thing . He knew that reference and he tried it , but to do that , I had to camp outside his door day and night . Hassle him . So most of the rest of the record , I wrote on a Mosrite guitar with a fifty watt Marshall amp up in my room and only Ron could have played it so wonderfully , but most of that , I wrote . To the board and to the other and mixed it . The engineer was a charming , cultured British individual . The Stooges perform in San Francisco for the first time , 1970 -LRB- Jeff Gold Collection -RRB- I just remember that in San Francisco some of the Cockettes were in the front row and I was psychedelicized that night . No , uh-uh , everybody stayed in one place . He provided much of the memorabilia pictured in the book , and conducted the Iggy interviews that appear in it , along with Johan Kugelberg . I asked Jeff a few questions via email . You saw them in 1973 . The whole show lasted maybe half an hour . He was definitely under the influence of something , and spent part of the show wailing about butt-fuckers in Hollywood , and after about 30 minutes , he started falling down and Ron Asheton , I think , had to help him off stage . It was total chaos , which is the title of the book , but completely compelling chaos , and unforgettable . But still you never know what someone will be like offstage , so I was both excited and a bit wary . He was friendly , had lots of good ideas about album covers , videos , and marketing , and was a real pleasure to deal with . I left Warner Bros. in 1998 , and got back into buying and selling music stuff full time , and that coincided with the dawn of eBay , so there was much more of it on the market , and I took advantage of that . As for the Stooges things I find most interesting , I bought copies of all of their original contracts from Danny Fields , who signed and later managed them . Iggy never knew they wanted to sign him as a solo act , and it blew his mind to find out about it all those years later . Tell us about the process of sitting down with Iggy to work on what would become TOTAL CHAOS . Jeff Gold : Iggy has a fantastic memory and is a wonderful storyteller . We were wholly unprepared for how much he remembered and how much he had to say . In 2003 , you saw the first Stooges reunion show . But we were wholly unprepared for how incredible they were , and how emotional an experience it was for the crowd and the band . I said this to Iggy years later and he said it could have been . And here they were playing their first gig in all that time to 30,000 cheering people . Jeff Gold : Fun House is and has always been my favorite Stooges album , because it takes the primal sounds of their first album and gets more experimental and out there . At that point the only Stooges albums you could find were Raw Power and Metallic K.O. Those were the only two in print . So for a lot of kids those were the Stooges albums they knew , and only much later did the first two get reissued domestically . So I think people preferred the ones they fell in love with first , and listened to over and over . Pre-order it on Amazon . The book is a tribute to vinyl , and includes contributions from such towering figures as Iggy and David Bowie . Another title , God Save Sex Pistols , authored by the aforementioned Johan Kugelberg and Jon Savage , recently came out . Check it out here .
