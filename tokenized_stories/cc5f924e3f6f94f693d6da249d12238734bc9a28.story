The candidates are not officially slated to discuss health care or education or the military ; they are not scheduled to address abortion policy or gun violence or police brutality or violence against women ; they are not expected to answer questions on any issue that would cause Trump to have to fumble again to utter the acronym LGBTQ . And the true elephant in the room , the one topic that will undoubtedly continue to be ignored , as it has been resolutely and steadfastly throughout the post-convention phase of the election , is one that encompasses issues of energy , the environment , climate change , big oil , pollution , clean water , and the forgotten peoples of this nation . What you will not hear on the stage in Vegas tonight is any discussion of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the imminent danger it poses not just to the Standing Rock Sioux people and their drinking water and sacred lands , but also to the rest of the country . It will transport Bakken crude oil through farmlands , Great Plains , and forests , from North Dakota to South Dakota to Iowa to Illinois . Witness , for example , the pollution of the Kalamazoo River in Michigan , which has still not fully recovered after a pipeline operated by one of the Dakota Access Pipeline stakeholders managed to dump 1.2 million gallons of crude oil into one of its tributaries six years ago . Last summer , Clinton unveiled a detailed plan to address renewable energy , including the goal of half a billion solar panels installed by the end of her first term , but in her first debate with Trump , the topic of climate change got less than 90 seconds of airtime . One hardly expects much on the subject from her opponent , who has called climate change a hoax and pledged to undo the Paris COP21 Agreement . Including , yes , the Mashantucket Pequots , who are among the more than 300 sovereign tribes and nations from all over North and South America who have joined their brothers and sisters of the Standing Rock Sioux in solidarity , for they know that whatever damage is wrought by the pipeline will travel its course and pollute drinking water for all who depend on the Missouri , the Mississippi , and the Big Sioux rivers and their tributaries . The attack dogs unleashed by DAPL security , viciously biting nonviolent water protectors , are a reminder of the police dogs sicced on African-American children in Birmingham , Alabama , in 1963 , and they reopen another 500-year-old wound , that of the attack dogs wielded by the gold-seeking conquistadors who came to the Americas in 1493 . So , yes , these are real Indians , and they are also joined by their allies , of all backgrounds and walks of life : military veterans , career activists , scientists , nurses , teachers , musicians , security guards , retail workers , students . They come from far and wide , with stories of their own polluted rivers and towns . They are among the nearly 8 percent of Native Americans who already lack clean water . They are Cree and Saulteaux First Nation people who are now fighting in Iowa to protect that stretch of land and water threatened by the Dakota Access Pipeline . They are Anishinaabe people from the Shoal Lake 40 First Nation , where construction of an aqueduct left the community without clean water for almost two decades . They are Navajo who live on a mere seven gallons of water a day and rely on once-monthly deliveries from a water truck . They come from drought-ridden California and from West Virginia and Colorado , from states battling fracking and mountaintop mining . One day last week , when I was at Standing Rock , a school bus pulled up full of members of the Shining Light Kitchen , a food collective that had just served meals to victims of the floods in Baton Rouge ; with them were New Orleans American Indians who survived Katrina , and volunteers who made it through the Deepwater Horizon spill . As in , the last . The Third Straw is essentially a giant pumping station or massive bathtub drain designed to extract water from a lake stricken by drought and funnel it to the homes , hotels , casinos , and , of course , to the stage at the Thomas & Mack Center at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , where , tonight , water will appear in little plastic cups for the candidates and the moderator , who will ask every question in the world except about where it came from . All rights reserved . And the true elephant in the room , the one topic that will undoubtedly continue to be ignored , as it has been resolutely and steadfastly throughout the post-convention phase of the election , is one that encompasses issues of energy , the environment , climate change , big oil , pollution , clean water , and the forgotten peoples of this nation . It will transport Bakken crude oil through farmlands , Great Plains , and forests , from North Dakota to South Dakota to Iowa to Illinois . despite the fact that peaceful water protectors have been portrayed and treated as violent offenders , despite the fact that freedom of speech is being directly threatened by the arrests of journalists attempting to cover the story , you will not hear why their cause matters now and how it impacts the rest of us , or where the candidates stand on the issue and how they plan to address it . referring to one of the worst water crises this country has ever seen . but in her first debate with Trump , the topic of climate change got less than 90 seconds of airtime . who are among the more than 300 sovereign tribes and nations from all over North and South America who have joined their brothers and sisters of the Standing Rock Sioux in solidarity , for they know that whatever damage is wrought by the pipeline will travel its course and pollute drinking water for all who depend on the Missouri , the Mississippi , and the Big Sioux rivers and their tributaries . yes , these are real Indians , and they are also joined by their allies , of all backgrounds and walks of life : military veterans , career activists , scientists , nurses , teachers , musicians , security guards , retail workers , students .
