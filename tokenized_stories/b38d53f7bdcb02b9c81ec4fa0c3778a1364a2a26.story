Now economics threatens to do what environmentalists could n't : scuttle the pipeline . The company that is building the controversial Keystone XL pipeline no doubt wishes Energy Secretary Rick Perry had been right last week when he explained the law of supply and demand . In fact , as any first-year economics student learns , supply follows demand . Perry could call TransCanada Corp. of Calgary , Alberta , for verification . There it would link up with existing pipelines that would carry the thick , high-sulfur , tar-sands oil to refineries on the Gulf Coast . Since its inception in 2008 , the project has been dogged by environmental concerns that brought opposition from the Obama administration . President Donald Trump greenlighted it in March . But now , The Wall Street Journal reports the law of supply and demand has raised its ugly head . TransCanada is having trouble getting commitments from oil companies to use the pipeline . Firms would rather take their chances on spot-market oil , even if they have to pay more to transport it , than risk long-term commitments to the Canadian oil . In February , the falling demand for Canadian oil led ExxonMobil to write off its entire 3.5 billion barrels of estimated reserves in Alberta oil . The pipeline investment must be amortized over 50 years , by which time global warming will be impossible to ignore . Just like the law of supply and demand .
