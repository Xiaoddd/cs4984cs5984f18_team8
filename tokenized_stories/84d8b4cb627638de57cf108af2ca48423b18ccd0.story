Worth supporting . More Reddit Pinterest Email Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry is apparently back in the mix to join the Trump Cabinet . BloombergPolitics reported Sunday that the two-time candidate for the Republican nomination for president had emerged as the leading candidate to lead the Energy Department . According to BloombergPolitics , Perry met with President-elect Donald Trump at the Army-Navy football game in Baltimore Saturday , along with Ray Washburne , a Dallas investor and former national finance chairman for the Republican National Committee , who was the vice chairman of the Trump Victory fundraising committee . According to the report , Washburne is also a contender to be energy secretary . Perry met with Trump in New York at Trump Tower on Nov. 21 to talk about a potential role in the administration , but there had been little , if any , buzz about his chances until this weekend . Perry was harshly critical of Trump when they were rivals for the 2016 nomination , but has been an enthusiastic booster since Trump clinched the nomination last spring . The Energy Department was one of three federal agencies that Perry , as a candidate for the 2012 GOP nomination , promised to eliminate . Perry serves on the board of Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners , a pipeline company headed by Kelcy Warren , the finance chairman of his 2016 presidential campaign . To date , Trump has not named any Texans to his Cabinet , but the Perry talk comes amid reports that Trump had settled on Rex Tillerson of Irving , the chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil , as his choice for secretary of state . If both Tillerson and Perry ultimately become part of the Trump Cabinet , Texas will suddenly find two favorite sons vaulted into critical roles in the administration , as will the Boy Scouts of America . Both Tillerson and Perry are Eagle Scouts who have remained devoted to the BSA throughout their lives .
