The article is in one sense a literal blast from the past . Blackwater changed its name to Xe Services in 2009 , in part because its brand had become so toxic after Nisour Square , and then sold itself to a group of outside investors in 2010 . The board of the new company , ACADEMI , includes former Attorney General John Ashcroft and former San Antonio Spurs owner Red McCombs . He also wrote a book defending his actions during the war and was working on creating a video game featuring unnamed contractors shooting their way through a war zone . That , in turn , means big profits for the remaining heavyweights , including those that own what had once been Blackwater . In addition to protecting U.S. installations in the war zones , ACADEMI also has contracts to train Pentagon personnel heading abroad at the 7,000-acre training center in Moyock , North Carolina , which was built by Prince as the centerpiece of his Blackwater empire . The site features multiple firing ranges , a three-mile driving track , and two airfields . The steady government work has made ACADEMI , like Blackwater before it , attractive to outside investors . In early June , ACADEMI joined forces with rival private security company Triple Canopy to form Constellis Holdings , adding even more distance -LRB- and name changes -RRB- between it and the original Blackwater . Triple Canopy is one of several private security companies hired by the State Department to protect its embassies and consulates around the world . By merging , ACADEMI and Triple Canopy will have over 6,000 employees , shrinking competition in the U.S. market and highlighting the increasing consolidation of what had once been a freewheeling industry . But with Blackwater in the news again , questions are once again being raised about the role of these companies and whether governments that are excessively reliant on their services are able to properly oversee them . ACADEMI spokeswoman Callie Wang says the company is entirely separate from Blackwater and has absolutely no involvement in the criminal trial of the Blackwater guards . Most recently , ACADEMI had to dispel rumors that its employees were operating in Ukraine . And Prince himself is very much still in the business . A former U.S. Navy SEAL , Prince founded Blackwater in 1997 when he bought up land in North Carolina and built a training site for military and law enforcement officials . A turning point for the company came with the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen . Blackwater was hired by the Navy to train U.S. sailors how to protect themselves from attackers . The public first became aware of Blackwater in 2004 , when four of its employees were killed , their bodies burned and hung from a bridge in Fallujah . Then on Christmas Eve in 2006 , an off-duty Blackwater employee shot and killed an Iraqi security guard inside the Green Zone , increasing pressure on the Bush administration to hold private security contractors accountable for crimes committed in war zones . Prince tried to rebrand the company , renaming it Xe Services in 2009 . DeYonker continues to sit on the board of ACADEMI and is one of eight men on the board of Constellis Holdings . In 2010 , Prince also sold Greystone , an affiliate of Blackwater that did work for the CIA . The company is still operating under its original name and its website lists offices in Chesapeake , Virginia , and Abu Dhabi . Around that time , Prince also sold Aviation Worldwide Services , which provided things like ISR -LRB- intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance -RRB- , airdrops , and defensive air support , to AAR Corp. . His small fund is called Frontier Resource Group , a private equity firm based in Abu Dhabi , which has a contract with the South Sudanese government to build an oil refinery . The project was temporarily put on hold earlier this year , when the security situation in the country grew too dangerous . While Prince pursued projects overseas , the firearms charges over the former Blackwater employees did not go away . That is , until this February , when most of the charges were dismissed after retired CIA officials testified the weapons had been given to the Jordanian king with the authorization of the CIA . Then at the beginning of June , the merger between ACADEMI and Triple Canopy was finalized . Nixon retired from the Army in 2011 ; his final assignment was as the deputy director of operations responsible for force protection for the U.S. Central Command . This is inevitable , Pelton said , because the government has a bizarre love-hate relationship with these companies . An earlier version of this story incorrectly called the company International Development Services .
