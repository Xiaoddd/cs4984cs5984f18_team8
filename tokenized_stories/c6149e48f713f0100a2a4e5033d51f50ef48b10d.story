The spill dumped 55,000 gallons of gasoline into Wallis Run , a tributary of the Loyalsock Creek that drains into the Susquehanna River . The breach was detected at 3 am when the pressure of the pipeline dropped significantly , leading Sunoco to shut down the pipeline . Though the pipeline has been shut down , the heavy rains that led to the leak are expected to continue , so the actual break in the pipeline will remain unidentified until the weather clears . The Pennsylvania water authorities warned customers to refrain from using water from the river as a precaution , but on Sunday The Pennsylvania American Water utility lifted the warning , saying it would continue to monitor water quality . All downstream users that pull water from the river were notified of the spill , said Mike Fetrow , director of the York County Emergency Management Agency . Wrightsville plans to fill its water reservoir and then close its intake valve to the river , Mayor Neil Habecker said . The Susquehanna had previously been declared the third most endangered river in the US by the NGO American Rivers . Many other rivers in the US are endangered by fracking . Indeed , pipelines managed by Sunoco Logistics spill more frequently than another , with more than 200 recorded leaks since 2010 . This is also not the first spill of a Sunoco pipeline in Pennsylvania . Sunoco is also a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners Limited , the company that also owns the controversial Dakota Access pipeline . The Dakota Access pipeline has been the site of a major protest against its construction , led by the Standing Rock Sioux with support from environmental activists and the United Nations . The Sioux and others argue that the pipeline threatens their water supply as well as their sacred sites . The protests have been brutally suppressed on several occasions by both private security and state police . This article has been republished from True Activist .
