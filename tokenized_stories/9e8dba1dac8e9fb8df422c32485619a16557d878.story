CAROLINE GRUESKIN , TRIBUNE Buy Now A large supply of bottled water sate at the pipeline protest camp in southern Morton County was piled up in September . The church is raising funds to put a winterized yurt there , according to an online fundraiser . Local folks have donated everything from diapers to sleeping bags to winterized tents to snack crackers . Herr said there had not been reports of law enforcement stopping such vehicles as of Tuesday afternoon . There are no plans for a roadblock on Highway 6 , the main road to the camp since the Backwater Bridge on Highway 1806 was closed in October , she said . Dalrymple issued the mandatory emergency evacuation order Monday to the hundreds of Dakota Access Pipeline protesters camping on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ' land near the Missouri River . The edict was given as a winter storm has dumped at least a half foot of snow throughout the central part of the state . It followed an order by the corps that the land will be closed to the public on Monday . The governor 's order means that emergency services will not be made available to people at the camp except on a case-by-case basis . The order is effective since Monday and will remain until he rescinds it . Forum News Service Reporter Amy Dalrymple contributed to this report .
