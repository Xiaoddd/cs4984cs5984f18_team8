John Lewis Questions Trump 's Electoral Legitimacy Pres. Not only is the land for the planned pipeline sacred ground , but also constructing the pipeline would permanently contaminate that water supply . This conflict between Energy Transfer -LRB- the company responsible for constructing the pipeline -RRB- and water protectors of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe , is anchored in protecting this body of water . Between 5,000 and 8,000 people worldwide have joined the efforts of the Standing Rock Sioux water protectors . It gives the impression that water protectors -LRB- she refers to as protestors -RRB- have been violent or would become violent . The only violent party has been law enforcement officials from a dozen states attempting to remove the water protectors from the land . The Army Corps of Engineers announcement means Energy Transfer must either challenge this decision in court or find a new path for the pipeline if they intend to continue construction . While today 's decision is vital to the longterm goal of protecting land and water , the battle is not over . It should be noted , President-elect Trump has a financial interest in Energy Transfer Crude Oil , LLC . His administration may be directed to pressure officials to reverse this decision . While using the office of the presidency in that fashion would amount to a Constitutional violation , Trump does not seemed concerned with such restrictions . This victory is worthy of celebration , but members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe should remain vigilant in their protection efforts . All Rights Reserved .
