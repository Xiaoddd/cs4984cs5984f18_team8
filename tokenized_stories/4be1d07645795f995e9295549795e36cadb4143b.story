If you 've already kicked in , we have innumerable thanks - this is much needed protective gear that will help medics and protectors ensure the safety of others on the ground , be they civilians or journalists , indigenous or allied people . We give what we can and what we must . Solidarity is a radical posture . I well know that the ability to donate is too often dictated by forces outside oneself . But for those to whom such ability applies , I am profoundly calmed by your presence and compassion . Thank you , thank you , thank you . Together , we 'll fight the fuck forward . Game on , fascism , game on . Still , incredibly , some warriors are set on contributing more , so let 's see if we can fill out 3 more masks for medics on the ground . Luckily , the hundred or so cops staring down protectors through the fences at Oceti Sakowin tonight did n't launch an assault - but we want our loved ones on the ground to be able to gear up when they have to . Let 's help them battle on . Mni Wiconi . Water is life . I 'll close it out tomorrow evening and we 'll hustle the bundle out there . Here 's to the gorgeous kindness . Profound thanks .
