It can affect everything from how well our borders are secured and our neighborhoods protected to how verdicts are handed down in courts to how public infrastructure such as roads and schools are built . The FBI is uniquely situated to combat corruption , with the skills and capabilities to run complex undercover operations and surveillance . Addressing environmental crime , election fraud , and matters concerning the federal government procurement , contracts , and federally funded programs . In 2008 , the FBI created the International Corruption Unit -LRB- ICU -RRB- to oversee the increasing number of investigations involving global fraud against the U.S. government and the corruption of federal public officials outside of the continental U.S. involving U.S. funds , persons , businesses , etc. . No other law enforcement agency has attained the kind of success the FBI has achieved in combating corruption . This success is due largely to the cooperation and coordination from a number of federal , state , local , and tribal law enforcement agencies to combat public corruption . Prison officials and staff being co-opted , even if unwittingly , betrays the public trust , threatens the integrity of the justice system in the U.S. , and threaten national security interests overall . Schemes to corrupt prison officials come in a variety of forms , including : Testing : An offer of simple items , like prison commissary goods , is made to prison officials . Empathy : Prison inmates study corrections personnel working in the facility and determine whether particular staff members are susceptible to exploitation . Border Corruption The federal government is responsible for protecting approximately 7,000 miles along the U.S. border and 95,000 miles of U.S. shoreline , and every day , over a million people visit the U.S. and enter through one of the more than 300 official ports of entry into the U.S. , as well as through seaports and international airports . Common acts of border corruption involve drug trafficking and alien smuggling . Or a corrupt official who expedites immigration paperwork or helps obtain an identification document in return for a bribe or gratuity might actually be facilitating an operation of a terrorist cell , foreign counterintelligence network , or criminal enterprise . Oftentimes the Bureau brings its expertise to bear on joint investigations with its partners in federal , state , and local law enforcement . Many of these investigations involve FBI border corruption task forces and working groups located in nearly two dozen cities along our borders . Members of these task forces and working groups stand shoulder to shoulder to combat corrupt officials , both operationally and through the sharing of intelligence and information , along with the use of trend analysis , lessons learned , and best practices . Federally , the FBI coordinates investigative efforts along the borders with the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General ; Customs and Border Protection Internal Affairs ; Transportation Security Administration ; Drug Enforcement Administration ; Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives ; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement-Office of Professional Responsibility . Election Crimes In democratic societies like the United States , the voting process is a means by which citizens hold their government accountable ; conflicts are channeled into resolutions and power transfers peacefully . Our system of representative government works only when honest ballots are not diluted by fraudulent ballots . The FBI , through its Public Corruption Unit , has an important but limited role in ensuring fair and free elections . Election crimes become federal cases when : The ballot includes one or more federal candidates ; The crime involves an election official abusing his duties ; The crime pertains to fraudulent voter registration ; Voters are not U.S. citizens . Civil rights violations Someone threatens a voter with physical or economic harm unless the voter casts his ballot in a particular way ; Someone tries to prevent qualified voters from getting to the polls in a federal election ; A scheme exists to prevent minorities from voting . What is NOT a federal election crime : Giving voters a ride to the polls ; Offering voters a stamp to mail an absentee ballot ; Giving voters time off to vote ; Violating state campaign finance laws ; Distributing inaccurate campaign literature ; Campaigning too close to the polls ; Trying to convince an opponent to withdraw from a race . If you think an election crime is occurring , call the election crimes coordinator at your local FBI office . ICU manages five programs : the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act -LRB- FCPA -RRB- , Kleptocracy Initiative , Antitrust , International Fraud against the Government , and International Corruption of Federal Public Officials . Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ICU has management responsibility and program oversight for FBI investigations of the FCPA . The 1977 legislation has two main provisions : the first deals with bribery of foreign officials , and the second deals with accounting transparency requirements under the Securities Exchange Act . The dual elements were designed to facilitate parallel criminal and civil enforcement to stem corruption and promote fair business practices worldwide . The anti-bribery provision makes it illegal for U.S. companies and certain foreign companies to bribe foreign officials to obtain or retain business . The bribes can be in the form of money or any other items of value . The accounting provision of the FCPA focuses on requirements applying to U.S. companies and all foreign companies whose securities are listed on the U.S. stock exchange . The United States can not charge the foreign official under the FCPA ; rather , the U.S. works together with international law enforcement partners by investigating U.S. subjects complicit in paying bribes to foreign officials . The supply and demand equation of bribe paying and receiving illustrates the FCPA and kleptocracy violations as two sides of the same coin . Through graft and embezzlement of state funds , corrupt leaders amass tremendous wealth at the expense of the broader populace . Some of the most egregious examples have occurred in countries with very high rates of poverty . The inherent challenge for corrupt leaders is covertly expatriating and holding money in secure locations where it can be accessed in the future . Generally , that requires international movement of funds . When transfers occur in U.S. dollars or transit the U.S. banking system , federal money laundering jurisdiction is established . The FBI initiates money laundering investigations to trace the international movement of assets and , in conjunction with foreign partners , forfeit and repatriate assets back to legitimate authorities in victim countries . ICU investigates these international business people who provide professional services to illicit actors wishing to disguise the source or nature of their money . These insiders have unique knowledge concerning the financial and legal systems in which they operate , making detection difficult . International Contract Corruption ICU has program management responsibility over cases involving international fraud against the government and international corruption of federal public officials . The FBI was a co-founder of the International Contract Corruption Task Force -LRB- ICCTF -RRB- , created in 2006 to address contract fraud concerns stemming from overseas U.S. government spending during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . Spending on these programs is highly susceptible to corruption and fraud by those wishing to take advantage of the chaotic circumstances surrounding these benevolent endeavors . Misuse of U.S. funds overseas poses a threat to the United States and other countries by promoting corruption within the host nation , damaging diplomatic relations , inadvertently supporting insurgent activity , and potentially strengthening criminal and terrorist organizations . Price fixing , bid rigging , and market allocation deprive U.S. consumers of true competition , an economic bedrock of our free and democratic society . The ill-gotten gains and competitive advantages stolen by cartels reduce supply , eliminate incentives to compete by offering better and more innovative products and services , and destabilize economic markets . ICU Initiatives Most recently , ICU has undertaken two large initiatives : the creation of three international corruption squads dedicated to investigating FCPA , kleptocracy , and international antitrust cases and the development of a robust private sector outreach program . International Corruption Squads The International Corruption Squads -LRB- ICS -RRB- , based in New York City , Los Angeles and Washington , D.C , were created to address the national impact of foreign bribery , kleptocracy , and international antitrust schemes . These schemes negatively affect U.S. financial markets and economic growth when not adequately addressed . They are unique in nature in that they are international matters with the overt criminal acts typically occurring outside U.S. borders . Without these dedicated resources , it was difficult for FBI field offices to investigate international matters that did not directly affect their area of responsibility as clearly as some other violations ; therefore , the FBI has created three international corruption squads fully dedicated to addressing international corruption matters without draining the resources of individual field offices . The international corruption squads are a vital resource to combat international cartels and corruption . The violations addressed by the ICSs are equally recognized by both DOJ and the FBI as matters posing significant risks to U.S. national interests . These squads not only lend additional resources to a global threat but they also allow the Bureau to proactively attack the matters by using sophisticated investigative techniques that have long been successful against other complex criminal matters . Nonetheless , we believe by fostering these vital relationships , the Bureau will be able to effectively fight international corruption to ensure a fair competitive global market environment for companies resulting in a strong U.S. economy .
