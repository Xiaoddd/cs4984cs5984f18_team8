This year Thanksgiving presents the real scare of political cold war November 23 , 2016 juneleffler By June Leffler Bringing up the election is ground zero for a cold war during Thanksgiving dinner . Therapists , advice columnists , talk show hosts and their callers , anyone who tweats . That seems too optimistic when most folks want to avoid the discussion entirely . Nick Wright grew up in Cleveland , Ohio . Ten years ago his mom and step-dad started an organic farm in Middlefield , Ohio . All the while Wright has spent the last five years in Chicago , a prototypical liberal city . They certainly did not talk on election day . Niki Miller voted for Clinton . Without paying too much attention to it , he said he could see something on the news triggering his aunt or uncle . Family members are traveling from both coasts but once they arrive they might feel a little stuck . Wright said the only way to get away would be to take a walk in the woods . Embed from Getty Images Thanksgiving is awkward for everybody . Pfeffer advises his clients to first decide if they even want to go to Thanksgiving dinner . Pfeffer said if folks decide to go , in preparation , they can make a rescue plan . A rescue plan is something you arrange with your partner or whomever you are closest to . Avoidance is a popular strategy for keeping the peace . Miller said . Weston Strickler said his family is exceptionally good at avoiding politics . Strickler will visit his family in Kokomo , Indiana . He voted for Green Party candidate Jill Stein , and his parents voted for Clinton , but his aunts and uncles voted for Trump . Strickler said if someone makes a political statement , everyone will politely not engage . Strickler said his family grew up with shared Christian values of simplicity , kindness , and passivity , not fire and brimstone . Winona did not want to be identified because of the awkwardness with her family . Winona grew up in rural Meade County in Kentucky . She is 24 years old and moved to Louisville , Kentucky , six years ago to go to college . Winona is queer , black , and a Black Lives Matter and pro-choice activist . Her step-dad and mom are both white fundamental Christians . They know about things that have happened in the past . Winona said she speaks with her mom once every two or three months , and visits about three times a year . She blocks her family on her social media . Her mom did call her the day after the election , saying she had voted for Trump . It can get combative between her and her step-dad . To make the visit easier , she brings up recipes , one of the few things she and her mom bond over . If she is engaged , she tries to remain calm . Winona is bringing one of her friends to Thanksgiving , to support her and lessen the blow . Friendsgiving is a relatively new tradition that provides the promise of refuge through a more casual gathering of friends for the holiday . For folks like Winona , Friendsgiving provides a safe space to openly be herself . Photo at top : Thanksgiving could be worse .
