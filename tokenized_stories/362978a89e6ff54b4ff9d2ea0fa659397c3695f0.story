The distress expressed by water protesters at Standing Rock is not just for the sake of opposing big oil . Clearly , one can understand why so many have protested the Dakota Access Pipeline , which opens this month . This particular pipeline was built under the Missouri River , which is the primary water source for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe . Recent Oil Spills in North Dakota It goes without argument that oil pipelines are less secure than the companies building them want us to believe . Furthermore , because spill detection technology is somewhat lacking , many of the 745 leaks in North Dakota last year resulted in substantial contamination . For example , in December 2016 , nearly 530,000 gallons of oil leaked from the Belle Fourche Pipeline in Billings County . The leak contaminated private land , US Forest Service grazing land , and Ash Coulee Creek . This was just 2.5 hours from Standing Rock . A landowner notified them when he stumbled upon the leak . Clearly , an important disconnect exists . This prompted a town to shut down drinking water service to 6,000 of its residents . Rather than dismissing these two examples as isolated incidents , consider the following . The New York Times reports that between 2006 and 2014 , more than 1,300 oil pipeline spills occurred in North Dakota . In 2006 , over one million gallons leaked out into the county of McKenzie . The same county experienced a leak in 2014 with another 1,008,000 gallons of oil spilling into the environment . Consequently , it is clear why protesters and landowners are concerned about the structural integrity of oil pipes . Oil leak examples presented in this article are not unique . Oil spills in North Dakota are actually quite common .
