The Native American protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- at Standing Rock , North Dakota is just such an event . This has the feeling of a truly seminal , historic event in which we are all invited to participate . As if a formless archetypal process is taking on form and materializing in front of our eyes , a deeper universal conflict that exists within the unconscious psyche of humanity is becoming visible at Standing Rock . On the one hand , there is the indigenous perspective that honors all life , living in conscious relationship with the earth . Two more opposed world-views are hard to imagine . At Standing Rock , a dissociation and fragmentation that exists deep within the soul of humanity is , both literally and symbolically , playing out on the world stage . The weapons of industrial civilization are guns , clubs , pepper spray , mace , tear gas , tasers , attack dogs and the like . By viewing what is taking place in this conflict symbolically , something profoundly important is being revealed to us that has to do with all of us . Symbols are the language of dreams , which is to say that symbols reflect something within the dreamer , which in this case is us . What is playing out at Standing Rock is all of our business . Donate to Awaken in the Dream The conflict at Standing Rock is an iteration of a seemingly endless fractal that is happening in different guises not only all over the world , but all throughout history as well . Animated by this sacred spirit , at Standing Rock the Native Americans are courageously fighting the same demonic force that has for centuries ravaged their people , lands , and sacred heritage . How we look at things determines what we see . How we view the conflict at Standing Rock depends upon how far back we go in time , i.e. , where we start in the story . The argument of Big Oil is that the protesters are trespassing on private property , i.e. , breaking the law . At the collective level , this perverse inner process is mirrored by the consumer society in which we live , a culture that continually fans the flames of never-ending desires , conditioning us to always want more . As if starving , we are in an endless feeding frenzy , trying to fill a bottomless void . This process of rabid , obsessive-compulsive consumption is a reflection of a deep , inner shared sense of spiritual starvation that is endemic to industrial civilization . Wetiko disease is a self-devouring operating system , a living death sentence that , if left unchecked , destroys everything within its dominion , including itself . Splitting the world into good and evil -LRB- and being identified with the good -RRB- is a slippery slope , oftentimes quite dangerous -LRB- as many millions of innocent people have been killed as a result of this process -RRB- , but if there was ever a situation that lends itself to clear-cut good vs. evil , Standing Rock is it . A war between life and death is , both literally and symbolically , playing out at Standing Rock . This is to say that encoded in the conflict is a potential blessing , just like hidden within a poison is its own medicine . Because of its power , Big Oil has managed to have public funds being used to protect its very private interests -LRB- i.e. , its profits -RRB- ; this is to say that taxpayers are footing the bill on behalf of the super-wealthy . Only in coming together can people and communities create the conditions for the regeneration of life and overcome the very powerful forces that would extract the last barrel of oil from the earth . The seeming entity that enlivens , sponsors and supplies cover for this sinister project is what the Native American wisdom holders are pointing at when they use the word wetiko . The incredible destruction that they cause , be it of the environment , communities or the lives of individual human beings , are considered to be nothing more than collateral damage , merely the price of doing business . Like a Frankenstein monster , as wetiko entrenches itself in our global system of doing business , it practically assumes an autonomous life and will of its own . This sinister life-form feeds on life and the living , as if it is a form of death taking on life . It is solely concerned with short-term profits , having little or no meta-awareness of , or concern for , the deleterious long-term effects of its rapacious actions . More than three hundred Native American tribes have come together and are on the ground at Standing Rock standing as one , which itself is unprecedented , as some of these tribes have been enemies from time immemorial . Stepping out of the illusion of being powerless , these tribes are recognizing the incredible power that becomes available when we see through the illusion of our being separate from each other , and in the spirit of peace , come together in solidarity and join forces - this itself can serve as a mirror and inspiration for all the rest of us . In their sacred activism , the Native American protestors consider themselves to be the guardians and protectors of the water , of the land , of the earth as a whole system . There is no greater honor . We are all in this together . Let us hear the call of the indigenous soul within us and spread the word about Standing Rock .
