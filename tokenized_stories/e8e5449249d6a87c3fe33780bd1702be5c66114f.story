His biggest controversies are so huge , so ludicrously bamboozling , that they suck up much of the attention in the country . In any other administration , that level of dispute might have made the front page . This is a lost opportunity for anyone who cares about environmental protection at the national level . The nomination of Betsy DeVos , a Republican donor who appeared not to know about basic federal education law , led to constituents clogging Senate switchboards . But the EPA wields much more power over air and water pollution than the Department of Education does over schools . And unlike DeVos , Pruitt is a tireless and knowledgable advocate for his cause of cutting environmental protections . He knows the statutes that govern the EPA , and -LRB- like the Obama administration -RRB- he knows how to interpret them to bring about his policy ends . By itself , this letter may not have been so odd : Republicans in oil-rich states often see an easy enemy in the EPA . Instead , it had been written by lobbyists working for Devon Energy , an Oklahoma City-based oil-and-gas firm . Pruitt received the letter in an email from Devon , changed two sentences and a couple spare words , and apparently forwarded it to the administrator of the EPA with his own name at the bottom . Devon Energy later donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican Attorneys General Association , while Pruitt was its chairman . This week , it finally received a reply to its first request , filed more than two years ago : a set of 411 emails exchanged between Pruitt and local oil companies . Most of the records they received were mass newsletters and not the one-on-one correspondence they believe exists . A hearing is scheduled for Thursday . Many government officials run sluggish public-records departments . He just chose not to . Secrecy is not the only knock against Pruitt . As attorney general of Oklahoma , he sued the EPA at least 14 times . He tried to block mercury and ozone protections that he thought were too onerous . He sued on behalf of an oil company to prevent enforcement of the Endangered Species Act . Burford left the agency after three years , unpopular and disliked , having accidentally won more power for the agency in the Supreme Court . They cite the burning Cuyahoga River , smog-choked Los Angeles , and the thousands of early deaths through asthma and heart failure . The United States adopted strict environmental laws -LRB- and under a Republican president , no less -RRB- because of the horrors of that period . But we are entering a similarly consequential time for environmental regulation . The price of renewable energy may soon finally become competitive with coal . Solar and wind will lead to major-emission reductions from the power sector : a key step in the fight to mitigate climate change . Whether wind and solar are allowed to change the U.S. energy market will depend on federal leadership across agencies . We want to hear what you think about this article .
