It was October 1973 and three months earlier David Bowie had stood before his fans at the Hammersmith Odeon and announced -- to the surprise of his band -- that he was effectively ending Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars . His alter-ego was done , and he had to break up the band . Invitation only , the audience comprised members of the David Bowie fan club , the rock press , musicians , and other lucky people . This would turn out to be the very last time that Mick Ronson and Trevor Bolder would play with Bowie as the Spiders . Joining the band was pianist Mike Garson , who had been a part of the Ziggy tour and the recently released Aladdin Sane , and whose sound is unmistakable here . Bowie also has three black back-up singers , a first sign of the sounds he would explore in Young Americans . Unlike a concert run-through , the three days of filming featured each number rehearsed separately and filmed multiple times . For one thing , it allowed Bowie the chance to change costumes for each song , wearing some of the most outlandish outfits of his Ziggy era , designed by Freddie Burretti . For the finale , Bowie joined her onstage . Also on the tape are introductions from one Amanda Lear , a velvet-voiced blonde who had a very intriguing career -- Salvador Dali protege , Rolling Stone groupie , David Bowie lover , Italo-disco star , nude model , possible transsexual . So yes , a perfect host for what was at that time both a high-water mark for glam rock and a visit to the future . As we approach the one year anniversary of David Bowie 's death , which seemed to send the Grim Reaper on a killing spree , there 's plenty of the Starman 's career to discover and re-discover ... and to be released .
