As archaeologists , anthropologists , historians , and museum workers committed to responsible stewardship , we are invested in the preservation and interpretation of archaeological and cultural heritage for the common good . We join the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in denouncing the recent destruction of ancient burial sites , places of prayer and other significant cultural artifacts sacred to the Lakota and Dakota people . The construction crews , flanked by private security and canine squads , arrived just hours after the Standing Rock Sioux tribal lawyers disclosed the location of the recently discovered site in federal court filings . The ancient cairns and stone prayer rings there can not be replaced . While a short portion of the pipeline construction has been halted by the Obama Administration until this survey can be done , construction continues elsewhere on the pipeline . More background on the resistance to DAPL below the fold . Many thanks to Lawrence O'Donnell for his national coverage of Standing Rock . National attention grows from the next two events . Activists are urged to avoid the check points .
