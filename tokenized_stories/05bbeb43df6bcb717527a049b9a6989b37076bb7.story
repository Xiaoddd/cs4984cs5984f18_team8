Trudeau spoke at the end of a remarkable eight-hour stopover in the national capital , an unscheduled break from his overseas trip to accommodate the last-minute summit with B.C. 's John Horgan , who has staked his government 's survival on opposing the pipeline , and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley , whose province 's economic health depends on it . It has been a week since Kinder Morgan announced it was halting all non-essential spending on the plan to build a second , bigger pipeline parallel to the existing one between Edmonton and Burnaby , B.C. . The company gave the Trudeau government until the end of May to reassure its investors the pipeline would be built , despite mounting opposition . After the meeting , Notley and Trudeau exuded confidence the deadline would be met and the pipeline would proceed . Horgan , however , betrayed no evidence that their confidence had anything to do with him . If anything , the positions of the two NDP premiers appeared all the more entrenched when the meeting was over . Notley said legislation to allow Alberta to cut oil supplies to B.C. , sure to send gas prices there soaring , would be introduced in the legislature this week . Horgan said a court challenge testing whether B.C. has the jurisdiction to regulate what can and ca n't flow through the expansion will proceed before the end of the month . The chasm between them did not go unacknowledged by the prime minister . As such , Trudeau said he has instructed Finance Minister Bill Morneau to sit down with Kinder Morgan to find a financial solution that will soothe their investors . He also promised legislation that would reaffirm Ottawa 's authority to press ahead with a development deemed to be in Canada 's national interest . He said the negotiations with Kinder Morgan would n't play out in public , and he would not elaborate on exactly what the legislation will say . Kinder Morgan , for its part , would not say Sunday whether it felt mollified by the day 's events . Trudeau said the pipeline was approved by his government in 2016 after a rejigged environmental assessment and Indigenous consultation process , and only in concert with the Liberals ' climate change and oceans protection plan . Approval came in consultation with the previous B.C. Liberal government , which gave its consent to the project after its own conditions were met . Horgan 's election last year changed that . His minority government exists at the pleasure of the Green party , and on condition of his continued opposition to the project . Trudeau made it clear Sunday that Horgan and his government are the ones wholly responsible for the impasse . The federal government can and will do more on the pipeline 's potential environmental impact , he added . Horgan blamed the lack of specifics on the dispute itself . A lack of scientific clarity on how diluted bitumen behaves in water , and a lack of political clarity over who is responsible to pay in the event of such a spill , are two of his chief concerns , Horgan added . Dilbit spilled into Michigan 's Kalamazoo River from an Enbridge pipeline in 2010 cost billions to clean up , with parts of the river closed for years afterwards . Before Sunday 's duelling news conferences were even complete , Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer was front and centre , accusing Trudeau of sitting on his hands for too long and frittering away investor confidence in Canada as a whole . Alberta 's Opposition leader , Jason Kenney , also said Sunday 's meeting did n't bring the pipeline any closer to construction . He said government investment in the project would do nothing to solve B.C. 's continuing opposition . Kenney repeated his calls for the prime minister to penalize B.C. by withholding federal dollars for infrastructure and jobs training .
