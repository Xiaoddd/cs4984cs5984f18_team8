U.S. District Judge James Boasberg 's decision will come as a blow to the Standing Rock Sioux , who have argued that an oil spill from the pipeline under Lake Oahe - from which the tribe draws its water - could have a detrimental effect on the tribal community . From there it can be shipped to the Gulf Coast and potentially lucrative markets abroad . It has the capacity to move half of the oil produced daily in North Dakota , the nation 's second-leading producer behind Texas . President Donald Trump had pushed for the pipeline 's completion , and the Army Corps of Engineers dropped a plan to conduct more environmental study after he took office . The Corps permitted the pipeline project . The tribe is among four that have challenged the pipeline in court over environmental fears that Texas-based ETP says are unfounded . The judge said the Corps also did n't adequately study how the pipeline might disproportionately affect the tribal community - a concept known as environmental justice . That aims to ensure development projects are n't built in areas where minority populations might not have the resources to defend their rights . In its analysis of the Missouri River crossing , the Corps studied the mostly white demographics in a half-mile -LRB- 0.8-kilometer -RRB- radius , which the agency maintains is standard . But if the agency had gone another 88 yards -LRB- 80 meters -RRB- - about the length of a football field - the study would have included the Standing Rock Reservation . The tribe accused the Corps of gerrymandering . Boasberg ordered the Corps to reconsider certain areas of its environmental analysis , and took arguments on whether to shut down the 1,200-mile -LRB- 1,930-kilometer -RRB- pipeline while the work is done . Corps attorneys said the agency expects to be able by the end of the year to substantiate its earlier determination that the pipeline poses no significant environmental threats . Their assertion is backed by numerous energy trade groups . Tribal attorneys argued that the company had overstated the potential effects of a shutoff and questioned whether the Corps will take the additional review seriously , saying a shutdown would create incentive for the agency to do so . The tribes also proposed a fallback plan if Boasberg decided against a shutdown . It included increased public reporting of pipeline issues such as repairs , and implementation of a spill response plan - including equipment staging - at Lake Oahe . All rights reserved .
