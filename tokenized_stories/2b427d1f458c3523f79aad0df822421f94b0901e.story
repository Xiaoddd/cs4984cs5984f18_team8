This refers not to the times of the dragon , or the Pagan Roman emperors , who were wroth with the woman , the church , and made war with her seed ; but Rome Papal , and its Gentiles , are intended ; these are the nations that antichrist reigns over : and it does not so much design their anger against Christ , and his people , expressed by their anathemas , excommunications , murders ; and massacres , and bloody persecutions , which could not be cause of thanksgiving to the elders ; but their anger and resentment at his power and reign , at having the outward court taken from them , said to be given them , Revelation 11:2 ; and at their loss of power , profit , pleasure , and plenty , through the fall of Babylon , and the setting up of Christ 's kingdom ; and though these things will make the Gentiles , the followers of antichrist , gnash their teeth , it will occasion joy and thanksgiving among the saints : and thy wrath is come : the time is come to make Babylon , or the Romish antichrist , to drink of the wine of the fierceness of divine wrath ; as the time of the Lamb 's wrath and vengeance upon Rome Pagan was come at the opening of the sixth seal , so the time of his wrath and vengeance on Rome Papal will be come at the sounding of the seventh trumpet : and the time of the dead , that they should be judged ; not the time of the wicked , who are dead in sins , while they live , and who die in their sins , not their time to be raised from the dead , in order to be judged , for they will not rise till after the thousand years are ended ; nor the time of the dead in Christ , who will rise upon Christ 's personal coming , at the beginning of the thousand years ; but this trumpet respects not the personal coming of Christ to raise the dead , and judge the world , but his spiritual coming to reign in his churches , and judge their enemies : the time of those that were dead for Christ , whose blood had been shed in his cause , the time for the vindication of them , and avenging their blood , is now come ; the souls of those under the altar had been a long time crying to God to avenge their blood on them that dwell on the earth ; and now the time will be come , when God will judge his people , vindicate their cause ; and when he , to whom vengeance belongs , will repay it , by pouring out the vials of his wrath on the antichristian party , by giving them blood to drink , because they are worthy ; this judgment will issue in the fall and ruin both of the western and eastern antichrist .
