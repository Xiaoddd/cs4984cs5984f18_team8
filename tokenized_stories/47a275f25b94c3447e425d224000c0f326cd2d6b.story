World Books & the Arts July 22-29 , 2013 Issue Distortions and Divisions Distortions and Divisions Distrust and distortion occupy the distance between much of Turkey and the Kurds of Diyarbakir . Even the colours of the flowers , of the brilliant green grasses , of the trees are different . Kemal is renowned for his lavish descriptions of the Turkish countryside in the wild south and southeast regions of Anatolia , where he was born in 1922 into a Kurdish family . His characters come into focus against it , trudging over mountains or building fires ; tending crops or gossiping with neighbors ; plotting against malicious landlords or doing time for their foiled plots . Their anger and disappointment was a foreshadowing : failed rebellions against the state trail the Kurds like a heavy robe . Still , nothing compares to the fighting of the last thirty years . In 1980 , the Turkish military launched a coup and , once in power , set about trampling all opposition . Although the military was in power for only three years , the mass arrests and systematic torture that were its tools effectively crushed the leftist opposition , which was based in western Turkey . But in the southeast , the assault only hardened the PKK , which grew into an armed rebellion led by one of its founders , Abdullah Ocalan . In 1984 , six years after it was first established in Diyarbakir , an ancient city situated on the banks of the Tigris River , the PKK launched an armed rebellion for Kurdish independence . Between 1990 and 2000 , as the Turkish military destroyed thousands of Kurdish villages in the countryside , the generations who once lived among those crystal-clear greens , amber yellows and bluer blues were pushed into Diyarbakir . Its population tripled , spreading far beyond the dark gray basalt walls surrounding its old city . New homes and boulevards fanned out from the walls , with block upon block of buildings giving shelter to the displaced , whose shared trauma and rural ways gave Diyarbakir the feel of a refugee camp . Kurdish farmers became Kurdish dissidents , and the would-be capital of greater Kurdistan became a recruiting ground for the PKK . The walls of many Diyarbakir living rooms feature portraits of these guerrillas , often beside a photo of Ocalan , who in 1999 was captured in Kenya while seeking asylum . Since then , he has been serving a life sentence for treason on Imrali Island in the Sea of Marmara . Ocalan will put an end to this war . We brought a letter that will bring peace . During the preceding months , BDP officials and Turkish intelligence officers had been visiting Ocalan in prison to discuss a cease-fire . The outcome of these talks was an agreement that the PKK would disarm and withdraw from Turkish territory . Eventually , Kurdish leaders hoped , reforms to the Constitution and the penal code would grant Kurds basic rights . The first of those demands , although consuming , seemed like wishful thinking . Ocalan had written a letter to be read at the Newruz celebrations . Communication from Ocalan has been scarce , and for weeks the anticipation of his speech had injected Diyarbakir with a rare optimism . Ceremonial bonfires spit high orange flames . In Diyarbakir , many roads are scarred black from the fires ignited during protests , and the residue of tear gas is a common ambient smell , but on Newruz the city was one big party . Families picnicked , and women ate tart dandelion greens plucked from where they sat on the grass . I was told by a few amused people in the crowd about a group of first-generation Swedes of Kurdish origin who were decked out in PKK khaki , laughing and photographing each other by the food vendors . The Turkish media are notoriously dedicated to portraying Diyarbakir as a war zone , but on Newruz , newspapers and news programs showed the gathering for what it was : peaceful . Although the Turkish economy has been booming , about 20 percent of the population in Diyarbakir is unemployed , twice the national figure , and what wealth there is serves only to accentuate the severity of the poverty . The literacy rate is 18 percent lower than the national average , and worse for women . In Istanbul , a guide will point out the vast dome of the Hagia Sophia , the spindly minarets of the Blue Mosque , or lead you across the red-lit walkways of a dank underground cistern . In modern Diyarbakir , the itinerary takes a tactical path . Ask a local to identify the military barracks : many are indistinguishable from other buildings save for barbed wire . Some barracks -LRB- there are many -RRB- are more easily noticed , set off from the main roads by high , guarded gates and ornamented with statues of larger-than-life soldiers . Nearby , a car bomb aimed at a military vehicle was detonated ; the blast was so loud , some say , that it could be heard for miles . Take a walk through Baglar , the poorest neighborhood in the city , where the walls are a riot of PKK graffiti . Here is where four Kurdish rebels were hanged , and there is Dicle University , where students are always on strike . The BDP headquarters fly a black flag in memory of the Kurds languishing in prison . There are the mass graves you may have read about in the newspaper . In the center of town , surrounded by tea houses and apartment buildings , is Diyarbakir prison . In the 1980s , the wails of tortured inmates echoed from the prison through the city streets . Today systematic torture is illegal , but Diyarbakir prison remains full . These laws weigh on every citizen in Diyarbakir . Until 2010 , minors charged with terrorism could be tried as adults , and the trauma of prison time haunts the young generation . Turkey has learned the hard way that when you put a child in prison for terrorism , he could leave it a terrorist . The cells are full at Diyarbakir prison , and if , when standing outside it , you can see a pair of brown shoes airing on a windowsill , as I did one afternoon , imagine what the inmate sees when he looks out the same window . That , your guide will remind you , is the point of having a prison in the center of a city . She tells me a story about a damaged young Kurd who spent their interview session sipping vodka from a water bottle . While Neyzi talked , I took notes until my fingers were too stiff from the cold to write . She had come dressed in layers . In the library , there were newspaper clippings in Turkish and Kurdish about the 1938 Dersim massacre , in which thousands of Kurds were killed or displaced by the Turkish Army , and the 2011 Uludere massacre , when thirty-four young Kurdish smugglers were killed by airstrikes . The novels of Yashar Kemal , with all their pastoral beauty , were laid out for visitors to peruse , attached to the table by thin plastic cords so no one could steal them . Young people in Mugla had enviably mundane concerns : getting into college , graduating , finding a job . Kurds in Diyarbakir , on the other hand , knew why Neyzi was there ; they feel they are in the middle of history . For generations , Kurds were encouraged to assimilate , and those who lived quietly in Istanbul , indistinguishable from their Turkish neighbors , were considered a success . But thirty years of fighting has turned Kurdish identity into a badge of pride . To the young Kurds who talked with Neyzi , assimilation is both a submission and a betrayal . Kurds know this . Neyzi thinks it has the opposite effect . She told me the story of one soldier who , after a battle with the PKK , was shocked when he examined the state IDs of the dead . He ticks off important statistics : 72 percent of residents use spoken Kurdish in daily life ; 66 percent are satisfied with the Sur municipality services . Full language rights , even at this peaceful juncture , seem remote , and full language rights are what Kurds demand . Speaking Kurdish in parliament , schools and courts is restricted . In 2007 , Demirbas was arrested for publishing the multilingual pamphlets . He lost his job . Demirbas returned in 2009 , and when he walks through town he affects a saintly glow , shaking hands across shop thresholds and patting children on the head . A key demand during negotiations between the Erdogan government and the Kurdish opposition is for local Kurdish officials to have more authority . It would be a more reasonable form of autonomy than an independent Kurdistan and would significantly elevate the status and power of politicians like Demirbas . My favorite Demirbas giveaway is a small book called Diyarbakir Is Waving Its Hands . The book is in English , Turkish and Kurdish , and , like many of his projects , it is a lengthy defense of Diyarbakir . Istanbul has the Blue Mosque ; Diyarbakir has the Great Mosque . Istanbul has ancient walls ; Diyarbakir has ancient walls . Istanbul has the Bosphorus ; Diyarbakir has the Tigris . The clouds of tear gas and the phalanx of charging police , the censorship of remarks critical of Erdogan and the obstinacy of his government , were all too familiar to them . But unlike protests in Diyarbakir , the tumult in Istanbul was big news . Foreign journalists flooded the city overnight , and international coverage was dominated by pictures of the brutality and articles striking notes of disbelief . Then she paused . That one city thrives while the other suffers is clearly an unbearable injustice to Demirbas . When I next visited him , Demirbas asked to see the slide show . We drank black tea in his office and watched the scrolling pictures . Demirbas grinned at his image atop the staircase and in the dark chamber of the Armenian church . He liked to see these Sur landmarks gleaming on the Internet . I felt guilty . Demirbas may use props so his stories will have more impact , but the mayor still lives inside the stories he tells . Elsewhere in the narrow cobblestone streets of Sur , in the Dengbej Evi , the conflict between Kurds and the state is translated into song . Dengbej is a style of a cappella singing , and the long songs tell stories of Kurdish history and culture . When Kurdish was banned , so was dengbej , and many of the traditional songs died along with those who had memorized them . New songs became both a historical record and the code in which to relate that history . Most of the dengbej sung in Diyarbakir today are not about ancient Kurdish history ; they are about the PKK . Hilmi Akyol , a poet and historian of dengbej , met me in the Dengbej Evi in March , the day before Newruz . Akyol is styled like an old Kurdish rebel , with a few modern touches : his gray hair is tucked into a turban , his beard groomed to a healthy inch . The endlessly roomy fabric of traditional Kurdish pants cinches around his thick waist , and on top he wears a practical blue windbreaker . Outside the Dengbej Evi office , where we talk , men take turns in an unrelenting chorus of dengbej . The words are sung so slowly and forlornly they seem to thicken the courtyard air like flour in soup . The strength of some of their voices causes Akyol to raise his voice . A girl falls in love . A large storm brings many deaths . A shepherd woman sees flowers in the mountains . Kurds battle people who want to conquer Kurdistan . In the stone courtyard , we listen to an old man with a voice that sounds , not unpleasantly , like a kazoo . His eyes are closed and his right hand covers his ear . The nearly 300 funders of the Mesopotamia Foundation are determined to draw Kurds beyond war . A few days after Newruz , I met with the professor and a few other board members in their offices . We sat on leather sofas so new it was hard not to slide off them onto the gleaming tile floor . The men were friendly and slightly conspiratorial , speaking carefully and eager to reinforce that , at its heart , the project was utopian , not slavishly political . It was still a secret . The first page of any Turkish textbook features the national anthem . The same texts hang on the wall of every Turkish classroom , flanking a picture of Ataturk himself . Two teachers arrived bearing gifts : three well-worn history textbooks . These textbooks are printed in the capital city of Ankara and distributed to schools all over the country . The glory is mostly lost on Kurdish students , who wonder about their own role in the country . A sixth-grade lesson says that one of the benefits of forests is to camouflage soldiers . This they do . Mesopotamia University will be a research university , with a focus on filling the gaps and correcting the errors in the Kurdish history taught in Turkey . Those involved in the school so distrust the state education system that committees of professionals and academics are beginning to write new textbooks exclusively for Mesopotamia University . At these early stages , the most important task is weaving Kurds back into the history of Turkey . Yegen was born near Diyarbakir in 1964 but grew up in Ankara , and he is only now beginning to learn Kurdish ; when we met , his office wall was papered with Kurdish vocabulary words . Yegen is hardworking and , aside from a head of rumpled , wavy hair , tidy ; his approach to learning Kurdish is systematic , not romantic . He is sheepish about not being able to speak it but had little choice growing up . It takes around thirty-five hours , often more , and snakes through the middle of the country . A friend remembered her childhood spent riding the train with her family from Diyarbakir to the Black Sea , where they picked tea . They sat together , three generations leaning against their belongings . When the train came , it was packed quickly . It clattered through the center of Diyarbakir , past shallow concrete ravines barely damp with water and low structures made out of broken , discarded train tracks . Craggy slate overhangs gave way to hills stained a shadowy green . The landscape is breathtaking : in so much of it there is so little human settlement , except for a few scattered villages , some farmland and an occasional grain silo . Ankara and Malatya , the two big cities along the way , seemed ugly , contrived . We were stopped once by armed gendarmes , who walked through the cars , checking IDs and opening bags so that German shepherds could dig their noses inside . For most of the trip , the train is alone and the sound of its engine is the only sound . I wondered to myself if the most recent visitors on foot were those who laid the tracks . It got dark . Small orange fires flared on the hills . I surmised , less romantically , that the hill fires were burning garbage . I had wanted to try to gauge the distance between Diyarbakir and Istanbul beyond a blink-of-the-eye flight on Turkish Air , and at 2 am on the station platform , I understood that Diyarbakir is very far away from Istanbul .
