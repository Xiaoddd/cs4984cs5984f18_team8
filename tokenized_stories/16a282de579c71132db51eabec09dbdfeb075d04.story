I left a piece of my heart by that river . I prayed by that river . Sang songs to that river . Met people who are willing to die for that river . The coming days , for me personally , will be full of driving and reflection . And I will share what I can as it comes to me . The coming days , for the tribes and their allies in North Dakota , will be full of prayer , of ceremony , of biting cold wind & snow , and an uncertainty about the future . For now what I want you to know is this ... there are beautiful people all over the world , and an impossibly huge number of them are gathered at Standing Rock . I have been touched in ways I can not yet explain . I am grateful . And I will do all in my power to get these voices of our Native People out into this great big world . Heart to heart . Human to Human . The shortest distance between a human being and the truth is a story , and I am honored to have been trusted with so many stories to share . Much Love , my friends . Much more to come .
