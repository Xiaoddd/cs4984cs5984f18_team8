Under the new scheme announced by Minister of the Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna on Thursday afternoon , the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada , which replaces the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency , will be the sole body responsible for reviewing the potential positives and negatives of major projects like pipelines , mines , and dams . Previously , that job fell to three different agencies . Bill C-69 , introduced in the house on Thursday , also replaces the National Energy Board with a new organization called the Canadian Energy Regulator , which will be responsible for regulating the oil and gas industry . For minor projects , the Agency will prepare an impact assessment report and make a decision . The changes would shorten the review process , from a maximum of 365 days to 300 for minor projects , and 720 down to 600 days for major projects . Prior to 2012 , there were strict guidelines that dictated when a project would trigger an environmental assessment , rather than leaving the decision up to politicians . A key Harper-era move was to do the opposite . Green Party leader Elizabeth May had mixed feelings about the bill . Winfield says that in practical terms , this bill is likely to reduce the number of projects that undergo a thorough review . Previously , that job fell to three different agencies .
