A winter blizzard descends on the camps just outside of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota . The gathering has been the largest meeting of Native Americans since the Little Bighorn camp in 1876 . Jenni Monet posted Mar 16 , 2018 At the height of the movement at Standing Rock , Indigenous teens half a world away in Norway were tattooing their young bodies with an image of a black snake . Derived from Lakota prophecy , the creature had come to represent the controversial Dakota Access pipeline for the thousands of water protectors determined to try to stop it . The Disruption of White Supremacy The Indigenous Collective Using Tattoos to Rise Above Colonialism It was a show of international solidarity between the Indigenous Sami and the Lakota . The backstory can be told simply . Temporary communities of thousands were created on the reservation borderlands in nonviolent resistance against the crude oil project . Police arrested more than 800 people , and many water protectors faced attack dogs , concussion grenades , rubber bullets , and , once , a water cannon on a freezing night in November . Last February , armored vehicles and police in riot gear cleared the last of the encampments . Oil now flows through the pipeline under the Missouri . But this Indigenous-led disruption , the awakening resolve that was cultivated at Standing Rock , did not dissolve after February . Rather , it spread in so many different directions that we may never fully realize its reach . The spirit of resistance can easily be found in the half-dozen or so other pipeline battles across the United States . Beyond that , the movement amplified the greater struggle worldwide : treaty rights , sacred sites , and the overall stand to protect Indigenous land and life . To be sure , post-colonization has always demanded acknowledgment of Indigenous autonomy . He wanted to remind the world that European colonizers had honored Iroquois Confederacy nationhood upon entering treaty agreements under the two row wampum . The story of White Clay , Nebraska , is indicative . There , another fight for justice was mounting , for families living on the neighboring Pine Ridge Indian Reservation . This one focused on a decades-long dispute over beer sales targeted at Native American customers mostly prone to alcohol addiction . Demands turned to broader issues : investigation of dozens of unsolved crimes in White Clay against Native Americans . Matthew had been caretaker of one of the main communities at Standing Rock , and he settled right in at Camp Justice at the edge of Pine Ridge . For all the momentum that the resistance at Standing Rock brought , the Indigenous rights movement in the 21st century faces increasing challenges . Tribal nations tread cautiously under the administration of Donald Trump . Internationally , the militarized protection of extractive energy projects and theft of land persist , despite glaring media attention paid to the rising number of Indigenous peoples killed or jailed for their activism in the face of it . The difference of opinion between the two leaders is a conflict that often lies at the heart of tribal community : protecting the Earth or protecting the Indigenous peoples . On the eve of Thanksgiving 2017 , when the Keystone pipeline ruptured and spilled 210,000 gallons of oil in neighboring South Dakota , the newly elected Faith remained notably silent while water protectors responded with outrage , most loudly , closest to home . Sustaining this awakening is the next great task . Like Archambault and other tribal leaders , Frazier was arrested for participating in the Standing Rock occupation . Leadership in the Indigenous world is not only a difficult balance , but also dangerous . In July , she survived an attack by a group of assailants wielding machetes . Just weeks earlier she had been named the new leader of the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras , the nonprofit organization formerly led by her mother . Last year , after the military-style assaults on the camps at Standing Rock , Human Rights Watch expanded its agenda to include a program focused on the environment as a human right . Meantime , the organization Global Witness reports that it has never been deadlier to take a stand against companies that steal land and destroy the Earth . In 2016 , the watchdog group found that nearly four activists a week are murdered fighting against mining , logging , and other extractive resource development . Traditional knowledge has kept us in harmony with Mother Earth . As disturbing as this reality is , it is unsurprising then to recall the military-style violence at Standing Rock : the rows of riot police pointing their guns at unarmed activists standing in the river ; tanks shooting water in freezing temperatures at a crowd of people gathered on a bridge . In this one regard , Standing Rock was not unique in the world . It had become crucially important . Sustaining this awakening is the next great task . Climate change poses one of the most serious reminders of why the sacred fires ignited at Standing Rock must continue to burn : Indigenous peoples and their knowledge and value systems matter . The girl who once tended cattle in the region of Chad bordering northeastern Nigeria has now become a bridge for her people and government officials making decisions impacting the fragile ecosystem of Lake Chad , the lifeline for the Mbororo . Jannie Staffansson , a representative of the Saami Council , wants what Chief Deskaheh had petitioned to the League of Nations nearly a century earlier : sovereign recognition for Indigenous Peoples on an international scale . She paused to check the Snapchat account she had been using to engage with a young Sami audience while at COP , a demographic similar to the teens who got tattoos of the black snake . No Paywall .
