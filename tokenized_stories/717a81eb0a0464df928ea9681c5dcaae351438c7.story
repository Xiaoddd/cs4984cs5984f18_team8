The cleanup costs , coupled with the environmental impact of these events , make renewable energy look like the only true option . Drill and Spill Transporting oil via pipelines is extremely risky . Ruptures and leaks are not uncommon , and these often cause serious environmental issues . But despite this fact , the U.S. continues to promote its operation . Now , another incident has shown why this method of transport -LRB- and form of energy generation -RRB- should be a thing of the past . This week , reports surfaced of diesel leaking from an underground pipe found on a farm in Iowa . According to officials , the Iowa Pipeline ruptured , spewing out nearly 138,000 gallons of diesel . Last October , their pipeline ruptured in Nebraska , which carried anhydrous ammonia . The leak killed one person and forced the evacuation of 23 households . A Much-Needed Alternative Oil spills can cause grave damage , both economically and ecologically . The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 sank the tourism industry for a number of coastal towns and cities in the Gulf of Mexico . Yet , we are still planning new projects . According to an Inforum interview with Bill Suess , an environmental scientist from the North Dakota Department of Health , 130,200 gallons spilled into the Ash Coulee Creek , while 46,200 gallons leaked onto the nearby hillside . These incidents , and others like it , really do make solar and other renewables look like the only real option . See stories of the future in your inbox each morning .
