The leak occurred just 150 miles from where members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their allies have been camping out for months to protest the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline on grounds that the structure could contaminate drinking water and destroy ancestral lands . The leak was discovered last week by a landowner rather than the monitoring device which should have detected it . Wendy Owen , a spokesperson for True Cos. , the company that is responsible for operating the pipeline , told CNBC that it has not yet determined why the equipment did n't detect its own leak . Military veterans gathered to protest the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota earlier this month . After months of protest , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced early in December it would deny a permit which would allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to continue its planned route under Lake Oahe , effectively halting construction . The news was widely considered a victory for the thousands of people who had gathered at protest sites in North Dakota and their supporters around the world . All rights reserved .
