About to cut it down . Guy hanging by the sign . The project runs through land that the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota considers sacred , and the protests at Standing Rock -LRB- and elsewhere along the construction route -RRB- have become a national cause for those that oppose the construction . Construction of the pipeline is completed except for the contested portion , but had been stalled by ex-President Barack Obama amid the protests . However , President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive action to advance approval of both the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Keystone XL Pipeline , which had also been halted by the Obama administration . Trump 's most recent Federal Election Commission filings showed that he owned stock in Energy Transfer Partners , one of the companies that is building the Dakota Access Pipeline . A spokesman for the president recently stated that the president has sold all of his stock -- which would presumably include the aforementioned stock in Energy Transfer Partners -- but did not provide evidence of the transactions . With construction apparently on track to begin again , it seems likely that there will be more protests in and around the Standing Rock area and elsewhere , though likely none at NFL games for a while .
