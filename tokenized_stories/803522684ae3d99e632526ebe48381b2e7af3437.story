Kirchmeier , who has led the police response to the Dakota Access oil pipeline , is a law enforcement lifer , a veteran of the North Dakota State Patrol and National Guard before being elected to his first term as Morton County sheriff . Tribes including the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux are fighting the Dakota Access project because they fear it will harm drinking water and cultural sites . Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners says the 1,200-mile pipeline through the Dakotas , Iowa and Illinois will be safe . The Corps cited North Dakota 's oncoming winter and increasingly contentious clashes between protesters and police . The agency previously had said it would not evict protesters due to free speech reasons . North Dakota officials contend that the Corps should not allow people to be on the land without a permit . More than 525 people from throughout the country have been arrested since August . In a recent clash between police and protesters near the path of the pipeline , officers used tear gas , rubber bullets and large water hoses in freezing weather . Organizers said at least 17 protesters were taken to the hospital , some for hypothermia and one for a serious arm injury . One officer was injured . It 's been called the largest gathering of Native American tribes in a century . Standing Rock tribal members and other Native Americans believe the land with the encampment is rightly owned by the Sioux through a more than century-old treaty with the U.S. government . Protest organizers said they do n't intend to leave or stop their acts of civil disobedience . The pipeline is projected to move a half-million barrels of crude oil daily to an existing pipeline in Patoka , Illinois , for shipment to Midwest and Gulf Coast markets . The Standing Rock Sioux , whose reservation straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border , are suing federal regulators for approving the pipeline . They have challenged the Corps ' decision to grant permits at more than 200 water crossings and argue that the pipeline less than a mile upstream of the reservation could affect drinking water for more than 8,000 tribal members and millions downstream . The tribe has n't fared well in court . A federal judge in September denied its request to block construction of the entire pipeline . An appeal is pending . The Corps of Engineers in July granted Energy Transfer Partners the permits needed for the crossing , but the agency decided in September that further analysis was warranted given the tribe 's concerns . Since then , the Corps has called for even more study and tribal input . The company responded by asking U.S. District Judge James Boasberg to declare that it has the right to lay pipe under Lake Oahe . The judge is n't likely to issue a decision until January at the earliest . President Barack Obama earlier this month raised the possibility of rerouting the pipeline , and Archambault has said that would be acceptable to the tribe provided the new route is n't near the reservation . But Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren told The Associated Press that that the pipeline wo n't be rerouted and the company has no alternative than to stick to its plan . President-elect Donald Trump holds stock in Energy Transfer Partners . Pipeline opponents worry that Trump 's investments could affect any decision he makes on the project as president .
