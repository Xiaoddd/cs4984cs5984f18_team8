Water protectors had been looking for new locations to establish camps because the Oceti Sakowin is in a flood plain and campers needed to evacuate the camp prior to the spring thaw . No trial date has been set . Previously , he served as editor of the Native News Network . He is a resident of Grand Rapids , Michigan . So-called law enforcement and private police are the real instigators . Never more true than today . izopnyde 1 year ago It is for each of us to find the love that the Creator has given us to share with our fellows . I am humbled by the sacrifice of this great warrior . Peace be with you my friend . Drink no poisoned water , eat no poisoned food and breath no poisoned air . Its not good for you , your family or animals . Know who you are , where you are and what you are doing . Be generous , honest and vigilant in your dealings . May the peace you hold in your heart quell the fears of your mind . I stand with the People of Standing Rock . I stand with the People of Puerto Rico . I stand with the People of the Aleutian islands . izopnyde Janice E Mitich 1 year ago The people dressed for a riot were law enforcement , not the Water Protectors . What you wear affects what your brain perceives . People dressed for a church wedding act differently than those dressed for a baseball game . Blessings to all people daring to stand up against oppression and the rape of Mother Earth . Bob Talley 1 year ago Janice E. Mitich , thank you for your post . Very well said . Shadow Wolf 1 year ago The inciting a riot charge against Chase Iron Eyes is egregious . Simply because he was present at the camp . He had every right to be there , to express his Creator given right to the First Amendment . The Morton County Sheriff Office have no credibility whatsoever . Especially after they tried deleting all the evidence leading up to that Nov. bloody incident . Also , he was unarmed and posed no personal threat to the hired thugs in riot gear . Unlike the Bundy Clowns and their cowardly Malheur Wildlife Refuge terrorists . Meh 1 year ago I am not to be a judge as I was not present to witness . Past happenings of injustice seem to be prevalent and still abound . I especially would like to echo and thank the writer izopnyde for I am also too old to run , so I will do my best to follow and try to understand . I hope in Native American culture that counts as a dance . Takesha 1 year ago I have never met Chase Iron Eyes , but I would way this in a court of law under oath . I have viewed a hundred videos of this man , and not once did I hear him curse or speak disrespectfully to anyone . I never have seen him show anger , he always speaks with knowledge , kindness and softly , even when there is a strong truth that needs to be spoken . He encourages people not to follow him , but to stand on their own to feet before the Creator , whomever they believe him to be , and to stand for what is right , what is pure , what is scared , and encourages them not to speak with his voice but their own , to love , to honor others even if they hate us . He is an lawyer , and educator of the people about the Indian Way and the Constitution of the United States . I speak the truth , unlike the those who are making the accusations , Chase Iron Eyes , did not incite a riot . He has said many times , he is not a chosen leader by any tribe he is but a single person , doing what is right to protect the water from avaricious , unscrupulous men who hide behind the names of an oil company , a governors office , and a police badge . What he is , like many others , is a man of principal , a prime example of an American who knows his rights and as they were given to him by the Constitution of the United States . He is a husband , and a father , a provider for his family . He exercises his rights in a non-violent way and cautions other to do the same . He is a target of the State and Federal law enforcement agencies . I give a word of caution here , whatever Chase Iron Eyes has done in the past , he has paid the price for it numerous times over . He is not the man the state and federal government has , and is , trying to present him to be . This is a sham , a travesty , and a lie . I am disgusted with the government which is not of the people , for the people or by the people . I send prayers , and I stand and dance for your freedom and safety . Will they the law and ect ever leave Native Americans its not their land why cant they honor treaties . Prayers brother Gene 1 year ago Good News : As of today , no Water Protectors have been found guilty of felony charges , none have been sentenced to spend time in jail , and over 30 Water Protectors have had misdemeanor charges dismissed for lack of evidence . They have comitted genocide against a race of people and should be dismantled . wrong is still wrong . Help support Native News Online by clicking on our sponsors ' advertisements .
