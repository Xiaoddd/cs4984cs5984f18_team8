The sea is steadily doing the same . Sea level has been rising , and more people have been moving closer to the coast . As the ocean has warmed , polar ice has melted , and porous landmasses have subsided , global mean sea level has risen by 8 inches -LRB- 20 centimeters -RRB- since 1870 . The rate of sea level rise is faster now than at any time in the past 2,000 years , and that rate has doubled in the past two decades . Tide gauges have been used to measure sea level for more than 130 years . Satellite measurements now complement the historical record . -LRB- NASA Earth Observatory image by Joshua Stevens , based on data from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and NOAA -RRB- That has not stopped people from buying and building along the coast . About 55 to 60 percent of U.S. citizens live in counties touching the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean , the Gulf of Mexico , or the Great Lakes . It is estimated that more than 50 percent of the United States population lives in coastal counties . -LRB- NASA Earth Observatory map by Joshua Stevens , using data from the NASA Socioeconomic Data Applications Center -RRB- For NASA climatologist Cynthia Rosenzweig , the urgency of the problem was crystallized in the summer of 2009 . As part of a climate change preparedness workshop , she joined other scientists , engineers , facility managers , and administrators on a tour of launch pads 39A and B at Kennedy Space Center . The U.S. government long ago made the choice to fly most of its rockets and experimental aircraft from the coast because failures happen , and they are less dangerous to the public when they happen over water than over land . But launching from the coast requires testing , storage , and spacecraft assembly facilities to be nearby . So if you are going into space from the United States , you are going to have to face down the challenge of rising seas . The majority of NASA centers and facilities are on or very near the coast . -LRB- NASA Earth Observatory map by Joshua Stevens . Langley Research Center is situated along the Back River , near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay . Ames Research Center is tucked into the south end of San Francisco Bay . Johnson Space Center sits on Clear Lake , an inlet off of Galveston Bay . Those centers all stand between 5 and 40 feet -LRB- 2 and 12 meters -RRB- above mean sea level . The math is nearly upside down at Michoud Assembly Facility , which sits behind levees near the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain . NASA coastal centers that are already at risk of flooding are virtually certain to become more vulnerable in the future . These maps show -LRB- in red -RRB- areas around NASA centers that would be inundated by 12 inches -LRB- 30 centimeters -RRB- of sea level rise . And turbulence matters : Think about that bathtub with a child sloshing around in it . Waves can roll up one side and then the other , sometimes splashing over the brim . The higher the flat-water line , the greater the chance that the water will slosh out of the basin when it is stirred up by storms and winds . Sea level also matters in a horizontal direction . An old rule of thumb is that 1 inch of vertical change in sea level translates into 100 inches of horizontal beach loss on a flat beach or marsh . In this way , a little bit of sea level rise can translate into a lot of water moving inland with storms or abnormally high tides . Most of it is built on coastal marshland about 5 to 10 feet above sea level . Launch Pad 39B at Kennedy Space Center has been the site of dozens of Apollo era and space shuttle launches . Future SLS and Orion spacecraft will lift off from this site . -LRB- NASA -RRB- Conservative climate models project that the seas off Kennedy will rise 5 to 8 inches by the 2050s , and 9 to 15 inches by the 2080s . If ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica continue to melt as quickly as current measurements indicate , those numbers could become 21 to 24 inches by the 2050s and 43 to 49 inches by the 2080s . Even as the space center was founded in 1961 , management and scientists were aware that seas were rising and could someday pose a threat . But in that era , the challenge was to get to the Moon as soon as possible . There was an established Air Force station nearby with access to orbits that could not be obtained from anywhere else in the United States . The choice was easy , and it was right for the time . But time has not been kind to this stretch of sand . Based on historical records and aerial photos , the beach in front of Kennedy has thinned and moved inland by as much as 200 feet -LRB- 60 meters -RRB- . Complex 39A was recently leased for 20 years to Space X , which intends to use it for its Falcon heavy lift rocket . The Atlantic Ocean stands less than a quarter mile from both . Crashing waves and sandy shoreline are not far from the launchpads at Kennedy Space Center . That distance is decreasing each year . -LRB- NASA Earth Observatory image by Joshua Stevens , using Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey -RRB- In 2004 , three hurricanes crossed the Florida peninsula . In response to the persistent storm damage , Kennedy facilities managers contracted to build a 15-foot-high , 725-foot-long dune as a proof of concept for a managed retreat . Center scientists and engineers also worked with the U.S. Geological Survey to map the shape of the beach -LRB- topography -RRB- with laser ranging and detection -LRB- LiDAR -RRB- . Then they enlisted coastal geologists John Jaeger and Pete Adams of the University of Florida to figure out why sand dunes near launch Complexes 39A and B were so persistently being washed away . The goal was to build a three-dimensional model of the area . They found that the beaches were retreating due to the shape of the seafloor just offshore , where gaps between the sandbars channel wave energy toward certain areas . But they also found sand piling up -LRB- accreting -RRB- in other areas , mostly near Launch Complex 41 . In 2012 , Hurricane Sandy offered a glimpse of the new normal along the Atlantic coast . The storm passed 200 miles offshore from Kennedy , but it moved so slowly that the heavy surf scoured the beach for three or four high-tide cycles . By the time the skies cleared , the dunes along a 2-mile -LRB- 3-kilometer -RRB- stretch near Complexes 39A and B had retreated as much as 65 feet -LRB- 20 meters -RRB- . Nearly 650 feet -LRB- 200 meters -RRB- of railroad track in the vicinity of 39A were undermined by the storm surge . That road sits just 4 feet -LRB- 1.2 meters -RRB- above sea level . Hurricane Sandy had wind , wave , or rainfall impacts on five NASA centers along the U.S. East Coast . In the aftermath of Sandy , Kennedy Space Center shored up the beach again . Some of the railroad track was removed , and coastal engineers piled up 90,000 cubic yards of sand to create a 1.2-mile secondary dune . Roughly 180,000 plugs of native dune grasses and other vegetation were planted to hold the sand in place . So far , the dune has performed as designed , providing protection against storm and wave inundation and sea level rise for critical launch infrastructure . In the longer run , Bray and colleagues at Kennedy are working on what they call a managed retreat . They are building up the shore defenses , while also earmarking land farther inland for additional launch infrastructure should the demand materialize . Different Centers , Common Problems The sea level concerns at Kennedy Space Center are the most visible , given the history and high profile of the real estate . But the issue touches the majority of NASA centers . The beaches and dunes alongside launch facilities in Wallops Island , Virginia , have been built up , washed away , and built up again several times in the past decade . Wallops had a prominent role in the early days of spaceflight before settling into a quieter role for several decades . In the past fifteen years , the facility has been redeveloped for launching NASA and commercial rockets , including the 2013 LADEE mission to the Moon . But Wallops sits amidst a barrier beach system , and those sand bars want to move . Erosion and beach migration has been reshaping the barrier island , Assateague , which sits north and east of Wallops . Assateague has been losing 10 to 22 feet -LRB- 3 to 7 meters -RRB- of beach per year ; Wallops Island has been losing about 12 feet . According to the Environmental Protection Agency , 50 acres -LRB- 20 hectares -RRB- of surrounding Accomack County are turning from farmlands to wetlands each year . Barrier beaches near the Wallops Flight Facility and the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport have been receding by as much as 12 feet per year . -LRB- NASA Earth Observatory image by Jesse Allen , using Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey -RRB- Hurricane Irene in 2011 did substantial damage to Wallops , leading NASA and local partners to redouble their efforts to hold back the tide . Coastal engineers built a sea wall 14-feet high and 3 miles long . A few months later , Hurricane Sandy removed 20 percent of the sand that had just been placed . Scientists have found that sea level around the Chesapeake Bay has been rising at 0.13 inches -LRB- 3.4 millimeters -RRB- per year , twice the global average of 0.07 inches -LRB- 1.7 mm -RRB- per year . Recent studies have shown that the landforms around the Chesapeake are sinking as a result of processes that started during the last Ice Age . Langley Research Center is surrounded by water and sits on land that is still naturally subsiding from the last Ice Age . -LRB- NASA Earth Observatory image by Joshua Stevens , using Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey -RRB- The combination of rising waters and sinking ground means the Hampton Roads area -LRB- Norfolk-Newport News-Virginia Beach -RRB- could see 41 to 53 inches -LRB- 104 to 135 centimeters -RRB- of relative sea level rise by the 2080s . That prospect has the leaders of both NASA Langley and the Langley Air Force Base planning to slowly move back from coastal flood zones . Scientists have surveyed the property with airborne lidar , and modelers have looked more closely at future projections for flood-prone areas . Old buildings are being hardened for tougher weather , and new buildings are being sited farther inland . Johnson Space Center lies within some of the most notorious hurricane territory along the Gulf of Mexico coast . The primary NASA center for human spaceflight training and operations is particularly vulnerable to water hazards , including storm surges from hurricanes , flooding from extreme rainfall , and sea-level rise . While these hazards are not new to the Galveston Bay region , many climate change scenarios predict increases in the frequency and severity of such events in an area where sea level rise has been significant . Sea level has been rising nearly 2.5 inches -LRB- 6.4 centimeters -RRB- per decade in Galveston Bay , significantly more than at any other NASA center . Sea level in Galveston Bay , near Johnson Space Center , has been rising nearly 2.5 inches -LRB- 6.4 centimeters -RRB- per decade , significantly more than at any other NASA center . -LRB- Astronaut photograph ISS024-E-10403 provided by the ISS Crew Earth Observations experiment , Johnson Space Center -RRB- Hurricane Ike in 2008 provided an instructive dress rehearsal for future events . Ike was just a category 2 storm in terms of wind speed , but the 20-foot-storm surge was similar to what a category 5 storm would generate . Widespread power outages occurred in Houston , and the power loss and debris cleanup resulted in a week-long shutdown at Johnson . The experience spurred improvements to infrastructure , including new floodgates at key facilities like Mission Control and the protecting and raising of utility tunnel vents to better handle storm surge flooding . The facility provides deepwater access for ships that carry rockets across the Gulf of Mexico to Kennedy and Wallops . Situated in the bayous and marshes of the Mississippi Delta , Michoud Assembly Facility is experiencing significant ground subsidence that exacerbates sea level rise . -LRB- NASA Earth Observatory image by Jesse Allen , using Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey -RRB- But Michoud stands below sea level and behind 19-foot-tall earthen levees . The land beneath the facility is subsiding , a result of the draining and compression of Mississippi Delta swampland as the city of New Orleans has been built up over the centuries . After Hurricane Katrina , the hardy facilities team at Michoud had to pump more than a billion gallons of water out of the facility . Cynthia Rosenzweig has an answer : flexible adaptation pathways . she said . For years she worked with city and state leaders to assess the impacts of climate change and to develop risk reduction strategies . They conducted environmental impact studies and modeling to project how much sea level could rise near each facility . They examined past and future land use changes around centers , even considering how sea level rise might affect the endangered and threatened species that find havens on NASA property . NASA Center 1950-2014 Trend 2050s GCM 2050s Rapid Ice-Melt Ames Research Center 6 to 9 inches 18 to 25 inches Johnson Space Center 5 to 9 inches 17 to 26 inches Kennedy Space Center 5 to 8 inches 17 to 24 inches Langley Research Center 7 to 11 inches 19 to 27 inches Michoud Assembly Facility not available 30 to 34 inches 42 to 51 inches Stennis Space Center 6 to 10 inches 18 to 27 inches Wallops Flight Facility 7 to 11 inches 19 to 28 inches According to global climate models -LRB- GCMs -RRB- , sea levels are expected to rise at least 5 inches -LRB- 13 centimeters -RRB- for most NASA centers by the 2050s . Those numbers rise significantly if ice sheets continue to melt rapidly . Note : the estimates for Michoud are especially high due to ground subsidence in the New Orleans area . In some places , they will need to design smarter buildings ; in others , they will retrofit and harden old infrastructure . If a facility must stay within sight of the water , then maybe the important laboratories , storage , or assembly rooms should not be on the ground floor . For the launch facilities , which must remain along the shore , beach replenishment , sea wall repair , and dune building may become part of routine maintenance .
