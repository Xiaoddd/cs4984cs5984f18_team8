The Army Corps of Engineers has ordered that the Oceti Sakowin camp near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation be closed at 2 p.m. local time on Wednesday , citing the potential for spring flooding . They also burned wooden structures central to the camp 's function , so that government engineers could not touch what they made and found sacred . The smoke that rose to the heavens was symbolic , as were the prayers : This was a ceremony of leaving . The numbers at the camp have dwindled since last December , when the weather turned mean and the tribe awaited the Army Corps ' next steps . James T. Meggesto , a member of the Onondaga Indian Nation , grew up in Syracuse , New York , with his grandmother nearby on the Onondaga reservation . He spoke to Salon : Today is a sad reminder that at its core , this dispute has always been about environmental justice , and the lack thereof in Indian country , because once again Indian people are literally being forced to accept a dangerous oil pipeline directly upstream of their water supply that was rejected by a non-Indian community for precisely this reason . Meggesto , who is a partner and deputy practice leader of the Native American law practice group at Holland & Knight , said he saw the amount of the tribe 's land shrinking when he was a child . And so it goes once again for Native American people , with government interests superseding treaty rights in order to grow environmentally dangerous businesses . While advocates of Energy Transfer Partners ' Dakota Access pipeline said it will be safe because it will use the latest technology and the most modern pipes , people who live in different parts of the U.S. and suffer oil leaks into their water supply think otherwise . As recently as Dec. 5 , a significant oil spill occurred 150 miles from Cannon Ball , North Dakota , where the Standing Rock camp sits . At the time , officials estimated that 4,200 barrels of crude oil had leaked from the Belle Fourche Pipeline in Billings County . Investigators did not know the cause , and it is this very sort of ambiguity that concerns anti-pipeline activists . Many cried and hugged others who had been strangers just a few months before , but are now considered family . Social media is awash with advocates of the Standing Rock Sioux , who are tweeting details and resolve to keep fighting corporate interests . Ruth Hopkins , a former judge for the Spirit Lake Nation and Crow Creek Sioux Tribe , has been among the most digitally vocal in the past year . As the group walked out of the camp , they sang traditional songs in several Native American tongues , and traveled the highway toward nearby Bismarck , where they were offered shelter in a transition center . Police are saying they 're going to do the raid in the morning now . Who knows , maybe they 'll try it under cover of darkness later .
