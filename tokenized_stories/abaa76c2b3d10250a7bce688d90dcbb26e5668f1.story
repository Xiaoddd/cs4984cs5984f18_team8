Post Nation Chicago police officers have pattern of using excessive force , scathing Justice Dept. -LRB- Reuters -RRB- A federal investigation into the Chicago police found that the department routinely uses excessive force and violates the constitutional rights of residents , particularly those who are black and Latino . The blistering 164-page report by the Justice Department , released Friday , put an unwelcome spotlight on Chicago , a city already struggling with a surge in gun violence that has pushed homicide numbers to their highest level in two decades . The report , and a pledge by city officials to reform the police department , come in the last days of the Obama administration , which has aggressively pursued investigations of abuse by local law enforcement . On Friday , Chicago leaders said they had promised to negotiate with the federal government an order , enforceable by a judge , that would reform how the police department handles training , accountability and the way officers use force . A similar agreement is in place for the city of Baltimore . The report details a grim succession of anecdotes . Some of those chases ended in fatal gunfire . Police fired a total of 45 rounds at him , hitting and killing him . These anecdotes were not limited to fatal incidents . A 16-year-old girl is described as being struck with a baton and shocked with a Taser for not leaving school when she was found carrying a cellphone . But he also said that many of the problems had already been identified and officials were working to correct them . Dean C. Angelo Sr. , president of the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police , did not respond to a message seeking comment Friday . This dashboard-camera recording , withheld for more than a year by city officials , showed Officer Jason Van Dyke firing 16 shots into McDonald , some after the teenager had already crumpled to the ground , despite initial accounts that the teenager had lunged at the officer . Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel , left , with Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson . Johnson , the police superintendent , called for Van Dyke and four other officers to be fired over the episode , accusing them of lying about the shooting . Van Dyke was arrested and charged with murder the day the McDonald footage was released . Distrust remains an issue between police officers and residents in Chicago . The new report also states that police use force almost 10 times as often against black people as white people . Complaints filed against officers by white people were substantially more likely to be substantiated than those filed by black people or Latinos . Federal investigators said their inquiry found that Chicago police force did not provide officers with suitable guidance for using force , investigate improper uses of force or hold officers accountable for such incidents . Speaking on Capitol Hill during his confirmation hearing this week , Sessions suggested that entire departments filled with good officers could be tarred by the work of individuals and was critical of lawsuits that force reforms . He would not commit to leaving unchanged agreements that are in place when he takes over , though he said he would enforce them until changes are made . This authority was given to the federal agency in 1994 , when Congress acted in the wake of the 1991 beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers and subsequent unrest following the acquittal of the officers involved . During the Obama administration , the Civil Rights Division has opened 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies , according to the Justice Department . Probes have found patterns of excessive force used in police departments including Portland , Ore. , Cleveland , Albuquerque , New Orleans , Seattle and Puerto Rico , among others . A day before Lynch spoke in Chicago , she had traveled to Baltimore for officials to outline efforts to revamp policing there .
