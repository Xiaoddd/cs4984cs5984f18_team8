You either came to Saturday 's Standing Rock benefit at the Pour House and emptied your pockets or you donated your time , talents , and goods to be auctioned up for the cause . We told you last week that Charleston 's Ary Fun would be making the purchase of and hand-delivering 400 tepee poles to Standing Rock , and as of three days ago , that deal is done . That 's enough to build 20 tepees . And since each tepee can sleep up to 10 people , that means that Charleston just bought winter housing for about 200 people at Standing Rock . That 's a whole lotta love . On behalf of the organizers , thanks , y' all . Sat outside .
