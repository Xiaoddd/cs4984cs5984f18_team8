UPDATE 3 : Please click on the Updates tab to get the full info but this fund is now closed , the core mission of the fund was accomplished . to continue to support Technology for Good at Standing Rock . Together we can make a major difference and get the real story out . They just move the problem downstream to the Standing Rock Reservation where they thought the people were powerless . Imagine what we could do if the Geek tribes unite . The Black Snake is hurt but with the administration change in Jan we know it 's going to be an ongoing fight . Chairman David Archambault of the Standing Rock Tribe has requested that people return to their homes for safety reason -LRB- ND winters are brutal -RRB- and he suggests that a big part of the battle is going to be legal these next few months . But many other camps like Sacred Stone and the new All Nations camp are determined to stay until the black snake is killed . The tech team has been working hard to keep the network running . They also built the physical NOC tent . Workstations and servers are being setup and the woodstove is keeping everyone toasty . They are running into all sorts of attacks and sabotage . Earlier this week one of the wifi radios was stolen and PoE cable was cut . We have also had numerous denial of service attacks . There are fake access points trying to phish for people 's login and the list goes on . This company has no scruples , please do n't trust them with your water and your oil . Because of the camps transition we are circling up and deciding on the next phase of tech priorities . The Oceti Sakowin leaders have asked that all fundraisers donate directly to them so I 'm closing this GoFundMe down , it has served it 's purpose . You can still donate to the tech needs by adding a Tech Warrior line item in your donation notes . If you do n't specify they 'll assign it to the highest need . Thank you for all you have done . The internet would not be flowing into camp if it was n't for all of your assistance and support . Special shout out to Tech Warrior Lisha of Geeks without Bounds , who has been on the ground for months , withstanding the elements and the cyber attacks . There are of course many people who have worked to use technology for good -- you know who you are . Thank you for your service . We hit some snags with a broken unit early on but we are back on track . The first bits are coming into camp . There is still work to do , configuring the networks and troubleshooting a PoE switch but I just wanted to share the joy with you . Our friends were at Bioneers and updated everyone on the situation . Yesterday was a really tough day . Over 80 people were arrested for praying and protecting their waters . Please watch . Wopila to all that have contributed so far . Please try again . I just heard Roberto give a Report at the Ecologistics Collaborative in San Luis Obisco . He is so real it 's a little scary . Google that group they know him personally . If you want to communicate with them and their efforts , PM me . I 'm unemployed , and dying in a red state with no healthcare . I will keep spreading your message though as much as I can . I tried to find you on FB to send you a direct message but only saw two people with similar last names but not and exact match . that was charged to my card :--RRB- I had a short window to install the equipment and I needed to get the parts there in a hurry so also paid a good amount for shipping the solar stations and batteries which weighted about 450 lbs . I have a picture of the pickup at ups on this page . You should be able to send me a private message in GoFundMe . If you send me your email I 'd be glad to give you more details . I 'm in the video I posted , the video interviews are taken in the new Media tent on Facebook hill and you can see some of the equipment I brought . The tent was also donated by the allies of Red Cloud Defense Center . I had reached out to Josh Tree and started the conversation . Thank you all for the help . I work closely with Lisha . Great minds think alike . We actually are working with the org that setups up the Burning Man Communications -LRB- Geeks without Bounds -RRB- . I sent medical , first aid supplies and want to help , but I 'm very Leary about who I 'm sending money to , if I do send . I 'm all about the help , so convince me . :-RRB- Ln on FB , so msg mr through messenger . Thank you . Sign in to track your impact . Connect We will never post without your permission .
