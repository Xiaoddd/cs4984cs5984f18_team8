The future of the Dakota Access Pipeline is unclear By Mary Beth Griggs posted Dec 6th , 2016 at 11:13 am DAPL in Iowa The Dakota Access Pipeline is almost complete , but the last section wo n't pop up anytime soon . It was a huge victory for protesters there , who had maintained a camp for months as temperatures dropped and heavy snow arrived . The decision not to grant the easement means that one of the last sections of the -LRB- mostly-complete -RRB- pipeline can not be built under Lake Oahe , a dammed stretch of the Missouri river that falls under the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers . Lake Oahe is the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Souix Reservation , who sued the Army Corps of Engineers in July to halt the pipeline . While the decision not to grant an easement addresses some of the issues raised in that case , the legal group Earthjustice , which filed the lawsuit , has said that it will wait to see how future events play out before they decide how to proceed with the case . Some changes are already being made . In September , the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Army issued a joint statement prompted by the lawsuit and protests saying that they would focus on improving communications between tribal and federal governments on public infrastructure issues like the pipeline . For now , the pipeline will sit unfinished . The sections of pipe to the north and south of Lake Oahe are almost complete , so options for re-routing the pipeline are more limited now than they were before construction began . Other Environmental Impact Statements prepared for the US Army Corps of Engineers took anywhere from several months to several years to be completed . There is a large concern among protesters and advocates that the incoming administration will take a different view of the situation , and may try to find a way to push construction forward again . Protesters are still deciding on how to proceed . Standing Rock leaders are telling people to head home , but some protesters vow to stay through the bitter winter as distrust lingers and unproven rumors swirl that the construction is continuing despite the denial of the easement . President-elect Donald Trump has publicly supported the pipeline and at one time owned stock in the company building it . . His team has said that he will review the decision after he takes office . The company itself has no plans of backing down . In a blistering statement released by Energy Transfer Partners , the company argued that the recent Army decision was politically motivated , and maintained that they would continue to push for the completion of construction . The protests that brought about the current decision were led by the Standing Rock Souix and other indigenous peoples , but were eventually joined by environmentalists , celebrities , and veterans . Depending on the circumstances , if Trump reversed the Army Corps decision , these groups would likely come back in full force . By submitting above , you agree to our privacy policy .
