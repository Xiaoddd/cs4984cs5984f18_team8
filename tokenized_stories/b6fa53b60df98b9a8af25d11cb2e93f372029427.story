Travis Morales and a young member of the Revolution Club have been at Standing Rock for over a month . This is really what is happening here . Same thing goes for the food here . Anyone who comes here has that spirit to contribute as much as they can towards this effort and there is no shortage of need here and especially as we approach this very brutal winter . And again you have thousands of people here who are determined to do whatever they can to make sure to see this all the way through .

People coming together to stand up to the pipeline and quite frankly the U.S. capitalists who are trying to ram this through and this could be quite a crisis for the Trump regime that is coming in . That seems like a good note to end on . People making incredible sacrifices . And the way people have stood up against these vicious police .
