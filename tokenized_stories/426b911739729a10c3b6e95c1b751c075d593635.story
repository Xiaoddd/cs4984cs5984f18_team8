The rally was authorized by Virginia officials and stirred heated debate in America , where critics say the far right has been energized by Donald Trump 's election to the presidency . In short , when we hold the working class responsible for white supremacy , other whites are absolved of racial wrongdoing . Certainly , there is no apology for the racism of working-class whites , nor any excuse ; but we should seek to understand the ways in which white supremacy and power are completely intertwined . White supremacy is most commonly conceptualized as a way for lower-class whites to feel socially superior to people from other ethnic backgrounds . More important , though , white supremacy is a tried-and-tested means for upper class whites to grow their wealth and power . It Was a White Revolt . They constantly are told that African-Americans are the primary recipients of welfare and social benefits , and that policies like affirmative action are greatly detrimental to all whites . By controlling key aspects of the economy , especially education , politics and the media , the white elite often very easily manipulate less affluent whites . First , by governing and managing the education system in this country , the upper classes remain in control of the equality of opportunity . Today , as Republicans continue slashing education funding at the federal , state and local levels , they legislate for ignorance . They fear statistics and facts , realizing what may follow the political enlightenment of the lower classes . Second , elite authority over the educational system also means regulation over the teaching of subjects like history , government and civics . An overwhelming majority of Americans have shockingly little understanding of our own past and our own government , often leading to lower-class political apathy . Finally , business owners and corporate leaders have historically sought to keep workers segregated , either physically or by job . Since antebellum times , masters attempted to engender racism between poor white laborers and enslaved blacks , trying to keep each side distrustful of the other . By perpetuating and encouraging a vile form of racism , they attempted to establish psychological segregation , ultimately thwarting the prospect of an interracial coalition . Thus , even though working-class whites certainly support Trump and his policies , it is important to remember why . With a few short breaths , Watson had laid bare the most important reason why white supremacy has always thrived in this country , especially during times of severe economic inequality . As our nation impetuously tumbles toward a very uncertain future , we must take heed that the racist rhetoric and divisive political issues have only just begun . The millionaires and billionaires of this country literally have a fortune to protect , and white supremacy has always helped assure their place at the apex of society .
