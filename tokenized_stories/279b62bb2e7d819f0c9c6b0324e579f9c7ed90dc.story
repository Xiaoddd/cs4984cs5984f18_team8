Kyle Kirchmeier , the sheriff of Morton County , where the Dakota Access Pipeline snakes through en route to Illinois , said in an interview late on Saturday that he hoped protesters would be peaceful while waiting for federal authorities to resolve questions about a permit to tunnel under the Missouri River . The 1,172-mile -LRB- 1,885-km -RRB- Dakota Access Pipeline , owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP , is mostly complete , except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe , a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River . One way or the other . I do n't care which way it is . Protests have been largely peaceful , but there have been a number of violent clashes , the most recent on Nov. 20 , when police responded to hundreds of protesters amassing on a barricaded bridge with water hoses , despite freezing temperatures . Warned to back up . Warned to get out of the way over and over again . Some 564 people have been arrested during the protests , the Morton County Sheriff 's Department said . State officials on Monday ordered the thousands of protesters now present to leave the snowy camp , which is on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land , citing harsh weather . On Wednesday they said they would not enforce the order . The temperature in Cannon Ball is expected to fall to 4 degrees Fahrenheit -LRB- -16 Celsius -RRB- next week . The Army Corps has twice delayed that decision . POST A COMMENT Generated by readers , the comments included herein do not reflect the views and opinions of Rigzone .
