There is no doubt that Donald Trump poses an urgent threat to our climate . There is no doubt that Donald Trump poses an urgent threat to our climate , to our environment , and to the integrity of Mother Earth . He will try to fast-track fossil fuel projects across the country , including the Dakota Access pipeline and other transport infrastructure . President Obama has previously stated that the Army Corps is exploring options for rerouting the pipeline . Unfortunately , simply rerouting the project does not go far enough . The administration should revoke the permits , pull the easement , and order a full environmental impact statement . There are no safe routes for carrying this fracked and highly volatile oil . Any other proposed alternatives , such as drilling deeper under the Missouri River or double-lining the steel pipe , do not provide a guarantee against the prevention of future leaks and spills . Already this year , we have seen over 220 significant pipeline spills in the U.S. alone . Pipelines by their very nature are threats to the land , water , and climate . If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had completed a proper full environmental impact statement assessment , it would have come to the conclusion that this project poses an immediate threat to Native communities in the region , who are already experiencing disproportionate health and environmental impacts from failed federal policies and practices . Additionally , it threatens the drinking water for millions of people downstream on the Missouri River . There are no safe routes for carrying this fracked and highly volatile oil . Instead , the company chose to reroute the pipeline to cross just north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation , a sovereign Native nation that had not given its consent for construction of the pipeline . This is environmental racism . The United States has an executive order indicating it would not discriminate on the basis of race , color , or national origin in its environmental decision-making processes . This project is a glaring violation of that order . The Obama administration should pull the plug on this project immediately . Members of the Standing Rock Sioux , along with other Native water protectors and supporters , are under constant attack for peacefully resisting the destruction of their water , land , and sacred sites . We have seen an over-militarized police presence using tear gas , dogs , rubber bullets , bean bag shotgun rounds , and riot-control sound cannons on water protectors , medics , and journalists . Currently , equipment is poised for drilling under the lake . If these climate deniers choose to move forward with dangerous fossil fuel projects , we will fight back . We have also started to see the financial institutions backing this project begin to waver , noting their concerns about a project that tramples all over indigenous rights as well as the human rights of peaceful supporters . Other major players , including Citibank , TD Securities , Wells Fargo , and SunTrust , must be held accountable for continuing to finance the destruction of sacred treaty lands and our climate . If you have money in any of the institutions financing the Dakota Access pipeline , reach out to them to reconsider their decision or consider banking elsewhere . We hold the power to push them to divest and pull their loans . President-elect Trump certainly poses a threat to the climate , and we have urgent work to do before he takes over the White House . That starts with urging President Obama to do everything in his power to stop this pipeline . We also need to continue to make it undesirable for financial institutions to invest in fossil fuel infrastructure , especially those projects that contribute to human rights violations .
