The Standing Rock Sioux Nation and thousands of native and non-native allies won a remarkable and unexpected victory Sunday . Word came down that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had denied a permit for the pipeline owner , Energy Transfer Partners , to drill underneath the Missouri River , and that a full environmental-impact study would be launched . Bitter cold weather has descended over the region , making life in the resistance camps even more difficult . Over the long Thanksgiving weekend , Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier and his deputies , along with a multijurisdictional array of paramilitarized police and National Guard , unleashed an arsenal of pepper spray , concussion grenades , tear gas , rubber bullets and , in the freezing cold , water cannons . While Dalrymple threatened to forcibly evict the thousands of peaceful water protectors , troops of a different sort were massing to defend them . U.S. military veterans were responding to a call from tribal elders to come defend the camp . Over 2,000 veterans made the journey , under the leadership of veteran Wes Clark Jr. .

When we asked her how long she was planning on staying at the camps .
