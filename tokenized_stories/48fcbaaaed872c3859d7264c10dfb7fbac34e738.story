about me : I 'm Lin Gokee-Rindal , Holly 's cousin . She and I were like siblings growing up and since I moved away from our home reservation and she had a few kids I 've been out of touch . This crowdfunder was a way for me to help my family from afar even though I would 've liked to be there in person - but I ca n't afford a plane ticket so I used the internet instead . Please help us raise funds for his mom Holly and our family to ease the burden of funeral expenses . Indigenous people are killed by police at a higher rate than any other group , but my baby cousin is not simply a number to be added as a statistic . After laying him to rest in the Earth and sending him on his journey , reality is staring to hit me . He had a loving family that cared deeply about him . We loved him and he had a bright future , a future that was taken away from him after being shot in the heart and being denied life saving measures . WE CAN SEE THE BULLSHIT . The story does not add up and is a way to try to make a child into some type of villainous monster . We will not let Officer Brock Mrdjenovich get away with murder . jason pero is still gone and the coward who shot him did not experience any particularly painful consequence . meanwhile our family has been in a constant state of mourning for decades because native peoples have a lower life expectancy than the general population . holly still has a family to raise and a son to grieve . miigwech . This one is going directly toward Jason Ike Pero 's mom , Holly Gauthier , who absolutely deserves the love and support - the entire family has been through so much already .
