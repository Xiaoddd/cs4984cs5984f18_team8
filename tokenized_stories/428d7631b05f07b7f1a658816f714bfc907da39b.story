The move is a significant victory for environmentalists who have campaigned for years against drilling in the ecologically fragile region . But the ban could be overturned by Donald Trump , who has previously pledged to increase offshore drilling . Drilling will be still allowed in Alaska 's Cook Inlet and several areas of the Gulf of Mexico . According to the 2017 to 2022 leasing plan published by the US Department of the Interior , drilling will be banned in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas off northern Alaska . Climate change : Nations will push ahead with plans despite Trump Of the 11 lease sales proposed in the five-year plan , 10 are in the Gulf of Mexico , historically the focal point of US offshore oil production . Industry representatives condemned the decision . Nearly 400 scientists signed a letter this summer urging the president to eliminate the possibility of Arctic offshore drilling . Mr Obama has attempted to make environmental programmes a central part of his legacy , signing a global accord to curb climate change and an ambitious plan to reduce carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants . But those advances are now at risk as he hands the reins to Mr Trump , who has said he thinks climate change is a hoax and pledged to increase oil and gas drilling . The decision to block Arctic drilling follows a decision this spring to block drilling in the Atlantic . The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites .
