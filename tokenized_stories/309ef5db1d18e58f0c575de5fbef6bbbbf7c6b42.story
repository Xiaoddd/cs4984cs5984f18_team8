A joint misdemeanor trial is scheduled Monday for 10 people arrested Aug. 11 after they allegedly pushed through law enforcement lines or police tape to access a construction site . The Bismarck Tribune reports prosecutors are asking that issues of tribal sovereignty be kept out of the trial , but defense attorneys say their clients have a right to explain why they were there . The judge has yet to rule on that . The defendants are from nine states , including North Dakota , South Dakota , Oregon and Hawaii .
