For many , these times mean sweet relief : we 've long known this moment was coming . In this blog post , I speak to both camps and more . I speak to the world . I speak to , for , with Sacred Stone Camp and the good peeps of Syria and California 's Central Valley . I work for life ; I aim to end war . Many do . We may be scared for the culling , yet we know our sacred calling is to protect existence herself . We live for a living . We are in an age of natural reckoning against violence in all its forms . Violence is n't suffering . Mothers suffer through childbirth for beautiful children . Elders suffer aches and pains . Animals such as the buffalo die so that their humans might live . Violence is unnatural . It is war . It is incest . It is policing . It is tech-fueled gentrification . Violence is desecrating Mother Nature and refusing our sacred calling to protect our global ecosystem for our ancestors , ourselves , and our future children . Like many folk , I sway to the beat of the Cherry Creek Singers , hear the hymn of Dakota Choir , and skank with Askultura for life . I also raise the voice of First they came for the homeless . I fly the freak flags of sluts , queers , trannies , queens , and women who are shocked to discover they 're nasty in some men 's eyes . Those of us who put our boots to the ground for justice are soul warriors on the Earth Mother Spaceship . We can do the math . We see the score . We see truth through delusion . The jig is up , and so is our middle finger . We know that being crude is funny . As if an offense to anyone 's delicate sensibilities is tantamount to ecological destruction on a world scale . As if a few curses is equal to the curse of having our people locked into failing schools and caged in jails . Motherfucker please .
