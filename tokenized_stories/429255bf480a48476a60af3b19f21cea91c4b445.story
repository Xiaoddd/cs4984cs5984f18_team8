They are protesting the attempted construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline , which would run from western North Dakota to southern Illinois . In early September , bulldozers damaged sacred Sioux land ; the next day , security forces used dogs on protesters . In late October , armed soldiers and police with riot gear cleared an encampment ; a month later , water cannon were used against demonstratros . For a long time , it looked like a foregone conclusion that the oil pipeline would be built close to the reservation . And yet , in a remarkable twist in the usual of story of fights against big energy companies , the US Army Corps of Engineers denied permission for the building of a crucial part of the project . As scholars of indigenous rights who have visited the camps of the numerous opponents of DAPL in North Dakota , we are sceptical that this decision will hold . Having witnessed numerous abuses of the state against those trying to stop the pipeline , we are not confident that indigenous rights will be respected in the near future . It took enormous efforts to get the US government to take notice of the environmental and land rights concerns at stake . The rivers and lakes under which the pipeline was planned to pass are vital water supplies and abundant in wildlife . The 1,172 mile pipeline would carry highly flammable oil from the Bakken and Three Forks fields in North Dakota to a terminal in Illinois . The proposed route is a short distance from the Standing Rock reservation and would go underneath Lake Oahe which flows into the Missouri River . This project carries grave health and ecological risks , which were subject only to a light environmental review conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers . As with oil pipelines on indigenous lands elsewhere , contamination of not only water but the local ecology is a real possibility . The centre also lists 500 fatalities in the US from pipeline accidents since 1986 . Violence and Threats Resistance to the pipeline was met not only with official violence , but also suppression of opponents from voicing the environmental , land rights and indigenous self-determination conflicts at stake . This was evident when we visited the Oceti Sakowin camp with a delegation from the University of Wyoming in late November . To stop people accessing the area where a stretch of the pipeline was to be built , police and National Guard units erected a crude barrier of concrete , razor wire and two burnt out trucks . Many protectors had attempted to remove the barriers , successfully towing off one of the burnt out trucks . As spokespeople for the protectors have said , the barricades were dangerous and prevented a lawful protest . We witnessed police respond with tear gas , sound cannons , high velocity rubber bullets -LRB- which wounded one of our delegation -RRB- and , most menacingly , water cannons which doused protectors in subzero temperatures . Armored vehicles , helicopters , and planes were clearly visible and several American Indian Veterans said they had seen snipers in the hills . A young woman named Sophia Wilansky went to hospital facing possible amputation of her arm . A statement by her father alleged it was caused by a concussion grenade lobbed by police at the bridge . She , along with about 400 others at the scene , were unarmed . As well as this violence by the state authorities , even more disturbing acts of suppression were used over that fateful weekend of November 20-21 . A plane continuously circled the camps , flying at night without lights . NBC reported what many water protectors were saying ; that the mysterious plane had been jamming signals so that witnesses could not disseminate what they saw , heard , and felt . Several people mentioned in the NBC report as well as one of our party had their mobile phones rendered permanently unusable , possibly through interference of this kind . A History of Suppression These acts of suppression contradict the freedom of expression enshrined in the First Amendment of the US Constitution -LRB- though it is not the first time that Native Americans have had this freedom denied them specifically -RRB- . Equally humiliating and not unrelated to civil rights is that the DAPL traverses tribal lands that have been continuously confiscated . It has since been reduced to four reservations in the Dakotas . Standing Rock Reservation , the home of great chief Sitting Bull , is one of these remnant spots that still belongs to the Lakota . Land grabbing continued in the 1940s when the government dispossessed the Lakota and other tribes of their homes for a series of dam projects . This led to the flooding of burial sites , which caused human remains to float to the surface and was the precursor to many other acts of desecration of indigenous remains and sacred sites . Uncertain Future It had looked like DAPL would be approved via the same legal process -LRB- and with similar consequences -RRB- to these dam projects . However , the Army has called for a more lengthy environmental impact assessment and it has recommended that routes away from Standing Rock be explored . Whether any of this will happen is open to question . The company that is building DAPL , Energy Transfer Partners , has sizeable investments from numerous important backers , including Donald Trump . Trump assumes the Presidency next month , and has a set of advisers already urging him to privatize oil-rich indigenous lands . The company may still go ahead with constructing the pipeline under the lake , having previously disregarded an Army Corps of Engineers request to cease construction . US security forces have been literally shielding Energy Transfer Partners and the state has discouraged those opposing it from expressing their views . The freedom of the press is severely restricted by this concealment . Keeping informed about the environmental assessment , if it goes ahead , could prove equally difficult . The US has committed itself to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . Both require free , prior and informed consent for any intrusions on indigenous lands and stipulate that indigenous peoples shall own and control their traditional lands .
