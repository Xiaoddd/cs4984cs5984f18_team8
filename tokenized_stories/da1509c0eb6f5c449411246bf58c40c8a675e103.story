In exchange for his agreement not to violate any criminal law for 360 days , the state reduced all charges to a minor , Class B misdemeanor of disorderly conduct . Under this agreement , Iron Eyes will walk away without jail time or any risk to his law license . I and the water protectors are not terrorists . The agreement is pending final approval from Judge Lee Christofferson , was expected late Tuesday . The state of North Dakota ruled weeks ago that this land had never been acquired nor legally owned by pipeline parent company Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- ETP -RRB- due to a North Dakota law prohibiting corporations from acquiring and owning agricultural parcels . According to documents uncovered earlier this year by investigative journalists at The Intercept , Iron Eyes was identified by the TigerSwan military-style security company as a key leader of the Standing Rock movement . At a court hearing that had been scheduled for this Thursday , the defense would have made the case that any action Iron Eyes took was necessary to prevent a greater harm . Sheehan said that the defense compiled thousands of pages of documentation demonstrating that ETP and TigerSwan violated the liberties of the people of Standing Rock under the Federal Civil Rights Act and that the pipeline posed an existential threat to the tribe by jeopardizing its primary source of fresh drinking water . The video is accompanied by an open letter to President Donald Trump . In the 1870s , the US government seized our treaty lands , an act deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1980 . In 2016 , my people and our land came under attack once again . Help support Native News Online by clicking on our sponsors ' advertisements .
