Yessenia Funes Jun 26 , 2017 12:39 PM EDT Indigenous leaders open the L'eau Est La Vie -LRB- Water Is Life -RRB- Camp in ceremony June 24 , 2017 , in southern Louisiana . Based in southern Louisiana , the camp is against the 163-mile long Bayou Bridge Pipeline . The camp , according to a press release emailed to Colorlines , is made up of indigenous and environmental justice communities . The United Houma Nation is one of the tribes whose members are challenging the pipeline . For these first two weeks , the camp will be full of prayerful ceremony , says Cherri Foytlin , state director of Bold Louisiana and an indigenous woman . L'eau Est La Vie -LRB- Water is Life -RRB- Camp members prepare crawfish , a major part of the region 's culture and economy , on June 24 , 2017 , in southern Louisiana . However , Foytlin says that campers are prepared to put their bodies on the line . The company wants the crude oil from the Bakken Formation in North Dakota , which runs through the Dakota Access to Illinois , to ultimately end up at terminal facilities and refineries in St. James , Louisiana . The pipeline system , collectively called the Bakken Pipeline , would bring the oil to Nederland , Texas , and then to Lake Charles , Louisiana . The idea is to expand that existing system to St. James . It would carry 480,000 barrels of crude oil a day . Landowners are worried that Energy Transfer Partners will take away their land to use for the pipeline , which Energy Transfer Partners has done with other pipeline projects around the country -LRB- including the Dakota Access Pipeline -RRB- . The company says the pipeline will provide an economic and employment boost , but The Times-Picayune reports that only 12 permanent jobs will come out of the project . Watch the video below to hear Foytlin speak about how the Bayou Bridge Pipeline could impact her land and people .
