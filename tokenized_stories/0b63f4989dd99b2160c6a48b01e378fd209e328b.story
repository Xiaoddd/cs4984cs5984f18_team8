Yet in the WikiLeaks instance , the content of the leak was a series of nothingburgers . Maybe the most exciting revelation was that Donna Brazile had shared with the Clinton campaign one of the questions to be posed to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders at a CNN townhall during the Democratic primaries . Now , however , we are dealing with information of truly vital national importance : plausible allegations that a U.S. presidential campaign had contact with a hostile foreign power which had hacked the communications of its political opponents . If there was any coordination , the resulting scandal would blend Watergate with Alger Hiss . Congress refused to act . The Department of Justice has shown zero interest . Evidence that close associates of the current president of the United States had contacts with a hostile foreign-intelligence service is not a matter of purely historical interest . The whistle blowers are blowing whistles , at immense professional and legal risk to themselves , because the people in charge of protecting the system against foreign spy penetration are themselves implicated in that penetration . It might be more accurate to describe the current struggle as a duel . In early January , multiple newspapers reported that the incoming administration planned radical reforms of the intelligence agencies . These reports agreed that the new administration wanted to reduce the role of the Director of National Intelligence , the central coordinator of all intelligence products . Maybe this was all undertaken for the highest and most disinterested public motives . And Flynn has now resigned ; the CIA director has been restored to his seat at the table . If information was not brought forth now , such an investigator might reasonably fear , that information would be silenced and secreted forever by people with a deep personal interest in silencing and secreting it . What Americans should all be able to agree is that this duel is no way to conduct the national security of the United States . We want to hear what you think about this article .
