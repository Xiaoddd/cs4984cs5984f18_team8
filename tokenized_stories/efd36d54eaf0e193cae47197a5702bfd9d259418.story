Prior to joining the board on May 1 , Lozier had been an attorney with the Belin McCormick law firm of Des Moines . The Iowa Utilities Board has recently raised questions with the Dakota Access Pipeline about liability insurance issues . Even more significantly , a major court case involving the state 's approval of the pipeline project and authorizing use of eminent domain for the pipeline are pending before the Iowa Supreme Court . Richard Lozier -LRB- Photo : Special to The Des Moines Register -RRB- In May , Iowa Supreme Court granted a request by Lozier to withdraw as counsel for the MAIN Coalition , which has intervened in the court case . The Dakota Access Pipeline began transporting crude oil on June 1 from North Dakota 's Bakken oil patch to a distribution hub at Patoka , Ill. . Former Iowa legislator Ed Fallon of Des Moines , an opponent of the Dakota Access Pipeline , said Lozier made the right decision by recusing himself . But he believes former Gov. Terry Branstad , a Republican , never should have appointed Lozier to the state regulatory board because of Lozier 's conflict of interests . Now , the three-member Iowa Utilities Board has only two members who can vote on matters involving the Dakota Access Pipeline , said Fallon , who heads Bold Iowa , a political activist group . He believes Lozier 's appointment by Branstad had reinforced the perception of anti-pipeline activists that the former governor ignored the well-being of the people of Iowa . In response to critics , Branstad has said he 's no friend of oil interests in Texas . As a lawyer for more than 20 years with the Belin McCormick firm , Lozier had spent much of his time in a practice that involved regulated utilities , including telecommunications , wind energy development , electric transmission , water , and gas and oil pipelines , according to the Iowa Utilities Board . He is a former president of the Polk County Bar Association and was a special agent with the FBI after graduating from the University of Iowa College of Law .
