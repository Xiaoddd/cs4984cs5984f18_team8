For decades those names , and the names of dozens of others , have stalked the American consciousness . Until recently when terrorists became the boogeymen of a nation , the serial killer was the monster of our nightmares , the demon of our subconscious , stalking us at every street corner , along every poorly lit alleyway . While the reality of serial killers was always far from the fantasy , the existence of real life monsters served to provide us with an outlet for deepest fears . Even in the face of global terrorism , there is something deeply disturbing about the serial killer that continues to disgust , repel , frighten , and fascinate beyond any kind of rational explanation . Perhaps it is the sheer abnormality of the serial killer , perhaps it is the fear that a person we know or love could be one , or perhaps it is just the sheer fascination we have with death , presaging and perhaps rationalizing our own eventual demise . Psychological questions aside , a new poll has indicated that the general population in the United States may have more in common with serial killers than previously believed , namely political leanings . A new poll of living and deceased serial killers has shown that upwards of 80 per cent lean towards conservative ideals and the majority routinely voted Republican , something becoming more and more common throughout the United States as a whole . Across the board , serial killers are predominantly conservative in their political leanings . Gary Ridgeway , Dennis Rader , and probably the biggest name of all , Ted Bundy , were all active in the Republican Party at some level . Reportedly , David Berkowitz has never voted , but actively supported independent Ross Perot in the 1992 Presidential election . The momentum is certainly on their side and the best thing right now would be to bring everyone they can on board , even if they are of questionable moral and ethical standing . One name often mentioned in Republican circles is Jeffrey Dahmer who officials believe would help bring in younger voters . The case for Dahmer is complicated by his death in 1994 . Sarah Palin , a leading contender for 2012 , has reportedly made several visits to Dennis Rader , better known as BTK , at his prison cell in Kansas over the last few weeks . They can not imagine how much I resent and disdain them , or just how great a threat they would face if I could get at them . make a list of them and keep a watch on . Most serial killers are white men . They 're all Republicans . In reports kept under wraps until after the recent elections , anecdotal researchers using new counterfactual technologies and fellacious methodologies have turned up startling hearsay and volumes of evidentiary spuriousness that point to both conclusions . We discovered the phenom when reading accounts of an interrogation of Green River killer Gary Ridgway by erstwhile sheriff - now 8th District Republican congressman - Dave Reichert . Ridgway , a truck painter with an IQ of 82 , who had sex with his victims after he killed them , told the sheriff he was a Republican and would support him if he ran for higher office . While Republicans are typically in a somewhat higher IQ range than Ridgway , Reichert was flattered and his Republican handlers saw an opportunity to target new voters . Here was an inroad in the vote-rich micro-constituencies of not only psychopathic killers , but also necrophiliacs - a voting niche Republicans have been trying to crack since discovering that their revered Sen. Strom Thurmond had married three times though dead some 12 years . Dennis Rader , Wichita 's BTK -LRB- Bind , Torture , Kill -RRB- Killer was elected dog catcher on the Republican ticket and was active in the party . Although a lowly bureacrat , he carried out his eponymous deeds with a vigor many described as entrepreneurial . Marked by scornful , narcissistic , lack of compassion or empathy , its symptoms are obvious in people like Dori Monson , Rush Limbaugh , or Michael Savage . An admix of power , celebrity , free markets , privatization , and no gun control , can sometimes go terribly wrong - and innocents can die . Ted Bundy , the Tacoma boy renowned nationally for his sensational and prolific stranglings was a campaign worker for Republican Governor Dan Evans . A handsome law student , he cut quite a swath in the 1970 's Olympia GOP chablis and brie scene . While schtupping smart , young , single , Republican women during the week , he spent his quality time raping and strangling hippie chicks up in Seattle on the weekends . It was said in Olympia that Bundy was polite , responsible , anti-union , and had the proper respect for private ownership , steel manufacturers and his Republican girlfriends . But for those to whom he felt superior , -LRB- and were potential Democrats -RRB- he repressed their votes by way of strangulation . He and his parents were active Republicans . As far as anyone knows , Coe never murdered anybody . His MO was brutally raping women while on his morning jog . She was arrested coming home from a Lincoln Day dinner . We see evidence of this strange disorder as a Republican administration is pulled down and exposed . The needless war ; the dismantling of social safety nets , the denigration of the judiciary , the privatization rhetoric - it all dovetails into the pathology of the Republican serial killer . We 're wondering where and when the next Bundy , or BTK will show his deadly face . We 're against profiling , but screening Republicans might be a prudent first step to stopping the killing . Responsible Republicans would agree - profiling is an important law enforcement tool , surely if they have nothing to hide , they 'd gladly cooperate . Obama is a serial killer and a mass murder .
