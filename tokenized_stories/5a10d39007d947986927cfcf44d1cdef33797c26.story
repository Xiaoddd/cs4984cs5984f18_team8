In 1493 , Pope Alexander VI declared that any land not inhabited by Christians was free for the new generation of European explorers to take at will . The truth is , this history has been intentionally expunged from our cultural memory . If it is taught at all , it is usually treated as nothing more than a historical footnote to the grand story of European national birth and divinely-mandated expansion . The brutality and imperialism sanctioned by the Doctrine of Discovery is papered over in U.S. textbooks , glimpsed only in short units on the Trail of Tears or the massacre at Wounded Knee . But these glimpses are always met with a comforting explanation : they were simply unfortunate events in the inexorable movement toward divinely-mandated nationhood . Certainly lamentable , but nothing to lose too much sleep over . And with that , the curtain is snapped shut again , covering up the much uglier and deeper truth : that massacre , abuse , exploitation , and theft are not accidents of the American project , but have been necessary strategies from the very beginning . It 's not hard to see this legacy playing itself out today . We have forgotten the wisdom of the ancient Hebrews , our ancestors of the faith , who understood that the created world is inherently sacred and pulses with the divine power of the one , true God . According to the logic of Discovery , interplay between heaven and earth is intellectually embarrassing , and dependence upon the rest of creation is weakness . We have forgotten the wisdom of the ancient Hebrews , our ancestors of the faith , who understood that the created world is inherently sacred . This language of acquisition and domination can be seen all over Western society today , but perhaps no more clearly in current events than in the struggle of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to protect their land , water , and air from the Dakota Access Pipeline . At Standing Rock , we see the logical conclusions of the Doctrine of Discovery : the instrumentalization of the earth for its industrial usefulness , the marginalization and oppression of non-dominant culture lives , and the disregard for common goods like clean water , clean air , and a safe climate for all . The common good is obscured by the drive for private profit , lives are degraded , and creation is desacralized . It is no wonder that the U.S. is horrendous at honoring the treaties we have made with Indigenous peoples , especially when these treaties stand in the way of the acquisition of resources . It is no wonder that Energy Transfer , the company building the pipeline , moved the original route of the pipeline south of Bismarck in order to protect the drinking water of the capital , clearly signaling that some lives matter more than others . It is no wonder that the Dakota Access Pipeline stands to carry half a million additional barrels of crude oil per day to market at a moment when the world desperately needs to keep fossil fuels in the ground in order to avoid climate catastrophe . It is no wonder that Western countries account for the vast majority of historic greenhouse gas emissions . The domination of minority cultures and of the earth for the purpose of ever more acquisition is the modus operandi of the Doctrine of Discovery . The domination of minority cultures and of the earth for the purpose of ever more acquisition is the modus operandi of the Doctrine of Discovery . Until we wrestle with all the ways that Discovery has infected our institutions , our imaginations , and our souls , I fear we are doomed to repeat its pattern of destruction and oppression . Only this time , in a world whose Discovery-induced scars of massive ecosystem loss , mass species extinction , and runaway climate change are more visible than ever , we ourselves could very well be among the victims . A step for unlearning the Doctrine of Discovery : Read about the historic protests at Standing Rock .
