Opposition to wealthy oil companies and their potential profits if and after the pipeline is completed would have been sufficient to attract the thousands who came to support Sioux protestors at Standing Rock . Meanwhile , environmentalists , who care and worry about what such a pipeline under the plains and river might do , have raised appropriate questions . The environmental concerns alone would have been ominous enough to agitate the Native Americans on the scene . But the Cannonball River , which flows nearby , and the complex of tributaries connected to the Missouri River , are not merely sources of water . Water is necessary for the sweat lodge , so important in Sioux worship , and it serves as a purifier and calmer in sacred ceremonies . And much more . What motivates her and her fellow worshippers , above all , is concern that the pipeline will profane the burial sites over and around and through which it will flow . All of the governmental action is thus , in the eyes of the Native Americans , a profanation . Weekly , if not daily , we hear and read of the ins and outs , the ups and downs , of this most recent conflict . We observe how readily disdained the protesters are . Many of them know that there are other sides -LRB- and undersides -RRB- to conflicts like this one . They know how complex are the valid economic issues on the opposing sides of such ventures . Even some close-to-the-scene Native Americans are concerned about the potential economic loss , should the Native Americans win . Sympathetic religious leaders are urging that the spiritual concerns and the human rights of the protesters be respected in the face of often brutal economic and political forces and realities .
