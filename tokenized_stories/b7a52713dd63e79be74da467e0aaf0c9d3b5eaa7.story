The parallels between the Standing Rock Sioux and the Amazigh of Imider extend far beyond their respect for water . Thousands of miles apart , both communities struggle against extractive industries and a lack of respect for tribal sovereignty . Imider is the home of Managem , the largest silver mine in Africa . Silver mining is a water-intensive industry . Resistance against resource exploitation is also a central focus of the Water Protectors at Standing Rock . At present , the Standing Rock Sioux have been resisting the Dakota Access pipeline for eight months and experienced brutal repression from police on Sunday night . The 30-inch diameter pipeline is supposed to stretch 1,172 miles from North Dakota to Illinois and transport 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day . The emissions of this oil are equal to 101.4 million tons of carbon dioxide , or as much as 30 American coal power plants per year .
