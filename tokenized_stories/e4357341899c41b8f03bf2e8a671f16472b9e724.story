People and water protectors we met with this week in Standing Rock were furious and fearful . Since August when the protests against the construction of the oil pipeline reached historic proportions and made major headlines , some Native-American water protectors and allies have been seriously injured by the indiscriminate use of life-threatening crowd-control weapons by law enforcement . People across the globe witnessed much of this abuse through live video feeds shared through social media and footage taken by independent indigenous drone journalists . Sadly , these reports were confirmed and further substantiated during a U.N. hearing earlier this week co-facilitated by the International Indian Treaty Council and the ACLU . Several water protectors gave testimonials about being shot with rubber bullets at point blank range , hosed with water cannons in freezing temperatures , beaten by officers , and incapacitated by concussion grenades . Witnesses described the war-like weapons being deployed indiscriminately , against medics , reporters , elders , pregnant woman , and legal observers . Protesters who were arrested testified about abuse and ill-treatment in detention , including being held in dog kennels . The testimonies were heartbreaking and disturbing . There has been little , if any , leadership from local authorities to curtail the well-documented abuses . There has been a resounding lack of accountability for law enforcement agents and commanders . Some were hit with outlandish felony charges and high bail bonds . More than likely , if state leaders do not require a significant change in policing tactics , law enforcement will only continue its violent and unconstitutional responses to largely peaceful protesters . This must be investigated , and the people responsible for releasing dogs on protestors should be held accountable . Recently , the Standing Rock Tribal Council called for the evacuation of the camps behind the Dakota Access Pipeline protests within 30 days , which means by February 19 . However , the question remains whether law enforcement will use force to clear the camps and , whether on accident or with intent , injure or kill someone who refuses to leave in an act of civil disobedience . But where local law enforcement quickly resorts to the massive use of less-lethal weapons , it is the responsibility of the state and federal governments to step in . The state and federal governments must rein in the county sheriff and private security contractors , and they must immediately end any unlawful surveillance practices against individuals and groups expressing their right to free speech and peaceful assembly . Until then , the ACLU will continue to monitor the situation through legal observers and will consider taking legal action including supporting the Water Protectors Legal Collaborative . We have also released an action requesting the public to call North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and urge him to do everything in his power to prevent police violence against Standing Rock water protectors . Using crowd control weapons will only exacerbate the injuries and trauma that has plagued Native American communities and water protectors since the pipeline protest intensified this past August . That carnage is occurring right now at the hands of law enforcement in Standing Rock . If Trump truly intends to end unnecessary violence , he must listen to the voices of Native American water protectors and those who are supporting them at Standing Rock , and he must vow to protect their right to water , sacred sites , and their future development as sovereign nations . Human decency requires it . The executive order makes no reference to the Dakota Access Pipeline , the 1,100-mile pipeline being constructed to carry nearly 500 million gallons of fracked crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois each day . Yet expediting the construction of DAPL is the obvious goal of the executive order . The Obama administration recognized that the pipeline has the capacity to cause catastrophic misery and loss if it ruptures . The Obama administration also confirmed that under federal law DAPL can not be approved until proper consultation with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is completed . Moreover , under international legal principles , our government should seek the informed consent of indigenous people prior to undertaking a project on federal land that threatens their health and welfare . Yet Trump seems determined to rush the approval process . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe strenuously argues that construction of the pipeline would violate its rights under federal treaties and statutes . Those are issues that may ultimately need to be litigated . At this point , however , Trump apparently agrees that the law requires the Army Corps to complete the environmental impact assessment and determine the threat to the environment before going ahead with the pipeline . The Trump administration should therefore allow the Army Corps to take the time it needs to conduct a careful and proper assessment of environmental impact , both to the general public and to the tribe . An American Civil Liberties Union delegation is in Standing Rock today , facilitating meetings between U.N. officials and members of the International Indian Treaty Council . By law , they are entitled to water rights and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect , not sacrificed for political expediency and profit making .
