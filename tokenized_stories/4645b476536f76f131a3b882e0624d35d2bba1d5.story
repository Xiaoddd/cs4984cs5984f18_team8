The conflict over this pipeline arises with various groups of protestors , including the indigenous Native Americans who are concerned with the survival of their communities and sacred spaces . The Sac , Fox Nation , and Cherokee tribes are a few that have been affected . According to the Indigenous Environmental Network -LRB- Bates , Crawford 2012 -RRB- , an archaeological survey found that Keystone XL threatened 88 archeological sites and 34 historic structures . The environmentalists are another group protesting the project . Native American traditional culture believes that everything in the world has a spirit . The massive oil pipeline that requires digging over thousands of miles would be harmful to the indigenous peoples sacred earth . Your perspective changes depending on which cultural lens you are looking through . The oil resource brings economic benefits that are highly important to our government . Each tribe affected from the pipeline shares similar cultural values . They all believe that the land possesses spiritual qualities . We will take a closer look at the Cherokee and Denesuline peoples , and discuss how their cultures interact with nature and society . The Modern State Worldview Every society has a different way of viewing the world . With the rise of technology and industrialization comes an increase in overall population . When a population increases in a society , demand for resources also increases . Obama will increase oil supply by extending the Keystone XL pipeline . This will allow our refineries to obtain the crude oil resource much quicker . Those who use this approach are convinced that it will work , even if it ignores local interests and cultures -LRB- Josephson 2004 -RRB- . But , these traditional cultures are not the only ones concerned with the land . Conservationists worldwide are major opponents to developments like the Keystone XL pipeline . Reports from the National Wildlife Development assert that the Keystone XL pipeline will destroy swaths of important forest ecosystems , create reservoirs of toxic waste , and produce a significant amount of global warming pollutants into the atmosphere -LRB- Maestas 2010 -RRB- . This organization , along with other conservationists , believes that keeping our air , water , health , and prosperity is much more important than obtaining the crude oil resource -LRB- Maestas 2010 -RRB- . Again , we come into contact with another clashing of worldviews . Their anthropological history , which includes the traditions and cultures of the people , is embedded in the forest that is very sacred to many tribes . Maintaining the balance of the system is the main priority for conserving and protecting Mother Earth . We acquire an in-depth perspective on how these cultures communicate with the land if we examine a specific tribe . The Cherokee peoples protestation has stemmed from their cosmology , religion , and worldview . The Cherokee religion involves spiritual rituals and ceremonies that attempt at providing safety from the mystery and danger of the mythic world . The springs of rivers are said to be sacred entrances to this lower world . In their culture , shamans are the leaders of ritual and ceremony . Specific cardinal direction , color , and animals all have symbolic meaning towards something else . The Cherokee cosmology is clearly complex . It contains many different mythical aspects that are difficult for an outsider to understand . The point here is that they rely heavily on their sacred places , as well as the shamans that maintain those places . The streams and rivers are important for their access into the underworld once dead . The Cherokee rivers and cornfields will be directly affected by such leaks . Keystone XL is not just destroying the indigenous peoples gravesites . It is also tearing up their spiritual Mother Earth , disrupting their river underworld entrances , and possibly destroying their sacred Corn . Media that covered the protest of the Keystone XL stated that the indigenous natives opposed the project because their graves and historical sites would be unearthed . By learning how Cherokee cosmology works , and attesting to how intricate it is , we can see that their protesting comes from much more than simply protecting grave sites . The Cherokee object to the pipeline , not only to save their burial sites , but also to conserve the living , spiritual qualities of the land . Their cultural heritage and lands will not be preserved for future generations if industrial projects are allowed to continue development and expand on their land . Like many other indigenous tribes in the Americas , the Dene peoples have customary practices that follow a special relationship and care for Mother Earth . But , the Dene have an even closer tie with animals . When viewed from their perspective , it appears that ecological damage is making them lose inkonze , which is in turn making them believe they are less connected with reality . The conflict over the Keystone XL oil pipeline is inevitable . This approach ignores wildlife destruction and native land desecration . The Cherokee cosmology values many plants and topographic features as sacred places . The Dene view animals as the most important source of knowledge and are the key to making all life possible . These traditional belief systems are sustaining the conflict between native tribes and the United States .
