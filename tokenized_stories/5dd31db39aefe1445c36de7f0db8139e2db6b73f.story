A call out to New Zealand was made for support of the water rights of Standing Rock Reservation . Blue Bird is a Rosebud Lakota who lives in Bismarck and brought her daughter down to meet with water protectors to lend his support . Everyday should be like Thanksgiving . Once they arrived , a Lakota elder addressed the crowd . Not a single woman left . Even mothers swaddling infants stayed . On Friday , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers notified the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe that the land being used for the protests will be closed by Dec. 5 , and , late Monday , North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple ordered an emergency evacuation of the camp , citing safety concerns because of harsh weather . Both the Corps and the governor , however , said they had no plans to forcibly remove protesters . The warnings have gone largely unheeded . Each day , more opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline pour into the site , and many of the new arrivals are more defiant than those who came before . Protesters say the pipeline threatens clean water as well as areas considered sacred by Indians . The Red Cross is being called in to help with medical issues at the camp , Young said . Any attempt to clear the camp now , after seven months without a resolution , is likely to ensnare hundreds of women and children , which could inflame the already dangerous standoff , protesters warned .

Volunteers overseeing the supply tents sent out urgent requests for more gas masks , mace and other protective gear . With virtually no trees and just the distant hills to block the high prairie winds , the Standing Rock campground can grow bitterly cold at night . Paul Sherlock , 55 , of Cleveland , arrived three weeks ago and was shocked to see families squatting in tents meant for summertime camping . He now oversees a small army of young volunteers constructing up to a dozen permanent structures around the encampment . The possibility of a quick or orderly resolution seems unlikely . Among the growing numbers of Indians arriving here from far and wide , many speak of the confrontation in epochal terms . They invoke an ancient Lakota prophecy , which says that a giant black snake will rise from the earth and bring devastation . For many here , the pipeline is the black snake . Among those in the audience was actress Jane Fonda , another in a series of celebrities who have embraced the protest .
