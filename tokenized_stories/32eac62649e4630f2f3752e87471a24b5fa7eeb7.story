For months , DAPL was on hold amid protests . The pipeline builder , Energy Transfer Partners , says work has restarted . stretch of pipeline under Lake Oahe , just south of Bismark , marking the final connection of the 1,200-mile oil pipeline . Work is also underway to clean up after thousands of protesters left the area . During the 6-month siege , town-sized camps were developed , but there were no city services like septic or trash removal . An estimated 4.5 million pounds of garbage , from old tents and tepees to human waste , must be removed . Mother Earth is the last thing on there mind . I hope they take every nickel from there go fund me account and use it for clean up and restoration of the land they INVADED and RAPED . There is not enough characters allowed for me to type explaining the inappropriate actions taken by those that protested . There is no doubt in my mind there would be millions of pounds of trash created by group camping in the middle of the country . There are very few locals that want the oil . It 's only created chaos and destruction of land and relationships amoungst each other . Produced in the field and neatly organized by topic , from spring prep to post-harvest .
