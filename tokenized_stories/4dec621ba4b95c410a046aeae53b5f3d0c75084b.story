The front of the slow-moving train hit a bumping block as it pulled into Atlantic Terminal , left the tracks and smashed into a small structure , apparently a work area ; a rail pierced the floor of a train car , authorities said . About 100 people were treated for minor injuries after the 8:30 a.m. crash ; many had been standing as they prepared to get off the train at the last stop . Some people were removed on stretchers . Others sat , stunned , on the pavement outside - bleeding , holding ice packs on their heads , rising and limping away with help from rescuers . The most serious injury , though , appeared to be a broken leg , said Mayor Bill de Blasio .

Neufeld The terminal is beneath a shopping mall in downtown Brooklyn , adjacent to the Barclays Center , home to Nets basketball , Islanders hockey and major concerts . A similar accident across the harbor in Hoboken , New Jersey , in September was much worse . There , a New Jersey Transit commuter train plowed off the end of a track , killing a woman standing in the station . Federal investigators are examining whether a more modern bumper or other barriers could have made a difference .
