The short answer is no . The current hurricane season is by no means extraordinary , and the last few seasons have actually been very tame . The 2013 season saw no major hurricanes at all and tied with 1982 for the fewest hurricanes since 1930 . This view was supported recently by Kerry Emanuel , a hurricane scientist at MIT , who pointed to Matthew as a likely sign of things to come . Debate within the hurricane science community has in recent decades been almost as hostile as the storms themselves , with researchers , on occasion , even refusing to sit on the same panels at conferences . At the heart of this sometimes acrimonious dispute has been the validity of the Atlantic hurricane record and the robustness of the idea that hurricane activity had been broadly ratcheting up since the 1980s . Now , the weight of evidence looks to have come down on the side of a broad and significant increase in hurricane activity that is primarily driven by progressive warming of the climate . For many , the bottom line is the sea surface temperature , which is a major driver of hurricane activity and storm intensification . Last year saw the warmest sea temperatures on record , so it should not be a surprise . As the Atlantic continues to heat up , the trend is widely expected to be towards more powerful and wetter storms , so that Matthew might seem like pretty small beer when looked back on from the mid-century . As with hurricanes , Pacific typhoons and the mid-latitude storms that periodically batter the UK and Europe are forecast to follow a similar pattern in an anthropogenically warmed world . Storm numbers may not rise , but there is likely to be an escalation in the frequency of the bigger storm systems , which tend to be the most destructive . An additional concern is that mid-latitude storms may become clustered , bringing the prospect of extended periods of damaging and disruptive winds . The jury is out on whether climate change will drive up the number of smaller , but potentially ruinous vortices of solid wind that make up tornadoes , although an apparent trend in the US towards more powerful storms has been blamed by some on a warming atmosphere . It would be wrong to imagine , however , that climate change and the extreme events it drives are all about higher temperatures and a bit more wind and rain . We are pretty familiar with the idea that the oceans swell as a consequence of the plunging atmospheric pressure at the heart of powerful storms , building surges driven onshore by high winds that can be massively destructive . Similarly , it does not stretch the imagination to appreciate that a warmer atmosphere promotes greater melting of the polar ice caps , thereby raising sea levels and increasing the risk of coastal flooding . In the paper , Liu and his colleagues provided convincing evidence for a link between typhoons barrelling across Taiwan and the timing of small earthquakes beneath the island . Their take on the connection is that the reduced atmospheric pressure that characterises these powerful Pacific equivalents of hurricanes is sufficient to allow earthquake faults deep within the crust to move more easily and release accumulated strain . Perhaps even more astonishingly , Liu and his team proposed that storms might act as safety valves , repeatedly short-circuiting the buildup of dangerous levels of strain that otherwise could eventually instigate large , destructive earthquakes . This might explain , the researchers say , why the contact between the Eurasian and Philippine Sea tectonic plates , in the vicinity of Taiwan , has far less in the way of major quakes than further north where the plate boundary swings past Japan . In a similar vein , it seems that the huge volume of rain dumped by tropical cyclones , leading to severe flooding , may also be linked to earthquakes . It is possible that floodwaters are lubricating fault planes , but Wdowinski has another explanation . He thinks that the erosion of landslides caused by the torrential rains acts to reduce the weight on any fault below , allowing it to move more easily . It has been known for some time that rainfall also influences the pattern of earthquake activity in the Himalayas , where the 2015 Nepal earthquake took close to 9,000 lives , and where the threat of future devastating quakes is very high . During the summer monsoon season , prodigious quantities of rain soak into the lowlands of the Indo-Gangetic plain , immediately to the south of the mountain range , which then slowly drains away over the next few months . This annual rainwater loading and unloading of the crust is mirrored by the level of earthquake activity , which is significantly lower during the summer months than during the winter . Volcanoes seem to be susceptible too . The volcano seems to prefer to erupt in the late autumn and winter , when weather patterns are such that water levels adjacent to this coastal volcano climb by a few tens of centimetres . The last time our world experienced serious warming was at the end of the last ice age when , between about 20,000 and 10,000 years ago , temperatures rose by six degrees centigrade , melting the great continental ice sheets and pushing up sea levels by more than 120m . The bottom line is that as climate change tightens its grip , we must be prepared to expect the unexpected These huge changes triggered geological mayhem . As the kilometres-thick Scandinavian ice sheet vanished , the faults beneath released the accumulated strain of tens of millennia , spawning massive magnitude eight earthquakes . Now , global average temperatures are shooting up again and are already more than one degree centigrade higher than during preindustrial times . It should come as no surprise that the solid Earth is starting to respond once more . In southern Alaska , which has in places lost a vertical kilometre of ice cover , the reduced load on the crust is already increasing the level of seismic activity . Well , no one is suggesting that we will see a great surge in the number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions . As always , these will be controlled largely by local geological conditions . Where an earthquake fault or volcano is primed and ready to go , however , climate change may provide that extra helping hand that brings forward the timing of a quake or eruption that would eventually have happened anyway . Freysteinn Sigmundsson of the Nordic Volcanological Centre observes that the centre of Iceland is now rising by more than three centimetres a year in response to shrinking glaciers . Studies undertaken by Sigmundsson and his colleagues forecast that the reduced pressures that result will lead to the formation of significant volumes of new magma deep under Iceland . The potential for more landslides is also likely to be a problem in high mountain ranges as the ice cover that stabilises rock faces vanishes . GPS measurements show that , like Scandinavia at the end of the last ice age , Greenland and the whole of the surrounding region is already rising in response to the removal of this ice load . More earthquakes in Greenland might not seem like a big deal , but this could have far wider ramifications . About 8,200 years ago , an earthquake linked to the uplift of Scandinavia , triggered the Storegga Slide ; a gigantic undersea sediment slide that sent a tsunami racing across the North Atlantic . Run-up heights were more than 20m in the Shetlands and six metres along the east coast of Scotland , and the event has been blamed for the flooding of Doggerland ; the inhabited Mesolithic landmass that occupied what is now the southern North Sea . The submerged margins of Greenland are currently not very well mapped , so the likelihood of a future earthquake triggering a landslide capable of generating a major tsunami in the North Atlantic is unknown . Dave Tappin , a tsunami expert at the British Geological Survey , points out that one large , undersea landslide has been identified off the coast of Greenland , but suspects that there may not be sufficient sediment to generate landslides as large as Storegga . Nonetheless , the seismic revival of Greenland is certainly a geological response to climate change that we need to keep an eye on . The bottom line in all of this is that as climate change tightens its grip , we should certainly contemplate more and bigger Hurricane Matthews . However , when it comes to the manifold hazardous by-blows of an overheating planet , and especially those involving the ground we stand on , we must also be prepared to expect the unexpected .
