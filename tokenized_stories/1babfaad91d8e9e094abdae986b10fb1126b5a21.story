Despite the delay , Dakota Access insists that it has already been granted permission to finish the project . At issue is an environmental assessment that the Army Corps released last July regarding the crossing at Lake Oahe . Attorneys for the federal government and for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe have filed motions to dismiss the firm 's cross-claim . They are also expected to oppose the attempt to stop publication of the EIS notice . Trump officially becomes president at 12:01 pm on Friday .
