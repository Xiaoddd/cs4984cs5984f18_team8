This story was originally published by High Country News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration . As of this week , Bakken oil is expected to flow through the Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . This development comes as court proceedings continue over the high-profile battle over the pipeline that drew thousands of protestors to North Dakota last year . As law enforcement officers and Indigenous activists faced off near the construction site , the conflict played out in real time on social media , capturing international attention . A ruling is likely still several weeks away . The tribes have tried for temporary restraining orders to stop the flow of oil until the case is decided , but judges have rejected those as well . Dakota Access , LLC , is required to update the court weekly on whether the pipeline operations have begun ; on March 20 , the company said they expected oil to flow this week . On March 20 , the Dakota Access , LLC said they expected oil to flow this week . Although the Obama administration had put DAPL on hold in December and called for further environmental review , then-President-elect Donald Trump vowed to push the project through once he took office . And recent legal proceedings remind us how difficult it is for tribes to argue for religious freedom in court . RFRA has an unreliable track record for tribes in court . Congress created the law in 1993 in part as a response to two cases in which courts sided with the government . In 1988 Lyng vs. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association allowed the Forest Service to construct a logging road in California that would have disrupted an area sacred to several tribes . In 1990 Employment Division vs. Smith allowed two Native Americans in Oregon to be fired for failing a drug test because they had used peyote as an element of religious ceremony . The most recent major failure was the case of the Snowbowl ski resort in Arizona in which reclaimed wastewater was being used to make snow on mountains sacred to several tribes . The tribes argued a violation of RFRA and ultimately lost . RFRA has an unreliable track record for tribes in court . RFRA has , however , worked for corporations such as Hobby Lobby . Part of the challenge for tribes , says University of Colorado law professor Charles Wilkinson , is one of translation . In court in February , Judge James Boasberg reportedly questioned how a pipeline would desecrate the Missouri River if the oil itself never touched the water . The most lasting impact of the Dakota Access battle might be greater federal attention to the process through which the U.S. government is supposed to consult tribal governments about proposed infrastructure projects that might impact those nations , says Wilkinson . A 38-page memo from former Obama administration Interior Solicitor Hilary Tompkins in December described in detail the ways in which the government failed to consult tribes that may be affected by the pipeline . That report requested further action from several federal agencies by April 2017 , in establishing better consultation processes .
