We are artists who are passionate about the nonpartisan documentation of Native American water protectors and their interaction with law enforcement and DAPL security . Our team arrived at Standing Rock last winter , with minimal , borrowed film equipment from dear friends . As the world watches , our media outlets need frontline nonpartisan participants to share what they are seeing and experiencing . Show and tell is key in sharing the story of what 's occurring and offering a ray of hope in this dark time . Please help our journey as we continue our documentation and education for the sake of all of us . Through this documentary , we wish to provide an educational platform , so that no one need feel oppressed . We seek to reveal that no land need be torn asunder to create jobs when we can create new job opportunities that are more in harmony with our land . We still have the brightest and strongest in our nation 's midst and we can learn from our history to honor our word to the Native tribes as we create new industries for non-Natives and the Indigenous alike . Our interview with her illuminates how her retina was severed in her right eye during the peaceful protests and her courage in rising through the disappointments and adversity that have spawned as a result . A member of the water protectors at Sacred Stone Camp since September 11 , Sioux Z has a grounding strength that is undeniable . Our documentary team is eager to go back to Standing Rock in January to continue sharing her story and the stories of countless other Brave souls who are rising through the ashes of adversity turned personal victory . Your donation makes all the difference for our team to express the unheard voices and share the beauty of what this powerfully compassionate movement is creating in all those who Stand for Love and Peace in the face of violence . Thank you and Bless the Beauty of our American Home . The turnout of Veterans was more like 11,000 souls , each one there with a mission of Peace in their Hearts . We shared tents with the veterans , fortified sleeping conditions with them , heard their stories , and held the warm hearth through the blizzard . Although many left due to the extreme cold , those who stand strong in the face of adversity are connected to an unyielding strength drawn from compassion and loving action . Please try again .
