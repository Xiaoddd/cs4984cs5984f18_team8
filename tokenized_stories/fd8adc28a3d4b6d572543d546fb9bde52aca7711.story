Protector efforts to thwart the development of the pipeline has been met with violence and surveillance by police . In order to track the Water Protectors , police and Energy Transfer Partners use helicopters , planes , and drones to photograph , monitor and harass . In some cases , the helicopters are used for more direct action against Water Protectors . A listing of the other eight articles is at the bottom of this article . The Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux also are fighting the pipeline work in court , with the next hearing set for Feb. 28 . In the meantime , hundreds of pipeline opponents have continued to occupy a camp near the drilling site in North Dakota . State and federal authorities have told the few hundred people remaining in the camp to leave by Wednesday -LRB- today -RRB- . Authorities want the area cleaned and closed before spring floodwaters wash tons of trash and debris into nearby rivers , including the Missouri River , and cause an environmental disaster . The tribe launched a cleanup effort in late January . The state and Corps were continuing Friday to try to line up additional contractors to speed up the work , according to Corps Capt. Ryan Hignight and Mike Nowatzki , spokesman for Gov. Doug Burgum . Some in camp think the flood fears are overblown and that authorities are trying to turn public sentiment against them . The latest spring flood outlook from the National Weather Service , issued Thursday , calls for minor flooding in the area . They are not children , and they darn well know what is being done to them . Again . Today the protectors need us all to help . Thank you KC .
