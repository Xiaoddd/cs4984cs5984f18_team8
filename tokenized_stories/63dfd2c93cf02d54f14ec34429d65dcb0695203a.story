There is a struggle being waged for the soul of the nation , for the very identity of America . And it has polarised opinion . Unless something changes very radically , the United States is in for a prolonged period of civil strife and political violence . While the GOP is threatened by a war from the extreme Right , the Left is trying to re-engineer the Democratic party into a European style social democratic party to tame the worst excesses of a Wall St corporate capitalism that leads the drive to massive inequality of income , wealth and , therefore , political power . The main parties are unmoored from the electorate and appear to be resistant to , or possibly , beyond reform . He won 13 million votes , not including the caucus states he stormed through last year . Never . If the Republicans thought their crises in the run-up to the 2016 election had been overcome by their takeover of both House and Senate in November , they were burying their heads . Both parties have lost their moorings , are cut off from their mass base , and appear to have no ideas of how to rebuild their credibility . Steve Bannon , former Trump White House chief strategist , and now back on his perch at the fascistic Breitbart website , has declared war on the GOP establishment to drive it even further to the extreme right . His project seems to be to use the Trump locomotive to remake the Republican party , possibly to split it in the process , into an openly anti-immigrant and anti-minority white-nationalist nativist bloc , political preparation for a holy global race war he believes is inevitable . But the facts are clear : that President Obama left the Democrats in a parlous state , losing both houses of Congress and over 1000 state legislative seats since 2008 . This represents a cliff-style fall off of political support not equaled since the American civil war . They want to harness to the party machine mass discontent and resistance . But incorporating and harnessing mass protest to the Democratic machine appears to be the move of a party in deep crisis but which remains itself attached to Wall Street and all that entails as to the corporate order at home and its militarism abroad . That the Democratic party has failed to grasp the meaning of 2016 indicates that it is an unlikely vehicle for popular aspirations even in the face of the most unpopular , divisive pluto-populist president in American history . Indeed , they may well be paving the road to another Trump administration , much as Obama and Clinton cleared the path to his election in November 2016 . He currently serves as Chair of the Research Network on the Presidency of Barack Obama , Co-ordinator of the Research Network on Global Knowledge and World Orders , and of the Trump Elite Project .
