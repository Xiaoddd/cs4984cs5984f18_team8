This is an inherent risk to all such pipelines and one of the reasons why transitioning to renewables is the only reasonable option . A Public Health Disaster Although it is not yet operational , the Dakota Access Pipeline has already experienced an oil leak . Approximately 84 gallons of oil leaked from the pipeline in early April , triggering a cleanup and a notation of the spill in the online database of the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources -LRB- SDDENR -RRB- . We also try to treat all of our spills in a consistent manner . Some perceive this position to be a tacit acknowledgment of the high frequency of spills inherent to all oil pipelines . Nobody listened to us . Toward A Sustainable Future These ongoing conflicts highlight the importance of transitioning toward clean , renewable sources of energy . Transporting oil in pipelines is inherently risky , and there is no way to remove the risk . In January of this year a diesel spill in Iowa contaminated farmland with 138,000 gallons of fuel . The fallout from the Deepwater Horizon spill has yet to stop unfolding , but has been one of the most significant environmental disasters of our time . Continuing to build and operate these pipelines is more than shortsighted . It is positively reckless in light of the undisputed risks to public health that oil spills cause to groundwater and land alike . Furthermore , fossil fuels like oil are dwindling , making renewables even more appealing . There is simply no reasonable position that includes building and operating more oil pipelines ; transitioning to renewables is the only logical and reasonable option .
