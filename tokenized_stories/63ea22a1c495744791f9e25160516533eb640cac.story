The name of the company building the pipeline is Energy Transfer Partners , and its CEO is a man named Kelcy Warren . Kelcy Warren also happens to be a passionate music lover who owns a festival -LRB- Cherokee Creek Music Festival -RRB- and a record label -LRB- Music Road Records -RRB- that , among other things , released a Jackson Browne tribute record . Indigo Girls have played the festival and had a song on the tribute record . Now we know . We are simply saying that building this pipeline is the wrong thing to do , and its disregard for Native land , water , and rights is in direct conflict with our philosophy as artists and people who care about Indigenous peoples and the environment . We wrote to Mr. Warren , asking him to reconsider and stop the pipeline . Many of us who have played your festival have invested time and energy into the fight for human rights and environmental justice . For some of us , this mission is the moving force and spiritual foundation of our larger community of musicians , and one of the inspirations to play such rich gatherings as the Cherokee Music Festival . This pipeline violates the Standing Rock Sioux Nation 's treaty rights , endangers the vital Missouri River , and continues the trajectory of genocide against Native Peoples . Many of us have also participated in projects affiliated with Music Road Records , another company of yours . While this company does a lot to promote incredible music that comes from the roots of our country , many of us , as artists , take offense and are mystified by how someone with such a deep passion for organic and traditional music can own a company that is so blatantly tearing at the heart of the fabric of our American community . The American tradition of music that is so diverse and rich depends on the respect for human rights and that includes environmental justice for Native Peoples that contribute to the great tapestry of this land . In order to stay true to our music and respect the Native Nations that are united against the Dakota Access Pipeline , we will no longer play your festival or participate in Music Road Records recordings . We stand with Standing Rock , the Standing Rock Sioux , their friends , and allies in protecting their sacred land and water by stopping the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and all pipelines that threaten massive ecosystems . Nevertheless , in the spirit of fairness , we present his letter in full : Lede image : Water Protectors prayerfully march across the desecrated sacred sites to stop DAPL construction .
