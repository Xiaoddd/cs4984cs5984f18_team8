Morton County Sheriff 's Office photo Stars and Stripes By Nikki Wentling WASHINGTON -- Hundreds of veterans will arrive at Standing Rock Indian Reservation this weekend to join the months-long protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline , bringing with them an influx of resources and attention . Diggs confirmed hundreds of veterans from across the United States were registered to participate , and the number could reach up to 2,000 -- a cap set by organizers . Veterans are a good fit for the job , Diggs said , because they 're organized and know how to handle emergency situations and extreme weather . Organizers warned veterans participating that they could be confronted with multiple state police agencies , some of them in riot gear and equipped with rubber bullets , pepper spray , water cannons and tear gas . Veterans have been instructed not to bring weapons and not to fight or destroy private property . Protesters and law enforcement have clashed during the past several months . Last week , police used a water cannon in freezing temperatures as crowd control , according to news reports . One woman protesting the pipeline could lose her arm after being wounded during a confrontation with law enforcement . There are conflicting news reports of whether her injuries were caused by officers or fellow protesters , with each side arguing it was the other . Hundreds of protesters have been arrested at the site . Diggs said the group of veterans is coming prepared . Besides medical supplies , body armor , masks and hearing protection , they 're bringing along lawyers and health care professionals . The veterans ' trip falls on the Dec. 5 deadline that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced Friday in a letter ordering people to leave federal land being used for protest . The announcement stated protesters must relocate for safety reasons to a free speech zone south of the Cannonball River . In a news conference Saturday , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said it would stand its ground . The Corps of Engineers clarified Sunday it would n't forcibly remove the protesters . Diggs said the announcement did n't change the veterans ' plans . In a video of the Saturday news conference , protesters are shown cheering when one of the lead organizers said the veterans were still planning to show up . Veterans Stand for Standing Rock was started by Army veteran Wes Clark Jr. and Marine Corps veteran Michael Wood Jr. , both of whom have been outspoken against the pipeline . Besides slowing construction of the pipeline , the group 's goal is to kick up widespread support for the protesters , according to organizers . Elected officials will be present at a news conference at the start of their trip , Diggs said . Organizers are also asking participants to use their phones and other devices to share what they 're doing on social media . All rights reserved .
