The army corps will undertake an environmental impact statement and look for alternative routes , the tribe said in its own announcement . While the news is a victory , Jan Hasselman , an attorney for the tribe , cautioned that the decision could be appealed . For months , they have protested over their fears that the pipeline would contaminate their water source and destroy sacred sites , and over the weekend hundreds of military veterans arrived at the camps in a show of support for the movement . As word spread in the main camp , protesters broke out in jubilant celebrations , and with nightfall a few fireworks burst above the tents and campfires . Many gathered around the central fire to sing and cheer , while others marched through camp carrying mirrored shields above their head . Alice Brown Otter , a 13-year-old from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe , said that she was one of the Native youth who ran from Cannon Ball to Washington DC to draw attention to the protests . But others voiced caution , noting the incoming Republican president and hints that the energy company will appeal the decision . Facebook Twitter Pinterest Alice Brown Otter .

Members of hundreds of other indigenous tribes answered their call to join in the struggle , resulting in the largest gathering of Native American tribes in more than a century . On Sunday , Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard joined the veterans at Standing Rock , where they planned to hold a prayer ceremony at the main encampment . US attorney general Loretta Lynch said the Department of Justice would continue to monitor and mediate between protests and police , who had fired rubber bullets and pepper spray in past clashes .
