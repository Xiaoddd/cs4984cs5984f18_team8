The criminal gang was compared by police to an octopus with tentacles across Europe and its members were related by blood or marriage . The investigation began when three women were caught trying to break into a property in Munich in January 2016 . It has led to arrests in Croatia and Spain as well as in Germany . Reinhold Bergmann , police commissioner for organised burglary , told reporters that the gang could have dozens of other tentacles operating in other countries such as Belgium , France and Italy . They claimed to be teenagers but police discovered they had forged identification papers and were linked to a wider gang originating in Croatia . Another two are on the run . Arrests have also been reported in Spain . Mr Bergmann said the group used young women to carry out the burglaries because they were discreet and less likely to face jail . They were even traded around different parts of the criminal family , which police say has some 500 members and is highly hierarchical . It was impossible to estimate the scale of losses sustained by burglary victims , police said , but it was likely to reach millions of euros . Police found alleged gang leaders living in luxury marble-floored villas in Zagreb . Croatian police have seized jewellery , other valuables and hundreds of thousands of euros in cash and are trying to trace their owners .
