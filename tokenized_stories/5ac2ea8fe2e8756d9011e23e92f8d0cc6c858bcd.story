Standing Rock Activists Clear Trash as Tribes Ask Court to Halt Pipeline Demonstrators in North Dakota are still on the ground and cleaning up trash left after a blizzard evacuation , and bracing as a new deadline approaches . Organizers told us much of the debris was left behind due to a forced evacuation of the protest camps amid a series of severe December 2016 blizzards , and subsequent sub-zero temperatures froze it to the ground , hindering cleanup . The Sioux have also tried to preserve cultural and religious landmarks spread throughout the area , some of which they say have already been destroyed by pipeline construction . Thousands of people have cycled through the encampments since the protest was launched on 1 April 2016 , including non-Native activists who oppose fossil fuels as an energy source because it contributes to climate change . Joye Braun , a front line community organizer with Indigenous Environmental Network and member of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe , told us that demonstrators have been working in freezing temperatures to clean after two blizzards bore down on North Dakota . Just as thousands had arrived at protest encampments , many were forced to evacuate . The first storm struck on 5 December 2016 and the second came several days later . Since then , freezing temperatures have been an obstacle for cleaning efforts : We had about 17,000 people here and then there was that big blizzard , then three or four days later , another big blizzard . Braun said the veterans will be housed on reservation land . Several camps , including the largest , Oceti Sakowin , remain standing with a total of about 800 demonstrators , despite extreme weather . And so other tribal governments are weighing in and supporting a fight on the ground as they have a right to do . There are 400 to 500 people north of the Cannonball River in the contested zone , in the treaty zone , in the place where according to the United States Army Corps of Engineers we are not supposed to be and they are going to stand their ground . Roughly 4,500 veterans descended on Standing Rock on 4 December 2016 after the Army Corps , which manages the disputed land , told demonstrators they had to leave the following day . But the Corps dramatically announced that an easement needed by the pipeline company had been denied and that an Environmental Impact Statement -LRB- EIS -RRB- would need to be completed before the project could proceed . The Corps reversed course on 8 February 2017 , and granted the easement after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to revive the project and that of the Keystone XL , another controversial pipeline blocked by his predecessor , President Barack Obama , in 2015 . In a statement , the Corps said it had terminated the EIS process and granted the final permit allowing construction to move forward . Braun said the Cheyenne and Oglala Sioux have also invoked land rights under the 1868 Fort Laramie treaty . Keller said ETS is drilling on both sides of the site .
