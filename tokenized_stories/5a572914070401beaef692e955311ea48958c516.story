Though BP is better known for its petroleum products , the spill released still unknown amounts of coal-bed methane wastewater into a tributary of the Los Pinos river , known as Sauls Creek . The rupture was discovered on December 13th , , but not made public until more recently . State reports said that a 6-inch fiberglass gathering line was found leaking early that morning on a Forest Service Road , though BP representatives have insisted that it was discovered just two hours after the rupture took place . The discovery of the leak led to the immediate emergency construction of an earthen dam in order to prevent the toxic wastewater from traveling farther downstream . BP crews also shut down 17 nearby gas fracking wells they own in addition to shutting off the ruptured pipeline . An early estimate , cited by the Durango Herald , showed that the contaminated water had traveled at least 2,300 feet along the tributary bed . BP has remained incredibly tight-lipped about the damage done by refusing to say how long the spill had been occurring , how much methane wastewater was released into the environment , and what the exact contents of the wastewater were . They also refused to even speculate on what could have caused the spill . Even though BP is clearly trying to keep information about this spill out of the public eye , enough evidence is available to speculate on the damage done . However , the chemical makeup of the wastewater released remains unknown , making it difficult to gauge the true damage of the incident . 30 of those wells lie across the Sauls Creek area , where coal-bed methane gas is produced . Within the same county as this latest spill , 19 reported oil and gas spills have taken place this year alone . BP was directly responsible for 12 of those spills . However , the number is likely much higher as this latest spill , as well as a previous one , have no existing estimates for the quantity of substances leaked .
