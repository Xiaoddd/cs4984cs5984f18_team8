Update : New happened . When Energy Transfer Partners proposed a new 1,200-mile oil pipeline from the Bakken oil fields to the Midwest , it chose a route crossing the Missouri River just yards upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation . Within days of his inauguration , however , Donald Trump ordered the permits granted . The Tribe filed a lawsuit to challenge this decision , but construction was completed while the case was proceeding . In June , just weeks after pipeline operations had begun , the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled for the Tribe that the Army Corps had not complied with environmental review laws before issuing permits for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River . The court ordered separate briefing to assess whether the pipeline should be shut down while the remand process is going on . In a 28-page opinion , the court weighed two factors to determine whether or not the pipeline should be shut down . The court answered that question in the affirmative . Second , it assessed the disruptive consequences if the pipeline were shut down . However , the court found that the first factor was sufficient to rule against shutting down the pipeline . In its legal briefs , the Tribe had asked that if the pipeline were not shut down , then the court should impose additional measures to reduce the risk of oil spills to protect the Tribe . The details and timing of this process will be worked out at a status conference next week . Because the district court case remains live , and the remand process is underway , this is not an appealable decision at this time . The Tribe intends to focus on the remand process and has a technical team of experts assisting it in providing input . The Corps has invited the Tribe to provide input into the remand , and that process is currently underway . The Corps has stated that process should be complete by April of next year .
