Even ExxonMobil has forecasted a drop in global oil consumption by 2040 due to climate regulations . Shortly after the EIA conference , Pope Francis held a conference of his own , which also involved the oil industry . The U.S. is not only exporting oil and natural gas as fuel but also as feedstock for the growing global petrochemical industry , which includes the plastics industry . While the world is coming to terms with the issue of plastic pollution , the energy industry sees plastics as a huge growth opportunity . The fracking industry , as it 's pumping out floods of natural gas , is producing far more ethane than it can process in the Marcellus Shale , which spans Pennsylvania , New York , Ohio , Kentucky , and West Virginia . But that is not a viable solution for the volumes of ethane being produced . Some EIA attendees also likely drove past the highway exit to Ellicott City , Maryland , a suburb of Baltimore , on their way to the conference . On May 27 , the city experienced its second 1,000 year flood in just two years . Three people died in those floods , which occurred in 2016 and 2018 . As The New Republic pointed out , these catastrophic floods were the combined result of extreme weather and overdevelopment . While Ellicott City was warned about the dangers of overdevelopment , the city continued paving the land , building more construction above the already flood-prone town , and putting off stormwater improvements . New construction on the hills above historic Ellicott City , Maryland .
