Search For Missing 10-Year-Old In Aurora The little girl has n't been seen for more than 24 hours . The leak occurred at a rural pump station in the northeast of the state as crews worked to get the four-state pipeline fully operational , Walsh said . The oil was contained on site by a plastic liner and containment walls and quickly cleaned up . Some oil-contaminated gravel will be disposed of at an area landfill , he said . The Standing Rock Sioux tribe , which was the initial plaintiff in the lawsuit , said the leak proves that the pipeline is a threat to its water and cultural sites . Nobody listened to us . Tribal attorney Jan Hasselman said the leak shows the need for more environmental study of the pipeline , which will move oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution point in Illinois . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had planned additional study but scrapped the idea after President Donald Trump earlier this year pushed for completion of the pipeline that had been stalled by months of protests and lawsuits . Energy Transfer Partners maintains that the pipeline is safe . A federal spill report database does not show any reports from Energy Transfer Partners or its subsidiary Dakota Access LLC in any of the other states through which the pipeline passes .
