Jenni Monet , the latest journalist arrested while covering pipeline protests , said she was taking notes and photos on Feb. 1 as pipeline opponents attempted to establish a new camp on private property . Monet said she complied with police orders when asked to show her media credentials and was leaving the scene when she was one of 74 people arrested . She is charged with trespassing and engaging in a riot , both Class B misdemeanors . Monet , who has covered the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe 's opposition to the pipeline since September for Indian Country Media Network , the Center for Investigative Reporting , PBS NewsHour and High Country News , said her arrest is a misunderstanding and she looks forward to her charges being reviewed and dropped . The Native American Journalists Association has denounced Monet 's arrest and called it a violation of free press principles . North Dakota Highway Patrol Lt. Tom Iverson told The Bismarck Tribune he asked Monet to leave several times and she was unable to produce media credentials when asked . At least eight journalists have been arrested while covering Dakota Access protests in North Dakota . Seven of the cases involve misdemeanor charges that are still pending . Prosecutors attempted to charge Goodman with engaging in a riot but a judge would not sign the complaint . During a hearing for House Bill 1426 , Assistant North Dakota Attorney General Jonathan Byers said individuals can be guilty of engaging in a riot if law enforcement gives an order to disperse and they do n't leave the area , even if they 're not actively participating in the riot . Rep. Todd Porter , R-Mandan , who introduced the bill at the request of law enforcement , said the intent of the bill is not to affect journalists who are covering a riot . House members voted 63-27 in favor of the bill , going against a do-not-pass recommendation from the House Judiciary Committee . The Senate Judiciary Committee 's hearing on the bill is at 10 a.m. Monday in the Fort Lincoln Room . Starting at 9 a.m. . The Pioneer Press is a Forum News Service media partner .
