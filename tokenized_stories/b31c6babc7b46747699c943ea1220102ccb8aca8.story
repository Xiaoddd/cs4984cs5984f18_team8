It was the first home she had ever owned and , to celebrate , her aunt fitted out the kitchen in Kronvall 's favourite colour , purple : everything from microwave to mixing bowls . A cousin took pictures of her lying on the floor of the room that would become her bedroom . She planted roses and told herself she would learn how to garden . The closest two are within 300ft of her tiny patch of garden , and their green pipes and tanks loom over the fence . As the drilling began , Kronvall , 52 , began having nosebleeds , nausea and headaches . Her home lost nearly a quarter of its value and some of her neighbours went into foreclosure . Energy analysts in the US have been as surprised as Kronvall at how fast fracking has proliferated . Until five years ago , America 's oil and gas production had been in steady decline as reservoirs of conventional sources dried up . Then a Texas driller , George Mitchell , began trying out new technologies on the Barnett Shale , the geological formation that lies under the city of Fort Worth , Texas , and the smaller towns to the north , where Kronvall lives . Mitchell did not invent the technique . Hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , was first used in the 1940s to get the gas out of conventional wells . As the well shaft descended into the layer of shale , the driller would blast 2m-4m gallons of water , sand and a cocktail of chemicals down the shaft at high pressure , creating thousands of tiny cracks in the rock to free the gas . Mitchell 's innovation was to combine the technology with directional drilling , turning a downward drill bit at a 90-degree angle to drill parallel to the ground for thousands of feet . It took him more than 15 years of drilling holes all over the Barnett Shale to come up with the right mix of water and chemicals , but eventually he found a way to make it commercially viable to get at the methane in the tightly bound layers of shale . The new technology has turned the Barnett Shale into the largest producible reserve of onshore natural gas in the US . Other operators , borrowing from Mitchell 's work , began drilling in Colorado , North Dakota , Ohio , Pennsylvania and , most recently , California . More than 15 million Americans now live within a mile of an oil or gas well , 6 million of them in Texas . The industry has been quick to publicise fracking 's apparent benefits . Electricity and heating costs have dropped . The activity from the oil and gas sector has helped buoy up an ailing national economy and paid for new schools in country towns . Last October , the US produced more oil at home than it imported for the first time since 1995 . New evidence , however , has begun to emerge that fracking , while reducing coal consumption , is not significantly curtailing the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change . Campaigners warn that fracking is binding the US even more tightly to a fossil-fuel future and deepening the risks of climate change . There have been stories from homeowners of fracking chemicals seeping into their drinking water , video footage of flames shooting out of kitchen taps because of methane leaks . Companies have been fined for releasing radioactive waste into rivers . It 's impossible to drive for any length of time without seeing the signs , even after the rigs have moved on elsewhere : the empty squares of flattened earth , the arrays of condensate tanks , the compressor stations and pipelines , and large open pits of waste water . Virtually no site is off limits . Energy companies have fracked wells on church property , school grounds and in gated developments . Last November , an oil company put a well on the campus of the University of North Texas in nearby Denton , right next to the tennis courts and across the road from the main sports stadium and a stand of giant wind turbines . Wesley and Beth Howard moved into the Remington Park neighbourhood in the same year , two doors down , after making a similar calculation . It was close to where Beth works as a graphic designer at Texas Woman 's University . Wesley , 41 , a support engineer at IBM , works from home . The neighbourhood was still only partially built , but the developers said they were planning 150 new homes , a park and walking trails on the meadow behind their house . In February 2011 , Beth , 31 , had just found out she was pregnant when the couple noticed some wooden stakes with fluttering bright plastic strips had gone up in the meadow behind their home . Kronvall had seen them , too , and assumed workers were staking out cul-de-sacs for the next phase of homes . She was away at a work conference in May 2011 when she got a call from another neighbour : crews had arrived with heavy earth-moving equipment . The meadow was about to be drilled for a well . None of the neighbours received any official notice , either from the energy company or the town authorities . At that time , Texas law did not require companies to disclose which chemicals they were using to frack the well . Residents say that , to this day , none of them has any idea , though there is now a voluntary chemical disclosure registry at fracfocus.org . The crews proceeded to flatten the earth and install a 200ft red and white drilling tower that loomed high above their homes . Convoys of articulated lorries rumbled down the main road . She says the activities on the other side of her fence deposited a layer of white powder on her counter tops . The sound of the crew shouting into megaphones invaded her bedroom . Bright lighting pierced her curtains and made it difficult to sleep . There was the din of diesel generators belching soot , and a nauseating mix of chemicals competing with the aroma of dinner . The noise and smells penetrated to the next street over , where Christina Mills lives . Like the Howards and Kronvall , Mills , 65 , was attracted to Ponder because of its sleepiness , and bought the fourth house built in the entire development when she moved to the town in 2001 . Devon Energy Corporation , the firm drilling behind their homes , did install a sound curtain to try to buffer the noise . The curtain did little to muffle the sound or reduce the other effects of fracking , say residents . The Howards ' baby , Pike , arrived several weeks early . The couple say there is no way of knowing whether that was connected to the fracking , but they were very nervous about exposing him to possible chemicals from the process . We did n't know what we were breathing in at any given time , and he was breathing it , too . Two doors down , Kronvall says , her eyes watered constantly when she was at home , stopping only after she had been at work for an hour or two . As well as bouts of nausea and low , throbbing headaches , there was blood when she blew her nose . Devon says it is not aware of any complaints about health problems suffered after it began its activities at Remington Park , though company representatives attended public meetings from 2011 , and were accused by residents of being dismissive of health concerns . As well as struggling with the noise and smells , Christina Mills says , there was the dust : ` It took the paint off my car . ' Photograph : Deia Schlosberg for the Guardian As well as struggling with the noise and smells , Christina Mills says , there was the dust . One morning she found a gritty white powder all over her car , so she stopped at a car wash on the drive to work . The three neighbours all tried to stop the fracking , or at least get compensation . They sought legal advice and appealed to the town authorities and state environmental regulators . Inspectors for the Texas environmental regulator came out to Kronvall 's home , commiserated about the smell and collected air samples , only to report back weeks later that they were unable to detect dangerous emissions . As the neighbours soon discovered , both they and the developer who owned the meadow behind Kronvall and the Howards were powerless because they did not control the mineral rights . The local authorities had already changed the zoning regulations to allow fracking close to their homes , and fought attempts to hold a public meeting about the drilling . She is , somewhat to her surprise , angry at the energy company , too . This is a first for Mills . An accountant , she started her career carrying out audits in the oilfields of Oklahoma . She considered herself a supporter of oil and gas . There have been cases where energy companies have compensated residents for damage to health and property as a result of fracking . The details of these agreements are closely held because of non-disclosure agreements . The Ponder residents , however , were unable to get their lawyer to pursue their case because their property values are too low : their lawyer told them the potential property damages were not enough to make it worth their while . All the neighbours could do , for the eight months it took to put the wells into production , was watch . Eventually , the rig was dismantled and moved on , leaving two oilwells and three waste tanks in the area just behind their homes . Another three wells , six more waste tanks and a large open pond were erected on the other side of the meadow . Heavy trucks still pull up almost every day to empty the tanks beside the well pad . There have been scares , too . At the start of this year , a loud whistling sound came out of the tanks and residents wondered if one of the wells was about to blow up . Mills now uses an inhaler after developing asthma . She has missed about eight weeks of work . You feel violated . No respect for any kind of human decency or rights , just take what you want . A report from the British Geological Survey last July significantly increased estimates for the amount of gas sitting beneath the north of England , raising hopes of replicating America 's gas rush . The report suggests there could be as much as 1,300 tn cubic feet of gas over an area stretching from Lancashire to Yorkshire and down to Lincolnshire . Depending on what fraction of that is recoverable , the gas could supply Britain for decades . The government began promoting the idea that it would be irresponsible not to take advantage , and talked of opening up lands to fracking not only in the north of England , but also in the south-east and Wales . The chancellor 's autumn budget statement last week included generous tax breaks for fracking companies . David Cameron has said that unlocking the shale will transform Britain as it has America , driving down energy prices , creating tens of thousands of jobs and providing new revenue for local councils . Fracking has not had an easy start in Britain . In April 2011 , two small earthquakes and dozens of aftershocks occurred when Cuadrilla Resources drilled its first well in Weeton , Lancashire . The tremors could be felt as far away as Blackpool . The company halted its operations for a seismic investigation , but continued work on its other wells . Protesters forced companies to delay or back away from other well sites . Even with those challenges , however , the industry remains committed to going ahead . At least six oil and gas companies have announced plans to pursue shale gas in Britain . Cuadrilla has already drilled exploratory wells at Singleton and Becconsall in Lancashire , and is pursuing another at Balcombe in West Sussex . Celtique Energie and Coastal Oil and Gas have applied to drill in Kent , West Sussex and Wales . The main industry body , the United Kingdom Onshore Operators Group -LRB- UKOOG -RRB- , expects a number of those exploratory wells to go into production in 2014 or 2015 . The pro-industry Institute of Directors said in a report that there could be 100 well sites across the country in the next 10 to 15 years . The industry maintains that fracking in Britain will be vastly different from that in America because of the nature of the geology and more stringent regulations . The Bowland shale is much thicker than the Barnett shale , for example , which , industry experts say , means energy companies will be able to dig many more wells spiralling out from a single site , and so limit the impact of fracking above ground . The regulations also require companies to disclose what chemicals they are using , and the British government has already restricted some chemicals used in the US . That 's enough to flood all of Washington DC beneath a 22ft-deep toxic lagoon . Unlike Texas , where waste water from fracking is sometimes left to evaporate in open pits , Britain will require sealed disposal units . And unlike North Dakota , where producers simply burned off excess gas , spewing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere , companies will capture the gas and feed it into the national gas supply . Perhaps most important of all , Cronin says , there would be strict standards for well quality , and regular inspections to ensure there is no escape of frack fluids or gas into the water supply . Cuadrilla believes that these regulations put Britain far ahead of America in terms of protecting human health and the environment . The company , however , has already been warned by ministers about its performance for failing to recognise the significance of the damage to its well following the 2011 earthquakes , and for failing to report it for six months , according to documents released under the freedom of information act . But Lucas 's biggest fear by far is that launching a shale gas revolution in Britain will destroy any prospects of action on climate change . Another prominent opponent of fracking , the landowner Lord Cowdray , says that if fracking went ahead , he could foresee a scenario of well pads scattered across the South Downs . Some of the proposed sites around Fernhurst in West Sussex , he says , are within 600ft of private homes , about twice as far as the Ponder site from Veronica Kronvall 's , but still very close . What Cowdray fears most , however , is that the oil companies are not prepared , or sufficiently insured , to deal with a major contamination event such as a leak of fracking fluids or waste into the water supply . Back in his small town in Texas , Wesley Howard says that , as fracking spread from state to state across the US , he often heard that refrain .
