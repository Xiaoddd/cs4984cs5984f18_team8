The announcement was a deep blow to the Standing Rock Sioux . The tribe has been protesting the pipeline for months , along with environmentalists and social justice activists from around the world . But hours later , across the country , something different happened in Washington state . And looking beyond Seattle , they hope to serve as a model for other communities looking for new ways to resist fossil fuel infrastructure . Army Corps of Engineers to grant final easement for Dakota Access Pipeline The Trump administration told a federal court it plans to approve the final permit for the pipeline . Advertisement As the Trump administration prepares to set in motion the pro-fossil fuel energy agenda that Trump promised during the campaign , much attention has turned to cities , which generally skew more progressive than the country at large . Creating a movement Seattle is no stranger to progressive citywide politics . It also has a relatively large indigenous population , with more 29 federally-recognized Native American tribes located in Washington state . The Dakota Access Pipeline captivated national attention for months as thousands of protesters clashed with local and federal officials in North Dakota ; that fight offered Seattle activists a concrete issue around which to coalesce a resistance movement . Starting in August , Native groups in Seattle began discussing what was happening in North Dakota , and how they could help draw attention to , and support , the protest movement beginning to grow there . The rally drew modest media attention , and garnered support from a handful of city politicians . Afterwards , Remle and other Native organizers decided to keep the momentum going by organizing rallies and demonstrations against the pipeline on a regular basis . And they saw the divestment push as a chance to radically alter the way the city of Seattle does business with banks , drafting language that mandates a set of socially responsible practices that must be given considerable weight when deciding which banks to do business with in the future . But as much as the paradoxical timing was a stark reminder of how incremental victories can be easily wiped out by a president who , despite presenting himself as a populist , shows little regard for the will of the people , it was also a testament to the awesome power of tenacious grassroots organizing . There is some hope that the success of the Seattle initiative will bolster the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline , which is likely to face intense opposition both in the courts and in the streets . Protests , rallies , and marches voicing opposition to Trump and his policies have ballooned in the weeks since his inauguration , but there can be a disconnect between voicing opposition to a policy and enacting policies to counteract it . For protesters looking for a tangible way to throw sand in the gears of the Trump administration , Seattle offers a blueprint for social action turned into successful city policy . The majority of working people in America are in no mood to negotiate with Trump . The movement is already growing . Seattle organizers are also working with tribes to encourage tribal divestment . The Muckleshoot Indian tribe has already divested from Wells Fargo , and Remle expects other tribes to adopt a similar strategy . In the conflict over treaty rights and indigenous land , they see a struggle similar to one that they have been engaged in for years in the Pacific Northwest . For more than half a decade , oil , coal , and natural gas companies have been eyeing the coasts of Washington , Oregon , and California as potential gateways to overseas markets , proposing a rash of export terminals and refineries meant to receive fossil fuel from the center of the country and send it out to the rest of the world . But as the Dakota Access reversal shows , those victories are tenuous , especially under the Trump administration . Remle , who heard about the decision to grant the easement while waiting to testify in support of the Seattle ordinance on Tuesday , described the moment as bittersweet .
