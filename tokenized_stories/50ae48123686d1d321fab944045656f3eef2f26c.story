Latest : It 's transition time at protest camps as people start leaving Complete coverage of the Dakota Access Pipeline protests In a wide-ranging conversation about the state 's difficulties in dealing with the ongoing protest , Dalrymple expressed frustration that the company building Dakota Access Pipeline , Energy Transfer Partners , has not been vocal in making the case for the project in the public debate . Man arrested for bomb threat in WF police parking lot Native Americans and environmental activists have been protesting to prevent the Dakota Access Pipeline from crossing under Lake Oahe at a point that is just upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . That 's a long-term challenge . Some protesters also repeatedly provoked law enforcement officers to try to goad them into a response that would make law enforcement look bad on video that would be widely shared on social media sites , Lt. Gov. Drew Wrigley said . One notable example came Nov. 20 , he said , when protesters refused to back away from a bridge and set fires . When responders used fire hoses to douse the flames , protesters could easily have moved back away from the spray , but did n't , creating a misleading visual representation of the confrontation , Wrigley said . Wrigley said he and Dalrymple , joined by Col. Michael Gerhart , superintendent of the North Dakota Highway Patrol , and Al Dohrmann , adjutant general of the North Dakota National Guard , as well as Ron Rauschenberger , Dalrymple 's chief of staff , watched a live video feed of the confrontation . Law enforcers have made more than 500 arrests so far , with 90 percent of those arrested coming from outside the state , Gerhart said . Officers have acted with great restraint , but are forced to act when protesters break the law , he said . As examples , he said officers have been shot at , have faced improvised explosive devices , and have had rocks and burning logs thrown at them . It has been clear for months that David Archambault II , the Standing Rock tribal chairman , is not able to control many of the protesters , Dalrymple said . After the corps ' announcement on Sunday , Archambault asked protesters , many living in tents or other accommodations that are no match for a harsh North Dakota winter , to go home . North Dakota no longer has any regulatory role in determining the fate of Dakota Access Pipeline , but must provide public safety , including for the protesters , Dalrymple said . The project will be in limbo until the Donald Trump administration takes over , Dalrymple said . He can be reached by calling 701-241-5522 . Generally , letters should be no longer than 250 words .
