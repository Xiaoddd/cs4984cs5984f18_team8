Two years ago , a popular protest there turned into a deadly riot . The army battled civilians in the streets on and off for three months , hundreds were arrested , a seventeen year-old boy was shot and killed , the government of Bolivia nearly collapsed . The issue was water . The spark was privatization . A private consortium , dominated by the Bechtel Corporation of San Francisco , had taken over Cochabamba 's water system and raised water rates . New Yorker writer William Finnegan traveled to Cochabamba to learn about the water war and to see what lessons could be drawn about privatization , globalization and the growing anger in Latin America over economic inequality . Bolivia is the poorest country in South America . Nearly one child in ten dies before the age of five . The Bolivian economy , never strong , was wrecked by hyperinflation in the 1980s . Desperate for relief , Bolivia has been faithfully following the dictates of the international lending community for the past fifteen years -- selling its airline , railroads , mines and electric company to private -- usually foreign-controlled -- companies . The economic shock therapy tamed inflation but led to severe recession and massive unemployment . In the 1990s , Bolivia , under pressure from the United States , eradicated its most lucrative export - coca - the leaf that is used for cocaine . Politicians like Quiroga fully supported the eradication of coca , but the loss of drug money made the country even more dependent on international financial institutions like the World Bank . The Bank advised the country to continue selling its remaining assets , including water . Cochabamba put its water system up for auction in 1999 . Only one bidder showed up . The company , called Aguas del Tunari , a division of the large American construction firm Bechtel , promised to expand water service . Two months after taking over the water system , Aguas del Tunari raised the water rates . People , resentful and angry , took to the streets in protest . One of their leaders was Oscar Olivera , a long-time union activist . He and others tapped into the anger many Bolivians feel about their country 's long history of political corruption and foreign domination . Housewives were throwing stones at the police . Although a major American corporation was at the center of the conflict , not a single U.S. newspaper had a reporter on the scene . But news of the uprising was reaching a worldwide audience through the Internet , thanks to Jim Shultz , an American activist living in Cochabamba . Shultz shows Finnegan how he organized an e-mail campaign to pressure Bechtel to leave town . The company finally withdrew and the uprising subsided . The case is being heard in Washington D.C. , in an arbitration court run by the World Bank . The water warriors who ousted Bechtel took control of the water system , vowing to run it as a human right , not as a commodity . But without new investment , they have been unable to improve or expand service . Neither the government , nor the World Bank appears willing to help them . All Rights Reserved .
