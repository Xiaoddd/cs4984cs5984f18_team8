Details are scarce but the probe appears to relate to a November incident during which Sophia Wilanksy , 21 , nearly lost her left arm , The Bismarck Tribune reported . A man who allegedly has information pertaining to the injuries has been ordered to testify before the grand jury , the paper said . According to court document obtained by The Tribune , Martinez drove Wilansky to the Prairie Knights Casino after she was injured and called 911 from the facility . The incident occurred as law enforcement clashed with protesters over several hours on the evening of November 20 and into the early morning on November 21 . Wilanksy 's father believes her arm was shattered by a type of less-lethal weapon used by law enforcement .
