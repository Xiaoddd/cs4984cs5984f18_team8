The demonstration began a few months back when it was revealed that the Dakota Access Pipeline , a planned 1,134-mile pipeline that would carry around 500,000 gallons of crude oil per day from the Dakotas to Illinois , would be rerouted through sacred land belonging to the Sioux tribe . After months of being attacked by police with non-lethal weapons in harsh winter conditions , optimism was waning for anti-DAPL demonstrators . This past weekend , the Army Corps of Engineers denied a permit for the construction of a key segment of the pipeline , causing Energy Transfer Partners to withdraw from the project . According to Jo-Ellen Darcy , the Army 's assistant secretary for civil works , the Corps of Engineers have decided to heed the warning that the Sioux tribe has given about what the pipeline will do to their water supply . The united front of protesters were both shocked and ecstatic to hear that the easement has been denied , as cheers and Native whoops rang out from the camp for hours after the announcement . Still , many demonstrators and members of the Sioux tribe have remained cautiously optimistic , understanding that they had won the battle , but that the war is far from over . While the Army Corps of Engineers and the Obama Administration have finally decided to stand up for the Native tribe , the fear that Donald Trump will try to force the completion of the pipeline once inaugurated remains a real threat . Though the future of DAPL still remains unclear with Trump poised to take the White House , this victory speaks volumes about the power of protests . Even outside of the North Dakota protest , the success of the demonstration proves that when people unite for a noble cause , anything can be accomplished regardless of the opponents deep pockets or political influence .
