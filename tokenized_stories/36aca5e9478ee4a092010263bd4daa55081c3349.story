That comes a day after pipeline opponents plan a rally in Lincoln and pipeline construction workers gather for a barbecue in Omaha . The 275-mile route submitted by TransCanada is the same pathway that was approved by a different state agency , the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality , back in 2013 . So expect some drama next week , along with plenty of legal objections from lawyers representing landowners and groups opposed to the pipeline . And expect some uncertainty . This is the first time the low-profile commission , which typically rules on issues concerning telephone and cellphone service , has ever sat in judgment over an oil pipeline . It will , without a doubt , be the highest-profile action the PSC has taken , drawing national attention . Rulings earlier this week by a retired judge from Lincoln who will be the hearing officer severely restricted what issues can be presented . Those rulings may serve to shorten the hearings , which are scheduled to extend as late as 9 p.m. each day . Flowers did allow discussion about the impact on property values and soil disturbance in laying the 36-inch pipeline , which would be buried 4 feet deep to allow farming and grazing to resume above it . Attorneys will get to cross-examine each witness , as would happen in a court hearing . However , the length of each day will be dictated by the amount of testimony and cross-examination that day . So hearings could end earlier , and the hearings might not take all five days . Labor unions that support the pipeline will testify last .
