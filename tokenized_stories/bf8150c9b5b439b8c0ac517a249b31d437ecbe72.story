In an influential 2017 paper , US finance professor Luigi Zingales considered what happens when firms become so large that they begin to rival states in their political power . The largest modern corporations facilitated a massive concentration of economic -LRB- and political -RRB- power in the hands of a few people , who are hardly accountable to anyone . And as the US economy has become more concentrated and corporations bigger -LRB- evidenced by increasing margins -RRB- , that power , and the ability to exploit it against customers , workers and politicians , has only grown .

Sign up This sits poorly with traditional economic thinking , which assumes corporations face competitive markets or , even without competitive markets , the threat of market entrants . One of the characteristics of neoliberal economics has been the effort of neoliberals to justify diminishing competition as firms grew bigger . Neoliberals justified mergers and acquisitions that created giant , market-dominating corporations as achieving huge efficiencies and savings that would flow through to consumers . The reality , of course , was very different . The major banks have wielded political power to protect their own interests . The royal commission has only really detailed what we have long known was happening for more than a decade : the conflict of interest inherent in this vertical integration model has harmed consumers . The commission is normally willing to grasp the nettle and criticise politicians , albeit indirectly , but the political dimension to market power has eluded it on banks . Any assessment of the market power of the banks is inadequate without an assessment of the political dimension of that power , and the way in which it has been used to benefit banks and harm consumers .

Political economy is a branch of social science that studies the relationships between individuals and society and between markets and the state , using a diverse set of tools and methods drawn largely from economics , political science , and sociology . Also including any other anti Govt entities . Witness the power of the FANGS and the emergence of the new feudalism . Capitalism is eating itself again and the result is rising inequality , slow wage growth and autocratic rule . The attacks by Crikey and others on neo-liberalism should make clear that it is not an attack on the virtues of competition and the market . Market failure exists but when it works it delivers the best public-interest outcome and reduces the power of vested interest . Capitalism needs a transfusion not an epitaph .
