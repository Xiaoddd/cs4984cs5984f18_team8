Native Americans and activists from around the country have been gathering at the camp for several months trying to halt the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . The proposed 1,172-mile-long pipeline would transport oil from the North Dakota Bakken region through South Dakota , Iowa and into Illinois . The Senate voted 33-12 in favor of a measure that makes it a crime for adults to wear masks in most cases . The Senate also approved bills that increase penalties for rioting and trespassing by even wider margins . The masks and trespassing measures were slightly amended by the Senate . The legislation now returns to the House to see if representatives will agree with Senate changes to the bill . If they do not , a conference committee of three House members and three senators will attempt to strike a compromise . Governor Orders Dakota Access Pipeline Protestors to Evacuate Camp Republicans said none of the measures infringe on the right to peacefully protest . There have been more than 700 protest-related arrests in North Dakota since mid-August .
