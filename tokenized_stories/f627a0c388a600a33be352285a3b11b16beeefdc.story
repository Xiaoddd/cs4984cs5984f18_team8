Over 4,000 veterans began to arrive on Saturday in caravans of cars , trucks and buses . They joined thousands of other protesters from around the world who were already camping at Standing Rock . The hope was that law enforcement would see themselves and rethink their role in history . They arrived Saturday morning and left Sunday afternoon , shortly before news came down that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had decided to block the pipeline route from running near Standing Rock Sioux land . He went because the Indians ' sovereignty had been violated , he said Monday . The response drew an astounding coalition of cultures from across the globe , an intriguing occurrence for a sociologist . The assembled groups originated from places as far flung as Peru . The Paynes saw freelance journalists from Germany and climate scientists from Norway , along with a man from Alabama who had driven north with a shipment of sweet potatoes . The unity he saw at the camp , in the context of America 's history of racial and political friction , inspired hope in Payne . The camp was surprisingly well organized , he said . His veteran status was registered among a list of social security numbers by camp organizers in order to deter fakers . His visit coincided with an influx of veterans to the protest camp , many of which were reportedly prepared to act as human shields for the protesters should a confrontation with the police turn violent . He personally observed an action on Sunday . Although some of the veterans crossed a demarcation line on the roadway , the police did n't use crowd dispersal tactics as they had before , Payne said . Conditions at the camp were very cold , so that the batteries in all three of Payne 's cameras were dead after just 24 hours of shooting photos . Signs posted by American Indian tribes made it clear that photos of sacred objects and traditions were not allowed without permission . It stymied Payne 's desire for candid shots , but he respected their wishes . They did chores like hauling water to earn their keep , and were sure to bring in more supplies than they used , Payne said . Although he had heard of a trend where young white people were reportedly taking advantage of the collective resources of the protest camp and treating it like a music festival , Payne did n't see evidence of that when he actually went there . The camp was surprisingly free of litter , he said . Pipelines are harmful not only because they further carbon emissions that cause climate change but also because of the risk of spills , Payne said . A pipeline recently ruptured near Kansas City , Mo. , and his hometown .
