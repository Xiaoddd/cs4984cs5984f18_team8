Transcript This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form . AMY GOODMAN : An honor song performed for the members of the Seattle City Council after the vote to divest from Wells Fargo , a funder of the Dakota Access pipeline . During the song , they gave the members a gift bundle with water from their river . The War and Peace Report . In a letter to Congress , acting Army Secretary Robert Speer said the Corps will cancel an environmental impact study of the Dakota Access pipeline and will grant an easement today allowing Energy Transfer Partners to drill under Lake Oahe on the Missouri River . The Army Corps also said it would suspend a customary 14-day waiting period following its order , meaning the company could immediately begin boring a tunnel for the final one-and-a-half miles of pipe . In response , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe promised a legal fight . Dave Archambault is asking allies to protest at state capitols and at a march on Washington on March 10th . Other indigenous water protectors and their allies have vowed to take direct action to stop construction at the drill pad on the west bank of the Missouri River , less than a mile north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . Meanwhile , activists are planning solidarity actions in cities across North America and beyond . We had a status conference with Judge Boasberg . And judge asked the Department of Justice when a decision was going to be rendered . And the Corps of Engineers said they were reviewing the process , and most likely will be Friday or maybe next week . So , I made plans to come out to D.C. and try one more time , one last attempt , to meet with the Army Corps of Engineers before they made a decision , and also to try to meet with the White House . I had a meeting set up with Intergovernmental Affairs , William Kirkland . As soon as I landed , I got notice . And it was just disheartening . And this is something that we were so thankful that the previous administration at least took time and looked at all angles and all perspectives of this argument . So , every time something comes out in the news , it appears that people take it as definite . But we always stop and take a look . Federal laws are being violated . And this is just a complete disregard for the environment , for what keeps people safe . But we need to get that out there . We need to be heard by decision makers . So , President Obama said that the environmental impact statement should be done , and talked about the possibility of rerouting . And that was never looked at . So , we have been asking for that . And this president is taking direction from corporate America , from the Koch brothers . Finally , we got a meeting . It was scheduled for Monday this week , and then it got pushed to today . So I came in to get this meeting done and let them hear our side , why are we standing up against this pipeline , what is the cause . AMY GOODMAN : Last year , Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren predicted the pipeline will go forward under a Trump administration . This is Warren speaking in November to Mark Albert of CBS News . KELCY WARREN : That the easement gets granted and the pipeline gets built . KELCY WARREN : Well , I wish him well . I think the chances of this pipeline leaking is extremely remote . KELCY WARREN : Absolutely . KELCY WARREN : They will not stop our project . DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II : Amy , what is unfortunate is that when I visited with Kelcy Warren and I shared with him why we are concerned and all the wrongs that took place to our people , he agreed that this pipeline should not go there , this pipeline should not be there , and if he knew the information prior to any of the scoping , he would have rerouted it . So he knows and he understands why we resist this . And our only chance now is to go through court with them , with a decision that Donald Trump is doing . DAVE ARCHAMBAULT II : Well , I think this march is very important , because we need to start focusing on more , because I believe that Donald Trump is going to start attacking all of our rights , all of our treaty rights . Not just this one pipeline is going to be the issue . All of these things are going to be under attack . And we are the first occupants of these lands . So we need to build awareness about that . AMY GOODMAN : Dave Archambault , you have been arrested protesting the Dakota Access pipeline , arrested for civil disobedience . And I did get arrested . One arrest is enough . We did make enough noise . Now , because of this movement , we have to take the lessons that were given to us at that time , when it was healthy . So , one of the other things is to continue the divestment , the things that happened in Seattle . Those are exactly what has to happen . If we know that the Koch brothers are running this nation , then we have to encourage anyone and everyone we know . AMY GOODMAN : Dave Archambault , we want to thank you for being with us , chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . Stay with us .
