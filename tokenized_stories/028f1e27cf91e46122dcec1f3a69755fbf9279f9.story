Many celebrities died including Gene Wilder , David Bowie and Prince . So did Cuban dictator Fidel Castro . Networks underreported economic issues even as voters repeatedly told pollsters how much it mattered to them . Instead , sexy or trendy stories like Pokemon Go and the Brangelina breakup got far more time . Protesters were also the go-to interviews for network reporters . Those same programs showed zero critics of the Army decision or proponents of the pipeline project . But in many ways new media are even worse . Take Spotify , the streaming music service with 100 million active users , for example . Other episodes promoted pro-abortion views , the gender pay gap myth , gun control , universal healthcare and other liberal causes . Other reports found described the brutal leader like a father , or grandfather figure to his people . The network morning shows said nothing about her candid remark the next day . Pokemon Go , a mobile game for catching monsters , got more than twice as much network coverage in July . ABC , CBS and NBC evening news programming spent 731 seconds combined on Pokemon Go , compared to 338 seconds on the U.S. economy . The bias against a British exit was obvious ahead of the vote . The networks barely reported on those four issues , as well as weak wages and median household income , preferring to report positive economic news . Ninety-one percent of those stories -LRB- 311 out of 342 -RRB- ignored those six key negative indicators which revealed remaining weakness in the U.S. economy . Stock market and oil price movements also got plenty of attention . One of those emails even indicated CNN political commentator Donna Brazile leaked debate questions to Clinton . 9 . Soros and Steyer Drive Liberal Agenda , Bankroll Clinton Campaign The liberal media spent the year peddling the liberal agenda , while men like George Soros and Tom Steyer spent millions trying to set that agenda and get Clinton elected in order to govern from the left . Many of the media groups he funded push the same liberal agenda as Clinton , from immigration issues , to wealth redistribution , unionization and increased minimum wage . Left-wing billionaire and climate activist Tom Steyer also spent millions to help Clinton , broadening from his previous choice to spend solely on climate change . 10 . News Media and Celebs Continue to Sound the Climate Alarm The liberal media kept the hot air coming on the threat of climate change . The cost of the liberal solutions to the climate threat would be less economic growth or even severe economic regression . DiCaprio also intentionally released his latest alarmist documentary , Before the Flood , just ahead of the election . His film premiered at the White House South By South Lawn event , then aired on National Geographic channel on Oct. 30 . -LRB- a 501c3 non-profit production of the Media Research Center -RRB- DONATE 2016 Presidential Debates Economy Business Coverage Coal Industry Environment Global Warming Brexit Vote Protesters ABC CBS NBC Follow Julia A.
