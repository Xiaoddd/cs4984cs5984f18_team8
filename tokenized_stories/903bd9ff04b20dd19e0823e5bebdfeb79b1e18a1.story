U.S. District Court Chief Judge Daniel L. Hovlandsaid that officers were outnumbered when they deployed hoses and other non-lethal means against a crowd of 1,000 protesters trying to remove a police barricade on the fire-damaged Backwater Bridge during the Nov. 20-21 melee . The tribe has led the calls to block the pipeline from its intended route under Lake Oahe , citing fears about water quality . For the last two months , however , tribal chairman Dave Archambault II has called for protesters to leave the area , citing the environmental damage to the prairie , which is now undergoing a massive cleanup effort led by the tribe . The judge scolded activists for illegally blocking roads , bridges and intersections for months with impromptu protests against the 1,172-mile , four-state pipeline , which is more than 90 percent complete .
