President Vibeke Larsen stands in the center of the front row . The project to build the 1,900 km Dakota Access oil pipeline across six US states has prompted massive protests from Native American activists at the Standing Rock Sioux reservation . Vibeke Larsen , president of the Sami parliament , said the pension fund announced the move when she arrived at a meeting in Oslo to discuss Dakota Access . Although they are seen as one people , there are several kinds of Sami , and their rights differ significantly depending on the nation state they live in , according to the United Nations . In common with Native Americans in the US , the Sami have over the years protested against mining operations and mineral resource prospecting on their land . The Standing Rock Sioux say that the Dakota Access pipeline crosses sacred land and threatens their water supply from the Missouri river . Their efforts to halt or divert the pipeline became an international rallying cry for indigenous and environmental activists last year . Facebook Twitter Pinterest The protest at Standing Rock against the Dakota Access pipeline has drawn solidarity from around the world . But Larsen alerted the investment fund to a report earlier this month by the UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples , Victoria Tauli-Corpuz , which concluded the tribes affected by the pipeline had not been consulted sufficiently . Opponents of Dakota Access have also waged a divestment campaign against the pipeline company , Energy Transfer Partners . Using the slogan Defund DAPL , activists have also urged individuals and institutions to move money out of companies involved in the project . Larsen believes KLP realised the case was serious when the parliament began writing to them . As non state-owned businesses , they had not been targeted by the Sami parliament , a parliament spokesman says . As indigenous people who are themselves protected under international conventions , the Sami campaigners believe that their voice can have an impact far beyond their numbers , said Larsen .
