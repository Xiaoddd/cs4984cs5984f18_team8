The camp gained increased attention starting in August after its population had grown and authorities made their first arrests . At its height , the camp included thousands of people , but the numbers had dwindled during the winter and as the fight over the pipeline moved into the courts . Most protesters left peacefully Wednesday , when authorities closed the camp , but some stayed overnight in defiance of the government order . As police in full riot gear worked to arrest the stragglers Thursday , cleanup crews began razing buildings on the square-mile piece of property at the confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri rivers . The arrests were a last resort , he said . Only one person resisted arrest ; otherwise there were no major incidents , and there were no injuries , Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said . Afterward , officers showed visible relief , smiling and shaking hands . They declared the camp cleared shortly after 2 p.m. , though Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said 15 protesters crossed the frozen Cannonball River on foot to the south bank . They planned to station officers on the north shore to keep anyone from re-entering the camp . Before authorities moved in , Gov. Doug Burgum had said those remaining at the camp still had a chance to leave without facing charges . The state sent a bus to the site on Thursday to transport anyone to Bismarck , where officials were doling out basic necessities , along with hotel and bus vouchers . No one took advantage of the offer Thursday , and only nine people used the center Tuesday and Wednesday .
