Because it proved that our divestment campaign was working . We were making change happen . Throughout the 1970s and 80s , divestment was a decisive tactic in the NUS campaign against apartheid in South Africa , particularly targeting Barclays Bank . And when Barclays eventually pulled its investments completely , they admitted it was due to the pressure from our campaign . Divestment works . It was about delegitimising them , shifting public opinion , and ramping up political pressure . I seriously doubt it . And these things really add up . The student movement made a massive contribution to the collapse of apartheid , and did so by undermining the system politically as well as financially . Divestment is a long-term game . We could bankrupt them . They should make use of all money and funding , some argue , solely to become the best institutions of education they can possibly be . That sounds good to me too . Obviously , that makes zero sense . Andlast year the BMA pledged to divest from fossil fuels too . It defies common sense . We know half of students want it already , and that momentum is building . Sometimes , you act pragmatically to make a real impact . Please choose your username under which you would like all your comments to show up . You can only set your username once .
