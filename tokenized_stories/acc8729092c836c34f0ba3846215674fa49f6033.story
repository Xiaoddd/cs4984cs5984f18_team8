It has the potential to cause devastating , longterm environmental damage , not least of all to Lake Oahe , a major source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Tribe . The construction would cut through ancestral burial grounds . And the harsh treatment of peaceful protesters near the construction site by private security contractors and law enforcement officials , who used tear gas , pepper spray , attack dogs , and even water hoses in sub-freezing temperatures , caused unnecessary pain and suffering while violating free speech and First Amendment rights of our fellow Americans . The Democratic Party was proud to support the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and their cause . During our most recent Rules and Bylaws and Executive Committee Meeting , Democrats unanimously passed an official resolution expressing our solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . The Democratic Party has also made it clear in our party platform that we believe we have a profound moral and legal responsibility to Indian tribes and we will not waver . Democrats believe that we must respect the property rights of Native and rural landowners , that we must respect the First Amendment rights of protesters and the sovereign rights of Native American Tribes , and that we must invest in rural America in smarter ways that create more jobs in the green energy economy . Economic development , job creation , and private enterprise are critical parts of our shared American prosperity , but they should not come at the expense of the health and well-being of our neighbors . The case raises serious questions about how Trump may use the power of the presidency to further his business interests . But beyond these conflict of interest issues , this project has been especially troubling for how the corporation in question has stepped on the rights of ordinary people . As we look to the future , Democrats will continue to stand with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , we will oppose any corporation that attempts to infringe upon the rights of ordinary Americans , and we will hold Donald Trump accountable if abuses the power of our highest office to trample on those rights for personal financial gain .
