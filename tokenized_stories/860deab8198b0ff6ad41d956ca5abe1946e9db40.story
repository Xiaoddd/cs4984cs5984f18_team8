This goes beyond the silly and transparent revisionism the new administration is bringing to settled government positions on climate change and other inconvenient realities . In particular , one memo details many failures of the Corps and of Energy Transfer Partners , which is building the project , to meet the requirements of federal law in dealing with the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River tribes . But the relevant treaties , subsequent acts of Congress and court decisions support the opposite conclusion , which requires consultation at a government-to-government level that the Corps has tried to avoid . Her concluding paragraph : The Corps , and particularly the Omaha District and Northwestern Division , have performed with remarkable diligence and professionalism in responding to a demanding situation that has galvanized tribal communities across the nation , and presented difficult and unique challenges in protecting public safety , First Amendment rights , property rights , and law enforcement . Consistent with the trust relationship , proactive tribal consultation is important to , among other things , allowing tribes to raise the types of concerns addressed in this Memorandum prior to the commencement of federal action , thus avoiding the need to reconsider issues or halt ongoing projects and ultimately conserving federal , state , tribal , and private resources . Their data indicates that since 1996 , there has been an average of over 283 such incidents per year , with total annual incidents trending upward since 2013 .

Companies manipulate their filings . I recall listening to testimony at a meeting in which a high ranking official of the Standing Rock Tribe and their lawyer pointed out the defects in the entire process of review of the pipeline . The result was that standards that were less strict were applied to each segment and so a far less detailed review of the project was conducted . I thought this was of major significance when considering the project as a whole , not just the issues pertaining to the part that goes under the lake . For some reason that issue seems to have been buried . The result is more dysfunction , which leads to more dissatisfaction which lead to more cries to limit government . Time and again companies do the types of things that DAPL seems to have done . The manipulate the information given to agencies who already are understaffed due to cuts in budgets . The companies then decry the excessive delays in getting permission to do the project they want , and the cycle just repeats itself . That is what seems to have happened with DAPL , and in my view also is a factor in the Polymet and copper mining debates in Northern Minnesota . It is a spiral that goes downward . When and where bottom is hit is something all people should ponder . Makes a person wonder about the resiliency and vermisilatude our legal and contractual protocols when they can be so conveniently manipulated with enough time and money and an endgame of abridging justice . Hidden authoritarianism under the disguise of a mantle citizen participation .
