Stun grenade M84 stun grenade Type Non-lethal explosive device The flash momentarily activates all photoreceptor cells in the eye , blinding it for approximately five seconds . Afterwards , the victim sees an afterimage that impairs his or her aim . The loud blast temporarily deafens the victim and also disturbs the fluid in the ear , causing loss of balance . The concussive blast of the detonation can still injure , and the heat created can ignite flammable materials such as fuel . The fires that occurred during the Iranian Embassy siege in London were caused by stun grenades . Unlike a fragmentation grenade , stun grenades are constructed with a casing made to remain intact during detonation , containing most of its explosive force and avoiding shrapnel injuries , while having large circular cutouts to allow the light and sound of the explosion through . The filler consists of a pyrotechnic metal-oxidant mix of magnesium or aluminium , and an oxidizer such as potassium perchlorate or potassium nitrate .
