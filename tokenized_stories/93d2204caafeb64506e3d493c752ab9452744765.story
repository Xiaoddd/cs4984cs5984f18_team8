So much for the young and beautiful students . Take that for a rant . DeVos is stupendously rich , and a longtime crusader for charters , vouchers and using federal funds for religious education . Image Betsy DeVos at her confirmation hearing . But it is sort of remarkable how much ire , wrath and terror this particular one is causing . The committee is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the nomination . The chairman , Lamar Alexander , desperately tried to throw himself in front of the train wreck . Poor Senator Alexander , who was once secretary of education himself , has an excellent reputation for bipartisanship . But there he was , limiting his members to five minutes worth of questions each and refusing to allow a second round . We have two problems here . One is that DeVos is obviously unqualified . There are , of course , some great charters around the country . But there are also some terrible ones , and she is deeply unenthusiastic about any system that would weed out the losers . This would be the second problem . DeVos seems to be a particularly big fan of for-profit schools . Running schools like a business -LRB- and , of course , driving away the teachers unions -RRB- is supposed to create more efficiency . But mainly , it creates more income for management . About 80 percent of the charters in the Michigan system are for-profit , and The Free Press investigation found that the charters were generally spending more on administration and less on the classroom than traditional districts . The DeVos family has invested in a company called K12 , which runs online charters and has a history of wooing urban parents by suggesting that their kids will be safer going to school in the living room . Finally , Kaine volunteered that he thought all schools that receive taxpayer funding should be equally accountable , and he asked if DeVos agreed . I invite you to join me on Facebook .
