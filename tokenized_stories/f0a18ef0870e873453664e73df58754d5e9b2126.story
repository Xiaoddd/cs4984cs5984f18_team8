The same Dallas-based company is behind both the Trans-Pecos and Dakota Access pipelines . The region is one of the only areas of the state that has , until now , remained unadulterated by oil and gas infrastructure . On December 6 , three Alpine residents with the BBDC chained themselves to the entrance gates of an ETP construction site , halting work on the pipeline . A second camp in Alpine , Texas , is also supporting the Water Protectors . Two Rivers Water Protectors lead a Native prayer drumsong before the lockdown action , January 7 , 2017 . Truthout has previously reported that many such sacred sites , including potentially Indigenous burial sites , have already been destroyed or are threatened . The site is rare in the region due to its particular historical significance , according to Keller . The site was once part of a larger formation of spring vents along the eastern front of the Davis Mountains , and is situated along an ancient trail network stretching from Mexico up through Leon Springs in Fort Stockton , Texas , and on farther north . It contains arrowheads and glass beads once heavily traded along the trails . ETP claims to have adjusted its construction route to avoid disturbing the artifacts after its own archeologist recommended the site be avoided . However , Keller said that ETP has only tested for cultural relics one foot beneath the topsoil even though many artifacts in the area of the floodplain of the Rio Grande are at least three feet beneath the surface . The Two Rivers Water Protectors are also fighting for state and federal recognition of Texas tribes . Indigenous Water Protectors occupy a segment of the Trans-Pecos pipe , January 7 , 2017 . During the conflicts , the tribe used the Comanche Trail that crossed West Texas through the Big Bend region . This land was very sacred to them , very important to them . Kiani Naranjo , another Two Rivers Water Protector who descends from the Lenca people of El Salvador , agrees . The Water Protectors and their allies want full environmental assessments on the entire length of both pipeline projects , not just for the areas that would be crossing the border . Opponents of the Trans-Pecos pipeline have been pushing for such a review for some time . As Truthout has previously reported , the fight against the Trans-Pecos pipeline has been ongoing for more than two years . Throughout that time , conservationists , landowners and area residents have filed hundreds of comments with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , which is tasked with regulating a portion of pipeline slated to cross under the Rio Grande . The Two Rivers Water Protectors fear the Rio Grande may become contaminated and they requested that the agency conduct an environmental review of the pipeline , but the request was denied last May . Now , with all institutional avenues for halting the pipeline exhausted , BBDC is linking up with SNN to use nonviolent direct action tactics , similar to the way in which East Texas landowners linked up with environmental organizers to resist the southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline in 2011 and 2012 after pulling every institutional lever they could without success . The primary financial backers of the pipeline include the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Japan , according to industry reports . Beyond the pipeline , Two Rivers Water Protectors say they hope they can galvanize a larger resistance to the development of the recently discovered Wolfcamp shale field in West Texas , the largest shale field ever assessed in the US . The shale contains 20 billion barrels of oil and 16 trillion cubic feet of natural gas . That resistance is already taking shape with another camp in Toyahvale , Texas , which formed concurrently with the Two Rivers camp . The city is home to the locally known and loved spring of Balmorhea State Park , and hopes to stop the development of the nearby shale fields by the Apache Corporation . The Houston-based company announced last fall that it could drill up to 3,000 wells over the next two decades .
