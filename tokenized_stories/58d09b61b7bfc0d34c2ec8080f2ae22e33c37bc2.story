This could get ugly , really ugly . The Corp works for President Obama , the POTUS . As of now I am not associated with this group , but , I would be proud to stand with my fellow Vets on this . That these lands might someday offer legal protections for the rights of citizens , to protest peacefully being one of those rights . What scares me most is discovering further proof that my childhood beliefs in America as exceptional were unfounded . That my patriotism was underwritten by propaganda . That so many good men - and women - shed blood , sometimes their lives for an America lost forever to the current culture of ravenous , unchecked greed . I am a coward . I thought I was fighting for liberty , freedom and our inalienable rights , but it was mostly all a deadly ruse . Hopefully I can locate my passport , otherwise I can not drive through Canada . Yet another law meant to limit the free travels of American citizens . Never thought about it until just now , but the only way to drive out of Alaska is through Canada .
