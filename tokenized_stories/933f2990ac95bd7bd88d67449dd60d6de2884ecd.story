A time when we remember a feast , the first Thanksgiving , on Plymouth plantation in the autumn of 1621 . The tales of pilgrims from the Mayflower who celebrated the harvest , shared and broke bread with the first Americans , are still used as inspiration and shared with children , teaching them the beauty of gratitude . It was invented to whitewash the vicious genocide wrought upon the native inhabitants of this magnificent continent . Not only did the Europeans try to eradicate native populations , but they made every effort to eviscerate their culture , their language and eliminate them from these coveted lands . From Plymouth Rock to Standing Rock , this lie has made our Thanksgiving Day a day of mourning for the First Nations , all the tribes big and small , those who came before us . A few weeks ago we traveled to visit the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota . We arrived at this unprecedented historical gathering of more than 500 tribes and thousands of others standing on the frontlines to protect water , to state the most basic human truth , to say water is life . Despite the painful history , today they fight peacefully for us all . The camp grows as winter comes . Standing in protection of our most vital life support systems , but also for the rightful preservation of Native American cultural ways and their sovereignty . Everyone we talk with is committed to peaceful resistance . Weapons , alcohol and drugs are forbidden there . Standing together in prayer to protect water displays a deeply rooted awareness of life 's interconnected nature , and of the intrinsic value and import of traditional ways . This growing movement stems from love , it is the most human instinct to protect that which we love . An eager and engaged youth are at the core of this pipeline route resistance , learning from a population of elders who pass down unforgotten knowledge . It is an awakening . All here together , with their non-native relatives , standing strong in the face of outrageous , unnecessary and violent aggression , on the part of militarized local and state law enforcement agencies and national guard , who are seemingly acting to protect the interests of the Dakota Access pipeline profiteers , at a cost of hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars , above all other expressed concerns . They stand against corporate security forces , the county sheriff and the national guard . Standing while being hit with water cannons , mace , teargas , rubber bullets . Standing without weapons and praying , the water protectors endure human rights abuses in freezing temperatures . Supplies arrive from all over as the social media universe shares the heartbreaking news to the world , that an American corporate media is not free to report . Thus , it is the ugliness of corporate America , seen around the world . But they stand , their hair frozen from water cannons . They stand for all that is good and they stay strong . We are calling upon you , President Barack Obama , to step in and end the violence against the peaceful water protectors at Standing Rock immediately . We will be going back to support the water protectors again . Let us all stand with them in thanks , in appreciation for the ancient wisdom they carry , in thanks for this opportunity for true gratitude . For giving us a path forward . For trying to show us a road to survival . We offer our support and our respect . We hear the call to protect the water protectors to listen , learn and get engaged . They are brave . We thank them . And we can give thanks for the bounty . Like water on the garden of activism , America 's surprise president brings a bounty of opportunity . The great issues of our time are now brightly illuminated and people are becoming more aware of them than ever , from sea to shining sea , from Standing Rock to Wall Street . The surprise president-elect was not the winner of the popular vote , does not have a mandate for the change of ideals envisioned . Keep in mind , close to over two million more people voted for another candidate . Nor is the surprise president the leader of the free world . Two hundred of the world 's nations believe in science , above the profits of the oil , gas and coal industries , and are committed to working together to protect the future from an unchecked climate crisis . The surprise president claims he does not believe in climate science nor the threats it presents and his actions and words reflect that claim in tangible and dangerous ways . Do not be intimidated by the surprise president 's cabinet appointees as they descend the golden escalator . Those who behave in racist ways are not your leaders . The golden tower is not yours . The White House is your house.Your growing activism in support of freedom over repression , addressing climate change , swiftly replacing a destructive old industries with safe , regenerative energy , encouraging holistic thinking in balance with the future of our planet ; that activism will strengthen and shed continued light on us all . These worthy goals must be met for all the world 's children and theirs after them . This is our moment for truth . Unintimidated , stand , speak up and show up . Be counted . Be like our brothers and sisters at Standing Rock . Be there if you can . The progress we have made over 240 years as a nation , has always come first from the people . The scorecard shows that 140 House members voted against chemical safeguards every time , while 149 members consistently voted for chemical safety protections . However , the action fund praised the lawmakers that bucked their party to vote for chemical safety , including Reps. voted for funding chemical reviews and against a farm bill that included pesticide safety loopholes . Florida Reps. A Preview of the People , Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule , two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Updated and reissued every five years , these guidelines are the nation 's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations . supply . These nominees will be well-known in their fields , and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers , academics and practitioners . part of the process is happening in real time . what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors . Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff , and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally . Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries . And here 's the first place you 'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition : rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected , USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first , soliciting public comments in the process . In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts , it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance . And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious . After the committee is announced in early 2019 , it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report . all appearances , the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs . though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable , plant-based diets have been all but stymied , there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle . Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance , including the meat industry , dairy industry , and sugar-sweetened beverage associations , as well as formula companies , which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers . -LRB- This may be happening in real-time , too . Exposure can be caused by contact , ingestion or inhalation . Short-term health effects can range from skin irritation and numbness to fever and headaches . Long-term exposure can lead to cancer , liver failure and sperm damage . is traditionally called blue-green algae is actually a class of microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria . Cyanobacteria can be toxic and can also produce various types of cyanotoxins that have different hazards . With their small , developing bodies , children are especially endangered by algae exposure . was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption . But it probably wo n't be the last , especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year . Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets . If you believe your pet may have been exposed , be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy , seizures , diarrhea or vomiting . And as climate change gets worse , the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks , creating a toxic feedback loop . The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish . Communities that struggle with regular , serious toxic algae outbreaks , like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie , can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation . The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth . The women were all non-smokers , had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies . Macrophages , which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body , protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles , such as bacteria and pollution particles . The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants . That 's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA 's Office of Inspector General -LRB- OIG -RRB- , the agency 's internal watchdog . EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement , and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was required to respond to the April 2017 petition within 90 days , but nearly 17 months have passed with no finding . more than 97,000 giraffes remain in the wild , and the species is gravely imperiled by habitat loss , civil unrest , hunting for meat and the international trade in bone carvings , skins and trophies . U.S. provides a large market for giraffe parts . for their six-foot-long necks , distinctive patterning and long eyelashes , giraffes have captured the human imagination for centuries . But so , under this definition , are multi-thousand-acre corporate entities using automated machinery to grow genetically engineered corn . Size of the farm is not a factor ; neither is the style of agriculture . A family farm may not even have a family that owns or works the land . issue with such a broad definition of family farming is primarily in the discourse . Aid is divvied up by revenue among family farmers , with additional programs going to some specialized farmers , like young or beginning farmers , organic farmers , and sustainable farmers .
