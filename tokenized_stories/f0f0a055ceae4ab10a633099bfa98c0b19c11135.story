The announcement came as the result of South Dakota Highway Patrol troopers being assigned to support North Dakota law enforcement personnel at the site of the Dakota Access pipeline protests . Download Audio The Crow Creek Sioux Tribe has two legal agreements with the state of South Dakota . One is a Memorandum of Understanding with the South Dakota Highway Patrol . Crow Creek Sioux Tribal Chairman Brandon Sazue says those agreements are now null and void as a result of South Dakota Highway Patrol troopers supporting North Dakota law enforcement at the Dakota Access Pipeline protest . Chairman Sazue wishes South Dakota would be as a good a neighbor to the Lakota people as it wants to be to North Dakota . But a standing agreement with North Dakota for law enforcement support when required means they could be sent back if requested .
