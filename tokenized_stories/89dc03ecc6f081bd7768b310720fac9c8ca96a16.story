The Gateway To The West Benefits From GPS Tracking Tracking Systems Help The People Of St. Louis One of the crown jewel cities in the Midwest , the city of St. Louis , truly has everything . The city is large enough to host the Olympics , which it did in 1904 , be the home to popular sporting franchises such as the St. Louis Blues , St. Louis Rams and St. Louis Cardinals , and be the home base of many businesses . With a long and rich tradition starting back in the mid 1700s when the city was founded by French traders , the city of St. Louis is the home to many corporations such as Anheuser-Busch and Energizer . With the city offering everything from business opportunity and tourism , the people of St. Louis are quickly learning how GPS trackers can assist the Gateway to the West . Companies all across the Midwest and St. Louis area are utilizing GPS tracking system technology to better network and manage fleet operations . Anheuser-Busch , the parent of world renowned Budweiser , is one of the companies discovering the benefits of GPS tracking systems by using the car tracking systems to monitor distribution trucks . Unlike many companies who use live tracking units such as the Victoria tracking system for fleet management , one distributor for Anheuser-Busch uses data logging recorders similar to the GPS Tracking Key and GPS Tracking Key Pro to record the movements of trucks . The GPS trackers record travel history and speeds traveled so if an accident were ever to occur the company would likely have some additional protection against a potential frivolous lawsuit . The tourism industry in St. Louis could also hugely benefit from the use of vehicle tracking devices . Being the home of popular tourist attractions such as the St. Louis Art Museum , Forest Park , Gateway Arch and Saint Louis Zoological Park , St. Louis has numerous transportation companies shuttling people all around town . Taxi cab and limousine companies all across the greater St. Louis area can use GPS tracking systems to quickly transport tourists all over the city in a swift fashion , and improve internal fleet management operations .
