We originally did not plan on releasing the video or text but since so little has been said about him following his passing , we decided it would be nice for friends and family of his to see the love those in Rojava have for him . In talking with Kurds that knew him personally , we have repeatedly been told of his compassion , sincerity , and revolutionary spirit . We hope this eulogy reaches those who were close to him and fills them with the same pride those here have for him . Today we honor and pay tribute to a true revolutionary hero . He loved the Kurds and he loved Kurdistan . While I did not know Heval Kawa personally , I do know that he was full of love and compassion , with a desire to change the world and to fight for freedom . From the plains of North Dakota , Heval Kawa , fought alongside his tribal family at Standing Rock against the barbarism of capitalism and the continued oppression and genocide of the Native Americans by US imperialism . From the Dakota , Heval Kawa traveled thousands of miles from the United States to Rojava to defend and ultimately give his life for a people also fighting for their freedom . Heval Kawa heroically fought against the tyranny and barbarity of Daesh alongside the YPG . To be a martyr is immortality for his blood will continue to nurture the struggle and show the path that others will follow . The future is bright , for justice will prevail . The light will shine through the darkness as millions win their freedom and their right to live the way they want , on their own terms . We give thanks and praise for all you have done . You were and always will be a free Kurd in our eyes . You are one of us and we are blessed to have known and fought alongside you . IGD is not the author nor are we responsible for the post content .
