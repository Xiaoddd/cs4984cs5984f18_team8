The pipeline , known as Keystone XL , is meant to help carry crude oil from the oil sands of Alberta to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico . Mr. Trudeau has been trying to avoid taking the path of his father , Pierre Elliott Trudeau , whose energy policies as prime minister in the 1980s deeply soiled the family name among Albertans . But now people on all sides are angry at him . But he agreed with Mr. Dyer that building the pipeline might make it impossible for the government to meet its emissions targets . When an attendee at a banquet hall in Peterborough , Ontario , challenged Mr. Trudeau on his earlier approval of the pipeline , he dived into his usual talk about Canada transitioning away from fossil fuels but still needing a vibrant energy industry . But then he veered slightly off script . We need to phase them out . His remark in Ontario was soon thrown back at him . The usually imperturbableMr . Reviving the pipeline project will not help , he said . Some analysts say the market has changed since then , to the point that there may no longer be a compelling business case for building it . Oil production is quickly rebounding in the United States , threatening again to flood the domestic and international oil markets . Fuel prices at American pumps are relatively cheap without the pipeline . where it would enter an existing piping network bound for the gulf refineries . With the American market already oversupplied , most of the additional oil from Canada would probably have to be re-exported in refined form to foreign markets , or would replace American crude that would then be exported . The project would create few permanent jobs , but it would generate thousands of short-term jobs in construction , which is why several powerful unions support the project . In the end , a completed Keystone XL pipeline may prove to be little more than a favor to Canada , where several American oil companies have made huge investments in the oil sands fields .
