The 1,130-mile long pipeline seeks to transport nearly 600,000 barrels of crude oil from the Bakken oil fields through 50 counties across four states . On Tuesday , the North Dakota Public Service Commission approved permits for a pipeline that would transport crude oil through the Dakotas , Illinois , and Iowa . The all-Republican panel voted 2-0 in favor of the pipeline , with one member abstaining due to a conflict of interest . Iowa is the only state yet to approve permits , however , The News and Observer reports that Energy Transfer Parts , the company behind the project , expects Iowa to approve by next month . The Southern Illinoisan reported that Energy Transfer Partners , a Dallas-based company , claims to have easement agreements on 85 percent of the land the pipeline crosses . Derrick Braaten , a Bismarck attorney representing about a third of landowners who wanted better terms for their agreement , told The Bismarck Tribune that his clients were seeking better deals and thorough protection of their land . The Grand Forks Herald reported that , earlier this month , over 7,000 gallons of saltwater -LRB- a waste product of oil and gas production -RRB- leaked from a different pipeline in North Dakota . Owned by a subsidiary of Summit Midstream , the leak was found in the same system responsible for the Blacktail Creek leak , which resulted in about 3 million gallons of saltwater leaking out of the pipeline . The Blacktail Creek leak occurred in 2015 , and the resulting contamination reached the Little Muddy and the Missouri rivers . The resulting effects are still being determined by the Environmental Protection Agency . However , chloride levels around the pipeline rupture were estimated to be as high as 900 times above normal . Ammonia levels were found to be up to 400 times higher than normal . Another issue some landowners have with these large-scale projects is the bureaucracy that they face and lack of accountability . Subcontractors are the people that landowners are told to talk to when they face land reclamation issues , such as weeds or damaged property . Despite these problems , Energy Transfer Partners hope to complete the Dakotas Access pipeline by the end of 2016 , the Des Moines Register reports . If easements are not reached voluntarily , the company is prepared to use eminent domain to take land , the Southern Illinoisan reports . Some landowners have attempted to fight the use of eminent domain . Last May , three landowners filed a lawsuit attempting to prevent Dakota Access LLC from claiming eminent domain . However , a judge dismissed the lawsuit in October according to KCCI . All rights reserved . This website uses cookies . Read RT Privacy policy to find out more .
