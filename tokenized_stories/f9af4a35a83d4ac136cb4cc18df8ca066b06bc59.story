Tribes have been reaching out to the Republican administration since it took office last month , saying they 're ready to help it meet its campaign promises of improving the economy and creating more jobs for Americans . We 're job creators . But tribes elsewhere have already steeled for battle just weeks into the new administration . The Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota has asked the courts to overturn recent federal approvals for the Dakota Access pipeline . The tribe and its supporters are also planning a large demonstration in Washington on March 10 . The tribes along the nation 's border with Mexico have also voiced concerns about the impact Trump 's proposed wall will have on their sovereign lands . And other tribal advocates are closely watching what comes of Republicans ' promises to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama 's Affordable Care Act . Despite the uncertainties , many tribal leaders say they 're still hopeful they can build on the strong relationships enjoyed under prior administrations . On the campaign trail , Trump gave little indication how he might approach tribes , but many see promise in the administration 's broader goals . Russell Begaye , president of the Navajo Nation , says his members will be looking for greater control over water , land , criminal justice and taxation on their sovereign lands , which straddle parts of New Mexico , Arizona and Utah . Tribes with casino dreams , meanwhile , are optimistic that Trump 's experience in the industry , as well as his promises to ease businesses regulations , will work in their favor , said Jason Giles , a member of the Muscogee -LRB- Creek -RRB- Nation in Oklahoma and executive director of the National Indian Gaming Association . Trump once owned three Atlantic City , New Jersey , casinos , though two have since shuttered and one operates under different owners . Tribes are even willing , for now , to overlook the president 's past off-color statements about Native Americans . Testifying before Congress in 1993 , the then-casino mogul questioned the legitimacy of some of his tribal rivals .
