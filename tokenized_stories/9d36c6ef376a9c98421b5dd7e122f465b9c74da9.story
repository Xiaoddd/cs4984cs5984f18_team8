While it is not known why the FBI is probing the Standing Rock water protectors , activists and free speech advocates fear the Trump administration may come to treat the peaceful protesters as domestic terrorists . The three activists exercised their Fifth Amendment rights and did not cooperate with the agents . All three contacts were made after the inauguration of President Donald Trump , who last month signed an executive order reviving the DAPL project after it had been blocked under the Obama administration . The 1,170-mile -LRB- 1,885 km -RRB- pipeline will transport crude oil from the shale fields of North Dakota to Illinois and then to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico . Trump is reportedly personally invested in Energy Transfer Partners , the company behind the pipeline project . Hundreds of Native American and allied water protectors remain encamped at Standing Rock despite sub-zero temperatures and the threat of police violence . The FBI has a long history of investigating peaceful protest groups and other non-violent activists . During the struggle for black civil rights in the 1950s and 1960s , the agency under the direction of J. Edgar Hoover launched the notorious COINTELPRO campaign in which leftist , civil rights , black power , anti-war , feminist and other groups were targeted , often illegally , in an effort to monitor , infiltrate , discredit and destroy them . COINTELPRO operations ranged from inciting deadly violence to attempting to persuade civil rights icon Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to commit suicide . More recently , the FBI investigated members of the peaceful Occupy Wall Street movement as domestic terrorists , while failing to inform Occupy activists of a nationwide assassination plot against them .
