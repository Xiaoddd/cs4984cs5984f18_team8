CreditCreditJoshua Bright for The New York Times By Marc Santora Jan. 19 , 2017 On the eve of the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president of the United States , thousands of protesters and a group of Hollywood celebrities took to the streets in New York City in what was meant to be a show of unity and a prelude to what organizers hoped would be a weekend of dissent around the country . On Thursday , with his presidency hours from becoming reality , they rallied near Central Park , in the shadow of another one of the many skyscrapers bearing the Trump name . Many said they had a personal fear of the president-elect . To Ms. Reid , that seemed like an opportunity . She also said that she doubted Mr. Trump would find the White House to his taste . Somewhat unexpectedly , the election of Mr. Trump has been a political boon to Mr. de Blasio , who campaigned for Hillary Clinton and disagrees strongly with most of the major policy proposals set forth by president-elect . His public statements have been more oppositional than those of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo , also a Democrat , who has similarly staked out a position as a Trump opponent , although somewhat less directly . Neither New York leader will attend the presidential inauguration , but only Mr. de Blasio planned to attend a rally like the one on Thursday night that , for many involved , might be better described as a protest . Mr. Phillips , however , acknowledged that others present on Thursday night might be more pointed in their remarks . Indeed , outside Trump International Hotel and Tower near Columbus Circle , the voices were often anything but moderate . Nearly an hour before the rally even started , dozens of demonstrators had gathered to voice their discontent with the incoming administration . Jawanza Clark , a professor at Manhattan College , also hoped that the rally would serve as a potent image of resistance to Mr. Trump . Refuse Fascism has also been holding daily marches this week throughout the capital starting on Saturday , when hundreds of protesters mixed with late night revelers on U Street .
