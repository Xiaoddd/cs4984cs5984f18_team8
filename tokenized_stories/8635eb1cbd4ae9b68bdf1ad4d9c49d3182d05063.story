I Agree Disagree Update privacy choices News North Dakota officials hope to quell pipeline protests with fines By Terray Sylvester Reuters November 29 , 2016 , 11:56 PM GMT A woman washes dishes in the Oceti Sakowin camp in a snow storm during a protest against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation , near Cannon Ball , North Dakota , U.S. November 28 , 2016 . Earlier , officials had warned of a physical blockade , but the governor 's office backed away from that . A spokeswoman from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe was not immediately available for comment . The 1,172-mile -LRB- 1,885 km -RRB- pipeline project , owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP , is mostly complete except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe , a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River . Thousands of people are protesting at camps located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land , north of the Cannonball River in Cannon Ball , North Dakota . The main protest camp is called Oceti Sakowin , near Cannon Ball . We 're moving in and out of the camp at will . So people should n't be afraid of coming and supporting the water protectors .
