Monkeywrenching Security Zines Read . Distribute . Fallen Warriors Obituaries to fallen warriors . Journal . Kanahus Manuel , a spokesperson for the activist group Tiny House Warriors , was arrested by the RCMP after allegedly defying an eviction order from the BC Parks service that was delivered on Thursday . The statement adds the territories were never surrendered to a Canadian government . Dawn Roberts with the B.C. RCMP said members went to North Thompson Provincial Park to meet with the protesters and discuss the eviction notice . Snutetkwe Manuel said her sister has been charged with mischief after the group refused to leave the park , although Roberts did not confirm that formal charges have been filed . An RCMP statement said Manuel was released from custody late Saturday afternoon on a series of conditions and a promise to appear in court at a later date . Additional members of the protest were told they could leave the park on their own or be arrested themselves . Manuel said the RCMP and BC Parks service have no jurisdiction in the park . Manuel said there were around six other protesters with her sister when she was arrested , including two village Elders . She subsequently recorded and posted a video to her Facebook page of a conversation with two RCMP officers who stopped her from entering the campsite , which she said was to help her mother pack up . The protest had originally begun as a three-day tattooing ceremony running from July 6 to 9 and grew into a Trans Mountain blockade by July 11 . Roberts said that she did not know precisely why the eviction order was filed by BC Parks , but did say the tattooing ceremony forced the closure of the park and cancelled reservations for campers . Kanahus Manuel responded earlier this week , saying her people have been inconvenienced by colonialism for over 150 years . Journal Collective . Please consider subscribing today .
