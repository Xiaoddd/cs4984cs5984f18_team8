Now , in two separate instances on two different days , members of what is apparently a separate group called VeteransRespond were busted for drugs . The four occupants included Matthew Crane , co-founder of the VeteransRespond group which is known to be at the Dakota Access Pipeline protest camps . One of the occupants turned over a smoking device identified as a pipe used to ingest marijuana . At that point , all occupants and their luggage were removed from the vehicle and searched by the K-9 . Crane acknowledged that possession of marijuana is illegal in North Dakota . He was cited for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia . On Feb. 9 , Mobridge , South Dakota Police Department arrested two individuals also associated with VeteransRespond after performing a traffic stop for a Michigan-plated vehicle . During the stop , the officer recognized signs of criminal activity and consent to search was denied . A K-9 unit was deployed and while doing an exterior search , the K-9 positively alerted and indicated drug odor . A search of the vehicle revealed the driver and passenger were in possession of Hash oil , which is considered a controlled substance in South Dakota . The car and protester gear were also confiscated and placed into evidence by the Mobridge Police Department . The VeteransRespond members , Graeme Cabrera and Travis Biolette , were taken into custody and taken to the Walworth County Jail in Selby , SD . This photo was included with the Morton County release . Veterans Stand , meanwhile , has raised over a quarter of a million dollars as of the time of publication .
