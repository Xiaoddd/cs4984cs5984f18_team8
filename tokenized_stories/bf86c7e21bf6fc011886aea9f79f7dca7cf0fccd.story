Nope . We live in a Native American-heavy state , so Arizona state politicians give Native American policy a little more thought , but it 's still often seen as negative . ASU is home to many Native American students from various tribes , best represented by the multi-tribe American Indian Council . Data collected by New York Times and the U.S. Census Bureau . For too long , there has seemed to be longstanding apathy concerning Native Americans . I know this personally from living almost all of my life in Massachusetts , where we punished a man who advocated for infecting Native Americans with smallpox blankets by naming a town after him . On the surface , the Dakota Access Pipeline is a near-1200 mile-long oil pipeline going from North Dakota to Illinois , which would be a more cost-effective way of transporting crude oil , as opposed to shipping barrels by train . Data collected by New York Times and the U.S. Census Bureau . To Native American and environmental leaders , the project would contaminate local drinking water of Missouri River , which is the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux , a local tribe of about ten thousand with a reservation that straddles the Dakotas , as well as pass through and likely destroy Native American burial sites and sacred places . This goes with a longstanding American tradition of not caring about the people who have been here far longer than any of us . Sophia Giolitti , a freshman exploratory major , said she is very strongly against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . Lehi Sanchez , of the Navajo Nation , is on a break from ASU but will return as a sociology senior . He felt so strongly in his opposition to the Pipeline , he ventured down to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota to go to the ground zero of opposition against the pipeline . Sanchez was not optimistic about the way policy was shaping up for Native Americans in the U.S. . He particularly pointed to Standing Rock as well as recent alleged attempts , including Utah , to give Native American land over to private corporations . Nowadays , the vast atrocities that have occurred against the indigenous people of the Americas is finally starting to break into the public discourse , especially among Millennials . It seems like every Columbus Day , I see more and more people talk critically about our history , and facing an unwelcome truth : the U.S. committed atrocities too , ones that many say verged on genocide . Under President Trump , that stance only became clearer . Keep letters under 300 words and be sure to include your university affiliation . Anonymity will not be granted . All rights reserved .
