Mr. Martinez had been summoned to appear on Wednesday March 1 , as a witness before a grand jury in Bismarck , ND . The putative subject of the investigation is the November 20 incident on Backwater Bridge , and in particular , the injury to Sophia Wilansky , who nearly lost her arm from being struck at close range by a law enforcement projectile . Federal grand juries are panels of citizens investigating a federal crime . The proceedings are secret , and the grand jury has broad power to compel testimony on a range of issues even outside of , and unrelated to the ostensible focus of the investigation . The subpoena was withdrawn just as WPLC lawyers were moving to quash on First , Fourth , and Fifth Amendment grounds , as well as on a statutory prohibition against propounding a subpoena on the basis of unlawful electronic surveillance . The office of the federal prosecutor declined to elaborate on the reasons for , or future implications of the decision to withdraw the subpoena . WPLC considers this grand jury to be one piece of a broader effort to criminalize Water Protectors and to unfairly target individuals in an effort to divide the movement . Water Protectors who are contacted by law enforcement or served a subpoena are encouraged to contact the Water Protector Legal Collective for advice and representation . Water Protector Legal Collective -LRB- WPLC -RRB- provides on-the-ground legal representation and coordination for Water Protectors engaged in resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock , ND in partnership with the National Lawyers Guild -LRB- NLG -RRB- .
