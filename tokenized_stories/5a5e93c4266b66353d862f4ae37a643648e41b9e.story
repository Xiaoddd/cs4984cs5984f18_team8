The Mother Jones committee also intends to celebrate the achievements of the suffragette movement and the 100th anniversary of the right of women to vote , which took place in the 1918 election .

Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was born in Kanturk in 1877 , and went on to spend a lifetime fighting for the rights of women , including the right to vote until her death on 20th April 1946 . In an extraordinary coincidence , during a visit to America in 1918 , Hanna Sheehy Skeffington had shared a speaking platform in San Francisco with Mother Jones . The two Cork-born women met and spoke together at this meeting on April 16th 1918 . Professor Louise Ryan , a native of Cork , is professor of Sociology at the University of Sheffield , who has published extensively on the suffragette movement .
