Nor could I have been more angry at the kid glove leniency given to a group of armed militia who were occupying Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon at the same time . The different treatment of the two groups could not have been more stark . The fact that the Water Protectors were fighting a battle that effects millions of those who depend upon the Missouri River ; that they were camping out in the depth of a South Dakota winter , and that they were met by violence as if they were terrorists of the first order . Then we have a heavily armed militia that takes over -LRB- and shuts down -RRB- a national refuge and who are staying inside with all of the conveniences . They essentially hold an entire city hostage , and yet except for one member who seemed bent on martyrdom , the barely got a slap on the wrist . Clearly race was at play , but there was a much deeper narrative . On the one hand you have primarily indigenous people standing up peacefully to protect something -LRB- s -RRB- that are sacred from corporate investors who are up to their necks in environmental destruction . There are few extraction and processing activities more environmentally devastating than tar sands . The further dispute the standing of any law that supersedes their own . Today the tribes fight on for all of us , and for their own survival . After shooting like a nova onto the global scene , the cone of silence has once again descended . Remember Standing Rock . Be informed . Spread the word . Do not let them stand alone under an enforced invisibility . Jennni Monet At the height of the movement at Standing Rock , Indigenous teens half a world away in Norway were tattooing their young bodies with an image of a black snake . Derived from Lakota prophecy , the creature had come to represent the controversial Dakota Access pipeline for the thousands of water protectors determined to try to stop it . It was a show of international solidarity between the Indigenous Sami and the Lakota . The backstory can be told simply . Temporary communities of thousands were created on the reservation borderlands in nonviolent resistance against the crude oil project . Police arrested more than 800 people , and many water protectors faced attack dogs , concussion grenades , rubber bullets , and , once , a water cannon on a freezing night in November . Last February , armored vehicles and police in riot gear cleared the last of the encampments . Oil now flows through the pipeline under the Missouri . But this Indigenous-led disruption , the awakening resolve that was cultivated at Standing Rock , did not dissolve after February . Rather , it spread in so many different directions that we may never fully realize its reach . The spirit of resistance can easily be found in the half-dozen or so other pipeline battles across the United States . To be sure , post-colonization has always demanded acknowledgment of Indigenous autonomy . He wanted to remind the world that European colonizers had honored Iroquois Confederacy nationhood upon entering treaty agreements under the two row wampum . The story of White Clay , Nebraska , is indicative . There , another fight for justice was mounting , for families living on the neighboring Pine Ridge Indian Reservation . This one focused on a decades-long dispute over beer sales targeted at Native American customers mostly prone to alcohol addiction . Demands turned to broader issues : investigation of dozens of unsolved crimes in White Clay against Native Americans . Matthew had been caretaker of one of the main communities at Standing Rock , and he settled right in at Camp Justice at the edge of Pine Ridge . For all the momentum that the resistance at Standing Rock brought , the Indigenous rights movement in the 21st century faces increasing challenges . Tribal nations tread cautiously under the administration of Donald Trump . Internationally , the militarized protection of extractive energy projects and theft of land persist , despite glaring media attention paid to the rising number of Indigenous peoples killed or jailed for their activism in the face of it . The difference of opinion between the two leaders is a conflict that often lies at the heart of tribal community : protecting the Earth or protecting the Indigenous peoples . Clean up efforts at site of Keystone Pipeline spill in South Dakota -LRB- Greenpeace -RRB- On the eve of Thanksgiving 2017 , when the Keystone pipeline ruptured and spilled 210,000 gallons of oil in neighboring South Dakota , the newly elected Faith remained notably silent while water protectors responded with outrage , most loudly , closest to home . Like Archambault and other tribal leaders , Frazier was arrested for participating in the Standing Rock occupation . Leadership in the Indigenous world is not only a difficult balance , but also dangerous . In July , she survived an attack by a group of assailants wielding machetes . Just weeks earlier she had been named the new leader of the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras , the nonprofit organization formerly led by her mother . Meantime , the organization Global Witness reports that it has never been deadlier to take a stand against companies that steal land and destroy the Earth . In 2016 , the watchdog group found that nearly four activists a week are murdered fighting against mining , logging , and other extractive resource development . As disturbing as this reality is , it is unsurprising then to recall the military-style violence at Standing Rock : the rows of riot police pointing their guns at unarmed activists standing in the river ; tanks shooting water in freezing temperatures at a crowd of people gathered on a bridge . In this one regard , Standing Rock was not unique in the world . It had become crucially important . Sustaining this awakening is the next great task . Climate change poses one of the most serious reminders of why the sacred fires ignited at Standing Rock must continue to burn : Indigenous peoples and their knowledge and value systems matter . The girl who once tended cattle in the region of Chad bordering northeastern Nigeria has now become a bridge for her people and government officials making decisions impacting the fragile ecosystem of Lake Chad , the lifeline for the Mbororo . Jannie Staffansson , a representative of the Saami Council , wants what Chief Deskaheh had petitioned to the League of Nations nearly a century earlier : sovereign recognition for Indigenous Peoples on an international scale . She paused to check the Snapchat account she had been using to engage with a young Sami audience while at COP , a demographic similar to the teens who got tattoos of the black snake .
