In a 2-1 ruling , the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -LRB- FERC -RRB- did not properly analyze the climate impact from burning the natural gas that the project would deliver to power plants . The case concerns the Southeast Market Pipelines Project , which is meant to bring gas to Florida to fuel existing and planned power plants . The Sierra Club sued FERC following its 2016 approval of the project . The environmental group brought a series of objections to the project and its environmental review , but the court denied all of the objections except the one focused on greenhouse gas . Judge Janice Rogers Brown , another Bush nominee , dissented from the ruling , arguing that FERC does not have the authority to take action to reduce the greenhouse gas impact of pipelines it approves , so it is not obligated to analyze some impacts .
