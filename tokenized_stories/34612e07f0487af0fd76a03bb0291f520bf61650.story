Trumps are not conservatives . What makes them trumps is not what they believe , but how they believe it . They hold on to their beliefs like know-it-alls , with a lock-tight grip shrouded in multiple layers of seemingly impenetrable , defensive , Teflon-coated armor that allows them to act like they 're right about everything , and everyone else is wrong about everything . There are chinks in that armor . You just have to know how to find them . Here are some factors to consider . 1 . Not fighting is a good idea when possible . You may be able to subdue them , which is why sometimes it 's worth trying . In such cases , play to your audience and not the trump . But also , pay attention to the costs of having an audience . Trump typically mistake fake reasons for real reasons . It can be stated in the form of a variation on the serenity prayer : Grant me the patience to reason with the receptive , the impatience to give up on the unreceptive , and the wisdom to know the difference . You need the wisdom , because reasoning with the unreceptive and not reasoning with the receptive will both leave you feeling dirty . They would prefer you believe they are reasonable , but short of that , they 're happy enough to keep you in doubt . Just do your best to guess carefully . 6 . Fight fire with fire : If you decide someone is a trump , shift attention to a higher moral goal : Making her leave the engagement disappointed . Drop your concerns about being kind , receptive , generous or giving her the benefit of the doubt . In the service of that higher goal , be ready to fight fire with fire , to go after her cunningly with whatever it takes to shake her . Do n't try to shame her morally . She 's proud of her naughty-girl immorality . To her , it 's a badge of honor . And do n't hold yourself to the same moral standard you set for dealing with the reasonable . This is different . 7 . Be tenacious : Trumps win debates by controlling them . Indeed , the Donald controlled the debate seamlessly throughout the campaign season . Never once did he let someone else decide what he would talk about or set the ground rules for the debate . If you try to stay honorable by responding to a trump 's questions and challenges , he 'll whip you around like bull whips a bull rider . Pick a point and stick with it . Never let him off the hook . If he asks questions -LRB- which are more like attacks dressed up as questions -RRB- ignore it and ask a question back . Pretend he never asked you and keep on him about how he refuses to answer your question . 8 . Mark your place : Trumps are slippery . Instead , play it up a level , character assassination for character assassination . The trump will likely reinforce your argument by responding in a way that confirms your accusation . 10 . Recognize that the trump is familiar with them all and is fully loaded with his know-it-all reactions . So you have to out-maneuver him , hitting him with surprising responses . To make any communication effective , you need discipline . Nowhere is that more important than with a trump . 11 . Murmur truth to power : The know-it-all sets you up to get agitated and unstable . That way she disqualifies you for getting emotional . Stay calm , confident , laconic , laid back , even glib . Keep breathing . Let her talk and talk little . The less you say , the less of a surface you present for her to pick apart with her know-it-all formula . Master communicators know not to lean into a conflict . Leaning back forces the other person to lean in off her grounded center . Simply assume that he is , and go from there . He will likely try to defend himself , arguing that he is n't a know-it-all , which puts him on the defensive . 13 . Give them a taste of their medicine : Follow their logic and pretend you embrace their assumptions . You 're one of those no-compromise , look-out-for-number-one guys . It 's a dog-eat-dog world and you 'll be damned if you 're going to tie your hands by compromising to accommodate others . That 's why you support Trump . He 's your kind of guy . Nothing matters but winning the game . They 're fighting two battles , to win and stay politically correct . You 're just fighting to win . Anyone could make it . 15 . Argue like it 's 2020 : We learned something very important in this election : Many Americans ca n't distinguish between opinions and reality . For these gullible Americans , the real test of honesty is insistence . To them , the more insistent you are in your opinions , the more honest you are about reality . Which is total BS of course . So do n't play into it . Do n't let someone think he can win a debate through insistence and do n't try to out-insist him . Calmly note that only time will tell . Reality wins all debates in the end . You and he are placing different bets about how reality will play out . None of these approaches guarantee success .
