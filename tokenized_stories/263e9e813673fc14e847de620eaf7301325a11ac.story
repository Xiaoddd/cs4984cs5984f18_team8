The area is in a flood plain and must be clear of buildings and people who have been illegally camping to protest the nearby Dakota Access Pipeline . At 2:00 pm everyone is to be off the Corps land where the camp was established months ago . Some of the protesters are vowing to resist efforts to move them . The state has a program in place to give anyone wishing to leave peacefully ahead of the deadline a hotel room voucher , food and other supplies , as well as a bus ticket home . Conditions in the camp are filthy , as I wrote yesterday , the result of thousands of people camping in the middle of a field with little in the way of responsible sanitation services . The cops who will eventually go into the camps are receiving hazmat training . Meanwhile , the protesters are setting fires . Fires at the protest camp this morning . Leadership will be assessing the situation on an hour-by-hour basis with the hopes of avoiding a major conflict . But as all this builds up , we should remember that any resistance at the camp is not sanctioned by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . The Standing Rock Tribal Council also issued a resolution on January 22nd ordering the evacuation of the camps .
