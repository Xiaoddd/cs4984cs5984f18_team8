Jim Carlson , Nebraskan farmer As environmentalists we often get criticized for not talking about solutions enough . The reality , however , is far from that portrayal , and those fighting the Keystone XL tar sands pipelines are making that point glaringly clear . Landowners and tribal members are joining together to build solar projects directly in the path of the proposed pipeline . While TransCanada wants to build projects that would harm the land , pose ongoing dangers to the water supplies of millions of Americans , and devastate tribal lands , these stewards are building the solutions they want to see Nebraska and the country embrace . On Tuesday , I had the opportunity to see these projects first hand . Greenpeace Canada Solar - and wind-powered barn In 2013 , landowners , tribal members and volunteers came together to build a solar - and wind-powered barn on land directly inside the proposed TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline route . It is already producing energy , and for TransCanada to build its dirty oil pipeline , it would have to tear down clean energy to do it . Greenpeace Canada Solar XL While TransCanada continues to push its destructive project , landowners are back at it again , planning to build more solar projects , right in Keystone 's path , throughout the state . The first of the latest round of solar installations is already up , and just yesterday landowner and farmer Jim Carlson received approval to plug the clean energy it will produce directly into the Nebraska power grid . Greenpeace Canada These groups are leading their opposition with solutions . Showing the world the type of energy we know we need to be producing and focusing on . We need energy sources that help protect the land , the water , and create far more jobs than a dirty tar sands pipeline ever will .
