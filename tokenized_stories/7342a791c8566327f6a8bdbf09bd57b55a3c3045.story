Photo : Balch & Bingham As if the jolt from the Oval Office were n't enough , Republican President Donald Trump is setting the agenda on the Dakota Access Pipeline on the legal front too . In a notice filed on Tuesday afternoon , the Department of Justice informed a federal judge of Trump 's new Dakota Access memorandum . The document at first glance appears to be merely a routine effort to keep the court apprised of the latest developments . But the notice in fact signals the changing of the guard at Justice . It bears the mark of Jeff H. Wood , an attorney and lobbyist who has been brought on board by Trump to set his administration 's new legal agenda . According to the notice , Wood is serving as acting assistant attorney general for the Environment and Natural Resources Division . While Wood did not offer anything in the notice beyond a printed copy of Trump 's Dakota Access memo from the White House website , his involvement speaks to an even greater development . He once served as environmental and energy counsel to Sen. Jeff Sessions -LRB- R-Alabama -RRB- , who has been nominated as Attorney General of the United States . Sessions does n't have much of a record on Indian issues . But he was forced to admit -- repeatedly -- during his confirmation hearing earlier this month that he opposes tribal jurisdiction over non-Indians even as he acknowledged that non-Indians contribute to high rates of violence in Indian Country . As counsel to Sessions between 2011 and 2014 , Wood provided legal guidance to his former boss not on Indian Country but on energy and environmental issues . Should he remain in a high-ranking post at Justice , he would bring a more corporate , rather than tribal , perspective to the Dakota Access fight . Indianz.Com SoundCloud : President Donald Trump signs Dakota Access and Keystone XL executive orders The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed the lawsuit last July in hopes of blocking construction on the pipeline near the reservation in North Dakota . The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe was allowed to intervene as a plaintiff in August . Among other issues , both tribes say they were n't properly consulted about the pipeline , which runs through territory promised to the Sioux Nation by treaty . The defendant in the lawsuit is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . The agency has stood by its handling of permit for the pipeline while at the same time has told the court that it never approved an easement for the final portion of the costly project . The wealthy backers of the pipeline were allowed to intervene as a defendant . They have since filed a cross-claim arguing that they were granted permission to complete construction last July . Trump , in his new directive , embraced that corporate line of thinking . He suggested that the Army Corps could approve the final portion of the pipeline without conducting any additional environmental reviews . Judge James E. Boasberg is presiding over the lawsuit . He has indicated he will call a hearing sometime in February to consider the cross-claim . A decision would come sometime afterward . But like everyone else interested in the case , he is keenly aware of the change in power in Washington , D.C. . He expects additional legal fights regardless of the way he rules on the cross-claim .
