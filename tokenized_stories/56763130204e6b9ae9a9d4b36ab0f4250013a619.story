FILE - In this Feb. 13 , 2017 , aerial file photo shows the site where the final phase of the Dakota Access pipeline will take place with boring equipment routing the pipeline underground and across Lake Oahe to connect with the existing pipeline in Emmons County near Cannon Ball , N.D. Environmental activists who tried to disrupt some oil pipeline operations in four states to protest the pipeline say they are n't responsible for any recent attacks on that pipeline . Starting Tuesday , tribal members and supporters plan to camp each day on the National Mall , with teepees , a ceremonial fire , cultural workshops and speakers . Native American leaders also plan to lobby lawmakers to protect tribal rights . On Friday , a march of about 2 miles is planned from the Army Corps of Engineers office to the White House , where a rally is scheduled . Organizers on Monday did n't immediately know how many people or tribes planned to take part . The White House did n't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday . The protest comes as a federal judge in Washington is weighing a request by the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes to halt construction of the last section of the Dakota Access pipeline pending the outcomes of their lawsuit seeking to stop the project . The tribes say that section of the pipeline , which will pass under Lake Oahe , a large Missouri River reservoir , will threaten their water supply , sacred sites and religious rights . The judge is expected to rule this week . The Friday march will begin at the Corps of Engineers office because the agency manages the Missouri River and last month gave the pipeline developer , Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners , permission to finish the project . The company expects to wrap up the work and have oil flowing this month . The two tribes feel they were n't properly consulted about the pipeline route , which the government disputes . They also they maintain their treaty rights were violated when the government changed its mind about doing further environmental study of the Lake Oahe crossing after President Donald Trump took office in January .
