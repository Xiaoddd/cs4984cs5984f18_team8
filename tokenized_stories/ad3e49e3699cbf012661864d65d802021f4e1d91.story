The Dakota Access protestors did not come out of nowhere , left-wing charities have been funding protests like these for years . Now in North Dakota , this same group is funding disorderly conduct and disrespect for the law . The group primarily responsible for the rally behind the Dakota Access Pipeline is none other than the Indigenous Environmental Network , a pawn of the left . Unsurprisingly , it has received funding from the usual fractivist funding suspects . As Vivian Krause a frequent writer for the Financial Post about this engrained corporate corruption writes , the left-wing opposition to pipelines extended to the Canada oil sands and the Keystone XL pipeline . These are The Big Five . That is exactly what they have done . Tides , with the help of big name charities and business men , has taken control of the debate on the pipelines and spun it into an indigenous issue . The protestors have burned tires , releasing toxic chemicals into the air ; dug latrines in the flood plain , washing waste into the Cannonball River ; and killed cows and bison , hardly environmentally appropriate at all . The Tides Foundation and its affiliates are not just paying for protests , they are building a franchise of illegal and reckless activity . North Dakota should send them the bill . With over 700 already arrested , 90 percent with previous records , these protestors have taken it to the next level of civil disobedience . Individuals have heckled police officers , tied themselves to construction equipment , and when forced to evacuate , set fire to their sites and became violent . These were the same tactics used in Canada by local tribal groups with great effect , often leading to property damage and arrests , and indicate an international strategy by these foundations to destabilize an entire industry . It need not be tolerated . There is no First Amendment right to destroy property . The foundations funding this protest can and should be held accountable to the entire state affected by this chaos . By creating a problem in South Dakota , these organizations have helped create a lawless area of senseless social justice advocacy which is costing the state millions . If Tides , Rockefeller and other foundations are willing to fund these protests , it is about time someone made them fund the cleanup .
