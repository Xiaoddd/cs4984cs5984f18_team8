Winds SE at 5 to 10 mph . Canadian pipeline company TransCanada filed an application Thursday for a pipeline route through Nebraska , following the same route that state regulators had approved in 2013 . The founder of Bold Nebraska , which led the opposition to the pipeline , pledged to again use protests and lawsuits to halt the project , first proposed nine years ago . While proponents tout the construction jobs and tax payments that will be generated by the project , critics say that much of the oil is destined for foreign countries and that few permanent jobs will be created in Nebraska . In 2015 , President Barack Obama denied a permit for the project to cross the U.S. border , prompting TransCanada to withdraw its application for a 275-mile route across Nebraska . But last month , President Donald Trump signed executive orders designed to revive the Keystone XL and end a stalemate over completion of the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota . Terry Cunha , a TransCanada spokesman , said that pipe for the unfinished portion of the Keystone XL already has been purchased and that 75 percent of it is from the United States . The company must show that the pipeline is in the public interest , according to a press release from the PSC . The commission now has 210 days to approve or deny the application , according to PSC spokeswoman Deb Collins . Local landowners , she said , will file objections to the project via the PSC review process . One argument will be that TransCanada should avoid disrupting additional land and build the Keystone XL parallel to an existing pipeline it completed in 2010 that crosses eastern Nebraska . She predicted that the eminent domain issue ultimately will find its way to the U.S. Supreme Court . The proposed route is the same one that was reviewed by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality in 2013 and approved by then-Gov . Dave Heineman . Girling said the route avoids the sensitive area defined as the Nebraska Sand Hills and that 90 percent of landowners on the route have already signed easement contracts . This application has been shaped by direct , on-the-ground input from Nebraskans .
