Tonight Some clouds . A stray shower or thunderstorm is possible . Low 68F . Winds light and variable . On the latter , I agree . However , supporting these pipelines and continued production of and reliance upon oil is shortsighted , greedy and dangerous . Once complete , the state department estimates the KXL pipeline will create only 35 permanent jobs . Though they create many temporary construction jobs , the fact that the Dakota Access Pipeline is already 87 percent complete means that ship has already sailed . A Prairie Rivers Network report shows that the DAPL threatens the drinking water supply of 27,382 people in Illinois alone , including part of Davis ' district . Pipeline leaks are not infrequent and have severe health , environmental and economic consequences . This week alone , pipelines in Iowa and Saskatchewan leaked nearly 200,000 gallons of oil . I hope Davis is considering what he will say and do when such an inevitable disaster happens here , ruining water and farmland , and threatening the health , safety , and livelihoods of his own constituents . Instead of valuing the investment of a Texas-based corporation over the lives of thousands of Illinois residents , it is time to think of the future and how to make Illinois a leader in renewable energy . I encourage all of Davis ' constituents to read two reports -LRB- available online -RRB- published by ISU scientists which detail the positive economic impact of investment in wind and solar energy in Illinois , and then call for in-district town hall meeting with Davis to address these issues .
