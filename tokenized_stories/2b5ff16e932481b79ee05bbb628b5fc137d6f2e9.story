According to the report last spring . organics in the intake are breaking down the membranes in the treatment process resulting in water that is n't even safe if boiled . The government 's solution was to bring in water once a week which residents pick up at the band office . Not only is access to clean water a human right , we have a moral responsibility to support the First Nation Peoples sovereign right to the Land and Waters . The power lies with us to bring attention to the damage our colonial lifestyle continues to inflict on the Land and its Peoples . - Isaac Murdoch -LRB- Bomgiizhik -RRB- Serpent River First Nation Made with the new Google Sites , an effortless way to create beautiful sites .
