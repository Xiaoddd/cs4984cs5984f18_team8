The situation took a turn for the ugly on November 20 when in subfreezing weather police and a tactical SWAT team unleashed water cannons , tear gas , rubber bullets , and concussion grenades in a military-style assault on 500 unarmed water protectors at Oceti Sakowin . According to sources at the scene , a dozen were critically wounded or sustained head injuries and were rushed to the hospital , while 168 were treated for hypothermia and pepper spray exposure on-site . One woman may lose her arm after it was torn open by a grenade and became frostbitten .
