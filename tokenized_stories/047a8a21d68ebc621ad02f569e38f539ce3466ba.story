DECEMBER 4 brought a significant and badly needed victory for the water protectors at Standing Rock confronting the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- . But it is important for our side to understand that there is substance to this latest victory , which gives us something to build on for the future . But ETP had a disappointing day in court . ETP is under financial pressure due to the resistance of the water protectors at Standing Rock hindering construction of the pipeline . An Indian Country Today article quoted investment writer Matthew DiLallo explaining why the Army Corps decision came at a bad time for ETP and Sunoco . Many water protectors are rightly fearful that ETP would press ahead with construction despite the Army Corps decision . After all , the company violated an injunction in place for over a month starting in the beginning of September , and it twice defied requests from the Army Corps to halt work over the past two months . And with the restructuring and merger in the works , the funders of DAPL are likely to want a project that has been government-approved and aboveboard legally . Trump is putting forward ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be the next Secretary of State . People are right to fear a coming Trump administration filled with corporate CEOs , fossil fuel energy tycoons and politicians connected to energy extraction who are proud climate change deniers . In the same ABC News article , William Buzbee , a professor at Georgetown University Law School , speculated about several options for Trump to pursue . One , Buzbee said , would be to allow the environmental impact statement ordered by the Army Corps to proceed and hope for a positive outcome for ETP , though that will take some months . Another option , according to Buzbee , would be for Trump to pressure the Army Corps to re-examine its decision and reverse course . But even if this succeeds , it would almost certainly lead to more lawsuits against the Army Corps or the administration . Michael Brune , executive director of the Sierra Club , pointed out that the nearly two-month delay before Trump takes office will also make things more difficult . And more important than anything else is the factor that pressured the Army Corps to act : the nearly yearlong mobilization against DAPL at Standing Rock and the widespread sympathy around the country with the struggle to stop the pipeline . However , if the environmental impact findings conclude the DAPL would have to be rerouted , it would be very costly for ETP to do this , given the long delays already . In fact DAPL was already rerouted once . The Missouri passes through most of North Dakota and is connected to another large body of water , Lake Sakakawea , which sits on the Three Affiliated Tribes land -LRB- the Mandan , Hidatsa and Arickara Nations of the Fort Berthold Reservation -RRB- . The Standing Rock Sioux have asked people to not travel to Standing Rock at this time due to harsh weather conditions . Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II has asked people to return home once the weather clears , and many will do so . Others will stay to hold the space , advance our reclamation of unceded territory affirmed in the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie , and continue to build community around the protection of our sacred waters . They will also keep a close eye on the company , which has drilled right up to the last inch it can , and remains poised and ready to finish the project . We have traveled far , given up much and taken extraordinary risks . We have endured serious hardships and physical violence , and shown courage , passion and determination in the face of impossible odds . We absolutely can not let this transition break us apart . We will also ask you to engage in the development of the Environmental Impact Statement to the extent that the public is invited to participate , and guide you through that process . But let us use this time to cut off funding for the project . Alongside this month of action , the movement needs to keep an eye on the growing tentacles of energy pipeline projects across North America , not to mention over water . Despite the fall in the price of oil , energy corporations , with the support of the U.S. and Canadian governments , want to ramp up production to sell to offshore markets . Solidarity among Indigenous nations is growing . This message of solidarity , expressed on a daily basis in the resistance camps at Standing Rock , is one we must remember in the many struggles ahead of us . The fight is far from over . We will keep our eyes on Standing Rock , knowing we may need to take up the call to return in the months ahead , and stand shoulder to shoulder with our Lakota sisters and brothers . We seem to be in new territory where the old rules no longer apply . However , this was the one that caught the fancy of the liberal bourgeoisie . What was learned from the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo is that high fuel prices and shortages can damage the careers of US politicians . This fact gave oil corporations extraordinary power . We remain at square one . Taxpayers fought every effort to invest in building a modern -LRB- Euro-style -RRB- mass transportation system . seen nips and tucks here and there , with wind and solar energy . This , however , proved to be unpopular among the middle class back in 1973 , and no efforts are made in that direction today .
