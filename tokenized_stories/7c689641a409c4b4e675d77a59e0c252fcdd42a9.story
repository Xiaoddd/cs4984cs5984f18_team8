Meanwhile , more than 100 opponents crowded into an overflow courtroom and then marched to a nearby downtown park for a rally in protest of the project , which has been in the national news spotlight . He said the company had met Iowa Utilities Board requirements for a state permit and authority to use eminent domain for condemnation proceedings in cases in which voluntary easements could not be negotiated . Iowa Utilities Board legal counsel David Lynch said the three-member panel had substantial evidence that the proposed pipeline met the criteria of providing a service to oil-dependent Iowans as a public convenience and necessity that was safer than rail shipments . However , Sierra Club attorney Wally Taylor said board officials ignored relevant evidence refuting the service and public-use aspects of a project that was transporting oil for a private business from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to an Illinois shipping terminal with no direct benefits to Iowans . Bill Hanigan , a Des Moines attorney representing land owners in six counties , said Dakota Access should not have been allowed to force landowners to sell easements by condemning the land against their will in a way that runs contrary to a 2006 Iowa law and recent court rulings in other states . Judge Farrell noted that farmers along the pipeline route still will have the use of their land even if the project disrupted their operations this year and maybe into next year as well . Hanigan , however , predicted the case would end up in the Iowa Supreme Court and maybe the U.S. Supreme Court before the matter is settled . If the landowners prevail , Hanigan said , the pipeline should be viewed as a trespass , and oil passing through the pipe would be a continual trespass that could result in monetary compensation or removal depending on future rulings by judges in the counties where condemnations were wrongly ordered . That includes 346 miles of pipeline in Iowa , crossing the state on a diagonal from northwest to southeast . If you have found an error or omission in our reporting , tell us here . Tell us here .
