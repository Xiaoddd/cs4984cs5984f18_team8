About 400 barrels of oil were spilt in North Dakota in 2011 , and again in South Dakota in 2016 . A spill of 5,000 barrels took place yet again in South Dakota on November 16 . The company still has not disclosed the cause as it continues the clean-up . The extension was approved by US President Donald Trump in March , following years of opposition from environmental groups and residents , and a rejection from the Obama administration . TransCanada said it will declare the fate of Keystone XL next month , among concerns about its viability with oil prices riding low . All rights reserved . This website uses cookies .
