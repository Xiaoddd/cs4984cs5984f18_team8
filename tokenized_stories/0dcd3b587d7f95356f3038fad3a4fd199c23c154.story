The pipeline company will decide by May 31 whether it will continue with plans to expand the pipeline from north of Edmonton to the coast in Burnaby . The Alberta premier is banking on being better served by working in Edmonton to keep the Trans Mountain pipeline on track than attending the meeting . It would be surreal and exceptionally tone deaf for anyone to think we could politely discuss pharmacare and cannabis when one of the players is hard at work trying to choke the economic lifeblood of the province and the country . Behind the scenes bureaucrats were working on a communique that would have been presented to the media following the meeting . That communique did not have the support of all of the provinces . The meeting was expected to formally deal with the issue of a national pharmacare plan and handling the legalization of recreational marijuana . But according to officials involved in the meeting , there were discussions behind the scenes between Alberta and other provinces that would have seen more aggressive language around resource support . The two politicians worked together in the mid-1990s and have been described as friends . But the disagreement over the pipeline have put a strain on relations between B.C. and Alberta . Our values are lockstep . Alberta has threatened to use the power against B.C. if it stands in the way of the Trans Mountain project . Please read our Commenting Policy first .
