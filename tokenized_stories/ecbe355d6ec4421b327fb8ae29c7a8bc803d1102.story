But fewer are sure that the changes will harm them personally . New data released by the Yale Program on Climate Communication gives the most detailed view yet of public opinion on global warming . The White House and Congress may do the opposite . Me . Mont. . N.D. Vt. . Minn. . Ore. . N.H. Mass. . Idaho Wis. . S.D. N.Y. Wyo. . Mich. . R.I. Conn. . Pa. . Iowa Neb. . N.J. Nev. . Ohio Md. .

But most do n't believe it will harm them . Part of this is the problem of risk perception . Global warming is precisely the kind of threat humans are awful at dealing with : a problem with enormous consequences over the long term , but little that is sharply visible on a personal level in the short term . Humans are hard-wired for quick fight-or-flight reactions in the face of an imminent threat , but not highly motivated to act against slow-moving and somewhat abstract problems , even if the challenges that they pose are ultimately dire . Texas and Florida are vulnerable to climate change , but residents are split on how much to worry about it . But the state shows a distinct north-south split in the level of concern over global warming , and it is not a simple Democrat-versus-Republican distinction , said State Representative Kristin D. Jacobs , a Democrat . South Texas favors Democrats , West Texas is decidedly more mixed , and the Gulf Coast in November 2016 was solid Trump territory . One thing is shared by those disparate parts of the state : They have felt the brunt of shifting weather patterns , including rising temperatures , coastal hurricanes and western droughts so long and severe that some West Texas towns now recycle wastewater for drinking . Roberto Suro , a professor of public policy and journalism at the University of Southern California , suggested age as a possible factor . Everybody talks about the weather . Only in some places . Me . Mont. . N.D. Vt. . Minn. . Ore. . N.H. Mass. . Idaho Wis. . S.D. N.Y. Wyo. . Mich. . R.I. Conn. . Pa. . Iowa Neb. . N.J. Nev. . Ohio Md. . Ind. . Del. . Ill. . Utah W.Va . Colo. . Kan. . Calif. . Va. . Mo. . Ky. . N.C. Tenn. . Ariz. . Okla. . Ark. . S.C. N.M. Ga. . Ala. . Miss. . Texas La. . But there are distinct regional patterns . In the West , much of which has been affected by drought and wildfires , residents are more likely to talk about climate change . New England states , and not just the liberals of Massachusetts and Vermont , talk more about the climate , as well , along with coastal South Carolina , which lies in a path many hurricanes have taken . But aside from Southeast Florida , which has put so much effort into making discussion of climate change a priority , much of the rest of the Atlantic Coast is less likely to engage in climate discussions , despite recent increases in tidal flooding . We would love to hear from you .
