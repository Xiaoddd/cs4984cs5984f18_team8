Booker cited the reports of inappropriate police tactics waged against water protectors . Last Sunday night and early Monday morning North Dakota law enforcement shot rubber bullets , tear gas and water cannons in frigid temperatures at some 400 water protectors on the Backwater Bridge , the site of a barricade on Highway 1806 . Booker is seeking prompt attention on the situation . Previously , he served as editor of the Native News Network . He is a resident of Grand Rapids , Michigan . Now the Army Corps of Engineers are telling the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe that the protest camp must be moved -LRB- vacated -RRB- come December 4th . I fear there maybe blood shed before this is over . Treaties mean nothing when Mazaska -LRB- money -RRB- is involved . It happened when gold was discovered in California in1849 and the Black Hills in 1874 . dwna 2 years ago thank you Senator Cory : for requesting this be investigated . from Sept. labor day they had brought in dogs to hurt the protectors the protectors tried Peacefully to persuade them to reconsider Leaving the Corporation to think of their family and the future , but the dog attached when the police all went into hiding action and allowed this incident to happen . these Water Protectors has been going through a lot or huge amount of Brutality from the Morton County Police force such as the Governor , the Sheriff , and the Police daily , CEO Kelsy has made a statement , they are going to put the pipeline in no matter what nothing is stopping them . but the worst of the worst of the attach these uniformed cops has done was when Sofia got her arm shot on Nov. 20 at 5:45 pm . they police made sure the protectors were all on the bridge and literally dehumanized the protectors and water cannon , mace , tear gas , grenades , concision , and there were some laughing as they were enjoying the brutality of doing that to the protectors. , they had the bridge blocked as to no leaving and the medic were unable to reach their protectors. , they even shot the medic with mace. , and hit with the rubber bullets. , they kept on shooting the drones , or blocking peoples cell phones of not showing the truth , the airplane was flying low without lights during the police brutality. , its a time of Great sorrow when they had done all this to the Water Protectors that were all unarmed all they had was a plastic lid to block the fires that were shot at them as much as possible . The whole Morton County Cops are intimidating them drastically in public of Bismark , if they step on a crack wrong the cops drag them beat them royal and incarcerate them , they did to Chris Jordan an Veteran for picking a flower . I imagine more as well . I am worried for our Protectors. , thank you my name is : as you see below. , dwna Linda 2 years ago dwna , In the world that I want live in , your comment about your experiences and what you have witnessed would melt away the cruelty from the iciest of hearts . I have been keeping myself informed of all that has been going on with DAPL and the Water Protectors . Stay strong , Linda Lena Toledo 2 years ago This request only evidences Washington politicians do not know Tribal Constitutions provides the authority to either curb or enforce actions within their tribal domain . The Senate on Indian Affairs should be monitored to assure the tribal governments are exercising these authorities . All Chairman Archambault has to do in this paramilitary standoff is to INVOKE the Exclusion Clause and the tribal council to endorse it . As it stands , this Chairman broke through the N.D Law Enforcement set boundary August 9th and was subjected to arrest . Robert Ferrari 2 years ago Thankyou Senator Cory : I am greatful for all of our elected officials that are standing up and realize that there is a problem . Thankyou Sir . I am ashamed of pres. America the free , explain to me what that means now . We know what you did and no , we will not vote for you in 2020 so stop the fake support effort . Susan Perry 2 years ago Thank you , Senator Booker - Someone needs to intervene and stop this horrific attack on innocent U.S. citizens . Everyone in the USA should be asking their Senators to do what this New Mexico Senator Martin Heinrich has done . Please send this article about Senator Heinrich to them over this weekend . It could have a huge effect , precisely what we need .
