The mainstream media has not covered this repression with the attention it deserves . To see a video of the militarized assault on one camp by police , see this link . And on November 25th , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a letter to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe warning that the military will forcibly displace the main camp of water protectors and allies on December 5th . For more than 200 years , since the United States government claimed ownership over enormous stretches of Indigenous territory with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 , the Oceti Sakowin have defended the Mni Soce against poisoning by resource extraction corporations , commodity transportation infrastructure , and its agents in the US Army Corps of Engineers and private resource extraction corporations . This fall Oceti Sakowin are protecting the river , and the water it carries , against its latest threat , the Dakota Access Pipeline . The pipeline , which Oceti Sakowin land defenders call the black snake , is being pushed by Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company , LLC to move crude oil from oil fields in Three Forks North Dakota to a terminus in Illinois , where the crude would be shipped to refineries . Land defenders are stopping the pipeline from crossing underneath the Mni Soce . The defense of this site has stopped the construction of the pipeline , blocked the shipping of crude oil , and therefore interrupted the accumulation of the wealth of the land from Indigenous nations by a capitalist corporation through colonial means . Alliance Against Displacement supports this interruption of capital accumulation . Alliance Against Displacement -LRB- AAD -RRB- fights capitalism and colonialism because we believe that in Canada and the United States both non-Native working class and Indigenous people can not successfully struggle against one force without struggling against the other . Our activist strategy is to engage and support community struggles across Turtle Island against displacement and dispossession . Most of our day-to-day community struggles face this two-headed snake in its capitalist form : urban -LRB- and suburban -RRB- displacement . Because of the pressing demands of these community struggles that occupy our time and therefore often dominate our political perspectives , we talk and write a lot about gentrification , mass evictions , police brutality and harassment , poverty , and the rule of private property as a dehumanizing force in the lives of our communities . From these mostly urban places in western Canada , on paved over but still embattled territories of the Coast Salish people , we declare that the fight to stop the Dakota Access pipeline is inseparable from our daily struggles . Rather than cancel the pipeline , the Dakota Access company redirected it through a sacrifice zone . What is currently happening at Standing Rock must be situated within a broad context and history . It also constitutes a specific and significant moment of conflict with colonialism , convergence between Indigenous nations , and solidarity from non-Native activists . Image credit : Adam Alexander Johansson Continuation of colonialism and the continuation of resistance The state violence at Standing Rock is a continuation of colonialism , and the resistance against it must continue . We oppose the building of this pipeline and all others that would cross Indigenous territories without free , prior , informed consent . We oppose the police violence used against the people and against the land at Standing Rock . We support all water protectors and land defenders . We honour and thank those who are putting their lives on the line to save the land and Mni Soce . We will continue to resist the continuation of colonial violence and accumulation . Alliance Against Displacement The Volcano is affiliated with the Alliance Against Displacement , a pan-regional anti-displacement network of local communities , organizations , and activists fighting displacement on the ground .
