But Nebraska landowners are at the forefront of legal challenges . The application may open up a new front in efforts to block the massive pipelines that have become conspicuous symbols of fossil-fuel clout . So far , though , the first line of opposition seems likely to come through the courts , even as indigenous groups vow to mount the same sort of protests that won a temporary stoppage of the Dakota Access pipeline , a sister project . Bold Nebraska , an opposition group , is planning a multi-pronged approach . It will launch a letter-writing campaign aimed at persuading the Nebraska Public Service Commission , an elected panel with four Republicans and one Democrat , to reject the pipeline . Bold Nebraska says any oil spills could pollute the Ogallala Aquifer , a water source that is vital to several midwestern states , in addition to other environmental damage . But it will mount its legal challenge on eminent-domain grounds , headed by a group of some 82 landowners who refuse to let the pipeline run through their property . The Commission typically responds to applications within seven months , or they can choose to postpone a decision for up to a year . If approved and constructed , the Keystone XL would run from the Canadian province of Alberta through Montana , South Dakota , and Nebraska , where it would connect with an existing pipeline to transport some 830,000 daily barrels of crude to Texas refineries . In addition , Native groups voiced frustration over what they see as a lack of adequate consultation over a project that crosses their lands .
