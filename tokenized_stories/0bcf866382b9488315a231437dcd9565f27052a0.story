The day after Thanksgiving , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers told the Standing Rock Sioux tribe that people camped at the Oceti Sakowin Camp would be considered trespassers on that federally managed land after Dec. 5 . Next came the snow , which is piling up across the camp as I write . If you want to pray from home , pray from home . If you want to send a letter of support , send a letter of support . Here are some things to consider as you decide what to do . People with skills like nurses and other medics are needed . Check with Oceti Sakowin camp or teams already on the ground to find out . And there is always work to do in the kitchen or chopping wood . If you do go to Standing Rock , remember that this is a movement founded in nonviolence and prayer . Respect the indigenous leaders there and follow their requests about how to behave at camp in keeping with Lakota traditions . But before you pack up your car and head out , consider the snow . You will need to be well-provisioned to avoid becoming a burden on the community there . Many of the organizers have asked White allies to consider whether the money spent to get yourself to Standing Rock would be better spent donating to the cause : covering mounting legal costs , provisioning an indigenous water protector , or helping the Standing Rock tribe pay for costs . You may be a more effective advocate where you are , where you have easy access to elected officials and banks ; at Standing Rock , access to phone and internet service is limited . Break up with your bank Banks are feeling the heat from the protests and from their own customers . One bank , DNB of Norway , has responded to pressure by divesting from Energy Transfer , the parent company of the Dakota Access pipeline . The ING Bank of the Netherlands , which prides itself on its sustainability and human rights stance , posted a statement on its website expressing concern about excessive police force at Standing Rock . If your bank is one of the direct investors in DAPL or one of the investors in its parent companies , Energy Transfer and Sunoco Logistics , ask them to withdraw support . Tell them you plan to close your account if their support continues . Photograph yourself cutting up your credit card , or share your letter on your social media networks . Consider planning or participating in a nonviolent protest at a bank branch or headquarters . Sacred Stone Camp has posted a map to find bank branches near you and recommends actions beginning Dec. 1 . Banks are risk-averse , and this pipeline project has become quite risky because of public relations problems as well as the oil price bust and reduction of oil extraction in North Dakota . Banks and investors may be hoping for an excuse to back out . Your action could help tip the balance . If your police force is there , call them home . Although the police staffing is changing constantly , some sheriffs have responded to public pressure by refusing to send deputies . Contact elected officials , write to local papers and local blogs , and contact local media to object to law enforcement involvement at Standing Rock . Remind President Obama of this and of the way his decision on DAPL will shape his legacy . You can also call Denis McDonough , White House chief of staff , at 202-456-3182 . Contact the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which is charged with making a decision about the permit to drill under the Missouri River . Tell them to reject the permit and order a full environmental impact statement . -LRB-703-RRB-Â 697-8986 Col. John W. Henderson Commander Omaha District , USACE 1616 Capitol Ave. , Ste. 9000 Omaha , NE 68102 Phone : 888-835-5971 or 402-995-2229 The Department of Justice should be concerned about the use of excessive force against the water protectors and alleged violations of civil and human rights . You can also call the Department of Justice Office of Community Relations , which offers mediation to communities facing racial and religious confrontations . Remember to speak politely and factually about your concerns . If you send an email , copy it to your social media account to inspire your friends , and to local media . Call out the media If media outlets are ignoring or distorting the news , call them on it . Send open letters and share them on social media . Ask major media to fully and factually cover the unfolding drama at Standing Rock . Donate There are many opportunities to donate cash or supplies . You can raise more money for these and others by organizing support events and fundraisers in your community . Invite people who are curious about the issues as well as people who are already passionately engaged . Make it a celebratory or prayerful event in whatever way makes sense to your community . Other options Phone a bank . Invite friends over to make phone calls and send emails . Resist extraction where you live . Resist but also renew . Remember that as you resist the dystopian world of extraction , Donald Trump , violence , and racism , you can also use your activism to build up the world you want . Resilience for the days ahead When I talk to people at Standing Rock , I feel the trauma and pain but also the resolve . The young people speak of being the Seventh Generation , the ones that were prayed for . And many speak of the suffering they are prepared to endure to ensure the next generations has the clean water they will need to survive .
