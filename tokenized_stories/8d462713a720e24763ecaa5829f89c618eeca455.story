It is natural to feel afraid during and after a traumatic situation . Fear triggers many split-second changes in the body to help defend against danger or to avoid it . Nearly everyone will experience a range of reactions after trauma , yet most people recover from initial symptoms naturally . Those who continue to experience problems may be diagnosed with PTSD . People who have PTSD may feel stressed or frightened even when they are not in danger . Signs and Symptoms Not every traumatized person develops ongoing -LRB- chronic -RRB- or even short-term -LRB- acute -RRB- PTSD . Not everyone with PTSD has been through a dangerous event . Some experiences , like the sudden , unexpected death of a loved one , can also cause PTSD . Symptoms usually begin early , within 3 months of the traumatic incident , but sometimes they begin years afterward . Symptoms must last more than a month and be severe enough to interfere with relationships or work to be considered PTSD . The course of the illness varies . Some people recover within 6 months , while others have symptoms that last much longer . In some people , the condition becomes chronic . A doctor who has experience helping people with mental illnesses , such as a psychiatrist or psychologist , can diagnose PTSD . Words , objects , or situations that are reminders of the event can also trigger re-experiencing symptoms . Avoidance symptoms include : Staying away from places , events , or objects that are reminders of the traumatic experience Avoiding thoughts or feelings related to the traumatic event Things that remind a person of the traumatic event can trigger avoidance symptoms . These symptoms may cause a person to change his or her personal routine . For example , after a bad car accident , a person who usually drives may avoid driving or riding in a car . These symptoms can make the person feel stressed and angry . They may make it hard to do daily tasks , such as sleeping , eating , or concentrating . Cognition and mood symptoms include : Trouble remembering key features of the traumatic event Negative thoughts about oneself or the world Distorted feelings like guilt or blame Loss of interest in enjoyable activities Cognition and mood symptoms can begin or worsen after the traumatic event , but are not due to injury or substance use . These symptoms can make the person feel alienated or detached from friends or family members . It is natural to have some of these symptoms after a dangerous event . Sometimes people have very serious symptoms that go away after a few weeks . This is called acute stress disorder , or ASD . PTSD is often accompanied by depression , substance abuse , or one or more of the other anxiety disorders . Children and teens can have extreme reactions to trauma , but their symptoms may not be the same as adults . In very young children -LRB- less than 6 years of age -RRB- , these symptoms can include : Wetting the bed after having learned to use the toilet Forgetting how to or being unable to talk Acting out the scary event during playtime Being unusually clingy with a parent or other adult Older children and teens are more likely to show symptoms similar to those seen in adults . They may also develop disruptive , disrespectful , or destructive behaviors . Older children and teens may feel guilty for not preventing injury or deaths . They may also have thoughts of revenge .

These can be read online , downloaded , or delivered to you in the mail . Risk Factors Anyone can develop PTSD at any age . This includes war veterans , children , and people who have been through a physical or sexual assault , abuse , accident , disaster , or many other serious events . According to the National Center for PTSD , about 7 or 8 out of every 100 people will experience PTSD at some point in their lives . Women are more likely to develop PTSD than men , and genes may make some people more likely to develop PTSD than others . Not everyone with PTSD has been through a dangerous event . Some people develop PTSD after a friend or family member experiences danger or harm . The sudden , unexpected death of a loved one can also lead to PTSD . It is important to remember that not everyone who lives through a dangerous event develops PTSD . In fact , most people will not develop the disorder . Many factors play a part in whether a person will develop PTSD . Some examples are listed below . Risk factors make a person more likely to develop PTSD . Other factors , called resilience factors , can help reduce the risk of the disorder . With more research , someday it may be possible to predict who is likely to develop PTSD and to prevent it . Everyone is different , and PTSD affects people differently so a treatment that works for one person may not work for another . It is important for anyone with PTSD to be treated by a mental health provider who is experienced with PTSD . Some people with PTSD need to try different treatments to find what works for their symptoms . If someone with PTSD is going through an ongoing trauma , such as being in an abusive relationship , both of the problems need to be addressed . Other ongoing problems can include panic disorder , depression , substance abuse , and feeling suicidal . Medications The most studied medications for treating PTSD include antidepressants , which may help control PTSD symptoms such as sadness , worry , anger , and feeling numb inside . Antidepressants and other medications may be prescribed along with psychotherapy . Other medications may be helpful for specific PTSD symptoms . For example , although it is not currently FDA approved , research has shown that Prazosin may be helpful with sleep problems , particularly nightmares , commonly experienced by people with PTSD . Doctors and patients can work together to find the best medication or medication combination , as well as the right dose . Psychotherapy can occur one-on-one or in a group . Talk therapy treatment for PTSD usually lasts 6 to 12 weeks , but it can last longer . Research shows that support from family and friends can be an important part of recovery . Many types of psychotherapy can help people with PTSD . Some types target the symptoms of PTSD directly . Other therapies focus on social , family , or job-related problems . Effective psychotherapies tend to emphasize a few key components , including education about symptoms , teaching skills to help identify the triggers of symptoms , and skills to manage the symptoms . One helpful form of therapy is called cognitive behavioral therapy , or CBT . CBT can include : Exposure therapy . This helps people face and control their fear . It gradually exposes them to the trauma they experienced in a safe way . It uses imagining , writing , or visiting the place where the event happened . The therapist uses these tools to help people with PTSD cope with their feelings . Cognitive restructuring . This helps people make sense of the bad memories . Sometimes people remember the event differently than how it happened . They may feel guilt or shame about something that is not their fault . The therapist helps people with PTSD look at what happened in a realistic way . There are other types of treatment that can help as well . People with PTSD should talk about all treatment options with a therapist . Treatment should equip individuals with the skills to manage their symptoms and help them participate in activities that they enjoyed before developing PTSD . How Talk Therapies Help People Overcome PTSD Talk therapies teach people helpful ways to react to the frightening events that trigger their PTSD symptoms . Based on this general goal , different types of therapy may : Teach about trauma and its effects Use relaxation and anger-control skills Provide tips for better sleep , diet , and exercise habits Help people identify and deal with guilt , shame , and other feelings about the event Focus on changing how people react to their PTSD symptoms . For example , therapy helps people face reminders of the trauma . It may be very hard to take that first step to help yourself . It is important to realize that although it may take some time , with treatment , you can get better . If you are unsure where to go for help , ask your family doctor . An emergency room doctor can also provide temporary help and can tell you where and how to get further help . To help yourself while in treatment : Talk with your doctor about treatment options Engage in mild physical activity or exercise to help reduce stress Set realistic goals for yourself Break up large tasks into small ones , set some priorities , and do what you can as you can Try to spend time with other people , and confide in a trusted friend or relative . Tell others about things that may trigger symptoms . Expect your symptoms to improve gradually , not immediately Identify and seek out comforting situations , places , and people Caring for yourself and others is especially important when large numbers of people are exposed to traumatic events -LRB- such as natural disasters , accidents , and violent acts -RRB- .

Next Steps for PTSD Research In the last decade , progress in research on the mental and biological foundations of PTSD has lead scientists to focus on better understanding the underlying causes of why people experience a range of reactions to trauma . NIMH-funded researchers are exploring trauma patients in acute care settings to better understand the changes that occur in individuals whose symptoms improve naturally . Other research is looking at how fear memories are affected by learning , changes in the body , or even sleep . Research on preventing the development of PTSD soon after trauma exposure is also under way . Still other research is attempting to identify what factors determine whether someone with PTSD will respond well to one type of intervention or another , aiming to develop more personalized , effective , and efficient treatments . As gene research and brain imaging technologies continue to improve , scientists are more likely to be able to pinpoint when and where in the brain PTSD begins . Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent , detect , or treat diseases and conditions , including PTSD . During clinical trials , treatments might be new drugs or new combinations of drugs , new surgical procedures or devices , or new ways to use existing treatments . The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe . Although individual participants may benefit from being part of a clinical trial , participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future . Please Note : Decisions about whether to apply for a clinical trial and which ones are best suited for a given individual are best made in collaboration with your licensed health professional . Doctors at NIMH are dedicated to mental health research . The studies take place at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda , Maryland and require regular visits . After the initial phone interview , you will come to an appointment at the clinic and meet with one of our clinicians . -LRB- search : PTSD -RRB- .
