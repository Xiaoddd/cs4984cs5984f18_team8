The rally comes as U.S. Bank drives a massive public relations campaign surrounding the hosting of the Super Bowl at U.S. Bank stadium in Minneapolis . U.S. Bank is at the center of a growing campaign by indigenous , climate and community groups demanding it lives up to its own promises to stop financing fossil fuel projects . Over the past year Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- ETP -RRB- has been responsible for violating Indigenous sovereignty by compromising and destroying sacred sites and burial grounds and enabling violence against water protectors by ETPs private security contractor , TigerSwan , who infiltrated and provoked violence at the nonviolent gathering in Standing Rock , ND . In light of Energy Transfer Partners continuing to put communities at risk by building new projects like the Bayou Bridge , Mariner , Rover and Trans-Pecos Pipelines , Indigenous leaders , environmental justice groups , and activists rallied on the eve of the Super Bowl LII at the U.S. Bank Headquarters to hold U.S. Bank accountable and to demand that the bank commit to their promises and end their partnership with Energy Transfer Partners . The rally began with a blessing by local Indigenous leaders and was followed by a speak out which included speakers from across the nation , including members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . Protesters then marched from the US Bank Headquarters to the Nicollet bridge . This was a nonviolent action , when asked to disperse by local law enforcement protesters complied . The following are statements from organizers and participants at the rally : Click here to watch the rally . We will not allow U.S. Bank or any entity for that matter , break their promises to the people , especially when it concerns the health and safety of our communities . Funding companies like Energy Transfer Partners is funding environmental disaster . U.S. Bank funds the extraction industry and allows government-backed corporate conglomerates to move into poor communities and create havoc . These camps are one of many institutions in society that contribute to the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women , men , and children . U.S. Bank did the right thing when they dropped support of Enbridge and the Line 3 pipeline . Bank promised not to finance the construction of oil and gas pipelines . But they have . To the environment and communities threatened by these pipelines , the difference is meaningless . Through Energy Transfer Partners , U.S. Bank profits from the brutality and incarceration of citizens protecting communities , destruction of private property , destruction of vital ecosystems , and the unfettered escalation of climate change in my backyard of Far West Texas and across the nation . Action , Indigenous Environmental Network , Earthworks , Bold Iowa , and Seeding Sovereignty . Speakers will include : Indigenous leaders from Seeding Sovereignty , Indigenous Environmental Network , Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe , Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . Visuals : Colorful banners , hundreds in attendance , street theater Background Water Protectors from South Dakota , Minnesota , Iowa , and beyond are coming to Minneapolis to demand that US Bank keep its promise to divest from oil and gas pipelines , including Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- ETP -RRB- , the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline . All three of these deals came after U.S. Bank touted its new policy , in April 2017 , saying it would not finance pipelines , in response to public pressure galvanized by resistance to ETP and DAPL at Standing Rock . Despite its new policy , U.S. Bank is financing many oil and gas pipeline companies , as well as oil and gas production companies . ETP violates Indigenous sovereignty , including compromising sacred sites and burial grounds contrary to NAGPRA and NHPA . ETP pursues eminent domain for private profit , forcing landowners to sign over easements . Landowners are consistently lied to about risks , and often do not receive the compensation they are promised . In 2016 , nine Iowa landowners and the Iowa Sierra Club filed a lawsuit that will be heard by the Iowa Supreme Court this spring . Bayou Bridge : On January 25th , construction of the Bayou Bridge Pipeline began . Bayou Bridge threatens drinking water . The pipeline route runs through Bayou Lafourche , the drinking water supply for the United Houma Nations and at least 300,000 people total . This potential impact remains overlooked and unconsidered . Bayou Bridge threatens wetlands . Wetlands are sponges for floodwaters . They are vital to a sustainable Southern Louisiana . A Louisiana state agency , the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority , is frantically working to save our coast . Bayou Bridge will worsen flooding . Degradation of wetland storm buffers will be significant . The Atchafalaya Basin also drains floodwaters . Acadia and Lafayette Parishes would be especially affected . This sort of water management is furthermore inconsistent with the Atchafalaya Basin Plan . Bayou Bridge is a takeover of private lands by eminent domain . This pipe would potentially use eminent domain to seize private property and create spoil banks of excess dirt in its path . These spoil banks block the free flow of water , flooding landowners and obstructing waterways used by fisherfolk and boaters . Bayou Bridge is not in the public interest . Our country already produces more energy than it needs . The fracked oil from Bayou Bridge will be sold to the highest bidders . The pipe would simply provide fuel for greedy interests . People are more important than profits . Bayou Bridge represents Energy Transfer Partners . Climate change is key . Our region already feels its effects . Since construction began in the spring of 2017 there have been over 100 instances of inadvertent returns . Over 30 private drinking wells have been contaminated and destroyed . . ETP has been found to be in violation of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection -LRB- PADEP -RRB- permits , using horizontal directional drilling -LRB- HDD -RRB- in river crossings areas where they had permits for open cut construction . The three lines that make up this project will transmit colorless , odorless , heavier than air combustibles that include butane , ethane , and pentane . Within the probable impact radius of these lines are 40 schools and several Environmental Justice Designated Census Tracts . The hydrocarbons in these lines do not contain odorant , making it extremely dangerous for the people who live , learn , and work near the lines , because they will be used in the production of plastics in Europe . Mariner is a prime example of the frack to plastic to waste journey of a hydrocarbon and the global impacts of the oil and gas industry .
