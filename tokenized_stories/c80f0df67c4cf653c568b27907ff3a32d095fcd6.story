We were facing Dakota Access Pipeline workers threatening us with baseball bats and wrenches , one of whom had only moments ago sped his large truck through our ranks . A helicopter had appeared and begun circling low over our heads . We eventually parted ways , not in peace but at least not in physical violence . We had distracted them from further construction of the project that threatened to spill oil in the Lakota water supply and headed back to our cars to take part in a march through the streets of Bismarck , N.D. . But amid all the movement , that moment stayed with me . I had come with a group of Catholic Workers for reasons anyone studying or teaching theology as I do might find obvious . The violation of basic dignity happening here defies the consistent refrain by the prophets and Jesus to do justice with an eye toward the exploited . We had been told white bodies could help by surrounding native ones , shielding them while they sought to protect their water . Its most recent manifestation is this pipeline . I have meditated on that profession of love several days ago from a grown man wielding a bat to threaten us . After our class argued over how we might know when these frictions came to possess the machinery of government , one student declared emphatically that if we could not already recognize that the friction had taken over , then we would never see it . It was hard to disagree , especially the day after our encounter with the pipeline workers when the police pepper sprayed a Lakota prayer service and those of us surrounding it , arresting whom they could . The idea directly influenced Gandhi and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , who added their own positive notions to resistance . Gandhi insisted that more than ahimsa -LRB- the Sanskrit word for causing no harm -RRB- was needed in the Indian independence movement . We ought to ask ourselves whether Thoreau was right . But some white allies who had joined their struggle , quite understandably , held no love for those who might mace them midprayer without warning . There was no clear consensus on the parameters for civil disobedience . Of course , it is not for others to dictate to the Lakota how to protect their water . And if the law of the machine , a law of military and economic profit , enacted by generals and tycoons , must be broken in favor of the needs of man , let the law be broken . I still churn that moment over in my mind : A man threatening us with a baseball bat told us he loved us . Despite the presence of agape , love between people who had never even met before , we had already organized ourselves in a violent way that ruptured any chance for human community . It seems clear that the moment for resistance had come too late , that something was allowed to flourish that never should have had the chance to sprout . Lines were drawn centuries ago , were never erased , and we had simply stepped into ready-made roles . We loved one another , but a system was in place encouraging hatred , and we could only navigate it awkwardly and poorly . But the question of whether we have a duty to be a counter-friction was answered a long time ago , and the situation at Standing Rock is merely a reminder that far too many of us are still refusing to answer it .
