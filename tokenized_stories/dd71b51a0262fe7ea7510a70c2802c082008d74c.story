A couple hundred miles south of Washington , back on friendly turf , Trump was defiant and coy . It was an appropriate venue for such a speech . In its four decades , the school has become an incubator of conservative Christian leadership and a regular campaign stop for Republican politicians hoping to win over religious constituents . Falwell had previously kept a somewhat low political profile , and his endorsement was a sign that Trump might eventually be able to win over conservative Christians . The students , however , were more ambivalent . Last fall , in the weeks before the election , a small group of students wrote a petition urging their fellow Christians to oppose to Trump . When Falwell mentioned Neil Gorsuch , the recently confirmed Supreme Court justice , in his introduction , the crowd cheered wildly . The crowd applauded in agreement . It was like he was back on the campaign trail , once again an outsider railing against the insiders , rather than an elected official who has already won and is now tasked with governing . Trump was relaxed , sitting back with his arms crossed during the pledge of allegiance and opening pomp and circumstance . Trump has come a long way since the last time he visited Liberty . Back in January of 2016 , he was still part of a crowded Republican primary field . The media widely mocked him for making a biblical gaffe on the grounds of one of the most conservative Christian institutions in America . Shortly after the 2017 inauguration , Falwell told reporters that Trump had offered him the position of secretary of education , but he declined to accept it . He still seems most at ease out of the White House , among his people , facing adulation and approval rather than policy decisions and a critical press . But unlike those early days of biblical fumbling , Trump has learned how to smoothly connect his anti-establishment message with religious praise . In his first commencement speech as president , he said it was God who brought him to the White House . But in electoral terms , it was people like those at Liberty , and their president is finally speaking their language . We want to hear what you think about this article .
