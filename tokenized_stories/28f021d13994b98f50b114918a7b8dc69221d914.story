BP is no stranger to pipeline problems in Alaska . Other owners include ConocoPhillips , Exxon Mobil , Unocal Pipeline , and Koch Alaska Pipeline . The pipeline system has had a long history of maintenance problems and worker safety complaints . At the time , BP temporarily shut down transmission of a portion of its oil from its Prudhoe Bay field to the continental United States , cutting off approximately 4 percent of the nation 's domestic oil supply , while it examined its pipeline system . Photographs taken by employees in the Prudhoe Bay drilling field this summer , and viewed by ProPublica , show sagging and rusted pipelines , some dipping in gentle U-shapes into pools of water and others sinking deeply into thawing permafrost . Marc Kovac , a BP mechanic and welder , said some of the pipes have hundreds of patches on them and that BP 's efforts to rehabilitate the lines were not funded well enough to keep up with their rate of decline .
