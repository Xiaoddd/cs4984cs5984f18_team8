By Stephen Feller -LRB- 0 -RRB- Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt , nominated to be the next administrator for the EPA , was ordered by a judge on Thursday to turn over more than 3,000 emails he exchanged with Koch Industries , other drill and mining companies and the Republican Attorneys General Association by next week . Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt , whose confirmation hearing for head of the EPA is scheduled for Friday , was ordered by Oklahoma County District Judge Aletia Haynes Timmons to fulfill public records requests for more than 3,000 emails by the Center for Media and Democracy . Pruitt 's office earlier this week turned over 411 of the emails , which are among documents requested by the group starting in 2014 . Democrats in the Senate have sought to have the vote on Pruitt 's nomination delayed until the emails have been received and reviewed because , they say , the communications may shed light on Pruitt 's view of the EPA and how he may run the agency . The CMD has sought access to the emails for the last two years based on concerns about the handling of energy issues in Oklahoma . During his nomination hearing , Pruitt suggested senators file public records requests after declining to provide the emails as part of his hearing . Democrats say that concerns about exchanges with Koch Industries , other mining and drill companies and the Republican Attorneys General Association , in addition to Pruitt 's contentious history suing the EPA , are relevant to the job he is likely to be confirmed for .
