The oil has formed a slick at least 12 miles long , federal environmental officials said . The spill occurred just after midnight on Wednesday in northern Kentucky above the confluence of the Kentucky and Ohio rivers . The U.S. Coast Guard , together with other federal , state and local officials responded to the spill . Workers are attempting to keep the oil from entering the Ohio River where it may contaminate drinking water downstream in the city of Louisville . They have set up a boom across the river to direct the oil into a lock and dam near the confluence of the two rivers . Skimming equipment is being brought in to remove the oily mess . No evacuations have been ordered , but local residents in Carrollton are warned about the strong diesel odor in their drinking water . Governor Ernie Fletcher toured the spill site Wednesday by helicopter . As chair of the Southern States Energy Board , which is working on an initiative to improve pipeline safety , he called for an assessment of pipeline safety and security . The pipeline is owned by Mid-Valley Pipeline Co. of Hebron , a division of Sunoco Inc. . A spokesman for the company said crews shut off oil flow about 10 minutes after they were alerted to the broken pipe by a remote monitoring system . The effect on wildlife and fish is said to be minimal . A safety zone has been established on the Mississippi extending from six miles north of the U.S. 190 Bridge to six miles south of the Interstate 10 Bridge . All vessels entering the safety zone are required to coordinate their movements with the staff of the Traffic Control Center who can be reached via VHF radio on channels 67 and 11 . The Traffic Control Center and safety zone were implemented when the Mississippi River reached a height of 35 feet , flood stage for the Baton Rouge area , and will remain in effect until the river has crested and begins to fall to safe levels . River conditions above 35 feet are more challenging for commercial vessels due to increased river flow and velocity . The Mississippi River is expected to crest at 39 feet about February 1 . Meanwhile , tugs will assist southbound vessels in the vicinity of the U.S. 190 Bridge and vessels entering and exiting the Port Allen Lock . The Coast Guard is restriction the number of barges and their speed through this safety area , and their travel will be kept to daylight hours . Vessels operating in the safety zone are required to be staffed by experienced pilots . They will remain in place for two to three weeks after the river crests as a precaution . Noting that the U.S. has lagged behind Europe and Japan in solar industry manufacturing and deployment , the industry wants Congress to enact sustained , annually declining tax credits for solar deployment on homes and business . Solar photovoltaics use semiconductors , usually electronic-grade silicon , to directly transform the sun 's energy into electric current . Solar would provide half of all new electricity generation by 2025 under this scenario . By 2030 , the U.S. solar industry could employ 260,000 people . The industry effort was supported by New Hampshire Republican Congressman Charles Bass . With natural gas demand and prices skyrocketing , much of the briefing focused on the role solar could play in easing the natural gas crunch . But 99 percent of California 's children do not enter these parks because the National Park Service has insufficient funding and staff , a new report by the National Parks Conservation Association -LRB- NPCA -RRB- has found . More than 50 education leaders across California have endorsed the NPCA report , reflecting the widespread bipartisan support for increased funding for America 's national parks . Although Congress has regularly increased funding to protect the national parks , the National Park Service budget has failed to keep pace with needs . As a result , education programs and staff are being cut in national parks across California and throughout the country , leaving park service educators without the necessary resources to keep up with growing demand from teachers , students , and parents , the NPCA says . The petition to the California Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- Cal-EPA -RRB- and the state Department of Health Services calls for immediate action to lower the amount of the chemical perchlorate allowed in drinking water . The petition urges Cal-EPA to lower its perchlorate safety recommendation to one part per billion -LRB- ppb -RRB- and set an emergency standard to accelerate cleanup . The state 's currently proposed standard is six ppb . The petition cites new data on perchlorate 's toxicity and widespread contamination of water , milk and food , plus a new state law requiring drinking water standards to take into consideration the health of pregnant women and infants , as reasons a lower level is needed . After issuing an emergency standard , state officials would be required to review the data and issue a final standard within 240 days . The groups urged state officials to immediately consider the study released earlier this month by the National Research Council -LRB- NRC -RRB- , and recent Food and Drug Administration tests that found perchlorate contamination of food and milk is more widespread than previously thought . Under a law signed last year by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , the state must review the effects of perchlorate on pregnant women and infants in developing a perchlorate standard . Perchlorate , the major component of solid rocket propellant , contaminates more than 350 California drinking water sources , including the Colorado River . In small concentrations it can interfere with the thyroid gland 's ability to produce hormones , resulting in a potential increase of learning disabilities and attention deficit disorder in children . The groups warned that the Pentagon and defense industry are pushing to allow much higher levels of perchlorate in drinking water - 200 to 350 ppb . The Department of Defense -LRB- DoD -RRB- , through the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program , will be funding demonstration projects for treatment of perchlorate in drinking water , starting this year . Multiple demonstration projects selected through a competitive selection process will be funded . The demonstrations will be conducted at selected public water supply utilities in southern California that have been impacted by perchlorate . The DoD says perchlorate should be cleaned up to a level of four to 18 ppb . Signatories to the petition submitted to the California Department of Health Services and Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment include : Environment California , Natural Resources Defense Council , Environmental Working Group , Sierra Club California , Clean Water Action , Center for Community Action & Environmental Justice , INSIST , and Citizens for Chuckwalla Valley . In its preferred alternative , the Bureau of Land Management -LRB- BLM -RRB- proposes to open over 90 percent of these public lands to industrial-scale oil and gas drilling , and drill over six times as many wells under the new plan as are allowed under the existing one , when drilling is already proceeding at a record pace . The BLM will be holding public meetings on the Great Divide management plan February 7 - 10 in Rock Springs , Baggs , Rawlins , and Laramie to accept public comment on proposals for the Red Desert . The Bureau of Land Management manages 4.7 million acres of public lands and minerals in this area under the Great Divide Plan . Over the past decade , the BLM has managed these lands almost exclusively for oil , gas , and coal extraction , and has done little to protect its natural resources , the conservationists say . Encampment River canyon is in the area that could be open for drilling . -LRB- Photo courtesy BLM -RRB- Under the new plan , sensitive big game winter ranges and migration corridors , important habitats for rare wildlife would continue to get only the token protection of seasonal restrictions , which allow industrialization of the most fragile areas as long as construction occurs during less sensitive times of year , the same approach that is being taken by the Alaska BLM to justify drilling environmentally sensitive areas in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska . And under the agency 's preferred alternative , important parts of Adobe Town would be opened to drilling , while potential wilderness in the Pedro Mountains and Wild Cow Creek would not even be considered for protection , the alliance says . The plan fails to protect almost 3,000 identified respected places that are important to Native Americans , archeologists , and trails enthusiasts , hundreds of which are eligible for designation on the National Register of Historic Places . Air pollution in the Great Divide area would double , threatening air quality in protected areas and increasing levels of acid rain , the conservationists warn . The comment period closes on March 18 . The alliance is urging as many people as possible to appear at the public hearings and is organizing ride shares and vans from northern Colorado and Wyoming to the public meetings . In addition , these parties have agreed to preserve an additional 4.1 acres of wetlands near Grafton Ponds , place deed restrictions protecting the remaining 25 acres of wetlands on the site , and buy six acres in a wetlands mitigation bank . A wetlands mitigation bank is a wetland area that has been restored , created , or enhanced , reserved , which is then set aside to compensate for future conversions of wetlands for development activities . The EPA cited J. Denbigh Associates , the property owner , and Howard B. Hankins , Inc. , a land clearing contractor , for unlawfully disturbing 2.5 acres of wetlands through ditching and filling activities in 1999 and early 2000 . The ditches were not stabilized , causing the erosion of sediment into Stoney Run , a tributary of the James River . The companies did not have a required U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit for the discharge of fill or dredged material into wetlands and waterways . The permit requirement is designed to minimize the destruction of these natural resources , which serve a number of critical environmental and economic functions , including flood control , water filtration , and wildlife habitat . The EPA also cited these parties for violating a Clean Water Act requirement that owners or operators of construction sites obtain a storm water discharge permit , including a storm water pollution prevention plan . These plans are designed to reduce contaminated runoff , which may contain pollutants such as oil and grease , hazardous chemicals , and nutrients . As part of the settlement , the parties neither admitted nor denied liability for the alleged violations . Radon is a radioactive , invisible and odorless gas that comes from the decay of naturally occurring uranium in the soil , and it can accumulate in homes and buildings at dangerous levels . Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the U.S. , with about 21,000 lung cancer deaths each year attributable to radon exposure . In New England alone , about 1,000 people die each year from lung cancer due to radon exposure . DEP provides a list of certified businesses that offer testing and mitigation services . Do it yourself test kits also can be obtained from many hardware stores and local health departments . All radon test results conducted in New Jersey are reported to DEP by certified companies performing the tests or that manufacture test kits . This data is used to classify municipalities into a three tier system according to the potential for identifying homes with indoor radon problems . The tier system classifies municipalities as having high -LRB- Tier 1 -RRB- , moderate -LRB- Tier 2 -RRB- or low -LRB- Tier 3 -RRB- potential for indoor radon levels . DEP will provide municipalities whose radon designation was upgraded to Tiers 1 and 2 with materials to develop an outreach program for homeowners . Activities to increase awareness about the need for testing include local proclamations , news flyers and presentations to community groups . For more information , homeowners can contact DEP 's Radon Section at -LRB-800-RRB- 648-0394 or visit www.njradon.org . A Massachusetts school district has been recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for its radon remediation work . The district 's efforts successfully reduced elevated levels of radon to well below EPA 's safety standards at the Swift River Elementary School where it was detected by testing in January 2003 . This goal includes paying attention to the ever-changing environmental challenges which face schools .
