Domestic Swt . He is based in Pittsburgh , PA. . The Bakken is a substantial source of crude oil , producing just under 1 million barrels per day . That oil has to be moved by rail or pipeline out of the state , where it moves to refineries either on the Eastern seaboard , or down to the Gulf Coast . But the extreme distances that North Dakota crude has to travel inevitably lead to conflict as pipelines run into local communities . That potential for conflict became very stark with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota . President Trump has suggested that the Army Corps of Engineers , under his control , will move quickly to approve the pipeline , although protestors will surely do their best to stop construction . If Trump is successful , Energy Transfer Partners will be relieved to put that controversy behind it . Upon completion , the Dakota Access Pipeline will allow North Dakota oil to reach Illinois . From there it will tie into existing pipelines that will allow the oil to flow down to Texas and then on to Louisiana . But at that point , the path forward gets rocky again , and this is where Energy Transfer Partners could run headlong into its next brawl with local communities . Energy Transfer Partners , along with joint owners Phillips 66 Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. , are proposing the Bayou Bridge Pipeline -LRB- BBP -RRB- , a 163-mile pipeline that will run from Lake Charles , Louisiana to a key oil hub just west of New Orleans in St. James Parish . The oil will end at a terminal owned by NuStar Energy L.P. , from which the oil could reach any number of customers , such as refiners along the Gulf Coast or be sent abroad as exports . In other words , if the Dakota Access Pipeline is completed , the Bayou Bridge Pipeline will be the last key link connecting a greater volume of North Dakota oil to international markets . The BBP will carry 280,000 barrels of oil per day , with the potential to expand up to 480,000 bpd . Construction is slated to reach completion by the second half of 2017 . It is home to endangered wildlife and also has a successful crawfishing industry . Because of this , there are signs that a popular resistance akin to the Dakota Access protests is starting to emerge . At a packed public hearing on January 12 , a raucous crowd filled with pipeline critics from disparate backgrounds spoke out against the project . The crowd jeered and hissed at former Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu , who testified in favor of the Bayou Bridge Pipeline . She now lobbies on behalf of Energy Transfer Partners . But Energy Transfer Partners notes that pipelines are much safer than the alternative of shipping crude by rail ; rail shipments are 4.5 times more likely to suffer an accident compared to pipeline , a 2015 Fraser Institute study showed . And the Atchafalaya Basin is already home to a spider web of old pipelines , the industry argues . This may seem like a local story , but so did the Dakota Access Pipeline until mid-2016 . Protests that delay construction have a tendency of blowing up the issue into a national flashpoint . Above and beyond the PR disaster that could await Energy Transfer Partners , real money is also on the line . Related : OPEC Commitments Push Iraq Towards Oil Export Deal With Kurds Protest can be dismissed as mere sideshows , but they can have a concrete impact . When financial analysts warn investors to steer clear of companies like Energy Transfer Partners because of the political risk , the public backlash to large infrastructure projects should be taken seriously . There are also broader implications for the oil and gas industry . Environmental groups have been battle-tested by the multi-year Keystone XL fight , having constructed an infrastructure around protesting , disruption and media relations . That was on display with the Dakota Access blitz , which ultimately spurred the Obama administration to block construction . The incoming Trump administration will likely make it easier for companies to obtain federal permits , but environmental protests are not going away . Even as the protests in the frozen prairie of North Dakota could be in their final act , the spotlight could shift more than 1,000 miles to the south to the swampy wetlands of the bayou .
