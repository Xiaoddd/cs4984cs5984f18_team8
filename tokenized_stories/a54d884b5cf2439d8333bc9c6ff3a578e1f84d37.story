And it requires evidence . Documents are a crucial part of that . We want to hear from you . Below are a few ways to contact us send us documents and other materials , safely , securely and anonymously as possible . Signal Signal is a free messaging app for iPhone and Android that provides end-to-end encryption for messages and calls . Signal does not collect any metadata regarding who you are messaging : the service only retains your phone number and the last time you accessed the app . Also : Messaging us on Signal does reveal your phone number to ProPublica . So in some situations , it might even be better to use a separate phone for Signal communications . WhatsApp WhatsApp is a popular messaging app owned by Facebook , which also provides end-to-end encrypted communications . Although the message contents are encrypted , the WhatsApp service may retain some metadata about who you are communicating with and when . As with Signal , your phone number will be revealed to ProPublica , so you may want to consider other options -LRB- or use a separate phone -RRB- if you are concerned about that . To contact specific reporters , see our staff list . Although plain email is convenient , if your information is sensitive we recommend contacting us using the other options first . You may also consider registering a new , anonymous email address in combination with PGP . Postal Mail Postal mail is an excellent , easy way to reach ProPublica securely . Mail your package or envelope from an unfamiliar sidewalk box instead of going to a post office . You can mail us paper materials or digital files on , for example , a thumb drive . You can also simply address it to ProPublica . SecureDrop Update , December 5 , 2017 : Our SecureDrop instance is currently offline while we upgrade our systems to ensure the safety of our sources . We recommend you use Signal , WhatsApp , PGP , or anonymous postal mail as noted above .
