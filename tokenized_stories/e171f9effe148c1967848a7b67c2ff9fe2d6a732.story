Medea Benjamin is an author , activist and cofounder of CODEPINK . It is with a heavy heart that I travel to Standing Rock to give thanks and serve meals to the water protectors who , in the freezing weather , have braved attack dogs , tear gas , water cannons , rubber bullets , percussion grenades and other forms of state-sanctioned violence . This Thanksgiving comes on the heels of a particularly heart-wrenching day , Nov. 21 , when over 150 activists were injured , receiving treatment for hypothermia , contamination by tear gas , and traumas from rubber bullets . One activist , 21-year-old Sophia Wilansky , will spend the holiday undergoing a third surgery on her shattered arm that was ripped apart by an exploding concussion grenade . The Standing Rock Sioux are steeped in that reality . READ : Dakota Pipeline Would Make Water the New Oil , Devastating All but the Rich The Thanksgiving break has brought caravans of people from all over the country to join this struggle for freedom and show our thanks to the indigenous community . There are also many solidarity actions you can take on your own : Donate to sustain the encampment for the months ahead . Tell the Army Corps of Engineers to deny the permit to drill beneath the Missouri River . Contact the banks funding the pipeline and withdraw your money . READ : Wall Street Is Prepared to Destroy Mother Earth Finally , as you celebrate this holiday with family and friends , take a moment to remember the history of genocide and dispossession our nation was founded on . With their heroic stand to deconstruct the Dakota Access pipeline , the indigenous tribes gathered at Standing Rock are also deconstructing Thanksgiving . And they are showing us a path for the future that should inspire us for the difficult times ahead : a future based on respect for Mother Earth and all species , cooperation , generosity , nonviolence , humility and love .
