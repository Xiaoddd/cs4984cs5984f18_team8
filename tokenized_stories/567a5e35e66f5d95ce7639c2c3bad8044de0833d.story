23 , 2018 12:31 PM EST Lake Oahe , the source of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe 's drinking water . A Fairy Tale , Say the Standing Rock Sioux By Susan Cosier Nine minutes . That 's the longest it would take to detect a leak and shut down the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- should the crude oil within begin escaping into the North Dakota prairie or the Missouri River . At least that 's what Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- ETP -RRB- , the pipeline 's owner , says . This is just one of the problems examined in a new report recently submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which last February approved DAPL 's controversial route snaking less than a mile from the tribe 's reservation and upriver of tribal lands . In more than 300 pages , the document details many issues that the government never fully investigated when conducting its environmental review in 2016 . The report , written by the Standing Rock Sioux and independent experts , delves into treaty agreements , the history of government takeover in the region , the inadequacy of ETP 's risk analysis , and how one accident could ruin land , water , and a way of life . Don Holmstrom , an author of the report who worked with the U.S. Chemical Safety Board for 17 years , says that after noticing a break , workers would first have to decide what steps to take to stop the oil from coursing through the steel , an often stressful judgment . Then they must find and close the emergency flow restriction devices one by one , which can take time depending on how much pressure has built up in the pipeline . Standing Rock Sioux tribe member Dave Archambault Sr.Dave Archambault Sr. . Of course , all that hinges on whether ETP realizes there 's a leak in the first place . In reality , oil pipeline leaks frequently do n't even register with control systems and operators ; a farmer will simply notice a growing stain darkening a remote field and call it in . According to records obtained by the tribe and its technical team , no one at the company would be able to tell something was amiss if less than 1 percent of the 600,000 billion barrels it transports each day was oozing out . He tells me over the phone that he 's currently gazing out over a frozen Lake Oahe , a reservoir on the Missouri River where the Standing Rock Sioux get their drinking water . ETP 's own documents state the company has to fly over the land near Lake Oahe every three weeks to look for spilled oil since so little foot traffic exists near the pipeline there . The Standing Rock Sioux and three other tribes continue to fight ETP in court . Ultimately they want the government to shut down the 1,172-mile pipeline that runs about four feet underground from North Dakota to Illinois . To do that , they need to document why a pipeline there is such a bad idea . In 1958 , the Army Corps flooded 56,000 acres of agricultural land and wooded lowlands on which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe once depended as part of the Oahe Dam project Lake Oahe is a result of that project . Holmstrom said that Oahe pools are so close to the reservation , and provide wetland habitat for so many species , that the Corps should have considered it an HCA , or high-consequence area -LRB- i.e. , a sensitive waterway -RRB- . Such a designation would have required a more thorough environmental review that identified risks such as potential drinking water contamination , the sickening or killing of wildlife , and the suffocation of vegetation -LRB- to name a few -RRB- . DAPL crosses beneath Lake Oahe just north of the Standing Rock Sioux tribal lands . That move further politicized the DAPL debate pitting industry against the tribe 's safety . The Corps granted the pipeline 's final permit a month later . He also required that an independent engineering company review whether ETP had complied with federal regulations and instructed the company to file an oil spill response plan . In the meantime , the oil would continue to flow at a rate of about half a million barrels a day . ETP submitted the third-party review and response plan in early April , even though the tribes argue they still have n't been fully involved in the process . The Army Corps will now meet with all four tribes before June 1 and then complete a new environmental review . Archambault , for one , hopes the tribe 's own report will help push the company to better protect the Standing Rock Sioux 's land and people from disaster , one way or another . The scorecard shows that 140 House members voted against chemical safeguards every time , while 149 members consistently voted for chemical safety protections . However , the action fund praised the lawmakers that bucked their party to vote for chemical safety , including Reps. voted for funding chemical reviews and against a farm bill that included pesticide safety loopholes . Florida Reps. A Preview of the People , Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule , two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Updated and reissued every five years , these guidelines are the nation 's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations . supply . These nominees will be well-known in their fields , and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers , academics and practitioners . part of the process is happening in real time . what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors . Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff , and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally . Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries . And here 's the first place you 'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition : rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected , USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first , soliciting public comments in the process . In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts , it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance . And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious . After the committee is announced in early 2019 , it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report . all appearances , the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs . though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable , plant-based diets have been all but stymied , there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle . Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance , including the meat industry , dairy industry , and sugar-sweetened beverage associations , as well as formula companies , which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers . -LRB- This may be happening in real-time , too . Exposure can be caused by contact , ingestion or inhalation . Short-term health effects can range from skin irritation and numbness to fever and headaches . Long-term exposure can lead to cancer , liver failure and sperm damage . is traditionally called blue-green algae is actually a class of microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria . Cyanobacteria can be toxic and can also produce various types of cyanotoxins that have different hazards . With their small , developing bodies , children are especially endangered by algae exposure . was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption . But it probably wo n't be the last , especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year . Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets . If you believe your pet may have been exposed , be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy , seizures , diarrhea or vomiting . And as climate change gets worse , the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks , creating a toxic feedback loop . The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish . Communities that struggle with regular , serious toxic algae outbreaks , like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie , can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation . The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth . The women were all non-smokers , had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies . Macrophages , which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body , protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles , such as bacteria and pollution particles . The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants . That 's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA 's Office of Inspector General -LRB- OIG -RRB- , the agency 's internal watchdog . EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement , and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was required to respond to the April 2017 petition within 90 days , but nearly 17 months have passed with no finding . more than 97,000 giraffes remain in the wild , and the species is gravely imperiled by habitat loss , civil unrest , hunting for meat and the international trade in bone carvings , skins and trophies . U.S. provides a large market for giraffe parts . for their six-foot-long necks , distinctive patterning and long eyelashes , giraffes have captured the human imagination for centuries . But so , under this definition , are multi-thousand-acre corporate entities using automated machinery to grow genetically engineered corn . Size of the farm is not a factor ; neither is the style of agriculture . A family farm may not even have a family that owns or works the land . issue with such a broad definition of family farming is primarily in the discourse . Aid is divvied up by revenue among family farmers , with additional programs going to some specialized farmers , like young or beginning farmers , organic farmers , and sustainable farmers .
