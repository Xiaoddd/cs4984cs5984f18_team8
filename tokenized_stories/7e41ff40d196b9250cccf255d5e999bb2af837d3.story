This weekend , during a peaceful prayer ceremony , a truck driver working for the Dakota Access Pipeline plowed through the crowd firing his gun in the air . According to Native News Online , close to 500 people had gathered for the prayer service at the time of the attack . Although no one was hit by the gunshots and they were not captured on the video below , multiple shell casings were recovered from the scene . Our protectors were peacefully marching on a dirt road towards a DAPL operations base . There were no initial reports of any pipeline workers being arrested or questioned by police , despite the fact that the incident was reported . However , peaceful protesters and journalists have been regularly assaulted , tased , pepper-sprayed and arrested for doing absolutely nothing . Protesters are often criticized for blocking roadways and creating an inconvenience for people . However , it is important to realize that when people protest , it is usually because circumstances in their lives have gotten so bad that they have no other choice . People in this position are often left with no option but to protest in a way that inconveniences people , and forces them to recognize the struggles of those around them . As we reported last week , there is evidence that the Dakota Access Pipeline is even more dangerous than typical pipeline projects , because it is slated to run under a river that millions of people depend on for drinking water . The pipeline is also in the direct path of a landslide zone , which could cause obvious and disastrous complications . Having the water supply of millions poisoned , and land stolen from natives who have suffered centuries of ongoing oppression and genocide is a huge deal when compared with someone getting home from work on time . Also , this truck driver is not an innocent bystander , as a worker on the pipeline , he is a part of the problem . This fact may upset some people in the industry , but regardless of our jobs , every individual is responsible for their own actions , and everyone has the ability to refuse orders if their job puts them against humanity . Winning this battle is as simple as choosing to abstain from the violent corrupt old system and participating in the new and peaceful system that hands the power back to the people . We feel that PIVX is this system . PIVX takes the control the banking elite has over money and gives it back to the people . It is the ultimate weapon in the battle against the money changers and information controllers because PIVX is the only cryptocurrency in existence that allows for completely anonymous storage while simultaneously paying interest .
