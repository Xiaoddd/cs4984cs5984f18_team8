-LRB- Photo : Morton County Sheriff 's Department -RRB- On Sunday night , near the Backwater Bridge on Hwy 1806 in Morton County , N.D. , law enforcement officers used water cannons in below-freezing temperatures to disperse people protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- . An estimated 400 demonstrators , who refer to themselves as water protectors , were attempting to dismantle a nearly month-old roadblock that they say is preventing emergency services from quickly accessing the Oceti Sakowin -LRB- Seven Council Fires -RRB- protest camp and the Standing Rock community at large . Many were being treated for hypothermia . The Standing Rock Sioux maintain the land in question , recently acquired by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners , is unceded Dakota territory as affirmed in the Ft. Laramie Treaty of 1851 . During the late-October clash , military vehicles blocking the Backwater Bridge were set on fire and 147 people were arrested . But instead of removing the damaged vehicles , state officials left them where they were and , citing potential structural damage to the bridge as a result of the flames , closed the highway . In the meantime , water protectors claim that by keeping the highway closed the state is strangling the local economy and unnecessarily putting Native lives at risk . According to a press release issued yesterday by 350.org , a global environmental advocacy group currently working with Standing Rock : Despite the obvious public safety risk , and despite promises from Morton County that they would clear the road , law enforcement has insisted on keeping the vehicles on the bridge for weeks . This obstruction of Highway 1806 threatens the lives of the water protectors and residents of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation , as emergency services have been needed but unable to reach camp quickly . The blockage also unjustly restricts the free movement of local residents and hurts the Tribe economically by cutting off travel to and from the Prairie Knights Casino . Images of the burned vehicles have fed negative , distorted , and sensationalist media portrayals of the encampment . He says that due to the police enforced roadblock , ambulances currently need an extra 30 minutes to get to and from the hospital . Goldtooth notes on social media early Monday that foreign media interest in Standing Rock was surpassing that of mainstream , domestic news agencies . This was just a fire hose .

Shame on all americans who do not raise their voices to STOP this tremendous injustice . WE ARE ALL RELATED . ALL OF THIS WILL COME BACK TO US ONE DAY . Posted by pio dal cin on 2016-11-24 07:08:52 How ironic . The Constitution makes for no provisions for ` treaties ' with its own constituency . In short , the land involved in this pipeline dispute is owned by the People of the United States and permission to place a pipeline is not required of tenants .
