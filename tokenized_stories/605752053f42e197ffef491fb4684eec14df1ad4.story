ThoughtCo . While some states still apply the common law interpretation , most states have enacted written , statutory versions of Castle Doctrine laws specifically spelling out what is required or expected of persons before resorting to the use of deadly force . As in all cases involving self-defense , defendants must prove their actions were justified under the law . Even though the Castle Doctrine statutes differ by state , many states utilize the same basic requirements for a successful Castle Doctrine defense . Merely standing threateningly at the door or on the lawn will not qualify . In addition , the Castle Doctrine does not apply if the defendant had allowed the victim into the home , but decided to force them to leave . Typically , defendants who are unable to prove they were in actual danger of physical injury will not be allowed to claim defense under a Castle Doctrine law . Some states still apply the common law Castle Doctrine edict that defendants have some level of duty to retreat or avoid the confrontation before using deadly force . While the older common law interpretations required defendants to have made some effort to retreat from their attacker or avoid the conflict , most state laws no longer impose a duty to retreat . In these states , defendants are not required to have fled from their home or to another area of their home before using deadly force . They argue that in many cases the only eyewitness to the incident who could have testified against the defendant 's claim of self-defense is dead .
