We come to the close of Native American Heritage Month . And yet , look at where we are today . This fight goes beyond Standing Rock to places like Flint , Michigan and possibly to your own home town . In this month set aside to honor Native Americans , we have witnessed these proud People arrested and held in chain-link cages like you would use for animals . As they have gathered peacefully and exercised their constitutional rights , they have been shot with projectiles , percussion grenades , and sonic weapons . This treatment of Native Americans is a national disgrace . They were here first . Driven by their greed , these new-comers demanded the original inhabitants step aside , and so conflict ensued . And even though they were not allowed to be citizens until 1924 , their intense patriotism has shone like a beacon . Once again , through their determination to protect the waters and lands of this country , they are showing us what true patriotism looks like . Please think about it . Another Voice Next , let me introduce you to Brian Cladoosby , President of the National Congress of American Indians -LRB- NCAI -RRB- and Chairman of the Swinomish Tribe . Brian has been a friend for many years , but more importantly , he is a strong defender of justice . As always , thanks for reading . Police brutality and violence against peaceful protesters at Standing Rock is the perpetuation of over 500 years of colonial aggression , violence and greed . All proceeds go to help the brave water Protectors at Standing Rock , and not one cent goes to me . Please watch , share , and support our Native brothers and sisters as you are able . Jane Coffey Brooklyn , NY December 3 , 2016 , 5:49 pm Very well said . It is not something to be proud of that we continue to ignore our history . We have pretended that no genocide took place in this country by our forefathers and we have looked the other way every generation since as to the ill-treatment of native americans . We also continue to ignore the fact that in many , many parts of this country people can no longer drink the water from beneath their land . What a disgrace we are to the world . It Is YOU Melissa Mays Flint , MI December 1 , 2016 , 11:27 pm We need to respect our water and the Water Protectors . Living in Flint has shown us how life can be destroyed when your water is contaminated . Respect . Listening , watching , experimenting , experiencing .
