DAPL Proclaimed they would drill across the river and just pay the fine . The drill failed . We know this failed because they did not meet their deadline on Dec 31 . They had to take out a loan from ETE their Mother company . . the snake swallowing its own tail . Around Jan 29 people heard drilling again and Drone footage showed the West drill working . The drilling stopped and it was said they only drilled to the river and they stopped to wait for a permit . This attempt at a drill failed because they tried again after Trump over rode EIS . People heard it . . and then it was from both East Bank and West Bank . The people then said that it sounded loud like pounding ... ie the attempt to save a failed drill . It would be wonderful to know if the sound resumes on Tuesday and have drone footage especially the East drill . The ferocity they attack drones fits . drilling companies usually only try 3 drills before they retract and call the drill a fail . DAPL can not get enough to reroute the pipeline now and really ca n't admit failure or lose future loans and investors . And the Irony of if DAPL had been honest and Consulted the tribes ... they would have read the Engineers report from Cheyenne River Tribe and saved their company , stopped the Momentum of a Powerful world wide Movement and re routed their pipeline . The Ancestors stopped DAPL . You 're doing a great job . We need all the information we can get out here because the rumors and the mainstream media really are n't helping keep anyone informed in a good way . Reply Your comment Loading ...
