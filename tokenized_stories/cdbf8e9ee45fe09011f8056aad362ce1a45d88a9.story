Photo courtesy Chad Harrison With their costly project in limbo , the wealthy backers of the Dakota Access Pipeline are seeking to dismiss an appeal filed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . The tribe filed the appeal after a federal judge , back on September 9 , refused to halt construction of the controversial project . The appeal also led to a temporary injunction on September 16 that prevented work near Lake Oahe , where the final portion is located . But after the order was lifted on November 9 , Dakota Access quickly resumed construction with the hopes of completing the pipeline . Since the pipeline is all but complete except for the crossing at Lake Oahe , there 's nothing left for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to resolve , the firm 's attorneys argue . The tribe 's attorneys indeed conceded that point in a filing dated December 2 , before the announcement on the easement two days later . But they are asking the D.C. Circuit to vacate , or erase from the record , the September 9 decision that sparked the appeal because they say Dakota Access should n't have kept working on the pipeline . Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on YouTube : Hearing on the Human Rights Situation of Indigenous Persons in the Context of Projects and Extractive Industries in the United States Dakota Access , unsurprisingly opposes the tribe 's request . But the Obama administration does n't think the September 9 decision should be vacated either . However , all three parties agree on one big point -- the construction at issue in the case has been completed . In a footnote , Maysonett noted that the easement for the crossing at Lake Oahe was denied on December 4 . The mutual agreement on a key issue could convince the D.C. Circuit to dismiss the case without further action . But now that the Obama administration heeded Indian Country 's call to deny the easement and conduct a new and more thorough environmental review , tribes are focusing their attention on that effort , especially due to uncertainty surrounding the incoming administration of Republican president-elect Donald Trump . He was referring to the National Environmental Policy Act , the federal law that will guide the upcoming review . The temporary order against construction was unprecedented for an Indian law case . Despite lacking the easement at Lake Oahe , Dakota Access is asking a lower court judge to authorize work at the site . A hearing is anticipated in early February , later than the firm was seeking .
