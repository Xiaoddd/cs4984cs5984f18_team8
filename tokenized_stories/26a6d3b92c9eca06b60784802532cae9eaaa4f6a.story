Deceleration Climate Change : Mitigation . Adaptation . Justice . The movement is considered the largest gathering of native peoples in the U.S. in more than 100 years . Most of what the world knows of Standing Rock is often encoded in violence . Circling the global mediasphere : images of blank-faced police oppressors employing baton and tear gas , the iconic snarling attack dogs , burning vehicles and the raised fists of activist resistance . Though a manifestation of the struggle , this violence is not Standing Rock . At Oceti Sakowin , one of several camps along the Cannonball River , life is marked by ceremony and peacemaking . Prayers are offered at the Sacred Fire from the dark of the early morning , throughout the day , and back into the night . We walk in prayer to the river each morning , singing , to honor women , the water carriers . There are sweats every night and pipe ceremonies during the day . And despite the legacies of colonialism and genocide and long-standing antagonistic relationships between peoples and tribes , the power of Standing Rock as a healing ground , is its true message . The world needs to see is the Spirit of Standing Rock . That is captured , in part , in those that one meets there . I spent part of a day walking the camp and asking how people came to Standing Rock and what the site means to them . Here are some of the responses I received .
