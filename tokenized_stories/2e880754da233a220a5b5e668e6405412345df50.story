Yessenia Funes Nov 28 , 2016 12:43 PM EST In a video by Fusion , actor Mark Ruffalo stands with other water protectors calling for the release of Red Fawn Fallis . Colorlines screenshot of Fusion video , taken on November 28 , 2016 . Police arrested her on October 27 -LRB- along with at least 140 others -RRB- during a raid on the short-lived 1851 Treaty Camp , or Sacred Ground Camp , in North Dakota . Shots were fired while she was pinned to the ground . However , water protectors say they can contest this allegation with video footage and eyewitness accounts . Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier had previously said during a press conference that he could not confirm any demonstrator had fired a weapon . Today -LRB- November 28 -RRB- , Fallis was in court where documents on Twitter show that the state court has dismissed her case , placing her in federal custody . I see a prominent politician interviewing a former Marine and across the river from a rifle -LRB- you can hear the pop -RRB- she is dropped in pain by a rubber bullet . These are things that should not be happening to anyone here , anywhere . Now trumped up charges , with witnesses contradicting what a Sheriff has said . I have no doubt this woman should be free to go . is published by Race Forward , a national organization that advances racial justice through research , media and practice .
