Last Monday , two-dozen activists chanted , sang , and drummed outside Wells Fargo ' San Francisco headquarters to demand the bank stop financing the Dakota Access Pipeline . Wells Fargo has drawn criticism for its central role in raising funds for the pipeline 's construction . But banks are n't the only Bay Area institutions that stand to profit if the pipeline is completed . ETP and Sunoco are the companies building the Dakota pipeline . Results have been slow and mixed . In 2015 , CalPERS began divesting from thermal coal . Gov. Jerry Brown later signed a bill requiring both CalPERS and CalSTRS to sell off coal stocks and bonds by July 2017 . Last September , the UC announced it was divesting from companies that mine coal and oil sands , two of the dirtiest fossil fuels . But the UC and both state pension funds remain heavily invested in oil and gas . The UC and CalPERS did n't respond to requests to discuss these investments . Pennie Opal Plant , one of the founders of Idle No More SF Bay , called the pension system 's engagement policies crazy . Hugh MacMillan of Food and Water Watch has researched the Dakota Access Pipeline 's finances . According to MacMillan , the fact that all three are invested in Energy Transfer Partners ' corporate bonds , as opposed to stock , matters , as well . According to MacMillan , the bonds are used to finance Energy Transfer Partners ongoing operations and to help build expensive capital projects such as the Dakota Access Pipeline . Opal Plant said that indigenous peoples and their supporters will continue to fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline and similar projects , and that focusing on local companies and investors who are funding the pipeline will remain part of their strategy .
