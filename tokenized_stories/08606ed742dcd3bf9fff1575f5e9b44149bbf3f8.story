Trump addressed reporters in the Oval Office on Friday morning . Republicans and the oil industry say the pipeline will create thousands of construction jobs and provide national energy security . However , environmentalists and scientists have long warned about the devastating impact of further fossil fuel extraction on a rapidly warming planet . On Friday , protesters gathered across from the Trump International Hotel in New York City and outside the White House in Washington , D.C. AMY GOODMAN : The pipeline is not yet a done deal . The company TransCanada still needs to secure funding , acquire local permits , stave off potential legal challenges . Bill , talk about this announcement that was made on Friday . It seemed as if , Bill , this was right at the time when Trump was going down over healthcare , was extremely angry and issued this unrelated executive order around the pipeline permit . BILL McKIBBEN : Yes , it was directly in between pretending to drive a big truck and losing on healthcare . And there are lots of people standing in their way . What it really underscores , Amy , is how much the world has changed in the six years since this fight began . The plan for the Keystone pipeline , which was bad then , is preposterous now . And the only good news is that the fight against Keystone has gone on to spur thousands of other battles with other fossil fuel projects all over the world . Look , the tar sands is not only a climate disaster . And the Trudeau government up in Canada is sort of operating in the shadow of the craziness of the Trump administration . He went down to Houston , couple of weeks ago , to speak to a bunch of oil men . I want to turn to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaking earlier this month . PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU : I said , on the very first trip to the oil patch back in 2012 , no country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and just leave them there . Go ahead . Trudeau and Trump in collaboration in the tar sands is a really sick picture . The oil industry is in trouble , because demand is beginning to disappear . These things terrify the oil industry because they destroy demand . You remember , because you were there covering it , the big climate march in New York City . This is the D.C. version two years later . AMY GOODMAN : Well , Bill McKibben , we want to thank you for being with us .
