Of course , there are good reasons why Mailer in particular should suffer posthumous obscurity with such alacrity : his brand of male essentialist braggadocio is arguably extraneous in the age of Trump , Weinstein , and fourth-wave feminism . Initially I had the impression I was being heard out , if reluctantly , but as the years have passed , my attempts to limn the shape of this epochal transformation have been met increasingly with outrage , and even abuse , in particular from my fellow writers . As for my attempts to express the impact of the screen on the page , on the actual pages of literary novels , I now understand that these were altogether irrelevant to the requirement of the age that everything be easier , faster , and slicker in order to compel the attention of screen viewers .

Corbyn is another feather in the wind of populism and a fragmentation of the old consensus and politesse . He was elected to the leadership by the party membership in 2015 , and no one was more surprised than he . Between 1997 and 2010 , Corbyn voted against his own party 428 times . He existed as an ideal , a rebuke to the Blairite leadership , and the only wise man on a ship of fools . His schtick is that of a weary , kindly , socialist Father Christmas , dragged from his vegetable patch to create a utopia almost against his will . But in 2015 the ideal became , reluctantly , flesh . Satirists mock him as Jesus Christ , and this is apt . But only just . He courts sainthood , and if you are very cynical you might say that , like Christ , he shows Jews what they should be . He once sat on the floor of a crowded train , though he was offered a first-class seat , possibly as a private act of penance to those who had , at one time or another , had no seat on a train . When Corbyn became leader of the Labour Party , the British media , who are used to punching socialists , crawled over his record and found much to alarm the tiny Jewish community of 260,000 . He invited the Islamist leader Raed Salah , who has accused Jews of killing Christian children to drink their blood , to Parliament , and opposed his extradition . He was an early supporter of the Boycott , Divestment , and Sanctions -LRB- BDS -RRB- movement and its global campaign to delegitimize Israel and , through the right of return for Palestinians , end its existence as a Jewish state . -LRB- His office now maintains that he does not support BDS . Corbyn freed something . The scandals bloomed , swiftly . In 2016 Naz Shah , Labour MP for Bradford West , was suspended from the party for sharing a Facebook post that suggested Israel be relocated to the United States . She apologized publicly , was reinstated , and is now a shadow women and equalities minister . For this comment , Livingstone was suspended from the party . Sign in here . Subscribe here . By Edwin Dobb If necessity is the stern but respectable mother of invention , then perhaps desperation is the derelict father of subterfuge . That was certainly the case when I moved to Seattle in 1979 . Not only had rent increased sharply in all but the most destitute neighborhoods , landlords now routinely demanded first , last , and a hefty security deposit , which meant I was short by about fifty percent . Over the first week or so , I watched with mounting anxiety as food , gas , and lodging expenses reduced the meager half I did have to a severely deficient third . To make matters even more nerve-racking , I was relocating with my nine-year-old son , Ezra . More than my well-being was at stake . The house needed a new roof , a couple of coats of paint , and , judging by what Ezra and I could detect during a furtive inspection , major repair work inside , including replacing damaged plaster-and-lath walls with sheetrock . All of this , from my standpoint , meant that I might have found a solution to my dilemma . I called the person listed on the rolls and made an appointment . Then came the moment of truth , or , more precisely , untruth , when dire circumstance begot strategic deception . To my immense relief , the pretense was well received . Sign in here .
