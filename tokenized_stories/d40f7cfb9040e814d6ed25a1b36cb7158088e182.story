Image copyright IRAQI JOINT OPERATION COMMAND Image caption The Iraqi military provided this image showing the destruction at the mosque compound Previous reports said IS had rigged the mosque with explosives to stop the advance of Iraqi troops , but that local residents had until now prevented the militants from blowing it up . IS says the mosque was destroyed by a US air strike but has not provided any evidence to support this . Iraqi forces are one street away from entering the mosque site , according to state TV , and more details may emerge if they do so . The al-Nuri mosque dated back to 1172 and was Mosul 's most famous Sunni mosque . It was named after the Muslim leader , Nur al-Din Mahmoud Zanki , famous for waging jihad against Christian crusaders . Image caption The BBC gained access to the site of the destroyed mosque on Thursday A month after IS forces overran Mosul in June 2014 , Baghdadi gave a Friday sermon from the pulpit inside the mosque and spoke about the newly-proclaimed caliphate - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law , or Sharia , by God 's deputy on Earth , or caliph . The militant group flew its black flag from the famous minaret and the building became the centre of IS activities . IS fighters have shown scant regard for history or culture in the three years since their lightning advance across northern Iraq , says Paul Adams , BBC News world affairs correspondent . Destruction of the mosque , most observers assumed , would mark the group 's final act of angry defiance before finally losing their grip on Mosul . Destroying the landmark would perhaps be better for IS than seeing it in the hands of its enemies - a scenario that would be a bigger symbolic blow for the group , adds BBC Monitoring journalist Mina al-Lami . Moreover , IS has openly said it will pursue scorched earth tactics in Mosul , she says . It has already targeted several mosques and tombs , including The Shrine of Yunus .

Sympathisers said Iraqi forces believed that destroying the mosque would break IS militants ' spirit but that instead it would make them more determined to fight on . Thousands of Iraqi security forces , Kurdish Peshmerga fighters , Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen , supported by US-led coalition warplanes and military advisers , have been involved in the battle to retake the key city since 17 October last year . Battle for Mosul : The story so far Russia ` may have killed IS head Baghdadi ' The UN has warned that IS may be holding more than 100,000 people in the city as human shields . The army said it believed there were no more than 300 militants left in the city , compared with almost 6,000 in October . On Tuesday , an Iraqi military statement on state TV said IS had lost control and civilians previously trapped in the Old City were being released . The US military has hailed gains by Iraqi forces but says the full liberation of the city from IS control is not yet complete . Russia announced earlier this month that it was investigating whether a 28 May air strike on Raqqa had killed the IS leader . The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites .
