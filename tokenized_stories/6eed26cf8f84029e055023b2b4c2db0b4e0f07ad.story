But another clash is brewing over a related pipeline by the same company , 1500 miles away . This battle cry was greeted by hoots and cheers from the crowd gathered outside a public hearing Thursday to protest the proposed Bayou Bridge Pipeline . The Bayou Bridge Pipeline would form the tail end of the now infamous Dakota Access route . The Dakota Access Pipeline would carry crude oil from the North Dakota oilfields to an oil tank farm in Illinois , where it would then be transported to Nederland , Texas . A newly completed pipeline connects Nederland to Lake Charles , Louisiana . Advertisement The Bayou Bridge Pipeline would carry 480,000 barrels of oil per day a final 162 miles across the state to refineries and ports , through eight watersheds and long stretches of fragile wetlands . The hearing lasted five and a half hours , as speaker after speaker weighed in on how the pipeline would affect them . Ultimately , however , they estimate the pipeline will create just twelve permanent jobs . Opponents are pushing the Army Corps of Engineers to draft an Environmental Impact Statement -LRB- EIS -RRB- that will fully investigate both certain and possible effects on the environment . It is already suffering from swamp degradation and pollution buildup from dozens of other oil and gas pipelines , many of which are abandoned . Now it 's apparently onto musical testimony . But that route is already causing immense damage to the basin , opponents pointed out . Advertisement Pipeline permits in the basin require companies to remove the dirt they dig out and replace it once the project is finished . A history of spills The Bayou Bridge builders argue pipelines are the safest way to transport crude oil that would otherwise use less efficient trains or trucks to get to refineries . But past pipelines have proven to be less airtight than the industry claims . A new report by the Bucket Brigade found that there were 144 pipeline accidents in 2016 . Many reports also lacked clear information on exactly how much oil or gas was spilled . Bucket Brigade contends that the industry is underreporting the scope of many of these smaller spills . The report notes that the industry reported one spill in the Chandeleur Sound as 8.5 gallons . SkyTruth , a group that studies satellite imagery of oil sheens after accidents , estimated it was at least 116 gallons . Pipelines may become even more vulnerable , as more frequent storms and floods plague southern Louisiana . Older pipeline infrastructure has been compromised as the marshes lose ground . More than 600 Louisiana pipelines risk exposure over the next 25 years , according to a Louisiana State University study . A national movement Since Standing Rock protesters successfully halted construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline , efforts to stop more pipeline construction have ramped up across the country . Proposed oil infrastructure on the East Coast and in the Pacific Northwest are attracting more scrutiny in the wake of the Dakota protests . Activists in Texas have been arrested for blocking pipeline construction through Big Bend and the Rio Grande . Many of the Louisianans who attended the hearing had recently returned from the Standing Rock camp in North Dakota . Others expressed solidarity with the thousands of Florida water protectors expected to gather this weekend to oppose the Sabal Trail Pipeline . Lifelong Iberia Parish resident Andrea Kilchrist , 71 , described the violence she had witnessed at Standing Rock : peaceful protesters battered with sonic grenades , tear gas , mace , and cannons .
