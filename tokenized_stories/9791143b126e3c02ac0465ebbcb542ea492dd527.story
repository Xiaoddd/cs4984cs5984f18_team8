Today 's must-read The US is dominated by a rich and powerful elite . So concludes a recent study by Princeton University Prof Martin Gilens and Northwestern University Prof Benjamin I Page . This is not news , you say . Perhaps , but the two professors have conducted exhaustive research to try to present data-driven support for this conclusion . Here 's how they explain it : Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organised groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on US government policy , while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence . In English : the wealthy few move policy , while the average American has little power . The two professors came to this conclusion after reviewing answers to 1,779 survey questions asked between 1981 and 2002 on public policy issues . They broke the responses down by income level , and then determined how often certain income levels and organised interest groups saw their policy preferences enacted . Moreover , because of the strong status quo bias built into the US political system , even when fairly large majorities of Americans favour policy change , they generally do not get it . They conclude : Americans do enjoy many features central to democratic governance , such as regular elections , freedom of speech and association and a widespread -LRB- if still contested -RRB- franchise . But we believe that if policymaking is dominated by powerful business organisations and a small number of affluent Americans , then America 's claims to being a democratic society are seriously threatened . Eric Zuess , writing in Counterpunch , is n't surprised by the survey 's results . Maybe , she writes , Americans should just accept their fate . South Korea Ferry tragedy was a manmade disaster - The death toll from the sinking of the Sewol off the south-eastern tip of South Korea could have been greatly reduced if the passengers had been properly instructed in safety procedures and the crew had n't been among the first to abandon the ship , write the editors of South Korea 's Joongang Daily . The South Korean government also shares blame , they write . Ukraine Nato football v Russian chess - The Ukrainian crisis has taken Nato planners by surprise , writes Prof David Murphy of National University of Ireland , Maynooth , in the Irish Times .

BBC Monitoring 's quotes of the day Ukrainian media respond to high-level meetings between officials from the US , EU , Ukraine and Russia in Geneva aimed resolving the crisis in Ukraine . Ukraine will be presented there as a pie which will be divided . Everything ... shows the signs of a grand plot , where big geopolitical players resolved their issues at Ukraine 's expense . - Editorial in Den .
