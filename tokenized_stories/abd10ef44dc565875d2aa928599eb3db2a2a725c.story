In December , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other Indigenous leaders requested that each of these banks meet with tribal representatives to hear their concerns . The ask for the banks is to discontinue loan disbursements in consultation with Native leaders until outstanding issues are resolved , and Free , Prior and Informed Consent from Indigenous peoples is upheld . We call on the remaining banks to agree to a meeting with the Tribe . Banks need our dollars to make their investments . We can and must hold these financial backers accountable for supporting destruction of our shared planet and futures . We are demanding that our interests as a prospering people be put before banks and their investments . We are showing Big Oil and government leaders that we know the power of our capital , and as such we collectively choose to invest in life and water , not death and oil . We call on these banks to divest completely . All banks have a responsibility not only to their shareholders and customers , but to the communities that are impacted by their investments . We call on all banks to divest entirely from the Dakota Access Pipeline .
