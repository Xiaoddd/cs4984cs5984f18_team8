They are as focused as ever on preserving their languages and cultures and supporting their peers in communities across the United States . The report was released by the Center for Native American Youth on Wednesday . The groundbreaking non-profit 's efforts have helped draw unprecedented attention to the issues facing American Indian , Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian youth , who are often overlooked at the national level . Shortly before the November 8 election , the organization released an open letter written by Native youth leaders . They asked the next president -- an unknown at the time -- to maintain the commitments they saw during the Obama administration . Republican Donald Trump secured a historic and surprise victory on that night yet he has n't said anything about Native youth , or about any Native issues for that matter , as he creates his new team . But once he takes office on January 20 , 2017 , his actions will have a direct impact on millions of young lives in tribal communities . Key among the concerns is the ongoing crisis in North Dakota . Protecting sacred sites , burial grounds and water resources have been the rallying calls of the effort to keep the Dakota Access Pipeline away from the lands of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . Those issues rank among the top priorities of Native youth , according to the report . But , as a result of the concerns raised by Native youth and the tribe , a key segment remains on hold pending further review by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . The agency has yet to grant an easement for Dakota Access to drill under the Missouri River on public land less than mile from the northern border of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . Beyond the pipeline , Native youth are also focused on health and wellness . Trump 's new administration will play a big role on that front once he nominates someone to run the Indian Health Service , which in recent years has taken a greater role in addressing the high rates of suicide among young tribal citizens . So far Trump has signaled big changes that will have a major impact on those efforts . He plans to nominate Rep. Tom Price -LRB- R-Georgia -RRB- to run the Department of Health and Human Services , the parent agency of the IHS . Price , like many other Republicans , has called for a full-scale repeal of the Affordable Care Act , the landmark law that permanently reauthorized the Indian Health Care Improvement Act . But neither the Congressman nor Trump have said what they will do to replace the programs affected by the IHCIA or how they will address funding for the IHS . The incoming Trump administration will also affect other Native youth priorities like protecting the Indian Child Welfare Act . Whoever the new president picks to run the Bureau of Indian Affairs will be charged with enforcing a new rule that requires state courts and state agencies to ensure they are following the 1978 law by keeping Native children connected to their communities . The rule takes effect December 12 and it 's unlikely that Trump could overturn it . Other Native youth priorities , like juvenile justice reform , fall under the purview of the Department of Justice . Trump plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions -LRB- R-Alabama -RRB- as his Attorney General but the lawmaker does not have much of a record or interest in Indian issues . Finally , education remains high on the Native youth agenda . Most Native youth attend public schools and Trump plans to nominate Betsy DeVos to run the Department of Education . DeVos has been a strong advocate of school choice , in which funds from the public school system are funneled to other institutions , often in the private sector . Some Republicans even want to open the Bureau of Indian Education , which is run by the BIA , to the same type of program in hopes of improving achievement levels among Native youth . Historically , they have fallen behind their peers on standardized tests and in high school graduation rates . The National Indian Education Association and Democrats strongly oppose the idea and while Native youth did n't speak directly on the issue in the CNAY report , they say one of the best ways to improve academic performance is to recognize their unique heritages . Retired Sen. Byron Dorgan -LRB- D-North Dakota -RRB- , who founded the Center for Native American Youth with leftover campaign funds , will host Native youth leaders and Interior Secretary Sally Jewell in Washington , D.C. , on Thursday to discuss the report . The event , which takes place from 12 pm - 1:30 pm Eastern , will be streamed live . Dorgan said .
