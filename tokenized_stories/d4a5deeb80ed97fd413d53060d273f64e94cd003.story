The Alberta oilsands , deposits of a tar-like heavy oil mixed with clay beneath the boreal forest in Alberta and Saskatchewan , represent the third largest reserve of crude oil in the world . But oilsands extraction is costly and energy-intensive , and oil producers in the region have struggled to compete in international markets . But opponents say Canada will never be able to meet its climate goals unless it stops expansion of the oilsands industry .

Investigative journalism has never been more important . Subscribe Share this article . When do we say enough is enough . This smooching of the corporate derriere is a bit much for this Canadian taxpayer to handle ... . I guess we can begin again to be hewers of wood , and haulers of water . Just remember , slaves are never happy ... and some have long memories , especially at election time . These people are despicable and this bail out is nothing short of treason . Also , I think that Notley should be kicked out of the NDP - she has shown her true color and it definitely not orange . These people are despicable and this bail out is nothing short of treason .

At this point , Kinder Morgan 's game plan may not even be to build the blasted thing . Playing along with this would make the Trudeau government either naive or very cynical and corrupt . Or maybe Trudeau himself naive , and certain top political operatives cynical and corrupt . At some point we 're going to have to recognize that many of our best policies are on paper only . Like consulting with indigenous people ... its a beautiful idea , if only those indigenous folks could see themselves to agreeing with our extractivist schemes . But when they do n't ... we just have to find some way around them ... and , eh ... some way through their land . As usual : We pay , they get the money . Be bad enough if it was our own bloodsuckers , but Trudeau wants to send billions of dollars out of the country so foreigners can poison us better . That would be 1 million dollars per 10 year job , or 8,000 jobs for 10 years -- probably more than the pipeline would have employed . With multipliers , probably 20,000 jobs ; with revenues paying just half the expenses , 40,000 jobs . Plus you 'd end up with a whole lot of clean power or increased energy efficiency . But no , instead he 's going to give the dough to billionaire Texans so they can make tar spills . The logic is pretty impeccable ... he 's counting on the Canadian taxpayer -LRB- dumb clucks that many of us are -RRB- to turn on the people who will continue to protest ... instead of on the government that is going to use our tax dollars to keep fossil fuels flowing well into armegeddon . When those dry up , we can look forward to the fires . Apparently , in carbon tax avoidant Saskatchewan , they are already well under way . So the money we pay hoping for good social policy and a future for our children is going to go down the tubes of more fossil fuel extraction ... and environmental disaster clean up . And I have n't even calculated in the money we 're going to have to spend cleaning up Alberta from the god awful mess they 've left behind ... in tailings ponds and unclosed old well heads . Liars like Kenny can promise it , but I do n't see any in sight . Now there 's a platform waiting for some ambitious Con . The oil sands project is not competitive in the first place . So everytime there is a glut of oil on the world market they ca n't even sell the oil at cost . Canada is the only G7 country that does not have a high speed train and the route between Calgary and Edmonton could be a good start . We could also use our own Bombardier to build the trains creating more employment . Maintaining a high speed train would create lasting employment unlike a pipeline . reply That would be amazing . Support our own companies , provide long term jobs and get people to where they want to go . sounds like a win-win to me .
