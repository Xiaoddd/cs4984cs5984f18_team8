The larger question over whether the pipeline should have been approved in the first place will be argued by Earthjustice attorney Jan Hasselman in Houston at the end of April . Hasselman has reason to hope for a positive outcome in the case . More and more , nontraditional allies like the Atchafalaya crawfishermen in the Bayou Bridge case are joining the fight as people realize that dirty energy companies are bad for communities and bad for the sustainable , living wage jobs like those in the basin . The Atchafalaya Basin in southern Louisiana , where the pipeline is proposed , is a special place . The basin is a crown jewel , a priceless component of our national ecological and cultural heritage . It is not the right place for an oil pipeline , especially one as massive as this one , and especially one run by a company with a reputation for carelessness like Energy Transfer Partners . This is an absolutely massive pipeline , far bigger than any others in the basin . A spill or leak from this project is different . The company , Energy Transfer Partners , likes to tout that 99.96 percent of the oil sent over its pipelines makes it safely to destination . Multiply by 365 days and you get three million gallons of oil per year spilled into the environment . Past pipeline construction has damaged the basin . In the past , when a company put in a pipeline , they would dig up a canal , drop in a pipeline and then leave the spoil -LRB- basically , dirt and plant debris -RRB- in a bank next to the canal . The Army Corps of Engineers permitted this pipeline without an environmental impact review . The idea of permitting a 162-mile pipeline of that size and volume in a place as special as the Atchafalaya is completely nuts . We do environmental assessments on shopping malls and drinking water pipelines . That process never happened here . Earthjustice client Jody Meche gestures to a diagram of the Atchafalaya Basin at a community meeting near Bayou Pigeon , Louisiana on March 21 , 2017 . The information came to light through a process required under environmental review laws like the National Environmental Policy Act -LRB- NEPA -RRB- . Part of that process includes giving members of the public a chance to voice their views . When all of the risks and benefits are balanced in a transparent way , these projects look terrible and decision makers have said no to them . The problem with the Bayou Bridge is none of that transparent balancing of risks and benefits ever took place . -LRB- Side note : For nearly 50 years , NEPA has empowered communities to defend themselves and their environment from dangerous , rushed or poorly planned federal or industry projects . A sign in the Atchafalaya Basin marks the location of an oil pipeline . Energy Transfer leads the industry in spills , leaks and other disasters . The company has already filed an appeal of the preliminary injunction . So many types of people have come out against this pipeline , including indigenous groups , environmental justice communities and crawfishermen . There is a growing awareness that the price of fossil fuel development has been too high . For decades , the industry has treated the environment and the people of Louisiana as an afterthought . For example , crawfishing , which has sustained families in the Basin for generations , is in dire jeopardy as the basin goes into ecological freefall . In the meantime , the battle against fossil fuels continues to grow in places like the Pacific Northwest , where grassroots activists recently stopped the largest oil-by-rail project proposal in North America . Demonstrators attend a community meeting in Napoleonville , Louisiana , to discuss the Bayou Bridge project on Feb. 8 , 2017 . He has successfully litigated a number of regional and national issues including listings of salmon under the Endangered Species Act , stormwater pollution , coal fired power plants , and coal and crude oil terminals . He currently serves as lead counsel to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in their litigation against the Army Corps of Engineers regarding approval of the Dakota Access pipeline . Learn more about Jan. .
