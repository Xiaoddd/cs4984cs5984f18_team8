Perry , the former chairman of the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission -LRB- IOGCC -RRB- , ran for president as part of the Republican Party primaries in 2015 , but his campaign ended quickly . He announced his run for the Oval Office in 2015 while facing felony charges for official state corruption in Texas . Trump and DAPL One of Perry 's donors for his short-lived presidential run was Kelcy Warren , CEO of Energy Transfer Partners , who also served as a major donor to Trump 's presidential campaign . Warren also sat on the advisory board for Perry 's 2015 run for president . After Trump 's election , Warren expressed a sense of elation over the future of the hotly-contested DAPL , which has erupted into the largest and most prolonged grassroots direct action mobilization against a pipeline in U.S. history at the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe 's reservation in North Dakota . Warren told The Dallas Morning News . In a recent interview with Fox News ' Chris Wallace , Trump said that when he takes office on Jan. 20 , 2017 , he plans to move forward and approve the currently stalled DAPL . Until recently , Trump owned tens of thousands of dollars worth of Energy Transfer Partners stock . Ironically , the U.S. Department of Energy -LRB- DOE -RRB- Perry will now head up is an agency he said he would get rid of during his run for the presidency during the 2012 election cycle . In a 2011 GOP primary debates , in a now unforgettable gaffe , Perry actually forgot the name of it when he proclaimed he 'd throw it by the wayside . Climate Denier , Former Head of IOGCC Perry , a vocal supporter of slashing regulations as applied to the oil and gas industry , is also a climate change denier . He does have some experienced heading up an energy-related agency , or at least a quasi-agency which functions much more like a lobbying organization : the IOGCC . IOGCC serves as an interstate compact of the 30 oil and gas states . At the time , a bill called the FRAC Act was moving through Congress , which called for the lifting of the exemption . The future of DAPL is somewhat up in the air and those on the ground in Standing Rock have pledged continued resistance through the winter as necessary . But at least in so far as the Trump Administration goes , with the naming of Perry to head the DOE , the old adage applies : personnel is policy .

The scorecard shows that 140 House members voted against chemical safeguards every time , while 149 members consistently voted for chemical safety protections . However , the action fund praised the lawmakers that bucked their party to vote for chemical safety , including Reps. voted for funding chemical reviews and against a farm bill that included pesticide safety loopholes . Florida Reps. A Preview of the People , Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule , two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Updated and reissued every five years , these guidelines are the nation 's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations . supply . These nominees will be well-known in their fields , and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers , academics and practitioners . part of the process is happening in real time . what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors . Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff , and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally . Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries . And here 's the first place you 'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition : rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected , USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first , soliciting public comments in the process . In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts , it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance . And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious . After the committee is announced in early 2019 , it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report . all appearances , the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs . though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable , plant-based diets have been all but stymied , there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle . Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance , including the meat industry , dairy industry , and sugar-sweetened beverage associations , as well as formula companies , which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers . -LRB- This may be happening in real-time , too .

Long-term exposure can lead to cancer , liver failure and sperm damage . is traditionally called blue-green algae is actually a class of microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria . Cyanobacteria can be toxic and can also produce various types of cyanotoxins that have different hazards . With their small , developing bodies , children are especially endangered by algae exposure . was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption . But it probably wo n't be the last , especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year . Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets . If you believe your pet may have been exposed , be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy , seizures , diarrhea or vomiting . And as climate change gets worse , the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks , creating a toxic feedback loop . The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish . Communities that struggle with regular , serious toxic algae outbreaks , like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie , can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation . The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth . The women were all non-smokers , had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies . Macrophages , which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body , protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles , such as bacteria and pollution particles . The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants . That 's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA 's Office of Inspector General -LRB- OIG -RRB- , the agency 's internal watchdog . EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement , and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency .

Size of the farm is not a factor ; neither is the style of agriculture . A family farm may not even have a family that owns or works the land . issue with such a broad definition of family farming is primarily in the discourse .
