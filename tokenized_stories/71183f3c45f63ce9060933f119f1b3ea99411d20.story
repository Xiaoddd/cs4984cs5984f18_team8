Two American Indian tribes who oppose the pipeline had argued that the spill risk data could bolster their case that more environmental study is needed . At the time , there had been about 750 arrests of anti-pipeline activists in North Dakota since August , and also vandalism to company equipment in Iowa and North Dakota during construction . In March , there were confirmed instances in which someone apparently had used a torch to burn holes through empty sections of the pipeline at aboveground shut-off valve sites , though no one was arrested . The Army Corps of Engineers , which also is a defendant in the lawsuit because it permitted pipeline water crossings , maintained that only a limited amount of the information should be kept from public view based on analyses by the Transportation Security Administration and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration . The judge is allowing the shielding of documents that include such details as pipeline maps at certain crossings , information on detecting and shutting down spills , graphs of spill risk scores at various points along the pipeline , maps of spill scenarios , oil spill volume predictions and details related to monitoring systems . Standing Rock attorney Jan Hasselman has argued previously that public scrutiny of the documents could help the tribe .
