He was tried with eight others last winter in the second Dakota Access trial and convicted by a jury of misdemeanor disorderly conduct for pushing an officer . His appeal , filed in March , is over insufficient evidence and a structural error during trial proceedings . Appearing Thursday morning before the state 's highest court , appellant attorney Kiara Kraus-Parr said a clerk of court told deputies and bailiffs not to allow the general public in the courtroom during jury selection so as to prevent members of the public mingling with potential jurors at the high-profile trial . A bailiff denied access to Bruce Nestor , a defense attorney in many protest-related cases , but not for anyone on trial that day . Decker 's defense counsel requested a mistrial over denial of the right to a public trial , but was denied and the proceedings continued . Justices fired away with questions for Kraus-Parr , who largely discussed the circumstances of the trial and its alleged closure relating to the Sixth Amendment and accommodations court staff could have made for the prominent trial . Justice Daniel Crothers asked . Regarding what 's considered a reasonable accommodation , Chief Justice Gerald VandeWalle asked if livestreaming the trial would have been unreasonable given no facilities exist to do so to satisfy the high interest . Kraus-Parr said there was no reasonable need to close the courtroom when seats were available . Crothers asked . Justice Jon Jensen asked about the distinction between closing the courtroom to the public and controlling the flow of people to and from it . Justices Lisa Fair McEvers and Jerod Tufte asked about segregating the jury pool from the public . Erickson said protesters sought to make influential political statements via the internet . After arguments concluded , VandeWalle said the court would take the case under advisement . Decker was not present for his appeal . Two other Dakota Access-related appeals have reached the North Dakota Supreme Court this fall . Mary Redway and Alexander Simon were the first protest-related defendants sentenced to serve incarceration for their convictions . Surrogate Judge Thomas Merrick convicted and sentenced them in a misdemeanor court trial in October . Redway served four days in jail while Simon served 12 , both at the Burleigh-Morton County Detention Center . Sam Saylor , of the Freshet legal collective in Mandan , will represent Simon and Redway in their respective appeals , possibly as soon as February in Simon 's case . He said Merrick handed down too harsh of sentences for defendants with clean records . Criminal convictions bring collateral consequences , he also said , such as when applying for teaching or nursing licenses in Simon 's situation . No arresting officer could be found for either Redway or Simon , Saylor added , and no one could attest to their individual conduct on Oct. 22 , 2016 , when they were among 140 people arrested along the pipeline route in southern Morton County . Saylor also questioned the rehabilitative function of Simon 's jail sentence . The Water Protector Legal Collective decried the sentences as disparate treatment and bias by Merrick , who countered that Redway and Simon were the only DAPL defendants he has sentenced , and their cases ca n't be compared in an independent judiciary . In addition to the three appeals , 496 DAPL-related cases have closed , 234 are open and 98 are inactive with warrants as of Thursday , according to trial court administrator Donna Wunderlich .
