` script ' , ` twitter-wjs ' -RRB- ; When I read comments from non Natives regarding the Dakota Access Pipeline , it is kind of shocking to me how much people disregard water . They hated the way it tasted , etc. . I of course , after getting over my disbelief went into a rant about how someday water will be more precious than anything . That is something that was taught to me by my grandfather , taught to him by his grandfather . The Lakota prophecy that dates back at least 300 years talks of all the water turning black someday . It says by the time white people realize how precious water is , it will be too late . People in North Dakota are so quick to defend oil and disregard water , as if oil is needed more than water . They are quick to throw their railroad workers under the train in order to put pipeline down without once thinking what they would do without water , how they would live . As Native people , we know the power of water , we know water can save our lives . Water can also in huge force take a whole village out in a flood . There is power in water , we are made of water which is why when it is sacrificed in ceremony for 4 days by Natives , it is done in a constant state of prayer in the hot sun . Water is used in every aspect of our lives , we know that it is our first medicine . Which is why hundred of tribes have come together in this fight for water . This is the challenge I issued on facebook . Being that so many politicians , corporations , and the average caucasian North Dakotan thinks that water is not important , here is the challenge . You can not have anything to do with water for 24 hours . This means no flushing a toilet , no washing your face , no drinking anything with water . No eating any portion that needed water to sustain it , no eating any crop that had anything to do with water . No drinking anything that needed water to make , being that everything has water in it including soda , about the only thing on this list is oil . No brushing your teeth , showering , or even going fishing . No going on a boat , no going swimming , no washing your clothes , no water in your life for 24 hours . I realize this is impossible for mostly everyone . Mostly everyone does not know that water is given up for 4 days and nights in the summer time during ceremony by the very same people who are fighting to protect their water . If you think you are ok without sacred water , then take this challenge . I realize not even the strongest man or woman can do this or even the richest , however , should you decide to take it , post it . Let us know truthfully how many minutes or hours you lasted . It is impossible . I only wanted them to think about it . Then I had a friend of mine step in who is non-native . I was thinking this was a good thing because most of us Natives know of someone or maybe have sacrificed water on their own in ceremony before . My own brother did and I remember him telling me the fasting of food for four days is not what got to him , it was the thirst for water . He said every cell in his body could think of nothing else but water for the whole four days . Animals and plants already know the importance of water , even more so than most humans . So Brooke lives in Florida , works in the health field , and decided to do the challenge on her day off . I will tell you about her day according to her notes . Brooke woke up at 9 am and her first thought was water . How normally she would shower and drink water , brush her teeth , etc. . She used the bathroom to urinate but did not flush the toilet . It bothered her to not wash her hands because she works in the health field she is constantly washing her hands all day . She thought about breakfast but had nothing to eat that did not use water to make . She broke down at 1:20 pm and made coffee because of a dependence on caffeine . Her challenge at that point was over , but she tried to keep going . Her mind was constantly on water wondering if she could eat the bananas outside but being they used rainwater to grow , they still involved water . At 2:10 pm she started doing laundry for the work week but her electricity went out , showing her again , how important water was . At 3:00 pm she finally broke down and drank a glass of water and tapped out completely . She lasted 4 hours and 20 minutes without water . Another hour without needing it to clean and another hour before her thirst took over . I asked her if she was bored without water . She said yes , it was such a distraction it was all she could think about , not being able to concentrate on anything else . She said she felt spoiled by having access to water constantly and she realized why there is a fight for clean water going on . I think of the children in Africa who get their water from mud puddles , I think of the power of water in lands that are shrinking due to melting glaciers , I think of the power of water in tsunamis . I think of water all the time and how the Lakota prophecy predicted that one day it will be more precious than anything . I think of the people on my reservation who still live with no running water . I think of the people in North Dakota who are too clueless to realize the fight for oil is about money . The fight for water is about life . Because water is our first medicine . Water is life . Mni Wiconi . We can not live without water .
