On Friday , the ExxonMobil Pegasus pipeline , which brings Canadian crude oil from Illinois to Texas , ruptured , leaking at least 80,000 gallons of oil into the Central Arkansas town of Mayflower . Arkansas ' THV11 reports : It was a rough start to the Easter holiday weekend after an oil spill struck in Mayflower . Authorities said as many as 40 homes had to be evacuated Friday afternoon . Lisa Song at Inside Climate News reports on the size of the spill : The size of the spill remains unclear . Dodson said the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated the spill at 84,000 gallons . The EPA and the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management did not return calls for comment . According to a Saturday afternoon press release from Exxon , 189,000 gallons of oil and water have been recovered from the site so far , and it is prepared to clean up more than twice that amount . According to the Arkansas Times the spill could have been much worse : the break was in the same Exxon Mobil 20-inch pipeline that carries Canadian crude to Texas refineries across 13 miles of the Lake Mamelle watershed and crosses the Maumelle River at three places . Had the spill occurred on either Lake Maumelle or the Maumelle River , this would have been a huge disaster for Arkansas . Arkansas Senator Mark Pryor was one of one the seventeen Democrats that joined all the Republican Senators in voting for symbolic approval of the Keystone XL pipeline . Pryor has claimed the pipeline will help create jobs in Arkansas , where some of the pipe is manufactured , however as Bloomberg reported recently , the project will only create 20 full time jobs , not the thousands that Pryor , TransCanada and other supporters like to talk about . More videos of local news coverage below : UPDATE 1 : April 1 , 2013 - As with most oil-spills affected wildlife is often a cause for concern and this spill is no different . In an interview with Inside Climate , a local official gave an estimate of 2,000 barrels -LRB- or 84,000 gallons -RRB- . Well , it 's not ordinary crude . The crude oil that spilled in Arkansas is actually dilbit , which stands for diluted bitumen . The oil sands , also known as tar sands , contain a mixture of sand , water and oily bitumen . ... Conventional crude oil is a liquid that can be pumped from underground deposits . It is then shipped by pipeline to refineries where it 's processed into gasoline , diesel and other fuels . Bitumen is too thick to be pumped from the ground or through pipelines . Instead , the heavy tar-like substance must be mined or extracted by injecting steam into the ground . The extracted bitumen has the consistency of peanut butter and requires extra processing before it can be delivered to a refinery . To make the thick bitumen flow through a pipeline , chemicals and water are added to dilute it . Benzene , a known carcinogen , is often part of the diluents mixture . So when you see a pond of oil in that Arkansas backyard above or the river of oil flowing through this suburban street , it likely contains more than just oil . UPDATE IV : As far as the corporate response goes , ExxonMobil has launched a web page dedicated to this spill . And , this is not an April Fools joke , their PR team handling the response is called Downstream Media Relations . Current regulations fail to protect the public against those risks . UPDATE VII : April 2 , 2013 - Ducks are still coming into contact with the oil . New photos from The Hawk Center show the damage . It is like removing gum from someone 's hair . ExxonMobil spokesman Alan Jeffers said only Hazmat certified individuals should catch or transport the oiled ducks . UPDATE X : Max Brantley of The Arkansas Times has a good piece on the concern over how the pipeline threatens water sources in Arkansas . He 's compiled some good responses from Central Arkansas Water 's John Tynan , who manages the watershed and Graham Rich , CEO of the water utility . Both men note that Exxon has purchased some equipment to deal with future spills . According to Rich , the equipment includes : One is a stationary boom that is placed in water to prevent drift of oil . Another is a mobile unit that could move an oil-blocking boom to different places . And in a letter about preparations being made to protect the watershed , John Tynan writes : In partnership with Exxon , CAW installed oil boom housing and other emergency response equipment at the former North Shore Marina on the north shore of the Lake . This allows for quick response in the event of a spill in the remote north shore of the lake . I am glad work is being done to ensure the safety of the Lake Maumelle watershed , but boom is just not adequate for containing the type of oil reportedly flowing through the Pegasus pipeline . As I noted in UPDATE III above , the Pegasus pipe is carrying dilbit , or diluted bitumen , which is thicker than conventional oil . As Lisa Song at Inside Climate News has reported , dilbit also behaves differently than traditional oil when spilled in water . What this means is that boom , which is like a long tube of paper towels and used to contain and absorb oil floating on the surface of the water , is not going to work when this heavy dilbit crude oil sinks to the bottom of Lake Maumelle . If there is a spill , boom is certainly going to be needed because some oil and contaminants will remain on the surface , but it is n't enough . What this shows is that ExxonMobil and other oil companies piping heavy , tar sands oil down from Canada just do not have the technology needed to deal with these spills , which are so frequent to feel inevitable . I 've put a call in to CAW to raise this point and will update this post if I get a response . Thousands of gallons of crude oil leaked into a residential neighborhood near Lake Conway , leaving significant damage to the State 's environment and to property in the surrounding area .
