by Indian Country Today Jan 17 , 2017 Faith Spotted Eagle speaks of the non-Native influence at the water protector camps at Standing Rock Faith Spotted Eagle is an activist and PTSD counselor . She is a member of the Yankton Sioux Nation who helped block development of the Keystone XL pipeline and now the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- . The elder and water protector has been at the forefront of the struggle against DAPL since it began . She has testified before members of the U.S. House of Representatives , written personally to President Barack Obama and even gotten a vote for President herself , from the Electoral College . She was the first Native American to receive an electoral vote for President of the United States , garnering one from a so-called faithless elector in Washington State , who cast a vote for her over Hillary Clinton . Amid all this , Spotted Eagle found time to sit down with Longhouse Media on a few occasions and talk about what makes the DAPL fight so important . Namely , the increasing role of white organizers in relationship to an indigenous-centered movement and how this shift could change the overall intentions of the camp . She is concerned that the new demographic , of roughly 80 percent non-Native water protectors , taking up space and making independent decisions at Oceti Sakowin Camp , is more reflective of the larger American society than an indigenous-led initiative . This highlights the need to confront settler colonialism within the movement itself , she explains . Without meaning to , some of the non-Natives who come to help are in fact seeking something . This is one in a series of conversations with Faith Spotted Eagle at Standing Rock , North Dakota , in December 2016 , conducted by Longhouse Media .
