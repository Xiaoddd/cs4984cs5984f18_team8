Water Protectors in front of a sunset at Standing Rock . -LRB- photo : AP -RRB- Donald Trump Picks Billionaire to Oversee Review of Dakota Access Pipeline By Indianz.Com 25 December 16 billionaire businessman with no experience in Indian issues is slated to oversee the federal agency whose handling of the Dakota Access Pipeline has come under repeated criticism . Vincent Viola went from a humble immigrant background to the founder of a highly-successful financial firm in New York . A huge legal , political and public relations challenge will be facing Viola should be confirmed as Secretary of the Army . Officially , the project is on hold in order for the Army Corps to conduct a more thorough review of the final portion of the pipeline in response to concerns raised by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and its many allies . But the process has yet to begin , more than two weeks after Jo-Ellen Darcy , who is the outgoing Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works , announced the December 4 decision on the easement . With Trump coming on board in just a month , the Army Corps does n't have much time to get the ball rolling . It 's crucial for the review to start soon because it would be difficult -- though not impossible -- for the incoming administration to change course . Even before winning the November 8 election , Trump made no secret of his support for large scale infrastructure projects like Dakota Access . He 's now stacking his team with pro-development figures , including former Texas governor Rick Perry , his pick to lead the Department of Energy . Perry sits on the board of directors for Energy Transfer Partners , the firm behind the pipeline . Though he comes from a business background , Viola does n't come with similar baggage or preconceptions about pipelines . At the same time , he does n't have any experience with Indian Country either and the Army Corps ' handling of Dakota Access has been seen as a failure of its tribal policy . Separate from the pending environmental review , the Army Corps has to defend itself from a cross-claim filed by the wealthy backers of Dakota Access . The firm argues that it has a right to drill under the Missouri River , less than a half-mile north of Standing Rock , despite lacking the easement that was denied this month . The agency is facing a January 6 , 2017 , deadline -- before Trump is sworn into office -- to submit crucial papers in court on the issue . The Department of Justice , which will soon be under new leadership , plans to contest the cross-claim , an attorney said at a December 9 hearing in D.C. Judge James E. Boasberg agreed to the request as he prepares for a hearing in early February on the easement . By that time , though , Trump will be in office . Beyond the legal and political realms , the new Trump administration will have to face the public , which has rallied behind Indian Country in its effort to stop the pipeline from crossing the Missouri River . We will not stop . A string of brutal winter storms has prompted many to leave , with promises to return once conditions improve . Earlier this month , the population there swelled to 10,000 with the arrival of nearly 4,000 veterans and other supporters . During the late summer and early fall , anywhere between 5,000 to 7,000 people were regular visitors and workers to the camps , located on land promised to the Sioux Nation by treaty . Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections : For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S. , particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election . We too were alarmed at the patterns we were , and still are , seeing . It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy , disciplined , and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before . It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time . We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century . The comments of our readers are the most vibrant , best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News . Accordingly , we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services . It is , however , important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in . Adapt and overcome . This time the fight will be out in the open , though , in plain sight , unable to be hidden . Thousands of whites , Indians from all over the United States , probably several thousand veterana , famous celebrities standing against a multitude of police forces from several states . We the people against the all powerful state . Standing Rock may be the turning of the tide against Trump . A wonderful and fitting climax to a long , hard fight -- for water . Hopefully that would slow their actions down for the next battle . A monopoly game . But it is n't . It 's real and Trump and his appointees are a great danger . The water protectors know this . I hope the rest of the country mobilizes to address this before we lose too much . Their ethical violations will be waived with pardons by the President . The Republicans in Congress will be rewarded for keeping quiet by having future elections cancelled . All in the name of Trump .
