` script ' , ` twitter-wjs ' -RRB- ; Seattle , WA - On November 2nd , Seattle City councilmember Kshama Sawant announced proposed legislation to help guide the city to contract with socially responsible banking institutions . Additionally , the legislation aims to end the cities finical relationship with Wells Fargo , citing both its recent defrauding of customers scandal and its finical backing of the Dakota Access pipeline . Wells Fargo is also one of the financial corporations bankrolling the Dakota Access oil pipeline running through the region around the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota . Thousands of courageous tribal and environmental activists are protesting at Standing Rock , in the face of militaristic repression and crackdown . Sawant has also separately introduced an amendment to the 2017 City budget that would end the B&O tax break for corporations engaged in international investment management services . Approximately 40-50 companies are beneficiaries of the corporate tax break . They get a tax break while people sleep on our streets . The Council passed this corporate tax break unanimously in 2009 .
