The White Earth River north of where an oil well spilled thousands of barrels of oil and brine water in October . Researchers found that streams polluted by produced water , also known as saltwater or brine , contained levels of contaminants that often exceeded federal guidelines for safe drinking water or aquatic health . The study , published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology , also found that soil at spill sites was contaminated with radium , a naturally occurring radioactive element . Port : Fracking is not contaminating water in North Dakota A North Dakota Department of Health official who reviewed the study Wednesday said the agency has long been concerned about the impacts of brine spills , which is why it has staff working in the field following up on spills . However , Glatt pointed out that the study focused on samples from a small number of spills while he said a vast majority of spills are cleaned up . The research team , which included students Nancy Lauer and Jennifer Harkness , spent about a week in North Dakota in July 2015 collecting water and soil samples . A majority of the contamination researchers analyzed came from pipeline leaks or other infrastructure failures . In addition , the team collected samples from waters affected by smaller spills and samples from two spills reported in 2011 in Bottineau County . Vengosh said he was surprised that researchers detected high levels of contaminants at the Bottineau County sites four years after the spills occurred . The study calls for long-term monitoring of waters downstream from spill sites to assess impacts to drinking water . But the Duke researchers did not contact North Dakota regulators to find out what monitoring is already being done . Vengosh said he thinks the results of any sampling that regulators do should be in the public domain . Researchers plan to return to North Dakota to do more testing on the contamination from oil development , which they see as more widespread than other areas of the country , Vengosh said . Funding for the study came from the National Science Foundation and the Natural Resources Defense Council . Glatt said health officials agree that brine spills are far more detrimental to the environment than oil spills . In addition , the North Dakota Industrial Commission is considering tighter regulations on gathering pipelines to prevent spills from occurring . In a response to the Duke study , a spokeswoman for the Department of Mineral Resources said those proposed rules will provide remedies to many of the issues raised in the study . However , some of those new regulations are being opposed by oil industry representatives who say the rules go too far and suggest North Dakota postpone those policy discussions to the 2017 legislative session .
