But after three years and three months , a massive oil spill in the area has still not been cleaned up . Most recently , the so-called Belle Fourche pipeline ruptured , resulting in some 130,000 gallons of crude oil being spilled into the environment . The leaking crude then traveled almost six miles to nearby Ash Coulee Creek , where a timely winter storm froze the creek , preventing the toxic sludge from reaching the Missouri river . Unless the spilled oil is removed from the area , it will seep into the creek , and then flow into the river . But confidence is low , as a 2013 oil spill has still not been cleaned up . Belle Fourche Pipeline spill in Billings county . Ok , maybe the Dakota protesters were right . At the time , an estimated 840,000 gallons of oil fouled 13 acres of soil , about the size of 14 football fields . A decontamination crew working on the environmental catastrophe dug as deep as 50 feet , removing and displacing enormous amounts of soil . Yet the company has not set a date for completion . The Dakota Access is enormous when compared to December 's ruptured oil line in Belle Fourche , as the latter moves about 6 million gallons daily , according to North Dakota Pipeline Authority 2011 report . The Dakota Access pipeline , a much larger pipeline , is reported to be some 30 inches in diameter , compared to 7-inch pipe of both Tesoro and True Cos 's Belle Fourche pipeline . Energy Transfer Partners , the Texas-based company responsible for constructing the pipeline , has a lengthy spill record , with 29 reported pipeline ruptures , leaks , or accidents since 2006 , leading to nearly 10,000 barrels -LRB- 420,000 gallons -RRB- of hazardous liquids dumped into the environment . President-elect Donald Trump , a supporter and early investor of the Dakota Access pipeline , has said that he will wait until he is in office to review the Army Corps ' decision to halt construction , according to Trump spokesman Jason Miller .
