We glued locks and ATM card slots at branches of Toronto Dominion and the Royal Bank of Canada . TD and RBC are among the largest Canadian investors in the Dakota Access Pipeline . There has been resistance to Enbridge and Kinder Morgan for years . We are continuing it here and we expect it will keep happening . Fuck all the pipelines . These actions were undertaken by anarchists in solidarity with the ongoing fight in Standing Rock to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline from being built , by whatever means necessary . We know the Army Corps of Engineers has refused to grant an easement to the Dakota Access Pipeline , but we also know that Energy Transfer Partners has vowed to build the pipeline despite this news . The struggle continues . We support land and water defenders all over the world who are fighting infrastructure projects that continue the genocidal march of colonialism and capitalism . We know that it is necessary for us to come together to fight this system . Sometimes we are most effective out in the open in the fields and streets , and other times we can strike hardest in the quiet of the night . We look forward to joining you wherever the coming struggles take us .
