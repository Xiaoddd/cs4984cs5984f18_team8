In the face of the violent events taking place since September , 2016 , in the territories of the Sioux Nation at Standing Rock , North Dakota , against the Hunkpapa Lakota Nation and other native peoples whose ancestors have long inhabited the banks and adjacent areas of the Missouri River in the United States of America , we , the undersigned , representatives of indigenous and campesino communities , non-governmental organizations , and independent academics of the state of Oaxaca , Mexico , manifest our opposition to the systematic violation of indigenous human rights by the violent imposition of the Dakota Access Pipeline , which affects the territory , water , and culture of the Sioux Tribe at Standing Rock . The Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAP -RRB- , a project of Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners , a private enterprise , has an estimated cost of 3.78 billion dollars and an extension of 1,172 miles . It would transport approximately half a million barrels per day of fracked crude oil from the Bakken shale fields in northwest North Dakota , to a refinery near Chicago , Illinois . The affected indigenous communities have fought the pipeline through the courts , so far unsuccessfully , and , for about 8 months , by non-violent protest . During the past few months , the movement has been joined by representatives of more than 100 Native American and Canadian tribes , as well as by people from the country at large . The implementation of the Dakota Access Pipeline Project has already led to police violence . Arbitrary arrests and intimidation of detainees by strip searches and incarceration have become frequent . The indigenous tribes involved see the pipeline itself as a violation of the human rights of original peoples to protect their territories , cemeteries and sacred sites as well as their right to clean water that would possibly be contaminated by pipeline leaks . The DAP project violates international treaties , signed by the United States , which stipulate the rights of indigenous peoples to their territories and to previous informed consent to projects that affect these territories . For the Sioux and other affected tribes , this project represents one more egregious violation of the historical treaties with the U.S. government that have been abrogated in the interest of private ventures . We , the indigenous peoples and campesinos of Mexico are suffering the same menace from government-supported megaprojects in the form of hydroelectric dams , contamination of our native corn varieties , open pit mining projects , and wind farms , which threaten to take over our legally-held lands and natural resources . In the face of these current political realities , we extend a call to create bonds of unity between indigenous peoples , activists , networks and movements of international solidarity among all peoples who resist this economic model and its megaprojects , with a view to guaranteeing respect for the human rights of the defenders of water and earth , and to upholding the rights of original peoples . We manifest our categorical rejection of the violent acts of harassment and repression provoked by the imposition of the Dakota Access Pipeline . We manifest ourselves in favor of the lives and well-being of the Native Peoples of the American continents , as well as of the rights of original peoples to conserve our water , our forests , our mountains and plains , and our spiritual relationship with the land . We stand in solidarity with the Sioux Nation of Standing Rock in its defense of its territory , water , and cultural identity .
