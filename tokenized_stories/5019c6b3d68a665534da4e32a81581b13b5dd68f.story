Protesters say the pipeline threatens water resources and sacred tribal lands . About 100 to 200 protesters remained after midnight . The Backwater Bridge has been closed since late October , when activists clashed with police in riot gear and set two trucks on fire , prompting authorities to forcibly shut down a protesters encampment nearby . Police said they responded by firing volleys of tear gas at protesters in a bid to prevent them from crossing the bridge . Activists at the scene reported on Twitter that police were also spraying protesters with water in sub-freezing temperatures and firing rubber bullets , injuring some in the crowd . A total of 167 demonstrators have been injured according to a medic on site , as cited by Indigenous Rising Media . Seven people have been hospitalized for severe head injuries . Three of those injured are reportedly elders of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe . Police did not confirm those reports , but later said protesters had hurled rocks , striking one officer , and fired burning logs from slingshots . The North Dakota Department of Transportation closed the Backwater Bridge due to damage from that incident . Completion of the pipeline , set to run 1,172 miles -LRB- 1,185 km -RRB- from North Dakota to Illinois , was delayed in September so federal authorities could re-examine permits required by the Army Corps of Engineers . Plans called for the pipeline to pass under Lake Oahe , a federally owned water source , and to skirt the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation by about half a mile . Most of the construction has otherwise been finished . The Standing Rock tribe and environmental activists say the project would threaten water supplies and sacred Native American sites and ultimately contribute to climate change . Supporters of the pipeline , owned by Energy Transfer Partners , said the project offers the fast and most direct route for bringing Bakken shale oil from North Dakota to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries and would be safer than transporting the oil by road or rail .
