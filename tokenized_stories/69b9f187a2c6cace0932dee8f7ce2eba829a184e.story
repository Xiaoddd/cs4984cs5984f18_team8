The disaster , the federal suit says , has heightened economic and spiritual pain in a region hamstrung by poverty and drought . This is our lifeblood . A spokeswoman for the E.P.A. , Nancy Grantham , said the agency could not comment on active legal issues . Representatives from the mining companies and the E.P.A. contractors declined to comment or did not return messages . Image People kayaking in the Animas River near Durango , Colo. , last August , in water colored from a mine waste spill . The mines have filled with poison from water and air entering earth cavities , mixing with sulfurous minerals . The sludge coursed through Colorado , New Mexico and Utah . The E.P.A. is considering whether to declare the area around the Gold King a Superfund site . The Navajo reservation , a vast region of red rocks that sits south of the mine , was hit particularly hard by the spill because leaders told people not to use water from the San Juan River for weeks after the E.P.A. said it was safe . Mr. Begaye , the Navajo president , said he was wary of the claim that the stream was healthy enough for agricultural and other use . Irrigation lines were cut off . Corn , melons , hay and wheat never made it to market . The spill , the president said , delivered a psychological lashing in a drought-stricken place where water is gold , many live in poverty and the San Juan River holds financial and spiritual power . The lawsuit names several defendants : the E.P.A. ; two contractors called Environmental Restoration and Harrison Western ; four mining companies called Gold King Mines Corporation , Sunnyside Gold Corporation , Kinross in Canada and Kinross USA ; and 10 unnamed individuals . It alleges that mismanagement of the mine , which had been closed for years but never cleaned up , caused it to swell with toxic water and eventually burst . Near the Gold King in Colorado , toxic water continues to flow out of the mine at a rate of 570 gallons a minute . A nearby water treatment plant put in place by the E.P.A. removes 95 percent of contaminants . The agency says that the water below the mine and the treatment facility has generally returned to prespill conditions , and local governments have instructed residents to resume recreational and agricultural activities on the Animas and San Juan Rivers . The suit is the latest to come out of the mine blowout . Earlier this year , New Mexico sued the E.P.A. and the State of Colorado over the accident .
