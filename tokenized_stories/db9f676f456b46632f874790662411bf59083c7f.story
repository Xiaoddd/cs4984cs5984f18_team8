I keep them so I can give them to homeless people when I see them . A couple of my daughters keep them in their cars for the same reason . Once when I went to Peru my heart broke when a little girl said she does n't like to get up in the morning because she 's too tired . She said she does n't sleep good . I asked her why and she said because she is too cold to be able to sleep . I made a point to take them with me every since then when I go . The only bad thing is even though they are reusable they do n't fold up as small as when they ae first opened . Another important thing to know is if you use them over heavy or bulky clothes they do n't work . They work by reflecting body heat back inward so if you do n't have it closer to your skin there 's nothing to hold in .

They come in little packets so they are easy to hand out and can be kept in a coat pocket . The individuals to whom we donated these said that they used them 3-4 days in a row before they were too worn out to use . They kept them warm on some pretty cold nights when they were sleeping outside . I put several in the glove compartment of my car for emergencies .
