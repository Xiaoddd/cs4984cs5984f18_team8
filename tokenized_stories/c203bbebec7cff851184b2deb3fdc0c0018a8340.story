The protestors are our collective conscience speaking truth to power . Instead , what is now happening is making an utter mockery of the principles , ideals , visions , hopefulness and goodness that America and the Office of the Presidency is supposed to represent . Mr. President , you are now , as they say , a lame duck president who at this point in the twilight of your presidency is especially concerned about salvaging for posterity what little positive legacy may in fact be left to salvage from some of the very darkest of moments that already have passed into the history books during your term in office . History will be the ultimate judge of your actions and how you decide to respond to this crisis . In my humble opinion , it will prove to be one of the greatest , if not the greatest , moral and ethical crisis of your entire term in office as it was some 150 years ago for President Abraham Lincoln when he , too , failed the test in his moment of truth to do the right and honorable thing on behalf of the Sioux people . President Lincoln failed to honorably respond to the Sioux Uprising in Minnesota in 1862 . Back then , Lincoln also caved to the blood-lusting desires of avaricious European settlers and corporate forces that coveted the sacred lands of the Sioux Nation for their own nefarious ends . Already hundreds have been seriously injured by Water Cannons indiscriminately pummeling them in the sub-freezing-wintry conditions on the plains and prairies of North Dakota . If allowed to persist many more than 38 innocent Dakota warriors will no doubt die in the end . When this happens , as it most assuredly will if allowed to continue to deteriorate the way things are going , anti-American scholars , Native Americans , environmental activists and decent people from around the world will surely have a field day bemoaning your memory and that of your Presidency . Mr. President , in all that is decency , put an end to the monstrosities going on . Declare a stop to the Dakota Access Pipeline project . Make this day truly a day of Thanksgiving for our Native American brethren and the rest of us who still hope for a bright future of the world .
