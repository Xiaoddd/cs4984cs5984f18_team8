His announcement is no surprise -- we 've been expecting him to roll back former President Obama 's decision since November . In preparation , we 've been helping plan the next international day of action targeting banks to divest from the dangerous project . Today , Bank DNB announced it is going to sell its assets in the Dakota Access Pipeline project . Original petition text : Over 100 water protectors were brutally arrested by Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- security forces -- some locked in dog kennels and shot at with rubber bullets and pepper spray -- just for standing up for their ancestral lands and our most precious resource , water . Thousands have peacefully gathered in person and in solidarity to stop this 570,000 barrel-per-day pipeline that would endanger the water and ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux . And while this inspiring work is going on , the banks that we use every day are backing the project with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and investment each . Demand your bank to stop financially supporting from the Dakota Access Pipeline and associated projects such as Energy Transfer now . North Dakota recorded nearly 300 oil pipeline spills in less than two years -- and none were disclosed to the public . The DAPL was originally going to be routed near the city of Bismarck -- but was rejected because it would have run so close to municipal water sources . Bank DNB , BBVA , TD , Wells Fargo , Mizuho Bank , BayernLB , Citibank , ING , Deutsche Bank , RBC , Credit Suisse , UBS , Scotiabank , Royal Bank of Scotland , Societe Generale , Credit Agricole , Credit Agricole , BNP Paribas , SunTrust , Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ , and ABN Amro Capital all support the project financially . These banks are vulnerable to public pressure . We are their customers and shareholders -- and they need our business . Stop the money , stop a pipeline . Tell your bank to stop funding the project now . What we are bearing witness to at Standing Rock is a moment of history . We ca n't all be in North Dakota , but we can all stand in solidarity with those who are . Which is why after you sign the petition , we will list other ways you can support to help the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe stop the Dakota Access Pipeline . This community is powerful when it comes together . Now , we need to come together now and help the Standing Rock Sioux stop the Dakota Access Pipeline .
