This is because President Donald Trump is expected to go forward with plans to sign an executive order approving the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Keystone XL pipeline , two controversial and highly protested pipelines that threaten the ecosystem in which they exist . Along with the recommendation of the Army Corp of Engineers , the pipeline was urged to build elsewhere , in order to avoid trampling sacred native lands of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe , as well as tunneling under a major waterway . Rather than go forward with that survey , it appears that the corporation merely needed to wait for Trump to enter office . Now , Trump will likely rescind the required survey , give the contractors a conciliatory slap on the ass , and send them off to destroy sacred lands and vital waterways in their quest for U.S.-made energy . This is especially infuriating when you consider the long-known fact that private citizen Trump was financially invested in the success of the Dakota Access Pipeline . Methinks quite a few . The Keystone XL pipeline was effectively killed months ago , and yet President Trump intents to reinvigorate that debate as well , with many arguing a fragile ecosystem will be threatened if the pipeline is completed .
