It seems like Cramer nailed it . But in an update to that statement released this evening , the Corps seems to be backing down . In an updated statement -LRB- see it in full below -RRB- the Corps says protesters will not be forcibly removed . Which is utterly unhelpful in terms of trying to restore law and order to south central North Dakota which has been terrorized by these protesters . but there was an error posting your comment .
