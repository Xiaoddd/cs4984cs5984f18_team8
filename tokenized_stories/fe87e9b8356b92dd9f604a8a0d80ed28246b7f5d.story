We are deeply disturbed by the police actions that have been taking place , where non violent protests have been and continue to be met with extremely aggressive tactics including ; being shot with water canons in below freezing temperatures , chemical weapons , rubber bullets , and attack dogs . These are the same inhumane methods used during WWII and the Civil Rights Movement . We feel strongly in the current political climate that those in power must be held accountable for their actions . We encourage you to remember that this planet provides for us , not the other way around . Water is life and this can not be underestimated or taken for granted in 2016 . We are aware of the long and painful history between the US and its indigenous people . Standing Rock we stand with you . The Army Corps of Engineers have set a Dec. 5 deadline for protestors to decamp from the site , with those remaining expected to be charged with trespassing and facing prosecution . In recent weeks , the peaceful protestors have reportedly been threatened with the use of water cannons , rubber bullets and concussion grenades . Lamb of God 's Randy Blythe recently visited the Standing Rock protestors and wrote a detailed account of his experience that can be read here .
