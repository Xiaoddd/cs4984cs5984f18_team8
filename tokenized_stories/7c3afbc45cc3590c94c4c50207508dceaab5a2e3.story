A crew cleans up an oil spill in Minnesota in 1991 . It remains the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history , Winona LaDuke writes . by Winona LaDuke Mar 3 , 2017 LaDuke : The Largest Inland Oil Spill in U.S. History Happened Today in Minnesota . On this day , March 3 , in 1991 , the Line 3 pipeline ruptured near Grand Rapids , Minnesota , spilling over 1.7 million gallons of oil , much of which flowed into the Prairie River , after a negligently delayed response by the company . The Prairie is a tributary of the Mississippi , so were it not for the 18 inches of ice on top of the river , the spill could have poisoned the drinking water of millions downstream , and would likely be remembered very differently . Thankfully , this was back in the days when our territories were still frozen and snow-covered in March , before climate change had fully sunk its teeth . Due to sheer luck , the cleanup was relatively quick and effective , so the spill received nowhere near as much media attention as the catastrophic Kalamazoo River spill of 2010 . It turns out that 1.1 million gallons of Alberta tar sands crude oil is not easily removed from riverbanks and sensitive wetlands . Minnesota , take heed . Line 3 is now 56 years old , well past its intended lifespan , but still carries crude oil across Northern Minnesota on its way from Alberta to Superior , Wisconsin , cutting directly across the Leech Lake and Fond du Lac Reservations . Many governmental reports refer to Lines 3 and 4 as a single unit , because of the complicated ways they work in tandem . Together , they are responsible for not only the 1991 Grand Rapids spill , but also the catastrophic 2002 spill near Cohasset , MN ; the 2007 explosion in Clearbrook , MN , that killed two workers ; a serious spill in Regina , Alberta in December 2014 ; and countless other ruptures and spills . A clean-up worker and his hose against millions of gallons of oil that spilled after a pipeline ruptured near Grand Rapids , Minnesota , on March 3 , 1991 Line 3 is crumbling . They estimate over half a million structural anomalies in Line 3 , which is about 1 every 10 feet . The company has reduced the pressure to the bare minimum that still allows oil to flow , and spends billions of dollars digging up and fixing pieces of it -LRB- they anticipate needing at least 12,000 integrity digs in the next decade just for maintenance -RRB- . In other words , Line 3 is a ticking time bomb . They cite this as justification for building a new one . But that is backwards thinking . The rational response would be to shut it down immediately and prevent them from doing this again to our grandchildren . Instead of cleaning up this mess , and putting hard-working Minnesotan union members to work doing it , Enbridge simply plans to abandon the pipeline and inevitable contamination in the ground , walk away , and build an entirely new Line 3 pipeline in a brand new corridor . The State of Minnesota , including the Public Utilities Commission -LRB- PUC -RRB- , has the power and responsibility to regulate pipeline abandonment , but there is currently no plan . Because Line 3 is the first crude oil pipeline to be abandoned in our state , there is a risk that the PUC will avoid their responsibility and set a disastrous precedent . But tribal governments , landowners , local businesses , and concerned community members across the north are standing up to say no , and demand accountability . The new Line 3 could eventually carry over a million barrels per day of tar sands , the dirtiest oil in the world . The proposed corridor threatens some of the shallowest aquifers , cleanest ground waters , most permeable soil types , and largest wild rice beds in North America . The route would also pierce the heart of Ojibwe treaty lands , where we retain the rights to hunt , fish , gather , hold ceremony , and travel . It is our responsibility as water protectors to prevent this . But this is not Morton County , and I hope we do not see armored vehicles deployed to brutalize our grandmothers and granddaughters as they stand in prayer . We expect Enbridge to clean up its old mess , and walk the enlightened path of clean energy . Until then , our communities will continue rising up to protect our waters .
