Leoyla Cowboy and Little Feather The treaty camp , erected in the direct path of the Dakota Access Pipeline , was eventually evicted by State , Federal and Private police forces . Little Feather joined hundreds in defense of the camp and was charged by the federal government for his actions . Little Feather , incarcerated since March 9 , 2017 , was originally charged with Use of Fire to Commit a Federal Felony Offense and Civil Disorder . Through a change of plea to a non-cooperating plea agreement on February 8th , 2018 , the Use of Fire to Commit Federal Felony Offense was dropped . The first federal sentencing comes alongside ongoing state-level trials . Popular Resistance provides a daily stream of resistance news from across the United States and around the world .
