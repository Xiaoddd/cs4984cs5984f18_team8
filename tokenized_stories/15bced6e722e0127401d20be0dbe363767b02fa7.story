I am amazed at the support . It is really hard to get reliable information in the news , but my friends who are there , are saying that the water protectors feel the movement is not over , it is just on hold . The doctors I have been in contact with , who are there at the camps , say there is still a lot of medical needs there . I am taking a lot of medical supplies with me tomorrow . With the blizzard that is happening right now , I think they can use all the help and supplies they can get . I will try to keep you updated when I am there , but will definitely send out some information when I return . Thank you for trusting me with your donations . I have used a fair amount of the money on supplies the current doctors told me they desperately need , and will use the rest once I return and know exactly is needed so none of your donations go to waste . It is inspiring to see people wanting to help . And to those of you who have donated that I do n't know . - thank you for your trust in me and this cause . Please keep sharing . Thank you all . I wanted to reiterate that none of the money is going to my expenses . I am funding my own travel expenses and will be camping with everyone . I have been asked to bring certain items they need . Some of those are antibiotics , wound care supplies , splinting material for broken bones , laceration kits and sutures just to name a few things . I will also be buying blankets and warm clothes as hypothermia has become a real issue . I ca n't thank you all enough . Please try again . No , the war is n't over but we are ready .
