Please show up by making phone calls . I 've written a script for anyone who needs it -LRB- at the bottom -RRB- and am reposting this call for action from last evening : They 're shooting our unarmed people again at Standing Rock with tear gas , rubber bullets , and water cannons , in 24-degree bitter weather . Call 202-761-7690 . Asap . I just did and left a message without yelling or swearing it was n't easy . - This should n't be happening . Morton County Police and DAPL officials are putting lives at risk by aiming water cannons at peaceful protectors in below freezing conditions . The Water Protectors are simply trying to ensure clean drinking water for over 18 million Americans and further protection for our planet . Ethereal theme . Theme images by badins .
