The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers gave demonstrators until 2 p.m. ET today to clear the Oceti Sakowin camp , which is located on federal land and nearby the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation . The agency and state officials cited a spring flooding threat when the snow melts . Many of the 200 to 300 protesters peacefully vacated the camp hours earlier today , the Associated Press reported . The camp , once the base of operations for thousands of tribal leaders and their supporters , was relegated to few hundred people Wednesday . Tribal leaders challenged the construction of the four-state , 1,172-mile oil pipeline , fearing that the pipeline could contaminate Lake Oahe , a primary water source for the reservation . In January , President Donald Trump signed executive orders that cleared the way for the completion of the once-delayed Dakota Access pipeline . The Dakota Access Pipeline and Keystone XL Pipeline were put on hold during the Obama administration . William Brangham talks with Valerie Volcovici of Reuters . In a Facebook post , the governor added that transportation will be provided to the center from the camp .
