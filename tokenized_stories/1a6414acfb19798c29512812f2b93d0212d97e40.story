President Joko Widodo has bestowed the right to manage customary forests on nine indigenous communities , heralding the end of decades of uncertainty and the beginning of a new era of secure right to land . The World Agroforestry Centre and Global Affairs Canada have helped one community regain control of their forests . Indonesia has had a long history of conflict over control of its massive areas of tropical forests that are spread across the many thousands of islands that make up the archipelagic nation . Declaration under former Dutch colonial rule of state ownership of all forests was rarely accepted by the millions of people who lived in them and who had managed them sustainably for centuries . The islands now known as Indonesia have long been home to thousands of distinct ethnic groups with their own languages , customs and identity .

Abdullah Mojaddedi , representing the Government of Canada , was also a special guest along with James M. Roshetko , senior agroforestry scientist with the World Agroforestry Centre and the leader of the Agroforestry and Forestry in Sulawesi -LRB- AgFor -RRB- project . AgFor had supported the Kajang people in their struggle to achieve legal recognition of the management of their sacred forests . AgFor itself was supported by the Government of Canada . Of the nine recipients , the Kajang were noted by Widodo as a national model from which others could learn . The road leading to recognition was long and fraught , with conflict between the Kajang , different levels of government and the private sector over control of the forests .

The deforestation not only increased carbon emissions and contributed to global warming but subsequent agricultural uses have struggled to maintain soil fertility and productivity owing to increased erosion and general degradation of the land that followed the loss of the forests . That first initiative faced many challenges and for various reasons could not be implemented . Saputra watching a fellow Kajang at work weaving a palm-leaf roof panel .

One of its objectives was to increase the awareness , understanding and technical capacity of participatory governance of agricultural land and forests . Our collaborative effort lead to the emergence of the Bulukumba District Decree no . AgFor partner Balang conducted various studies , such as a stakeholder analysis , categorization of tenure , classification of formal and informal access rights , cataloguing of forest policies , and consideration of the various cultural practices .
