Caroline Grueskin , Tribune Buy Now The feeling at camp on Monday was busy but calm . The clash came as protesters sought to push past a bridge on a state highway that had been blockaded since late October , according to the Morton County Sheriff 's Office . The attempt escalated into hours of conflict in which protesters reportedly threw rocks and logs at police , who responded with tear gas , rubber bullets and cold water . It was the most tense conflict between law enforcement and opponents of the 1,168-mile crude oil pipeline in weeks , and led to at least 26 serious injuries among protesters , according to a camp medical group , and one officer was reportedly hit in the head with a rock . Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier , who said police used fire hoses not water cannons as reported by numerous protesters , said water is not normally used by his department as a method to disperse a crowd . He said field commanders on scene who made the decision to use fire hoses on protesters considered the effect the water would have on people in the cold temperatures . when asked whether the use of force was necessary to keep officers safe . Law enforcement would consider using water again , he said . Kirchmeier said local law enforcement has begun getting federal aid in the form of Customs and Border Patrol officers . Protesters have voiced concerns that a leak in the pipeline would contaminate the Missouri River and Angela Bibens , an attorney who works at the camp , did not miss the irony that people protesting about protecting water were being repelled with it . Bibens said her team was taking statements throughout the day in preparation for a potential lawsuit alleging police brutality . Amnesty International said Monday they would send human rights observes to the pipeline protests , for their fourth visit since August . Treating injuries Michael Knudsen , a member of the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council , was giving medical treatment at the front line of the protest on Sunday night . He said people were suffering mostly from hypothermia , as well as blunt trauma from the rubber bullets and tear gas contamination . Knudsen said ambulances from Standing Rock , Cheyenne River , Kidder and Morton counties were present . According to a release from the medic and healer council , 300 people in total were injured in some form . At least 26 seriously injured people had to be evacuated by ambulance to three area hospitals , according to the release . Sanford Health spokesman Jon Berg said nine people were treated at Sanford but he could not release information on their condition . Cecily Fong , public information officer for the Department of Emergency Services said six were treated at the Fort Yates Hospital . One person was in serious condition at the Hennepin County Medical Center , according to the hospital . Among the most serious injuries were a man who had a seizure , an elder who had to be resuscitated and a woman suffering an eye injury from a rubber bullet to the face , according to the release from the medic and healer council . Protesters criticize the barricade as blocking emergency services and suggest it is being used to prevent access to construction sites just north . North Dakota Department of Transportation spokeswoman Jamie Olson said the department has not received any update from law enforcement on when they might be able to come do testing . She said testing can still be done despite the cooler temperatures but snow or ice would complicate the process . ` Figured it was time ' Aidoneus Bishop helped pull one burned vehicle off the bridge Sunday night . He said the move was the end of a two-week-long ritual , in which he would pull a semi-truck up to the burned vehicles as if to tow them , then turn back around to camp . Protesters started arriving to check on what was happening . From there , officers started firing the rubber bullets and more people gathered on the bridge and across the fields to the sides . This led to the long confrontation with police , in which protesters started fires and allegedly threw rocks and burning logs at officers , according to Kirchmeier . Law enforcement responded by spraying the protesters with water and firing rubber bullets , tear gas and pepper spray into the crowd . Protesters left the bridge late Monday at the request of tribal elders after police warned the crowd that they had found firearms , the Associated Press reported . Bishop said police were reinforcing the barricade with razor wire as protesters retreated . Among the crowd on the bridge Sunday night was Elih Lizama , 24 , who stayed for four hours despite several hits from rubber bullets , he said . He fended off some of them with a plastic container lid , which ultimately broke , and then picked up a piece of sheet metal , which he said worked better . He came back to camp after four hours when his girlfriend said it was time . Bismarck Tribune reporter Jessica Holdman and Forum News Service reporter Amy Dalrymple contributed to this article .
