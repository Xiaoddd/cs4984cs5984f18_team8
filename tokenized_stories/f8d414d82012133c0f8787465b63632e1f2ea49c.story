CST By Valerie Volcovici CANNON BALL , N.D. -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Two weeks after a victory in their fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline , most protesters have cleared out of the main protest camp in North Dakota - but about 1,000 are still there , and plan to remain through the winter . These folks say they are dug in at the Oceti Sakowin Camp in Cannon Ball , North Dakota , despite the cold , for a few reasons . Most are Native Americans , and want to support the tribal sovereignty effort forcefully argued by the Standing Rock Sioux , whose land is adjacent to the pipeline being built . Future decisions on the 1,172-mile -LRB- 1,885-km -RRB- pipeline are likely to come through discussions with the incoming administration of Donald Trump , or in courtrooms . At one point the camp had about 10,000 people , including about 4,000 veterans who showed up in early December - just before the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied a key easement needed to allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to run under Lake Oahe , a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River . After the Corps decision , Standing Rock chairman Dave Archambault asked protesters to go home . The camp 's population now runs from 700 to 1,000 , depending on the day , and many come from the nearby Standing Rock reservation where they live . Logistics are key for those still at the camp , located on federal land . Theron Begay , a Navajo journeyman who is a certified construction worker and heavy machine operator , has been put in charge of winterizing the camp . He is training volunteers to build structures that can withstand sub-zero temperatures and bitter winds , as well as compost toilets . Some people at the camp have gotten pneumonia , and they and others went to an emergency shelter that was built three miles away to escape the cold . Because the Oceti Sakowin camp is located on a flood plain , waste from the camp poses risks to the nearby Cannonball River . Tribal leaders have said the camp may need to move if it wants to remain active . North Dakota 's Governor Jack Dalrymple said in a Tuesday statement that he and Archambault recently met to discuss reducing tensions between the tribe and law enforcement . They are discussing reopening the nearby Backwater Bridge on state highway 1806 , which has been blockaded since Oct. 27 , when activists set vehicles on fire . Some still at the camp worry that if they leave , Energy Transfer Partners will restart construction . ETP asked a federal judge on Dec. 9 to overrule the government 's decision and grant the easement . The judge declined that request ; the parties are due back in court in February . The Army Corps is considering alternatives , which could take months . Trump , who owned ETP stock through at least mid-2016 , according to financial disclosure forms , could order the Army Corps to grant the permit . His choice for U.S. Energy Secretary , former Texas Governor Rick Perry , is on ETP 's board . Protesters who remain at the camp are still receiving donations of money and supplies from people across the United States . On a recent visit to the camp 's emergency shelter it was filled with boxes delivered via Amazon.com . Goldtooth said tribal leaders are talking about an exit plan for the camp .
