Hass : 46 long years John . We met in Vietnam , when we a lot younger my friend -LRB- smiles -RRB- . We were doing wildlife and vegetation studies in your AO -LRB- area of operations -RRB- . Hass : As usual , and as government agencies do and BLM and DOI are extremely guilty , they pretend that science guides its wild horse and burro management strategies . -LRB- shakes his head negatively -RRB- . . There is no pertinent reasoning to use it right now and especially on wild horses or much of anything else for that matter . Our wildlife and environment is simply too important to be so frivolous with such activity , especially an unknown situation , as fertility drugs used in our natural environment . Hass is a retired biologist previously with the NSA . share this petition with your friends and family via email . The Spin Dr. 's and some ignorant horse advocates are pushing fertility control on underpopulated wild horses . Know the truth and expose those spewing the spin . control research trials are big business . Left unchallenged , wild horses and burros will continue to be lab rats for human fertility control research . Rounding up federally protected wild horses and burros has been documented as cruel . Warehousing them for decades is fiscally irresponsible . Clearing wild horses and burros off public land -- for industrialization , fracking , grazing and the water grab -- goes against the 1971 Free Roaming Wild Horse and Burro Act put in place to protect the living legends of the American West . We request population studies for each herd management area -LRB- HMA -RRB- and each herd area -LRB- HA -RRB- because we are gravely concerned there are less than 18,000 wild horses and burros in the 10 western states combined . horses are underpopulated despite spin from the forces that want to perform heinous sterilizations in the field . Humane fertility control could be looked at as an option only after scientific population studies have been conducted for each herd management area . The EPA approved restricted-use pesticides known as PZP and Gonacon have risks as do other drugs ... now America 's wild horses and burros are being managed to extinction . horses are a returned-NATIVE species in America .

Such growth is biologically impossible . Kiger is not an isolated example , although it is the worst found so far . An independent study reviewed BLM roundup-records for a representative sample of four herd management areas composed of 5,859 wild horses -LRB- Gregg , LeBlanc , and Johnston , 2014 -RRB- . While the researchers found an overall birth-rate of just under 20 percent , they also found that half of foals perish in their first year of life . Thus , the effective foal-to-yearling survival-rate is just 10 percent . Further , adult wild horses also perish . They succumb to illness , injury , and predation . Their death-rate must be taken into consideration as well . Another ruse BLM employs is restricting maximum herd-size below minimum-viable population -LRB- MVP -RRB- size . BLM is distributing grant-money to universities and researchers to study more ways of dealing with the phantom overpopulation . All manner of sicko experiments are being carried out on the wild horses , such as treating them with endocrine disruptors and sterilizing them surgically .

PZP tricks the immune system into producing antibodies that attack the ovaries , inducing ovarian dystrophy , oophoritis -LRB- inflammation of the ovaries -RRB- , and ovarian cysts . Worse yet , per radioimmunoassay , the PZP antibodies are transferred from mother to young via the placenta and milk . The antibodies cross-react with and bind to the zonae pellucidae of female offspring . Although hyped as a ` non-hormonal ' method of birth-control , PZP causes estrogen-levels to plummet as the ovaries degenerate . In herds under PZP ` management , ' the birthing season extends to nearly year-round , putting the life of the foals and mares at risk . Filles injected with PZP before they have reached puberty are particularly vulnerable to immediate sterilization . control research trials are big business .

Federal authorities ring the alarm for the overpopulation of wild horses on the land . There will be 150,000 in five years if nothing is done to stop their expansion .
