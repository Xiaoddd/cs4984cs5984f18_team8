All Rights Reserved . Mossad ran a fake diving resort for tourists in Sudan . Peres , alongside then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , U.S. President Bill Clinton and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat on their way to sign the accords . That trust has been shaken , if not shattered last night . That was the sum of the protests in the middle class neighborhood . No-one took to the streets and in the restaurants and coffee shops , people continued eating peacefully . Meanwhile , on the Asian side of the city , Erdogan made his victory speech in front of thousand cheering supporters who shouted his name and kissed his pictures they held aloft . The Supreme Election Commission had stopped reporting the results before the vote-counting had ended and the opposition parties , which had campaigned against the proposed changes to the constitution , announced that they believed it was they who had won . The Kurdish party HDP also announced that it would formally challenge the results . Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan , accompanied by his wife Emine Erdogan , addresses his supporters in Istanbul , Turkey , late April 16 , 2017 .

They also claim that the election commission suspiciously stopped reporting the results during the counting and when it resumed , hundreds of ballots had been wiped off the tally . Pundits on government-aligned news channels explained this as an expression of the hope of Kurdish voters that after his victory , Erdogan would renew the peace process with the Kurdish underground movement PKK . But HDP politicians pointed at this a source of possible fraud , noting that half a million Kurds , displaced by the fighting , were unable to vote . In some vote-counting centers , fights between representatives of the different parties were reported . This was a surprise especially in Istanbul , a city long considered an AKP stronghold and where Erdogan was once mayor . It is even lower than the vote in favor of Erdogan himself in the 2014 presidential election , which stood at 51.8 percent . Hardly a resounding mandate for such major constitutional change . The Europeans will wait for the report by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe -LRB- OSCE -RRB- , which has been monitoring the elections , before they decide . Erdogan won . He now begins a long process which is scheduled to lead in two and a half years to presidential and parliamentary elections in which he believes he will be reelected , with much greater powers and a weaker parliament . A victory which nearly half of Turkey , perhaps more than half , does not recognize and disputes its validity . Today , more than ever , Erdogan is a controversial leader heading a nation split down the middle . Your comment was successfully submitted and will be published in accordance with site policy .
