This seemingly nice , quiet woman in loose yoga pants had not raised any alarms whatsoever . It was my first test . I failed . I saw her clutching her purse as she walked down the aisle towards me . She seemed harmless . I let her in to the window seat , and she unwrapped a piece of gum and put it in her mouth . I tried to give her room to get comfortable . She snapped herself into the seat . Ok , just push play on your headphones and zone out . She asked the one question I wanted to avoid . she said . I stammered , then decided to give as little information as possible . Yeah , that sounded good . I said Cannonball instead of Standing Rock . It was an attempt to give her an out . That way , if she was not in support of the water protectors and what they stand for she could easily accept my answer and move on to some other topic , saving us both the headache of having to debate our beliefs on the hour-and-a-half flight to Bismarck . Still not looking at me . I began to get nervous ; maybe it was worse than I thought . She seemed to be digging . Maybe she wanted in . Way in . I felt relief . Maybe I was the one in confession . She nodded her head , still never looking at me . Things fell cold . I tried to weigh out my options and ultimately decided to try and bridge the gap . I was going to be beside her for the next hour , I had to find some sort of common ground . I asked . I replied . She glanced at me . A glance that , I know now , was one of dark pleasure . I had fallen into her trap . We went to speak with female voters in North Carolina to campaign for Donald Trump . She looked at me and held it . I swallowed my gum . My mouth went dry . That Kevin Cramer . Now we both knew we were on completely different sides of the political spectrum . Things went cold between us again . Recklessly , I doubled down on my bridge-building attempt . So , I have friends on both sides of the issue . My plan for this project is to stay away from the politics of it all and just follow people in regards to the election . Breathe . Just chew . Wipe the sweat from your forehead . Answer the question . Deciding to stay away from the politics , I opted to take a more personal approach . The big wigs . We all need to be better at saving . I have to save . She seemed like she wanted a fight . I decided to dig in . This was becoming a battle . It felt like the air left my lungs . We both went silent . My chest felt hollow , breathing became laborious . Lines had been drawn in the sand . This is the issue . The one , big , glaring issue . It is a complete divide in a way of being , a way of existing on this planet . I thought of all the wars fought over the centuries , of all the atrocities that humans have inflicted upon themselves ; war , slavery , genocide . All of them justified through an interpretation of what being a human is , an interpretation of what makes me better than you , or me better than that . An interpretation that breaks any harmony between humans and the natural world around us . An interpretation spawned from flawed human beings . No politician , religion , status update , meme , or conversation on a plane can change something so rooted in our fellow humans . Nothing can stand in your way ; not God , armies , animals , the earth , and certainly not other humans . I thought of the Trail of Tears , I thought of pictures of Chief Spotted Elk -LRB- Big Foot -RRB- frozen dead at the Wounded Knee massacre in 1890 , I thought of those old pictures of black folks hanging from trees , I thought of pictures of the Holocaust , I thought of my grandpa getting hit with shrapnel in World War II , I thought of pictures of Indian children with short hair and school uniforms in front of boarding schools , I thought of wars fought in Iraq , Afghanistan , Vietnam , I thought of any number of environmental catastrophes throughout time , and I thought of the friends that I saw maced by militarized police and private security teams at Standing Rock for trying to protect our water from being polluted . I thought of all these things . All of them seemingly unconnected , but at that moment , to me , they told one story . We spoke again , not anymore about oil or Standing Rock . Both of us want happiness , but we totally disagree on how one should go about getting it . I told her bye and good luck . As I rented a car I saw her talking with her family . She was laughing with them , and I imagined that she just told the story of the silly Indian she sat next to that thinks there are issues with the oil industry . I rented a Jeep and drove another hour to Standing Rock . As I pulled into the entrance and passed the hundreds of flags planted by different tribes from across the nation , I began to hear familiar sounds of the drum and singers coming from the main fire . I rolled down my window . The singing got louder , and I began to breathe again . For more on Standing Rock , read Liz Blood 's article , Mni Wiconi .
