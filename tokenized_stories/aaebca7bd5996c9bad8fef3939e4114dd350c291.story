Read more stories like this at hakaimagazine.com . The food was prepared over an open fire in a wall-less kitchen building ; the aroma of coffee mingles with the wood smoke and the salty sea breeze . The planks of the floor and walls are fitted together loosely , so you can see chickens scratching underneath from inside . The roof is made of thatched palm leaves and the windows are square holes , with solid wood shutters to close out violent evening winds . Some of their children , aged two through 11 , race through the house . The family members joke with one another in Rama English -LRB- also known as Rama Cay Kriol -RRB- , the native language for most members of the Rama community . This English creole is incomprehensible to speakers of standard English . Fishing is his primary source of income , as is common for Rama men . Elsewhere on the island , both men and women are preparing their canoes for a trip inland to plant corn , beans , and breadfruit in their farmland . Unlike most Rama , Becky McCray has a college degree and speaks fluent Spanish . Their territory is shared with the Kriols , descendants of Africans who adopted the Rama way of life centuries ago . The Rama-Kriols hold a communal title not only to the nine settlements where community members live , but also to the 4,843-square-kilometer territory where they fish , hunt , and farm . If current construction plans for the canal go ahead , that territory will be severed in two . The massive Nicaragua Canal planned by a secretive Chinese billionaire , Wang Jing , and managed by his company , the Hong Kong Nicaragua Development Group -LRB- HKND -RRB- , will stretch from the Pacific coast , across Lake Nicaragua , to the Caribbean coast and is destined to wipe at least one Rama village off the map . It will also make travel between the northern and southern parts of the territory impossible , at least as the Rama travel now , in small motorboats and wooden canoes . Rama farming techniques involve elaborate field rotation and substantial travel to reach the fields ; the canal will both reduce the available farmland and render much of it inaccessible . Although the Rama community is among the least powerful groups in Nicaragua , an international court case currently underway gives them and other canal opponents a glimmer of hope . The proposed route of the Nicaragua Canal cuts across the country and bisects Rama-Kriol territory . -LRB- Mark Garrison -RRB- Nowhere is concern about the canal more acute than the village of Bangkukuk Taik , about two to three hours south of Rama Cay by motorboat over the open ocean . The isolated village is home to about 140 people , including 15 or so who still speak Rama , an indigenous language in the Chibchan family related to languages spoken as far south as Colombia . Bangkukuk Taik is among the most isolated of the nine villages in the Rama-Kriol territory and is the only place where there are regular classes in Rama for children . The Rama in Bangkukuk Taik have the deepest knowledge of traditional farming , hunting , and medicine , like how to hunt deer at night and how to collect iibu seeds and use the oil as a cough and headache medicine . The current residents of Bangkukuk Taik will be forced to move . McCray has been trying to prevent that from happening for more than two years . The day before the canal concession law was adopted by the National Assembly , in June 2013 , she and four other members of the Rama-Kriol Territorial Government traveled from Bluefields to the capital , Managua . They hoped to testify against the law they feared would destroy the traditional way of life in the Rama territory . Just as their bus to Managua was preparing to depart , three police officers boarded and demanded McCray and her companions gather their belongings and disembark . They refused . After a tense 10-minute standoff , the group was allowed to go . The following day , McCray and her companions watched in dismay as the law was adopted . Acosta filed a legal challenge to the canal concession law on July 1 , 2013 , just weeks after it was approved . The Supreme Court said the lawsuits were invalid because the law passed the National Assembly with a wide majority and because the major development project took precedence . Telemaco Talavera , the spokesperson for the Canal Commission , has similarly stated to the Nicaraguan press that the Canal Commission has all the necessary permission from the Rama-Kriol to carry out studies and other actions on their territory . The Rama-Kriol government disagrees . The Rama-Kriol government claims that it yielded to pressure from the national government and only granted the permit after environmental consultants contracted by HKND and escorted by the military entered Rama territory , causing alarm within the communities . Becky McCray is among the canal opponents currently fighting for indigenous rights in Nicaragua . The following December , she asked the IACHR for precautionary measures , which would prevent work from proceeding on the canal until the Rama had been properly consulted . The IACHR is a part of the Organization of American States and hears complaints about human rights abuses from around the Americas . In March , Acosta , McCray , and five other canal opponents traveled to Washington , DC , for the IACHR hearing . McCray represented the six indigenous groups whose territory is affected by the canal route ; the others spoke about canal-related environmental impacts , police repression of protesters , and other human-rights violations . McCray was nervous as she read her remarks in Spanish . Like other international organizations , the IACHR depends on its member states . The Brazilian government announced that it would ignore the ruling and subsequently broke off its relationship with both the commission and the Organization of American States . The commission removed its requirement that the government consult with the indigenous groups . In the Nicaragua Canal case , the IACHR issued a summary of the March proceedings in late June , which included a confirmation that the commission had asked the Nicaraguan government for proof that they adequately consulted with the Rama and studied the environmental impacts . The deadline for Nicaragua to respond to the request is confidential and is released neither to the press nor to the petitioners . As of publication , neither the Nicaraguan representatives nor the IACHR will comment on where the case stands . Aside from the Rama , whose territory will likely be the most impacted , at least four other indigenous groups will face disruption if the canal proceeds . Nicaraguan law explicitly bars indigenous land from being bought or sold ; that means the land will be rented , not expropriated , says Kautz . Yet , critics say that because this is not expressly stated in the concession law , the land is vulnerable to seizure . In fact , Acosta and other opponents say that , as written , the canal concession law gives HKND the right to expropriate land anywhere in the country , regardless of whether or not the canal is built . Legal challenges against the dry canal were unsuccessful , but it was never built for political and economic reasons . Maybe the Rama will dodge unwanted development a second time . But it will take a sustained fight from the community and international support . The answer will amaze you . -LRB- 1:32 -RRB- A mongoose is lightning fast and has razor-sharp teeth .
