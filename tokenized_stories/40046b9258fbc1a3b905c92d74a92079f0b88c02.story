map But the decision will run into a roar of opposition , said grand chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs . Other actions are also being planned , from a public interest group that has signed up hundreds of volunteers to canvass signatures for citizen-drafted legislation to block the pipeline to a group that is working to train its members on how best to physically block construction . The Kinder Morgan pipeline will not be built . Trudeau said the approval of the project was the best option for all Canadians . Texas-based energy infrastructure company Kinder Morgan said in a statement that it was excited to move forward with the project . Construction is expected to begin in 2017 and the pipeline could be in service by late 2019 . Some two years ago , as Kinder Morgan crews began carrying out survey work for the proposed expansion , the grand chief was among the more than 100 people arrested during a days-long protest . A well-respected First Nation elder and a group of retired seniors from number of churches were also among those detained , he said . Since the government announced its decision , the team at West Coast Environmental Law has fielded a steady stream of phone calls from First Nations groups curious about the possibility of legally challenging the project . Of the 120 aboriginal groups consulted by Kinder Morgan , just 39 have written letters of support for the project . The Kinder Morgan project is already facing seven legal challenges , said Jessica Clogg of the organisation , with more expected in the coming weeks . Despite being approved by the previous Conservative government in 2014 , the proposed northern BC pipeline was the target of 18 court cases . In June a Canadian court overturned the approval of the project after finding the government had failed in its duty to consult with indigenous peoples . For those opposing Kinder Morgan , she said , the lesson to be gleaned from the decade-long battle against the Northern Gateway project was clear .
