The Kichwa de Sarayaku indigenous group has detained 11 government soldiers who were traveling through their territory in northeast Ecuador . The soldiers were going by canoe along the Bobonaza River , were not on duty and had not asked permission to enter the territory , according to the Kichwa . Pictures of the soldiers sitting on benches inside a camp were also posted . The detainment comes as tensions flare once again over government-enabled corporate exploitation of native lands . A Chinese mining site was attacked by another indigenous group , the Shuar , who say the mine encroaches on their territory . In August , indigenous protesters briefly detained 27 soldiers and demanded the release of dozens of demonstrators who had been arrested . The protesters have every reason to be concerned . The Kichwa de Sarayuka endured a 17-year struggle to defend their land from attempts by corporations and the Ecuadorian government to drill for oil . The Kichwa fended off several illegal moves and bribery attempts by an Argentinean oil company , as well as attacks on camps by government forces using tear gas . The Inter American Commission on Human Rights -LRB- CIDH -RRB- found that Ecuador had violated its duty to consult with the Kichwa before signing contracts for mineral extraction . Instead , the government raided a Kichwa community and arrested five members they claimed were terrorists . This , despite that fact that the entire resistance had always been peaceful . In 2009 , Ecuador allowed the oil company to resume operations on indigenous land . Resistance only grew , and with the help of social media gained the attention it needed . Further , the government was found responsible for human rights violations and failure to protect the people of Sarayaku whose lives were at risk during CGC operations . If some elements of this story sound familiar , they should . The Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- in North Dakota is being built to enrich oil investors , with the unflinching support of armed government agents from multiple states . Sacred sites and burial grounds have already been destroyed by the oil company , and the pipeline is planned to be installed under Lake Oahe , threatening the water source of the Standing Rock Sioux . Militarized cops have used tear gas , water cannons , rubber bullets , LRADs and other riot gear to crack down on the massive protests that have taken place to resist DAPL . Protesters have set up camps , as the Kichwa did in Ecuador , for a more permanent presence . But in the corporate oligarchy of the U.S. , even the enormity of the protests are not enough to stop fossil fuel interests from getting their way . After all , they have to be paid back for the millions they are shelling out to act as militarized protection services for the company behind DAPL .
