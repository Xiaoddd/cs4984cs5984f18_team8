Boasberg did not immediately rule on whether the flow of oil , which started through the pipeline on June 1 , should be stopped . The pipeline 's construction spurred months of protests and dozens of arrests over its location near the Standing Rock Reservation and particularly its crossing under the Missouri River at Lake Oahe , the tribe 's water supply and an area it considers sacred . The tribe filed suit in July 2016 after the Corps concluded that a cursory environmental assessment of the pipeline project was sufficient and released a finding of no significant impact . The EPA said the Corps ' assessment did not sufficiently consider the impacts on water resources , and the Corps later agreed to that more in-depth review . In one of his first acts as president , Donald Trump issued a presidential memorandum directing the Corps to expedite the pipeline 's approval . But Boasberg said the Corps was looking only at the project 's construction , not the potential for a spill . Furthermore , the treatment fell short of the Corps ' duty to determine whether the project would have a disproportionate impact on minority and low-income populations , as the agency is required to do by law . Boasberg cited Council on Environmental Quality guidance on environmental justice , and case law under the National Environmental Policy Act . Losing the ability to do so could seriously and disproportionately harm those individuals relative to those in nearby nontribal communities . The pipeline 's builder , Dakota Access LLC , part of Energy Transfer Partners , has already faced leaks along the pipeline . Trump has repeatedly cited the Dakota Access project start as proof of his administration 's progress on lifting government restrictions on development . And I took none . Actually , none . But Boasberg 's ruling makes clear that Trump 's signature was not the final word on the Dakota Access pipeline .
