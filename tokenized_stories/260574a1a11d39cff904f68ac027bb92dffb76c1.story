Scahill was giving water protectors and fellow journalists in Standing Rock advice on Democracy Now . He speaks of scores of reports indicating sophisticated electronic surveillance of those attending the resistance . Although Morton County has matter-of-factly denied conducting electronic surveillance , Scahill disagrees . Democracy Now filmed a clash between the personnel and protesters , where contractors released attack dogs . Several dogs were filmed reluctantly charging crowds of men , women , and children with blood drenched maws . Days after it went viral , an arrest warrant for Democracy Now host Amy Goodman was issued . Even green party presidential candidate Jill Stein was charged for her participation in protests . Tiger Swan is an interesting character in the tale . According to Earth Island , the company maintains offices in Iraq ; Afghanistan , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , India , Latin America , and North Carolina . The firm was founded by former Delta Force operative James Reese , Earth Island reports . Its operatives are deployed around the world , participating in operations like kill-capture raids . Delta Force is also attached to the Joint Special Operations Command , which Scahill has also covered extensively . Perhaps unsurprisingly , Tiger Swan also has oil industry connections through advisory board member Charles Pittman . Prince served on a SEAL team , and started Blackwater after being discharged . The latest viral DAPL video shows authorities using a water cannon on protesters in freezing temperatures . Water protectors , including the elderly , have been beaten with clubs and shot by police rubber bullets . Just hours ago , reports of a woman whose arm was destroyed by a police grenade weapon began circulating . Hundreds , in fact , are expected to bolster the numbers of anti-DAPL ground resistance . Law enforcement agencies have also refused to return to Standing Rock , including Wisconsin Sheriffs . Two officers from other departments also turned in their badges in support of water protectors . All of this represents two polarized things . One : The culmination of a build-up in police militarization , expansion , and outsourcing of surveillance programs , and the oligarchic metamorphosis of our government . Millions of people are resisting DAPL in various ways , if for no other reason , other than to offer hope for the future .
