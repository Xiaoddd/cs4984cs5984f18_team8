Passed by the UN in 2007 , UNDRIP is the most comprehensive document in the world when it comes to Indigenous cultural rights , nationhood and self-determination . In 46 comprehensive legal articles , the document basically means Indigenous peoples can and should live as Indigenous peoples . You read that right . UNDRIP means Indigenous peoples have legal rights to maintain cultures , identities and communities , and nothing should stand in their way . For Canada , UNDRIP is a game-changer . Adopting it , to begin with , means no more Indian Act . No more draconian financial and legal control of Indigenous communities by a stifling Indigenous and Northern Affairs Department . Indigenous languages legally recognized as founding languages in Canada . Viable Indigenous economies . Healthy Indigenous bodies . Success . UNDRIP covers it all . Canada would be legally responsible to focus on these areas comprehensively . Unsurprisingly , UNDRIP spends a great deal of time talking about land . Approximately one-third of the document describes about how Indigenous communities must have access to traditional territories and suitable land to live healthy and productive lives . I know , UNDRIP is a tall order . Then , it was completely shelved . But this has never dissuaded Saganash . A residential school survivor who helped craft UNDRIP in the early 2000s , Saganash proposed his bill in 2016 and spent more than two years insisting that Canada fully commit to the document . He called it his career goal . The vote was 206-79 . It was met with cheers and a standing ovation . That is , except for the 79 Conservative MPs who voted against it . Two of them , one from Alberta and one from Saskatchewan , even high-fived when voting against . Now , I understand politics . They are desires without the weight of delivery . We are a plaything . A toy . Something to entertain . Something Canada uses for things such as an Olympic logo . Then , the game is over . An investment , even . When it comes to selfies or ornaments or crying , governments love Indigenous peoples . Canada needs more people like Romeo Saganash , people who believe in change . Because right now Canada is a game . One that Indigenous peoples are losing . Just look at the high-fives . Reconciliation is here .
