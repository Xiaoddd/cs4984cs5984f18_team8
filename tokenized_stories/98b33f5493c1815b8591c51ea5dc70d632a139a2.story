But Trump and the firm will have to get through Nebraska farmer Art Tanderup first , along with about 90 other landowners in the path of the pipeline . They are mostly farmers and ranchers , making a last stand against the pipeline - the fate of which now rests with an obscure state regulatory board , the Nebraska Public Service Commission . The group is fine-tuning an economic argument it hopes will resonate better in this politically conservative state than the environmental concerns that dominated the successful push to block Keystone under former President Barack Obama . They contend the pipeline will provide mainly temporary jobs that will vanish once construction ends , and limited tax revenues that will decline over time . They face a considerable challenge . Now Tanderup and others are gearing up for another round of battle - on a decidedly more local stage , but with potentially international impact on energy firms and consumers . The latest Keystone XL showdown underscores the increasingly well-organized and diverse resistance to pipelines nationwide , which now stretches well beyond the environmental movement . Another ETP pipeline in Louisiana has drawn protests from flood protection advocates and commercial fishermen . Faded signs around the farm still advertise the concert Willie Nelson and Neil Young played here in 2014 to raise money for the protests . Keystone offers a path to get heavy crude from the Canada oil sands to refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast equipped to handle it . TransCanada has route approval in all of the U.S. states the line will cross except Nebraska , where the company says it has been unable to negotiate easements with landowners on about 9 percent of the 300-mile crossing . The commission has scheduled a public hearing in May , along with a week of testimony by pipeline supporters and opponents in August . Members face a deadline set by state law to take a vote by November . TransCanada declined to comment in response to Reuters inquiries seeking a more precise number and description of the jobs , including the proportion of them that are temporary - for construction - versus permanent . Trump has been more specific , saying the project would create 28,000 U.S. jobs . The study indicates those jobs would be temporary , including some 16,100 at firms with contracts for goods and services during construction , and another 26,000 , depending on how workers from the original jobs spend their wages . The firm will pay property taxes on the pumping stations along the route , but not the land . Art and Helen Tanderup talk about where the Keystone XL Pipeline will cut through the farm that has been in his wife , Helen 's family for more than 100 years near Neligh , Nebraska , U.S. April 12 , 2017 . The alliance plans to target the commissioners and their electoral districts with town halls , letter-writing campaigns , and billboards . During the televised ceremony where Trump awarded the federal permit for the pipeline , he promised to weigh in on the Nebraska debate . Love , the White House spokeswoman , said she did not know if Trump had called Nebraska officials . The commission members - one Democrat and four Republicans - have ties to a wide range of conflicting interests in the debate , making it difficult to predict their decision . According to state filings , one of the commissioners , Democrat Crystal Rhoades , is a member of the Sierra Club - an environmental group opposing the pipeline . Another , Republican Rod Johnson , has a long history of campaign donations from oil and gas firms . The others are Republicans with ties to the farming and ranching sectors - including one member that raises cattle in an area near where the pipeline would cross . All five members declined requests for comment . PREPPING THE WITNESSES TransCanada has been trying since 2008 to build the 1,100-mile line - from Hardisty , Alberta to Steele City , Nebraska , where it would connect to a network feeding the Midwest and Gulf Coast refining regions . The firm had its federal permit application rejected in 2015 by the Obama administration . The Ogallala aquifer supplies large-scale crop irrigation and cattle-watering operations . Steskal dug his boot into the ground on his property , kicking up sand to demonstrate his biggest concern about the pipeline . TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said the company has a good environmental record with its existing Keystone pipeline network in Nebraska , which runs east of the proposed Keystone XL . The company , however , has reported at least two big pipeline spills in other states since 2011 , including some 400 barrels of oil spilled in South Dakota last year . The Domina Law Group is helping the opposition by preparing the landowners , including the Tanderups and Steskals , for the August hearings , much as they would prepare witnesses for trial . Eminent domain allows for the government to expropriate private land in the public interest . But Jorde said he thinks TransCanada would struggle to meet that threshold in Nebraska .
