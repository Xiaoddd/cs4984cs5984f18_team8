DAKOTA ACCESS New legal bid raises core arguments against pipeline Ellen M. Gilmer , E&E News reporter Published : Friday , February 24 , 2017 The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe is going back to the basics in its latest move against the Dakota Access pipeline , focusing on the fundamental legal issues in the case . The tribe filed its motion for partial summary judgment late Wednesday night , urging the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to scrap federal approvals for the contentious oil project . Tribal lawyers say the Army Corps of Engineers violated relevant laws and failed to adequately consult with American Indian tribes when it approved initial pipeline permits and a federal easement across Lake Oahe . The latest legal maneuver comes a week after the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed a similar motion arguing that pipeline approvals violated treaties between the Sioux and the federal government -LRB- Energywire , Feb. 15 -RRB- . Both tribes have been engaged in a lawsuit challenging the pipeline since last summer . According to Cheyenne River lawyers , approval of the Dakota Access pipeline threatens the heart of the Army Corps of Engineers ' job in the area : managing water through its Missouri River Mainstem Reservoir System . The system , part of the 1944 Flood Control Act , manages water for flood control , irrigation , navigation , water supply and other purposes . The Army Corps ' approvals of the pipeline also run afoul of the agency 's tribal trust obligations , the brief says . Both Cheyenne River and Standing Rock are asking the court to toss pipeline permits and the Lake Oahe easement . Dakota Access and the Army Corps have until March 23 to respond . Cheyenne River is also moving forward with a separate bid to pause pipeline construction based on religious freedom claims . The court is set to hear arguments Tuesday on the tribe 's request for a preliminary injunction freezing the project while the litigation plays out . Lawyers for Dakota Access and the Army Corps slammed the request in briefs this week , and the tribe is scheduled to respond today -LRB- Energywire , Feb. 22 -RRB- . Groups that have recently filed briefs include the National Congress of American Indians , Association on American Indian Affairs , Pueblo of Pojoaque , University of New Mexico School of Law 's Natural Resources and Environmental Law Clinic , National Indigenous Women 's Resource Center , and Oglala Sioux Tribe of South Dakota . That tribe recently filed its own lawsuit challenging the pipeline . Both Standing Rock and Cheyenne River issued statements last night disputing the claim , arguing that Trump officials have routinely blown them off . Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II noted that the only meeting he had scheduled with the new administration was derailed when Trump officials issued the final pipeline easement while he was on a flight to Washington . pipelines Related Headlines PIPELINES FERC restarts Atlantic Coast project Energywire : Tuesday , September 18 , 2018 PIPELINES N.Y. project backer heads back to court Energywire : Tuesday , September 18 , 2018 PIPELINES Warren , Markey press company , regulators on Mass. blasts E&E Daily : Tuesday , September 18 , 2018 PIPELINES NTSB homes in on cause of deadly Mass. .
