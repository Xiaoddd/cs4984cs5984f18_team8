DARK SEVIER PHOTO , FOR THE MONTANA STANDARD Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Editor 's note : Butte writer Suzanne Stefanac , photographer Dark Sevier and KBMF radio station manager Clark Grant went to Standing Rock late last week . Traveling with them were two Native American men from Butte , Alonzo Willis and Isaiiah Other Bull . For Alonzo Willis of Butte , being sprayed by a water cannon in subfreezing temperatures was n't the worst part of a Sunday night confrontation at Standing Rock . It was seeing a woman severely injured . He said he and Butte friend Isaiiah Other Bull were close to protester Sophia Wilansky when she was injured in a confrontation with police . After the water-spraying , the crowd had thinned out to fewer than a dozen people . Two of them -- including Wilansky -- were near a barricade on the highway . Law-enforcement at the scene denied using grenades , and said the Wilansky may have been hurt by a propane tank being used as a weapon by the protesters . But Wilansky , Willis , Other Bull and other eyewitnesses dispute that account . He said the police were firing tear gas canisters while she was down . Other Bull was also nearby , and his account matches Willis ' . She was trying to get up and run back and that 's when they threw that grenade at her . Big old wound . All open . Willis said he saw men get out of a giant armored vehicle labeled Stutsman County -LRB- N.D. -RRB- . They did n't act like professionals at all . They acted like were in a different country and they were in a war . Afterward , both Willis and Other Bull said the event had changed them . Other Bull , 23 , lives in both Butte and on the Cheyenne reservation in Lame Deer . His mother , Michaelynn Hawk of Butte , belongs to the Crow nation and is executive director of the Indian People 's Action . ... we were all there to save Mother Earth .
