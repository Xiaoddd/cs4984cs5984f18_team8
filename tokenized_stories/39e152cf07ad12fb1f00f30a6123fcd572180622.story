Standing up for Standing Rock . Photo Angus Mordant The Standing Rock protests in the US against the construction of 1,886 kilometre underground oil pipeline has garnered international support . Part of the proposed pipeline cuts through contested Indian Sioux territory and there are concerns a leak could have severe environmental impacts . The panellists are Dr Shawn Wilson , an Opaskwayak Cree from northern Manitoba , Canada and Southern Cross University academic ; human rights activist Dr Cristy Clark from the School of Law and Justice at Southern Cross ; and Elly Bird , a Lismore City councillor and one of the leaders of the Gasfield Free Northern Rivers campaign . Dr Shawn Wilson said with Standing Rock evolving into an international protest movement , it called into question the difference between a protestor and someone who is defending themselves from a home invasion . So corporate profit comes ahead of risks to the environment , community cohesion , or cultural continuity . questioned Dr Wilson . He said Standing Rock represented more than a pipeline protest . Free event . Note too how water-bearers & First Nation people arrested during the protest still await their prison prime time .

I dont understand why Cr Bird is speaking when she is one of the supporters for the development to go ahead . Indeed she is well aware of the significance to the Bundjalung but she ignores their pleas , breaks her promises and is just another local pollie making a name for herself . Seems that the Bentley blockade has been a means for these pollies to grand stand some environmental credential . Former Mayor Jenny Dowell indeed was the master of this type of populism using an environmental issue . Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published .
