` script ' , ` twitter-wjs ' -RRB- ; OpenSecrets News Pipelines of funds support allies of Dakota Access project By Soo Rin Kim December 8 , 2016 A winter storm hit the Standing Rock protestors the day after the Army Corps of Engineers denied the easement needed to build the pipeline . The pipeline has been boosted by politicians who have been heavily funded by the oil and gas industry . Trump indicated his support for the pipeline , including the segment that has triggered the controversy , on Monday . Phillips 66 owns about 25 percent of the pipeline , making it the biggest partner in the project after ETP . Trump sold all his shares in companies in June , including the investment in ETP , according to his spokesperson , though no documentary evidence of that has been shared . Like many big donors this cycle , Warren flirted with other presidential prospects first , most notably former Texas Gov. Rick Perry . Perry , it turns out , is on the board of Energy Transfer Partners . Angelle , the onetime head of the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources , is a board member of Sunoco Logistics Partners , a subsidiary of Energy Transfer and one of the smaller owners of the pipeline project . While members of Congress have voiced their views on the high-profile project , the permitting process has mostly been in the purview of the states . Both the Iowa Utility Board and the North Dakota Public Service Commission have been key here . Unfortunately for protesters , the Dakota Access Pipeline is not the only pipeline plan that could be revived by the new administration . Called the Keystone XL , the pipeline proposal was a top election issue in 2014 . The Obama administration rejected it last year , but Trump says he backs it to free America from dependence on foreign oil . Beneficiaries of the pipeline would be American oil moguls operating in the region , like Hamm and the Koch brothers .
