Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump arrives to speak at Joni 's Roast and Ride at the Iowa State Fairgrounds , in Des Moines , Iowa , on Saturday , Aug. 27 , 2016 . The brim shadows your face , which gives a sinister look , as if you 'd come to town to announce the closing of the pulp factory . Your eyes look dead and your scowl does not suggest American greatness so much as American indigestion . Your hair is the wrong color : People do n't want a president to be that shade of blond . You know that now . So sad . The fans in the arenas are wild about you , and Sean Hannity is as loyal as they come , but Rudy and Christie and Newt are reassuring in that stilted way of hospital visitors . And The New York Times treats you like the village idiot . This is painful for a Queens boy trying to win respect in Manhattan where the Times is the Supreme Liberal Jewish Anglican Arbiter of Who Has The Smarts and What Goes Where . They sympathized with the civil rights movement . To the Times , Queens is Cleveland . Bush league . You are Queens . The casinos were totally Queens , the gold faucets in your triplex , the bragging , the insults , but you wanted to be liked by Those People . You wanted Mike Bloomberg to invite you to dinner at his townhouse . You wanted the Times to run a three-part story about you , that you meditate and are a passionate kayaker and collect 14th-century Islamic mosaics . You wish you were that person but you did n't have the time . Dec. 1 , 2016 . Dec. 1 , 2016 . Senator Cardin says this is necessary under the Constitution 's Emoluments Clause . Nov. 29 , 2016 . -LRB- C-SPAN -RRB- Senator Ben Cardin -LRB- D-MD -RRB- introduces a resolution urging President-elect Donald Trump to address possible conflicts of interest related to his business dealings and assets . Senator Cardin says this is necessary under the Constitution 's Emoluments Clause . Nov. 29 , 2016 . -LRB- C-SPAN -RRB- Running for president is your last bid for the respect of Manhattan . If you were to win election , they could n't ridicule you anymore . They could be horrified , but there is nothing ridiculous about being Leader of the Free World . You have B-52 bombers at your command . When you go places , a battalion of security guys comb the environs . You attract really really good speechwriters who give you Churchillian cadences and toss in quotes from Emerson and Aeschylus and Ecclesiastes . Labor Day and it is not going well . You had a very bad month . You tossed out those wisecracks on Twitter and the Earth shook and your ratings among white suburban women with French cookware declined . The teleprompter is not your friend . You are in the old tradition of locker room ranting and big honkers in the steam room , sitting naked , talking man talk , griping about the goons and ginks and lousy workmanship and the uppity broads and the great lays and how you vanquished your enemies at the bank . Profanity is your natural language and vulgar words so as not to offend the Christers but the fans can still hear it and that 's something they love about you . You are their guy . You are losing and so are they but they love you for it . What the fans do n't know is that it 's not much fun being a billionaire . You own a lot of big houses and you wander around in them , followed by a waiter , a bartender , a masseuse , three housekeepers , and a concierge , and they probably gossip about you behind your back . Just like nine-tenths of your campaign staff . You 're losing and they know it and they 're telling mean stories about you to everybody and his brother . Meanwhile , you keep plugging away . It 's the hardest work you 've ever done . You walk out in the white cap and you rant for an hour about stuff that means nothing and the fans scream and wave their signs and you wish you could level with them for once and say one true thing : I love you to death and when this is over I will have nothing that I want . Garrison Keillor is an author and radio personality . Donald Trump should be extremely worried about his presidency Donald Trump is a profoundly incompetent president I helped draft Clinton 's impeachment articles . The charges against Trump are more serious .
