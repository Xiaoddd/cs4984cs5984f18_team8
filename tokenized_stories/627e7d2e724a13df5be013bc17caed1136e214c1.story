Both the builder and tribes are preparing to go to court in the new year . Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- ETP -RRB- , the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- , has no intention of giving up easily . However , Judge Boasberg was unsympathetic to the Texas company and will not hear arguments until at least February , according to the Associated Press . In the meantime , the US Army Corps allegedly agreed to raise the water levels of Lake Oahe to make the area unstable and unsuitable for drilling , preventing ETP from trying to finish the pipeline ahead of the court ruling , according to Jordan Chariton . Ironically , raising the water levels could result in flooding the Oceti Sakowin Camp , where protesters calling themselves water protectors are staying . How this will play out under the incoming Trump administration remains to be seen , but some local lawmakers who have recently met with President-elect Donald Trump believe that the attempts to find alternative routes for the DAPL are futile .
