TOM STROMME , TRIBUNE Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Two pipeline protesters were convicted Tuesday of misdemeanors in the first Dakota Access-related jury trial in Morton County . On Monday , a 10-person trial was postponed after a judge learned some evidence had not been provided to the defense attorneys . Though the trial happened Tuesday , it was not without confusion and objections : Voliva first reached his defense attorney , William Thomason , shortly before trial and showed up seemingly unexpected in the courtroom midway through a 9 a.m. pretrial hearing . Kent Morrow , representing Shapiro , speculated that he was missing a key police report . Voliva is a part-Yupik retiree and artist who said he protested a pipeline in Alaska when he was younger . Shapiro is a teacher and farmer . Both said they worried about potential environmental consequences of the pipeline . Two other men arrested in the same incident were supposed to go to trial Tuesday , as well ; but one did not have an attorney and was not in court . The other is in California and reached his attorney , Bob Quick , this past weekend , according to Quick . No representative of the Morton County State 's Attorney 's Office appeared at the pretrial hearing to respond to the objections , and South Central District Judge Bruce Romanick was determined to proceed . Jury selection Prosecutors and defense attorneys have expressed concern in recent days over their ability to find a fair six-person jury in Morton County . Their worries were reflected in questions asked by the judge and attorneys during the selection process . One man , who said he was in stopped traffic due to this protest , was quickly excused . Other potential jurors who did not make the final panel included a Mandan city commissioner , a man with family in law enforcement and the pipeline industry , and a man who said he records protests around Bismarck-Mandan for Facebook . Among the jurors serving were a homemaker , a pharmacist , a construction worker and an antiques dealer , who all said they could be fair . Trial The evidence presented at trial consisted of testimony of three law enforcement officers who were on N.D. Highway 6 that day . Mercer County Sheriff Dean Danzeisen , who was assisting Morton County , said he looked through binoculars and saw the car containing the defendants , who were masked , pull into the intersection of Highway 6 and County Road 135 south of St. Anthony so that a convoy of protesters could proceed without stopping . He said the men got out of the car . At least one car was stuck directly behind the protesters and another went around them , he said . Not mentioned in court was that a protest was staged that day along Highway 6 at a pipeline construction site . The defense attorneys countered that the state 's case jumped to too many conclusions . And they just made some assumptions . Romanick gave them 10-day suspended sentences , meaning they will serve no jail time if they successfully complete a year on unsupervised probation . The prosecutor told the judge in court he intended to seek a hearing for reimbursement after the trial , because he contends the protesters are seeking to do economic harm to Morton County through their arrests .
