But not everyone stands to see their quality of life materially improve from the deregulated sector . More than a few Yaqui are adamant that they will see no benefits from the project . As with Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines , the Aguaprieta project comes with its own share of risks . Anyone within the second kilometre would risk second and third-degree burns . Gonzalez has pointed out that another viable route for the pipeline was initially considered by the company that could have avoided Yaqui territory altogether . He suggests this route was ultimately rejected to save costs . The other seven communities chose to accept the compensation offered . In April 2016 , they successfully fought to be granted a moratorium on its construction . On May 21 , community members removed cables which had been laid down in the preliminary stages of the gas pipeline construction . Then , after another court ruling that IEnova should remove all infrastructure within 24 hours fell on deaf ears , on August 22 the community went ahead and cut a 25-foot section out of the live gas pipeline , despite the grave risks they ran in doing so . The community has been accused of sabotage and vandalism to IEnova property but the community maintains that IEnova , a company owned by US-based Sempra Energy , is trespassing on their land and holds them responsible for all damage brought on by the construction of a pipeline to which they never consented . Whether this latest ruling will carry more weight with both local and state authorities than the previous ones remains to be seen . For the time-being , the stand-off looks set to continue . Since the new energy policy went into effect , four other pipeline projects have been suspended . Try ICMagazine.org . We tell their stories .
