The pipeline is largely complete except for the now-blocked segment underneath Lake Oahe , a Missouri River reservoir . The company constructing the pipeline , Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners , had said it was unwilling to reroute the project . It and the Morton County Sheriff 's Office , which has done much of the policing of the protests , did n't have immediate comment . The federal government has ordered people to leave the main encampment , which is on Army Corps of Engineers ' land , by Monday . But demonstrators say they 're prepared to stay , and authorities say they wo n't forcibly remove them . Earlier Sunday , an organizer with Veterans Stand for Standing Rock said tribal elders had asked the military veterans not to have confrontations with law enforcement officials , adding the group is there to help out those who 've dug in against the project . About 250 veterans gathered about a mile from the Oceti Sakowin , or Seven Council Fires , camp in southern North Dakota for a meeting with organizer Wes Clark Jr. , the son of former Democratic presidential candidate Gen. Wesley Clark . The group had said about 2,000 veterans were coming , but it was n't clear how many actually arrived . He then talked about North Dakota authorities ' decision to move away from a key bridge north of the encampment by 4 p.m. Sunday if demonstrators agree to certain conditions , saying the National Guard and law enforcement have armored vehicles and are armed . Authorities said they 'll move from the north end of the Backwater Bridge if protesters stay south of it and come to the bridge only if there is a prearranged meeting . Authorities also asked protesters not to remove barriers on the bridge , which they have said was damaged in the late October conflict that led to several people being hurt , including a serious arm injury . Protesters also are not supposed to walk , ride or fly drones north of the bridge , Laney said . The bridge blockade is something that Standing Rock Sioux tribal chairman Dave Archambault has been asking to be removed , the Bismarck Tribune reports , and something he said he would to talk to Gov. Jack Dalrymple about when they meet in person . A date for that meeting has n't been set . Cars waiting to get into the camp Sunday afternoon were backed up for more than a half-mile . The 29-year-old from Cambridge , Massachusetts , flew the first leg of the journey , then rode from Bismarck in the back of a pickup truck . Steven Perry , a 66-year-old Vietnam veteran who 's a member of the Little Traverse Bay band of Odawa Indians in Michigan , spoke of one of the protesters ' main concerns : that the pipeline could pollute drinking water . Art Woodson and two other veterans drove 17 hours straight from Flint , Michigan , a city whose lead-tainted water crisis parallels with the tribe 's fight over water , he said . On Monday , some veterans will take part in a prayer ceremony in which they 'll apologize for historical detrimental conduct by the military toward Native Americans and ask for forgiveness , Clark said .
