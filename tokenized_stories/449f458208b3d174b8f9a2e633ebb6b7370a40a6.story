Today Congress convened its first session of the 114th Congress with Republicans controlling both the House and Senate . Today Congress convened its first session of the 114th Congress with Republicans controlling both the House and Senate . As campaign manager for Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean in 2004 , he started a trend that has reinvented that way politicians run for office . But he believes that many politicians are still missing out on the power of the internet once they 're elected . That 's why Trippi is working with an internet startup called Countable , which seeks to give citizens a greater voice in national politics . The company 's online service , which launches to the public today , gives you a simple and concise overview of the bills your national representatives are debating , and it lets you instantly send emails to these representatives , telling them how you would like them to vote . Countable joins a growing wave of online tools that can improve the dialogue between citizens and representatives , including Madison , which lets you add your thoughts to both proposed bills and existing policies , and ThinkUp , a tool the White House uses to gauge popular sentiment through social media . The new service is most similar to Democracy OS , which lets governments and non-profits set up websites where people can discuss issues and vote on particular topics . But instead of building a platform that government operations must install on their own computer servers , Countable is offering a ready-made service . In other words , you do n't have to wait for your representatives to adopt anything . All you have to do is sign up and start sending your thoughts to Congress . WIRED Politics in Plain English Countable was founded by Peter Arzhintar and Bart Myers . The pair previously founded the web TV company SideReel , which they sold in 2011 . They noticed that there were plenty of sites where you can find lists of bills being debated by Congress , but understanding those bills usually required quite a bit of specialized knowledge . They decided that one of the best ways to improve the political process would be to simply create a site that explained each bill that the House and Senate is voting on in plain English . So they built Countable . For now , you need a Facebook account to use the new service . Countable taps your Facebook profile information to determine your name , location , and your national representatives . It then shows you the next piece of legislation your representatives are expected to vote on , with a short summary of the bill and a list of pros and cons . You can also click on the bill 's name to pull up more details , including voting activity , costs , links to media coverage , and the full text of the bill . But the company will also use this data to target adverting . The startup just closed its seed funding round , and it 's now working on an iOS app , which Myers says should launch in about a month . So things are just getting started , and the company plans to add more tools to the service in the future , such as the ability to get voting recommendations from advocacy groups that you trust , ask your friends how you should vote , or suggest changes to a bill . It may eventually cover state level politics as well . For example , politicians often add amendments to bills that contain additional regulations or spending unrelated to the bill in question . Myers says that Countable will post updates to bills that have such riders . The company is hiring writers from a variety of backgrounds , including politics and marketing , to ensure that the content is both accurate and understandable . Myers says the company strives to offer a balanced view of the pros and cons of each piece of legislation . To improve develop the editorial process , the company is also advised by former Reuters News publisher Andrew Goldner . The other issue is e-mailing your representatives may not be that effective . And since Countable does n't do much to verify that you are who you say you are , a lobbyist or advocacy group could sign-up for multiple accounts and make it look like constituents feel more strongly about an issue than they actually do . But Myers says this is n't much an issue , at least for now . Instead , he says , representatives are just keen to find a way to gather data from constituents in a new way . But the biggest issue facing the company is privacy . It 's hard not to worry about a company that 's compiling dossiers on people 's positions on every single bill in Congress , but Myers says the startup wo n't sell data about how its users vote on particular issues to fundraisers or anyone else .
