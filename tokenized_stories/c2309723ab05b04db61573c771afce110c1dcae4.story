-RRB- ; Tech Trends Breakthrough technologies will continue to create new value and transform experiences for businesses and consumers alike . To start 2017 we look at 15 technology trends that will unlock opportunities for growth and enable organizations to provide more meaningful experiences to their customers , employees , and society . In the instant before an accident , an AV should maneuver in dramatic and utterly non-human ways in order to preserve life . This same car in Emergency Evasive Mode might even be able to stop the cross traffic and flip the lights to red as it enters the intersection . Precision medicine changes the focus of health and medical efforts from identifying symptoms to understanding and treating the mechanisms of disease . It also focuses on environmental and social determinants of health , like your postal code . More and more , the built environment will be a system of evolution and learning , integrating with architectural aesthetics and the utilitarian function of protecting you from the elements . Here is an example of how a scenario could play out in healthcare : hospitals will shift room layouts , update signage , and adapt lighting and sound to optimize individual patient experiences . As these spaces learn and evolve , their impact will lead to both better health outcomes for patients , as well as lowering costs for hospitals . Likely Longshot Synthetic Food And Cellular Agriculture Goes Mainstream Synthetic Food And Cellular Agriculture Goes Mainstream Synthetic Food And Cellular Agriculture Goes Mainstream With a growing need for global initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , fight climate change , and evolve cruelty free foods , the race is on to define the future of human protein consumption , potentially without involving any animals in the process . They will extend well beyond the vegan aisle , where most are currently relegated , and they will taste better than ever . Likely Longshot Business Bots Will Thrive Business Bots Will Thrive Business Bots Will Thrive Internet Bots , software that runs automated tasks , will move beyond simple chat applications like customer service and scheduling support , to impact business in more profound ways . Imagine an entrepreneur whose mentor has recommended they start a new venture , selling vintage electric skateboards to the aging hipster market . The entrepreneur will commission an assortment of business bots to bring their vision to reality . The R&D bot will crowdsource the selection of designs from on-demand freelance designers , the Operations bot will manage contract manufacturers and production schedules , and the Sales and Marketing bot will optimize e-commerce channels and product promotions . As business bots become more intelligent , their ability to perform complex operational tasks and harness digitally enabled platform services will help new entrepreneurs scale their ventures , faster and with precision . Mindmaze , a pioneer in this space , is already creating virtual environments for stroke patients , causing their brains to re-wire themselves and re-establish mobility in forgotten limbs . As the creation of immersive environments becomes more accessible , we will see more experimentation in this space and continue to discover and unlock what the brain can do . Future patients of cognitive behavioral therapies and systematic desensitization can expect virtual reality to become a critical component of their treatment . On the production side , new tools and techniques for growing and harvesting are being brought online ; on the demand side , new value chains and supply chains are evolving , bringing this kind of seafood to more and more tables as the taste for them is developed over time . Likely Longshot Interface In Our Ears Interface In Our Ears Interface In Our Ears Since the early 1980s , human computer interaction has primarily been facilitated through Graphical User Interfaces -LRB- GUIs -RRB- . However , the combination of screen fatigue and technology embedded in everything from cars to homes , is exposing a need for new types of interfaces that extend beyond the visual . Recently , Apple unveiled their AirPods , which will likely lead to more ubiquitous audio experiences for one of the largest consumer demographics in the world . Rather than wait months for roads to be built , drones can quickly provide critical support to people living outside of urban areas . MGM Resorts , Wynn , and Las Vegas Sands have all recently been outfitted for solar , for example , showing that large companies are taking the first steps towards sustainable infrastructure , both to cut costs and appeal to environmentally conscious customers . One particularly intriguing concept is the idea of VR micro-experiences , which allow users to transport themselves in space and time in order to experience wonderful little moments that refresh their senses . Likely Longshot The Rise Of Soft Robotics The Rise Of Soft Robotics The Rise Of Soft Robotics Robots today are hard , made of metal , and tend to operate in a deliberate and sharp manner . Over the next few years , we will begin to see robots soften , using materials that closely resemble the human body . Taking this a step further , some R&D departments are experimenting with electro active polymers , such as a dielectric elastomer , that change shapes when a current is applied . We will see applications of this in multiple industries . For example , we will want our vehicles to be equipped with soft robotics to support us and help us perform functions in transportation ; in the work place , soft robotics can enhance our strength and precision for creative and thoughtful actions where human empathy , emotion , and life experiences are important to the outcome ; in medicine , soft robotics may not only help us treat patients , but may also find a home inside the body as well . The soft robotics revolution will be gradual but vast . As robots and robotics become increasingly pliable , they will fold into our everyday lives in interesting and vital ways . Likely Longshot Learning From Machine Learning Learning From Machine Learning Learning From Machine Learning Machine learning has been a constant on tech trend lists for years . But in training and playing against AlphaGo , the human Go players who interacted with the computer also became better players .
