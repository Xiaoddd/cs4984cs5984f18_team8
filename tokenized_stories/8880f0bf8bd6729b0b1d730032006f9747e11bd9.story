Serhed Varto , member of the KCK -LRB- Kurdistan Communities Union -RRB- Foreign Relations Committee , spoke about the occupation attacks on Bashure -LRB- Southern -RRB- Kurdistan and Rojava . Also , they do not want the democratization of the Middle East . The Republic of Turkey actually has always considered Kurds the biggest threat to its own version of the nation-state which is built on denial and assimilation of other peoples . For this reason , the fears of the Turkish state grew as the struggle of the Kurds grew , especially in North Kurdistan . The state regarded the existence of the Kurds as its own absence . A special comment deserves Iraq , said Varto . Varto pointed out that Turkey is displaying its old demagogy while trying to convince others that it is fighting against the PKK , the PYD or the YPG . In reality , the target is the Kurdish people and their achievements , those in Rojava and in Southern Kurdistan . Varto said the attitude of the Kurdistan Regional Government is not clear when it comes to Turkish occupation . We can not reject the occupiers only with condemnation , statements and civil actions . As movement , we have been displaying a great resistance against occupation since the first day . Guerrillas have managed to stop and confined occupying forces that have not been able to make a slightest advance in Lelikan for months . Undoubtedly , we will carry on this resistance until victory .
