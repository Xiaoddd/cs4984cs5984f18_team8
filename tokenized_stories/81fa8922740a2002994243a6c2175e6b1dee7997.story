Given these circumstances , Red Fawn has made the very difficult decision to enter into a plea agreement that still risks significant prison time , but removes the mandatory minimum and the possibility of life imprisonment . Fallis had initially been charged in North Dakota state court with the attempted murder of a police officer after she was arrested during the military police raid on October 27 , 2016 to seize treaty land near the Standing Rock reservation for the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- and remove an indigenous resistance camp from its path . The plea agreement is to be officially tendered in court hearing in Bismarck on Monday , January 22 , when , if Judge Hovland accepts the plea , a sentencing date will be set . If Judge Hovland does not accept the plea bargain , Fallis could still go to trial on all three charges . Notify me of new posts by email .
