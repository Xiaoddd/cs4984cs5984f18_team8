14 years later , he was found dead . Hillary Clinton 's well-heeled backers have opened a new frontier in digital campaigning , one that seems to have been inspired by some of the Internet 's worst instincts . Others , however , say Clinton has little choice but to try , given the ubiquity of online assaults and the difficulty of squelching even provably untrue narratives once they have taken hold . The task force designed to stop the spread of online misinformation and misogyny is the brainchild of David Brock , a Clinton confidant who once made a career of spreading such misinformation and misogynistic attacks against her and Bill Clinton . The mere mention of Correct the Record makes some critics seethe . Super PACs are typically prohibited from working in tandem with candidates , but Correct the Record is doing just that by exploiting a loophole in campaign finance law that it says permits such coordination with digital campaigns . The email also emphasized that Correct the Record is spending the million dollars in a way that it argues is legal under rules governing super PACs . When actor Tim Robbins was confronted on Twitter after making the dubious assertion that election fraud is robbing Sanders of votes , he accused tweeters who challenged him of being paid shills for Brock . Your check is in the mail . Correct the Record is not paying activists outside the organization to send messages , although it is arming them with instructions , talking points and postable infographics . But the Robbins response confirmed a well-established rule of social media : The kind of confrontations Correct the Record is manufacturing almost never win converts . Social media scholars say that 's not necessarily a problem . Campaigns are grappling with the reality that there is no proven strategy for stopping the spread of even demonstrably false attacks on social media , he said . The campaign has been given credit by Sanders loyalists , however , for all manner of things that it has had nothing to do with , including posting pornography on pro-Sanders Facebook pages which resulted in them being temporarily taken down . -LRB- The pages went down as a result of a Facebook software glitch -RRB- . They 're also getting ready for battle against Trump , he said . That may be true , but the effort seems unlikely to be a game changer for Clinton 's campaign , said Dan Gillmor , who teaches media literacy at Arizona State University . ALSO Obama is more popular than he has been in years . Be the first to comment Hide Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by SolidOpinion .
