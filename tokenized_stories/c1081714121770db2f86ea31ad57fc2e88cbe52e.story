The proposed 1,179-mile -LRB- 1,897 km -RRB- pipeline would link Canada 's Alberta oil sands to U.S. refineries . It has long been a lightning rod of controversy for environmental groups and worried about spills and global warming , and former President Barack Obama rejected it . But President Donald Trump backs it as part of his broad energy strategy , and says it will lower fuel prices , shore up national security and bring jobs . Volunteers for Bold Alliance , an activist group that has been fighting the project since it was proposed nearly a decade ago , are knocking on doors in parts of the state to describe the threats that possible pipeline leaks could pose to groundwater . TransCanada has said the pipeline will create jobs and public revenues , and can be operated safely . The public service commission said it will announce its decision on the route on Nov. 20 . It is charged with weighing whether the project is in the public interest of Nebraskans , but is barred from considering environmental issues because the pipeline already has an environmental permit . During hearings on the line in August , opponents argued that there was little commercial interest in the line , given the surge in U.S. drilling over the past decade that has created a supply glut and driven down crude oil prices . Led by 90 landowners whose farms lie along the proposed route , opponents said tax revenue from the project will be short-lived , jobs will be temporary , and a foreign company should not be allowed to use eminent domain to seize American farmland . TransCanada has said it has received adequate support to make the pipeline viable . But the company has yet to announce results of its Keystone XL open season to gauge interest among shippers , which closed at the end of October . The Obama administration considered the line for years before rejecting it in 2015 on environmental grounds . Trump reversed that decision swiftly after taking office , which placed the final permitting decision in the hands of Nebraska . It will be the last of three states to make a decision on the pipeline 's proposed route . Lawyer Brian Jorde , who represents landowners who oppose the line , said regardless of what Nebraska regulators decide , the pipeline will not be built soon : a decision can be appealed up to 30 days after the vote in the district court , and subsequent legal challenges can take up to two years , he said . -LRB- Additional reporting by Nia Williams in Calgary ; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and David Gregorio -RRB- Our Standards : The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles .
