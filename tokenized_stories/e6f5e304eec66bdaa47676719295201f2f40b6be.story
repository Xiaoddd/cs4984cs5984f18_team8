Poems too , and a few short stories . 24 February 2017 Water and Blood -LRB- for Ungagged 15 -RRB- First , I want to comment about the latest glaring example of how in America , the greed of the few outweighs the needs of the many . I am appalled at what has happened the past few days in Standing Rock , with the expulsion of the water protectors and the arrest of those who stayed . The writing was on the wall the instant then-President Obama broke the momentum of the struggle by giving those fighting the Dakota Access Pipeline and their supporters the fleeting , ephemeral victory of a temporary halt by an easily reversible executive order . All to make way for the black snake to carry fuel for out-dated technology that is destroying the planet , both by aggravating climate change and by poisoning the land with leaks and spills which are inevitable given the utter lack of interest in preserving infrastructure clearly evident in nearly every part of America . Water is life , and native lives matter . And now to the NHS . It will provide you with all medical , dental , or nursing care . Everyone , rich or poor , man or woman , or child can use it or any part of it . There are no charges , except for a few special items . There are no insurance qualifications . But it is not a charity . Among them , however , he quoted Margaret Thatcher saying that NHS was a given ; that no politician in the UK would ever think of touching NHS , or the social welfare support system in general . He added that if that ever happened , there would be a revolution . What I saw of NHS in the film , which also featured the systems in Canada , France , and Cuba , filled me with envy . And then medicine . For an American , it was like a fairy-tale . Your health , your safety , and your freedom depend on saving it . Go out into the streets and make yourselves heard . Deluge your MPs with phone calls , letters , emails . Campaign street to street , door to door . March , chant , scream . Hold up the American system as the example of what your life will become without NHS and declare that you deserve better . Because you do . In fact , we all do , every person on the planet . Saving the NHS can be a first step to taking back power from the market-place and putting it back into the hands of the people . Into your hands . Fight for yourselves . Fight for your friends , family , neighbors , compatriots , and guests in your country . Fight in the name of the water protectors driven from their camps by storm-troopers serving the minions of the wealthy and powerful few . Fight for all of us . Fight for me . Thig ar latha , our day will come . Keep the faith . Peace out . By religion I am a freethinking Broad Church Episcopalian . By politics I am a Marxist . After a lifetime of trying to cram my square self into too many round holes , I 've finally surrendered to my desire to write . Whether I can make a living out of it has yet to be seen .
