Construction temporarily has been halted . But in his landmark encyclical on the environment published last year , and in other statements , Francis has strongly supported arguments of the Native American-led resistance movement on three core issues : indigenous rights , water rights and protection of creation . The 1,200-mile long pipeline is designed to move oil from the fracking fields of North Dakota to Illinois . The original path of the pipeline ran next to Bismarck , the North Dakota capital , but it was rerouted because of concerns over potential contamination of water supplies . The new route instead takes it through ancestral Native American lands , including burial grounds , and would cross beneath the Missouri River at the border of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation . The Sioux native communities object that the current route will threaten their water supply , upset the ecological balance of the region , disrupt tribal traditions and violate sacred lands . And their anti-pipeline action has been sustained by Native American spirituality . The Obama administration has temporarily suspended drilling beneath the river , but the company building the pipeline , Dallas-based Dakota Access , has vowed to complete it . In conversations at Standing Rock last month , Sioux tribal leaders noted that the pontiff has been outspoken when it comes to the rights of indigenous peoples who face large-scale development projects . They are not merely one minority among others , but should be the principal dialogue partners , especially when large projects affecting their land are proposed . For them , land is not a commodity but rather a gift from God and from their ancestors who rest there , a sacred space with which they need to interact if they are to maintain their identity and values . In this discernment , some questions must have higher priority . For example , we know that water is a scarce and indispensable resource and a fundamental right which conditions the exercise of other human rights . At the global level , it is a complex system linked to many of the essential conditions for human life . A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system . In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and , it would appear , by an increase of extreme weather events , even if a scientifically determinable cause can not be assigned to each particular phenomenon . Humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle , production and consumption , in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has announced plans to evict the Standing Rock Oceti Sakowin protest camp on Monday , Dec. 5 , and no one is yet sure whether that will go forward .
