The coalition of agencies has permits in hand and financing underway to start construction next year on a 95-mile pipeline to pump groundwater from the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer east of Lockhart in Caldwell County . To fill the void until the pipeline is ready , the city entered into a temporary water-sharing agreement with Kyle and San Marcos in summer 2016 and increased its water conservation efforts . Water availability has been the buzz topic of nearly every political debate in the area for years and for good reason : As the area encompassing some of the fastest-growing cities in the country continues to attract people , resources such as water will need to sustain that growth . The Alliance Regional Water Authority , formerly known as the Hays Caldwell Public Utility Agency , formed in January 2007 to develop this pipeline plan . The cost of the project will be shared by all members in percentages proportionate to use and will mostly be paid for by the Texas Water Development Board , which committed funding for the latest phase of the project in July . Members will repay the state for the loans with water fee revenue . Members will probably need to increase water rates to cover pipeline costs . City officials anticipate gradual increases over the next three to five years . Moore said he expects construction to begin in early 2018 and wrap up in the first quarter of 2019 . Moore said the Canyon Regional Water Authority and Kyle chose to issue bonds in 2015 through the water authority and the state water board for their shares of the cost , while Buda and San Marcos are paying for their portions with cash out of their utility funds . Later project phases will cover further expansions of the system . San Marcos had even studied the idea of tapping the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer in a similar project in 2002 , but it would have cost too much , Taggart said . With the joint project , Taggart said , the city will have a supply that lasts until at least 2080 , according to city staff projections , and at a lower cost . Taggart added that he and other city officials view ensuring a long-term water supply as key to cultivating economic growth and development in the growing region . James Earp , assistant city manager of Kyle , agreed , noting that the city would see a near-doubling of its 9 million gallons per day of water availability . After residents of Bastrop and Lee counties objected to a neighbor siphoning away their water , Hays commissioners nixed the deal in 2015 . The Alliance Regional Water Authority and its individual members are studying supplemental projects to increase water supply , such as aquifer storage and recovery , which is the injection of surface water into an aquifer for later use , and direct potable reuse , which is the injection of treated wastewater into the drinking water supply . The next phase , 1B , will be paid for through a loan from the Texas Water Development Board bond program . County officials said deputies received reports of ... All rights reserved .
