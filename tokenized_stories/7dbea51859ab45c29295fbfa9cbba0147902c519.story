The states and province are to share knowledge , policy and regulatory expertise , according to the MOU . In 2015 , Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock stepped up a joint federal and state push for more CCS to enhance carbon dioxide -LRB- CO2 -RRB- - driven enhanced oil recovery -LRB- EOR -RRB- in the fossil fuel producing regions . CO2 capture efforts applied to the EOR process are seen as key to providing a long-term , low-carbon path to the production of fossil energy resources , according to a report issued in late 2016 . In signing the MOU , the officials stressed the global importance of finding key CCS technologies with an estimated 1,600 coal-fired power plants planned or under construction in 62 nations . The MOU cites CCUS as a key technology in global efforts to reduce GHG emissions . China has 922,000 MW of coal-fired generation in place . Mead said Wyoming had done groundbreaking research , and said the School of Energy Resources Integrated Test Center and Enhanced Oil Recovery Institute is working on a first-of-its-kind project to develop statewide pipeline corridors that advance CCUS efforts . He holds BA from the University of Southern California , Los Angeles ; and a MA in journalism from Northwestern University , Evanston , IL ; and completed MBA courses at Northwestern 's Evening Graduate School of Management .
