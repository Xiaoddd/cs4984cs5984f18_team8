Republican Doug Burgum ordered demonstrators to leave the camp located on land owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers by Feb. 22 , citing safety concerns that have arisen due to accelerated snowmelt and rising water levels of the nearby Cannonball River . Burgum also said in his executive order that the camp poses an environmental danger to the surrounding area . His order reaffirms a Feb. 22 deadline set by the Army Corps for the demonstrators to clean up and leave . Environmentalists and Native Americans who have opposed the pipeline , saying it threatens water resources and sacred sites , have faced a series of set-backs since President Donald Trump took office in January .
