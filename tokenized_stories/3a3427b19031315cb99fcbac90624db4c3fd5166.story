Winter conditions are intense , but spirits at camp are high . Everyone has been working together to get people to delegated warming spaces in camp and spaces on the reservation . Medics , security , and veterans have been going from shelter to shelter to do wellness checks on our water protectors . Women , children , elders and other folks who wish to leave camp are being evacuated with four wheel drive vehicles and operators who know how to use them . The road conditions are icy . Visibility is low ; however , roads are passable with four wheel drive vehicles . There have been two cases of moderate hypothermia for whom the medics on the ground provided care . The main impediment to health is not the winter , but the state . The police roadblock on ND HWY 1806 is delaying the timely evacuation of patients and vulnerable populations . We have developed the capacity to keep the campers safe and warm , but are asking the state of North Dakota to cease its inhumane and unjustifiable blockade of highway 1806 . We applaud the water protectors efforts to self-organize and care for each other , the medics & healers who have collectively held space here for months , the Standing Rock EMS for their coordination and expert care of patients , and all other groups working tirelessly to ensure the health and safety of the campers .
