The standoff lasted more than five hours in freezing temperatures -LRB- 26-degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- , during which police deployed water cannons , rubber bullets , Long Range Acoustic Devices -LRB- LRADs -RRB- , teargas , and flash-bang grenades against Water Protectors and members of the press . One 13-year-old girl was shot in the face with a rubber bullet , and at least 20 people were sent to the emergency room with serious injuries . At least one seizure has been witnessed at the front lines by our legal observation team . There have been people vomiting from the exposure to the mace . And canisters were shot at the medic area at the front line . There is at least one woman who has a broken kneecap . The attack began around 6 PM yesterday , while Water Protectors attempted to peacefully remove two military vehicles that had been blocking Highway 1806 since October 27 , ironically , in an effort to clear the path providing the most direct route from the Oceti Sakowin camp to Bismarck , ND , for emergency services vehicles . Additional hearings are set for December 5 . The WPLC continues its months-long work on the ground in North Dakota , providing Water Protectors with legal representation , jail support , legal observers , and other direct legal assistance .
