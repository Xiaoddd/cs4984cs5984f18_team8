Plans to bury an oil pipeline in the Nebraska dirt , through hilly grazing land near the Elkhorn River and flat expanses of corn farther south , had been halted . Farmers and ranchers who spent years opposing the project moved on with their lives . State-level permits and easements along the three-state pipeline route are in place in Montana and South Dakota . Nebraska regulators will hear public comment on the project at a 10-hour meeting on Wednesday . If Ms. Crumly and her allies prevail , several dozen rural landowners will have triumphed over a transnational energy company and the wishes of their president and governor . If they fail , oil will flow through the Crumly property , in a grassy strip between where cows wander and corn grows . There , the National Guard was mobilized , and hundreds of protesters faced arrest . So far there have been no mass encampments on the Nebraska prairie , no tense standoffs with the police , no highway blockades . But Jane Kleeb , a leader of the pipeline opposition , said the more muted tactics in Nebraska should not be mistaken for a lack of organization or tepid sentiments . Opponents here managed to delay Keystone XL for years during the Obama administration , challenging state permitting rules and drawing national attention to the pipeline . They have fought with lawsuits and testified about legislation . They see it as both a physical barrier to construction and a blunt statement about clean energy . We understand that . Still , if construction ever begins , opponents say they are willing to participate in civil disobedience . But opponents in Nebraska are betting that they can block the pipeline through other means . Mr. Johnston sees Keystone XL as an economic boon for the state , especially a local school district that stands to benefit from additional tax revenue . As Nebraska emerges once again as a national pivot point for Keystone XL , the matter is already settled for most landowners along the route . Years ago , and with varying degrees of enthusiasm , those farmers and ranchers accepted payments and signed papers allowing the pipeline to be built if regulators ever approved . Ronald Weber , who owns land in the same county as Mr. Johnston , said he wished the route had avoided his property . Neither Mr. Weber nor Mr. Johnston said how much they were paid by TransCanada , which proposed Keystone XL , but both said the company had treated them fairly . Mr. Johnston said he used his easement money , which was below six figures , to invest in irrigation in a field the pipeline would cross . Mr. Van Housen , who grows corn and raises cattle , is adamantly opposed to Keystone XL , which would run beneath his fields . He says he might testify against the project at hearings this summer and , if it is approved , participate in protests . But Mr. Van Housen is a registered Republican living in a Republican county in a Republican state . He voted for Mr. Trump for president , knowing full well that his candidate supported the pipeline and that Hillary Clinton did not . Along the route , some holdout landowners voted for Mr. Trump , others for Mrs. Clinton , and still others for none of the above . Mr. Van Housen says he can not reasonably expect to agree with the president on every issue . But if Mr. Trump ever passes through Stromsburg , Mr. Van Housen says he will offer him a drink from his well . Then he will tell Mr. Trump that Keystone XL is a threat to that pristine water . Most landowners along the Nebraska route have accepted payments and given TransCanada permission to build on their land . But about 90 of them , roughly 9 percent , have not . Mr. Carlson said he feared that a leak in the pipeline would imperil the groundwater he uses to drink and irrigate his crops . Many politicians here believe the construction jobs and tax revenue make the project worthwhile . Doug Zimmerman lives along the route of a different oil pipeline built by the company , in use since 2010 , and says he has had no problems . If TransCanada wanted to put in another pipeline on his land , he says he would be fine with that . But the route still traverses the aquifer , unnerving other landowners . The family ties run deep . He says he is neutral on the merits of the project . Mr. Tielke concedes that a leak is possible and could damage the creeks running through his land . But he also says that he believes pipelines are necessary , and that TransCanada intends to operate Keystone XL safely . YORK , Neb. . It has loomed ever since . The fight could not be more personal . A final resolution could still be years away . And even if a permit is granted , individual landowners could challenge the eminent domain process in local courts . Ms. Kleeb predicted that the pipeline could still be an issue during the 2020 presidential campaign . Jack Begg and Doris Burke contributed research .
