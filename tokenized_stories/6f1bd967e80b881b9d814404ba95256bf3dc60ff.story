The day after the news , on Dec. 5 , there was a huge demonstration during which most of the camp marched against the wind into a blizzard , toward the bridge that the police had occupied . And then the protesters got back to work . Even when David Archambault II , chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe , told protesters it was time to go home and be with their families for the winter , many were reluctant . And the whole thing could be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump once he takes office . But whatever happens next , the ideals that catalyzed the Standing Rock protest are not going away . Pipeline supporters , by contrast , have short-term goals . They want to finish the pipeline , start pumping oil , and start making money . Plus , the government is about to open a gleaming new water-treatment plant , so , really , the concern that a pipeline break could contaminate their drinking water is actually unnecessary . Case closed . These arguments hold up so long as you think about them only within the narrow framework of the short term . As soon as you consider the long term , they fall apart . Advertisement The long term is what brought the environmentalists there , too , even though the actual decisions made at Standing Rock so far have been more fundamentally about land rights than about climate change . These concerns intermingled at Standing Rock , and one lasting prize of the protests might be the alliances they produced , a sort of coalition of the long term : Sioux Indians worried about their drinking water . Environmental activists concerned about the viability of the planet and the way our fossil-fuel dependence gets consecrated in our infrastructure . Veterans showing up out of a wish to protect the Constitution . Black Lives Matter activists who saw their own long cause in the police brutality visited upon Native Americans at Standing Rock and across the country .

Much has been said about the Americans whose grievances have not been recognized or addressed by our current politics . Some took their dissatisfaction to the ballot box . Others took it to Standing Rock . Veterans continued arriving even after the announcement . Trump is pro-pipeline generally , and he stands to gain financially from this one specifically . He will be the only world leader to deny the reality of climate change and the first president to have been elected without prior government experience . On Wednesday , Trump named a climate change denialist to head his EPA . Oil executive Rex Tillerson is the leading front-runner for secretary of state . Short-termism is running the country . Standing Rock is not going away . The perimeter of the Oceti Sakowin camp , Dec. 3 . The bridge was the site of a dangerous face-off between protesters and police on Nov. 20 , when protesters said water cannons and rubber bullets were used . Twenty-six people were taken to the hospital while another 300 were treated for minor injuries . Most everyone in Oceti Sakowin formed a giant circle holding hands around the perimeter of the camp . Friends of Youth Council members , they have been at Oceti Sakowin for months .
