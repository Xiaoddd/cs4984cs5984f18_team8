In many cases , this means making alternative purchases when it comes to food , clothing , beauty and so on . But up until now , I had n't thought about the negative impacts of where I keep my money before I spend it ... The banking system was born in 1406 , instigated by the Ancient Greeks and Romans to protect the funds of the public during troubled times . Back then , both ancient powers were quite adamantly Christian and thus their systems were based on the anti-materialism of Jesus . Today most investments would be considered immoral by the Greeks and Romans who set the standards with ethics rather than profits alone in mind . Currently , conventional banks are among the biggest investors in the causes of climate change . After all , the fruit of the majority of our labour : money , should only be allocated to that productive activity which serves us best , be it food , shelter or investment . Banking and finance can really be a force for good , instead of simply a force for profit , and it is within our power to achieve that , as the customers , taxpayers and often shareholders of these companies . As a response to this news , I myself am in the midst of switching my French account from Banque Populaire to La Nef , my UK bank account from Barclays to Triodos Bank , and our American account from Wells Fargo to First Green Bank . My Canadian bank account is with a Credit Union which means it is owned by and therefore invests in the community which supports it . ` contactFormMessageNotSentMsg ' : ` Message could not be sent .
