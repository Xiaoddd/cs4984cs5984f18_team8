The Dakota pipeline protests have become the frontline representation of the critical struggle against a completely out of control totalitarian power structure . Those in power can not afford to allow this justifiable protest to continue or succeed . In the coming days and weeks , weather warfare will likely be the most deadly and effective weapon that the power structure will wield against the pieceful Dakota pipeling protesters . If you do n't believe snowstorms can be completely engineered , you have not done your research . Weather warfare has long since been a covert weapon of choice for the criminals that truly control our government . Occupy Wall Street protesters prepare for the record October , 2011 , snowstorm that decimated their camp . Weather modification activities were also noted over the massive historical gathering in Woodstock . The combination satellite radar images below clearly reveal extreme and completely unnatural weather anomalies over the continental US . An engineered winter chemical ice nucleation assault -LRB- by jet aircraft aerosol spraying -RRB- was then unleashed in the stationary low pressure circulation . Note the center of the counterclockwise spinning low pressure system centered almost exactly over the pipeline protest region . Massive atmospheric aerosol spraying operations were also occurring off of the US west coast on Monday , November 28 , 2016 . The aerosol saturation reduces west coast precipitation and thus contributes to the effective migration of Pacific moisture further east toward the low pressure vortex over the protest zone . In addition to the extensive aerosol spraying visible in this NASA satellite image , some radio frequency manipulation waves can be seen in the upper right corner of the satellite image . By the evening of Monday , November 28 , 2016 , the huge plum of warm moisture is pulled closer to the still stationary spinning vortex over the Dakota protests . Aerosolized chemically cooled moisture flowing in from the Pacific also merges with the engineered Dakota snowstorm . The engineered cutoff low pressure zone has remained incredibly stationary and nearly centered over the Dakota pipeline protest zone . Now such incredible imbalances have increasingly become the norm . The animation below contains the most revealing and important images of all . Areas of the storm then suddenly flash back to rain as the jet aircraft sprayed chemical ice nucleating agents settle down through the air column . These anomalies will continue to manipulate the perception of populations who do n't realize -LRB- or are not willing to accept -RRB- what is going on in our skies . All the weather modeling for NOAA and NWS -LRB- National Weather Service -RRB- is done by private defense contractor , Raytheon , a corporation that is a primary climate engineering entity . Because all the employees of both agencies have a federal gag order on them . The NOAA -LRB- National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -RRB- extended temperature forecast map for November 6-10 is below . Again , it is important to understand and remember that engineering snowstorms is a well established technology that has long since been admitted to by mainstream sources . The NOAA map above shows continued predictions for record cold temperatures at or near the Dakota pipeline protest for yet another 6-10 day period . Also anomolous in the latest forecast map is the building heat dome in the US southwest . Climate enigneerign is greatly contributing to increasingly alarming extream temperature imbalances . Each color tear represents a 2-3 degree departure from normal high temperatures . Because the Dakota protests represent the rapidly growing will and unity of the people to take a stand against the criminal corporate and government tyranny that has completely taken over our country . The power structure will clearly do anything they can get away with to crush this all important protest . We must not let this happen . GeoengineeringWatch.org is working directly with representatives from the protest to test samples of precipitation and aircraft aerosol spraying that has taken place at the protest site . All of us are needed in the critical battle to sound the alarm on what is occurring at the Dakota protest , share credible information , wake others up to the truth , make your voice heard . 120 Responses to Power Structure Wages Weather Warfare Against Dakota Pipeline Protesters Gail - Yellowhead County Alberta says : December 10 , 2016 at 1:51 pm Thank You very much Bane B for your advice on color therapy . I was fortunate to have had a Mom who was a Reflexologist and also well versed in Color Therapy . She used Color Therapy through different light screens directed at infected areas on my Dad when he had Lung Cancer . He was improving so greatly and I am sure he would have recovered if it was n't for him caving into others -LRB- His many Sons & Daughters & the many medical Quacks -RRB- who wanted him to do the radiation death road . Only through Ignorance of course . Not long afterwards , he Died . She knew the Color Therapy method was working . She regretted not standing up to the pressure put on herself & Dad . My Mom never liked confrontations . But she knew that Radiation & Chemo , was a certain Death Sentence . He was only 72 . My Mom gave me a Book called Healing for the Age of Enlightenment , by Stanley Burroughs while I was still a Teen , many Moons ago . Chapter five is : The Miracle of Light & Color . You may be interested . I Love Blue , Yellow , & Green . I have 150 House Plants which takes care of the Green which is a Healing Color . It destroys & heals all infections & Hospitals find less infections when Green is present . Not to mention the Air cleaning my Plants do for me each day . Nasa has even done study 's on this . Green also stimulates the pituitary gland , The Master Gland . The Blue is a Cooling Color It relieves all Fevers & Burns , which if needed , can take down a high Fever by simply wrapping a Blue pillowcase around the head or a sheet around the entire body . Instead of giving them Tylenol or other poisons . Also , one drop in a bottle for a Baby will get rid of tummy aches & help them to eliminate . I had a friend who had a Baby with so called Colic , many Doc 's gave her no help . Blue is the Color of the Pineal Gland , the Color of the Spirit . So You are very right about the lack of it does effect our Moods etc. . Yellow stimulates , activating endless energy & building of the motivating actions of the body . Is a nerve stimulant & builder . No wonder why so few have no energy . Not helpful to breath the Toxic Chemicals too of course . Lemon has more elements than any other color . It is a Bone builder . It heals broken bones faster & hardens soft bones . God knew what he was doing when He created such a Wonder . The Color balance was there . All around us . I live in a Log Home & have no dry wall throughout . I do have Daylight Bulbs for light which need to be turned on for a ridiculous amount of time due to Very Little Sunlight . Never before did I need to have lights on all day . Others should take note of your advice if they have walls that can be painted . I Love the Wood & It too gives me comfort as my many Plants do . Alberta was known for it 's MANY Sunny days a year until the last five years for sure . A long response . I hope my advice too Helps others . You are all such Friends & care as much as I do . This means so much to me . Thank You All . Reply gary hillman says : December 15 , 2016 at 10:49 am Bless ypur heart , my dear . Thanks for the color theraphy lesson . May you have more sunshine and fresh air , and clean water . Shine like the sun . If that doesnt tell you its a crock nothing will . I live in Albuquerque and most evenings the smoke is so thick you could cut it with a knife -LRB- this is even on burn nights -RRB- . The smoke also enters the house when doors are opened and through exhaust fans that are not left on . Our dog does n't even want to go outside . Last year was bad and this year is starting out worse . I have heard on the weather reports from Public radio stations along with the mainstream presstatutes since the first week into Autumn , Winter Weather conditions . We have had snow on the ground in Alberta since Oct. 3rd . It has ` nt melted . They keep us at Zero F or lower . The Sun is Constantly blocked . Which is of course insane , so they must not do that . My favorite Season in Alberta was always the Autumn . And now their is NO resemblance to the Autumn 's I loved so much for decades of my life . And I am sick of everyone playing into their hands . I listen to the oldest public radio station in Alberta with 16 transmiters . They are well versed on Geo Engineering for a Fact and they still pull this Shit off . We ca n't trust anyone . Just say Cloudy with Snow . Obviously these creatures could not care less about anyone 's well being except their own . They are pathological control freaks and get their jollies making people miserable . Diminished sunlight has a profound mental -LRB- emotional -RRB- and physical impact on every living creature . We have to combat the bastards as best we can . You are way north of my region . I read some time ago that the color YELLOW -LRB- sunshine -RRB- is essential for mental equilibrium . To combat the artificially created gloom paint some room or wall a bright yellow . The primary colors are yellow , blue , and red . Everything else is a derivative . It 's interesting that the first two are absolutely essential to emotional well being . The terrorists are depriving us of the sun and the sky . The yellow sunshine passes through our once blue skies . Yellow and blue create green . Green is of course our plants -LRB- food -RRB- and forest , so these Luciferians are destroying the food supply . Red is the color of Eros and life itself . It flows in our veins . And to belabor the matter , white and black are not colors . White reflects all color . Black absorbs all color . Our team is white . The Luciferians are the black team , symbol of corruption , death and decay . To be trite lets paint them into oblivion . Colby Sanders says : December 8 , 2016 at 9:53 pm I hear you about the situation in Alberta . It has been unrelenting since around May , the sun has not been out at all . Everyday there are blue skies except for where the sun crosses the horizon to the south . Calgary winters used to be always sunny , more sunshine than anywhere else in Canada . We have had maybe a week of sunny days in the past four months . I 'm surprised more people do n't notice because the weather never used to be like this , or maybe they do and just do n't want to admit it . It is great to read geoengineeringwatch.org is communicating with representatives from the Dakota Pipeline Protesters . The samples taken and tested from the area , will be another piece of evidence in the fight to expose the truth . Not so much , It 's as if people are losing there empathy . We made passionate love , and Image a world not that far in the past , that was so much more then ourselves . . I just do n't understand man . Americans used to invent things to help the fellowship of man , Invent at such a pace , now technology is at the route of the axes of evil , we 're left to ride out the storm , and this is just the beginning of a storm , a storm so fierce that there will be no where to hide . How right those words are to me now . From a guy with nothin , really important to say , just another day , I do n't want to feel defeated . There are so many who feel the same . Empathy , heart , compassion , and imagination . Without that we would be like them and how horrible to be that way . We are on the verge of a change . A change that will allow us humans to be the best we can be . Hang on and keep being the person you want to be . We all have choices and how we choose is the key . Much love to you and yours . It is close , we will make it . They beamed the women and children with microwaves , and many of them got cancer after a while . I am really really worried that they are going to beam these heroes with microwaves to make them sick . They need an electrosmog meter to check , but on the other hand , they can use frequences that are hard to detect . If this is happening , the world must know . I RECOMMEND SOMEONE IN CHARGE OF THIS OPERATION TO GET IN CONTACT WITH BARRIE TROWER UK , AND ASK HIM TO ADVICE THEM ABOUT THIS POSSIBLE THREAT . In fact , Trump -LRB- who has a vested interest in the pipeline -RRB- has stated he has no intention of interfering with the construction . The veterans who will arrive there this weekend to support and protect the protestors have my deep appreciation . They will be in my prayers and thoughts . We need a miracle . We need many miracles . Peace . The U.S. still imports half of the oil it consumes per day and DAPL will provide a critical link to help close the gap between what we produce as a country and what we consume as we work to be truly independent of energy from unstable regions of the world . Yet what is passing through Montana is not for US use . They are so slippery . Really hard to believe a word they say . Blessings to all the veterans who have joined hands . Such a dearth of courage these days . Thank you for your rare example to the young in want of direction . Pedro says : December 2 , 2016 at 2:54 pm Hello Dane . I think something may happen until January 1st . Normally I 'm not paranoid , but this time I 've a strange feeling . Maybe it 's not bad idea if we all store some extra food , water , flashlights and woods in our places . Thank you for your Work and dedication to Humanity . Pedro . There is not enough empathy across this nation , and our media do not report a word of what is REALLY happening . With the Chemtrails above , Fracking below , polluting our water , our skies and every breath we take , the Indians were right , this is the end of our 6th lives of this planet -LRB- extinction -RRB- that started in 2012 . But I would like to apologize for anything I might have done , or a passed retaliative may have caused native peoples . Like I said it 's a very sad time to be an American , I think it 's all over for us all , They control the our weather , our energy , our food . I hope there is one honest person out there that can make a difference , everyone else who stood tall against these type of pirates for power , they end uo dead , Can TRUMP be the answer , however after the hangover wares off , I believe it 's game over for all of us , although I really hope hope their families get their own toxic diseases they so deserve . I 'm sorry . I hope you can forgive a Christian from Pennsylvania . I find myself welling up at night . I feel , well , horrible . God help us all , No one can stop this machine now . Us older folks had done much to clean it up . Yes what is on the cell phone is most important , to the youth . Who someday , will make DRs & chiropractors very rich , for a bad case of tech neck . BaneB says : December 3 , 2016 at 9:22 am Joe : Coming soon to a bank near you will be the cashless beast . It 's in the works . The MSM is in full propaganda mode . The articles exhorting us to accept the rationale of the banksters for why a cashless society is a boon are appearing with a greater rapidity . Overnight India has ordered a cashless society . And millions of Indians are miserable , and thoroughly pissed off . Most of the approaching con falls under the heading of negative interest rates . The idea is to charge the savings accounts a penalty for saving rather than spending on consumer goods . Of course one might not want to keep savings in the bank if it 's going to reduce the purpose for why one saves . Savers will simply remove their money and hold it under a mattress . The only cash will be in ones , fives , and tens . This forces one to use a debit or credit card . All privacy will be gone , tracked by the predators . And simple daily operations of ones affairs will be cashless except for the use of the smaller denominations . It 's more complex than my partial outline . It 's amazing what is planned . Search it out . Jenny says : December 3 , 2016 at 9:01 pm BaneB , I do n't always get to follow every story I hear something about . I 've mentioned him a couple of times on this site , but anybody who has n't seen this interview -LRB- there are short and long versions of it -RRB- on Youtube , should definitely watch it . One of the elites befriended him , tried to get him to join the CFR , etc. . We all need to do whatever we can to keep this cashless society from coming about , since it 's all part of very nefarious plans designed to benefit only those few at the top . Keep exposing this , and I think all decent people should do their best to expose PizzaGate , too . And geoengineering , of course . LET 'S WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE , folks . Physicians are supposed to be educated professionals . Go to fairewinds.org and bone up on what 's going on here on Planet Earth with regard to nuclear power plant infrastructure , microwave weaponry and nuclear meltdowns . Many , many more of us out here are very aware of these problems and we are watching those in charge of managing and stopping the groups who are polluting our planet and adding to the sickness . If you are really serious about ending illness on Planet Earth , you 'll need to take action . Please join with one or both of these groups . We are counting on YOU to stick your necks out and stand on the side of the TRUE angels . Pedro says : December 3 , 2016 at 4:19 am Hello All . We must start somewhere . Artificial sweeteners also causes blindness . And in the gut , as you said Brother , the transformation in the intestinal flora make digestion and nutrients absorption to be deficient . The responsible for this nutritional plague is a very well known hi-rank political and military of the US . Look for it , info is in the net . 10:17 a.m. Reply BaneB says : December 3 , 2016 at 9:41 am Susan : The propaganda specialists at NPR stated as if the morning there was two feet of snow on the ground there . They also stated ` authority ' is concerned for the welfare of the water protectors . I have been closely observing the weather terrorists ' weather warfare efforts to freeze out the water protectors . A week ago my forecaster , The Weather Channel , predicted at least three days of rain for my region beginning on Wednesday . Next one observes a bulls eye approach of very a very cold Arctic low heading out of western Canada toward South Dakota . The rain we did not get likely is going to merge with the Canadian low over South Dakota , if not already . If the plan is to stall the system over the region of protest for several days the protest will be buried . joe says : December 2 , 2016 at 9:14 am Climate Engineering is lethal in many ways and a big one is that , Climate Engineering prevents the planet from responding to the activities of burning gasoline and coal . Reply otterwalks says : December 4 , 2016 at 2:18 pm That has a small percentage of truth in the vastness of the overview . By the hand of humanity or by natural entropic processes . Yes , there are many products that are created by the Corporate Industrial Complex , sold to the public which then makes use of them prior to examination or research of the detrimental after effects . The same is true of Corporate creations by Big Oil i.e. the Petrochemical Industrial Complex , and Big Pharma with its usage of solvents , its waste materials , and their disposal . Evermore we see that they are being integrated into Aerosol slurries . Each Space Shuttle launch disbursed more Green House Gasses than 100 years of vehicular travel , including both business and private emissions . As well , the GHG 's that were produced were far more detrimental in their nature . Ionospheric Heaters continue to increase R and D at exponential rates . The launch or every single missile , rocket , aircraft usage , their development and deployment massively out weigh humanities generic use and wastes in daily life . Now , do n't get me wrong , I am on board with Dane and virtually all he says . One must applaud his research and test results . Here I am simply pointing out one of the largest factors which goes to the CO2 PsyOp being propagated by TPTB and their minions . It will not be long before an attempt is made to further ingrain the CCX . Misinformation , propaganda , depletion of critical thought by design ; these are tools to keep the Pavlovian response active and bound by tunnel vision . If you are going to fight for the Earth , you must expand your global view of the events that are being driven . Technocracy has an Agenda . Dane Wigington says : December 4 , 2016 at 5:48 pm Hello Otterwalks , thank you for your support in this battle . All of which climate engineering is helping to fuel . otterwalks says : December 6 , 2016 at 12:04 am Howdy Dane and friends , Agreed . My remaining issue comes in with the negation of the newest coal fired energy plants . I 'd rather have them than outdated nuclear facilities . I see no one addressing places like the SEMASS recovery plant here in MA which shreds and burns using outdated scrubber stacks . The data shows that 3000 tons of waste is processed daily . Their stacks emit toxins born of all form of Corporate Swill . I will leave that at that . Naturally censorship of all Radar sites continues negating the full extent of this new event 's duration . Loops are frozen and data is being wiped . -LRB- I was straight , since there was lots of money involved in the sales . The shows were 3 day shows . It happened like this . Dark clouds appeared above Sam Boyd Stadium , which located east of the Vegas strip . An isolated area . With a big stadium in the middle of desert dirt lands . A big flat open area . Every year summer month shows . -LRB- June -RRB- there would be a big build up of very dark clouds . A lightning storm , rain , then a rainbow , or even a double rainbow . What was really odd was this . It was only over the stadium . It was clear & sunny beyond the parking lot , in all directions . The lightning was severe . I dove into my van as a major strike came down . The entire parking lot smelled like electrical burn . Many cars did not start after that . People walking about seemed frazzled . from the lightning strike . The last show I went to out there it was 122 degrees . Record breaking temps . Until now . I sort of thought that the equipment on stage -LRB- sound wall of speakers -RRB- was attracting this weather storm . Not so sure anymore . Also something I have recently noticed . After the last 2 rains here . It seems like the clouds that I would see at 10.000 to 30.000 feet elevation . The kind from up drafts , along the mountains . Sat very low in elevation . maybe a couple thousand feet . As if something was pushing them down , to prevent them from going up like normal . They look like cauliflower heads , when rising then max out . Even when they maxed out . They were still way too low in elevation , compared to what I have seen , all my life as normal . Reply BaneB says : December 3 , 2016 at 9:52 am Geoengineered aerosol spraying over the top of cumulus clouds acts as a inversion cap . Combined with microwave heating of the air above the clouds will force them to flatten and also to become fuzzy and disorganized . I see that here in my mountainous region of Northern California . It 's virtually a non-stop operation . Gail - Yellowhead County Alberta says : December 2 , 2016 at 8:57 am Thank You Mauro too . Any Friend of Dane 's is a Friend of Ours . Reply Gail - Yellowhead County Alberta says : December 2 , 2016 at 8:53 am Great Information June Williams . If enough of us do this at least it might get an audience with Trump for Dane and our Legal Team . I did so yesterday . Dane , I hope you do n't mind . Also mention Sheriff Richard Mack for Head of Bureau of Land Management -LRB- BLM -RRB- . He is a good and decent man , Head of the C.S.P.O.A. -LRB- Constitutional Sheriff 's and Peace Officers Association -RRB- working closely with the Oathkeepers , I believe . Just keep trying is all I know to do and hopefully you 'll get through . Further , I send them to the brave souls who are forever our water-protectors and their supporters . And , no surprise , outgunned . That some of our veterans are joining to protect the water and the people is quite medal-worthy ; but that it 's necessary is shameful . And it IS necessary . We 're on the brink of extinction , by our own greedy hands , and our last effort MUST be one of kindness , defense , education , not revenge . The mind-numbed idiots shooting off water canons and such at innocent people in North Dakota -LRB- and elsewhere , surely -RRB- , should be left to perish and consumed by vultures . Barring some sort of miraculous rehab , they are not suitable to coexist with indigenous people , or anyone . They are a species destined to die off . Thank you Dane for sharing how weather modification is being used as warfare against those of us trying to save our planet . You have many more followers than comment here . We MUST be legion , we can be , we ARE . Someone with cred should be nominating you for the Nobel Peace Prize . You are my hero and give me hope in this seemingly hopeless world . I wonder if all those guys involved in this hideous destructive process actually would drink this water , or serve it to their own kids , and if the kids are any smarter than their completely morally compromised parents , who are sooo fcking stoooopid all they think that is of value on this planet is the Almighty Dollar . Never mind life itself . Please take your money out of banks that fund the pipeline , and give them a letter saying why , sample on above site . This pipeline can never be completed or used . The water it would contaminate constitutes 30 percent of crops of midwest besides being needed for millions of people . A leak would cause famine and mass deaths and cripple our country , anybody who wanted to destroy our country could blow the pipeline ; it is a national security issue , we are being plundered . Also people can call or e-mail their local sheriffs office and voice opposition to police being sent there . Sheriff 's depts in some states like Wisconsin and Minnesota have already cancelled sending their forces there due to constituents ' strong opposition . One of the protectors also pleaded for prayer , so please pray . It literally works miracles ; you may never know the good you do while you are still here on earth . The line has to be drawn here ; this has to stop . God Bless all involved in this fight . Reply stephan says : December 1 , 2016 at 11:21 pm Thank you Dane and Geo Watch crew for bringing this travesty to light . Reply Mauro says : December 1 , 2016 at 9:53 pm thanks Dane I 'll make sure the legal folks , media , and the security . I am honored to have known Mauro for some 15 years , and to call him my friend . SuZ says : December 2 , 2016 at 10:45 am I live in Bismarck , and have been watching the chemical weather modification spraying in our skies.Saturday morning , November 26 , started out as a beautiful clear cloudless day . The southern horizon was filled with long white lines that by early afternoon became a large white blanket overhead . Similar to my previous experiences when I am out walking and taking photos of the spraying with my cell phone , a small white unmarked jet came down very low behind me and then flew directly over me . For some reason , that day my phone continued to work . Other times when I have been out taking photos , and I am buzzed by a jet , my phone will suddenly shut off . When I turn it back on , what was a charged battery will now be drained . Anyway , I knew the spraying that day had to be connected with the Standing Rock NODAPL activities . So , I was not surprised to see what had originally been a forecast for 5-8 inches of snow had now become a major winter storm event . Deb Buckler says : December 2 , 2016 at 6:23 pm God bless you , Mauro . Please be safe . Cathy McComas says : December 1 , 2016 at 7:05 pm Revelation 11:18 This promise is in these folks very near future . The destruction of the earth will be avenged and stopped . And I still try to embrace my favorite Cedars . Even so combating the weird dust particulates INSIDE my house , on tables , kitchen & bath surfaces , etc. is equally threatening . I have a vacuum cleaner with a serious filter , but I resist cleaning it as I know I will end up inhaling the stuff that will escape into the air . For me however the most noticeable symptom is my trembling hands here in the Navy 's EW electronic war zone on the Olympic Peninsula . On You Tube Be sure to catch the Q&A at the end . Reply Kathy Jennings says : December 1 , 2016 at 5:47 pm I seem to recall a freak snowstorm that happened in Washington DC Christmas week of 2009 , which canceled all flights out , thereby trapping senators who were otherwise leaving to go home for Christmas break , forcing them to stay in session . The Affordable Health Care Act passed the Senate in a vote on Christmas Eve 2009 . For some reason , I ca n't find it on the web .

Though he does not show the courage to admit to the climate engineering reality in the interview , it is clear that he knows . I hope anyone will take a look and tell me more about them if possible . Thank you so much Dane and all for your contributions it 's really helping us learn and become aware and spread this info . Reply Adam S says : December 1 , 2016 at 11:12 am Early morning over Tacoma , WA . The mistreatment of those who peopled this land before the whites arrived has always been a point of great sorrow for me . As a teenager , I had friends who traveled from California to support their brothers at Wounded Knee in 1973 , and were injured during the occupation . As a young adult I was deeply moved by the book Seven Arrows and have built much of my personal philosophy of life around its tenets . When doing a portrait of an individual from a photograph , one has the opportunity to look deeply into the eyes , to study a single moment 's expression combined with the more permanent expression left by the lines of aging and , with a little luck , to glimpse the soul . The sadness in the face of Chief Joseph , emanating from his soul , has been indelibly imprinted onto my own . Joseph , or Hin-mah-too-yah-lat-kekt , whose birth name means Thunder Rolling down a Mountain , was a chief of the Nez Perce . In 1877 the Nez Pierce were ordered to a reservation but refused to go . Instead , Chief Joseph tried to lead 800 of his people from their home in the Wallowa Valley of Northwest Oregon to safety in Canada , fighting the U.S. Army all along their 1100 mile journey across several states , including Idaho and Montana . Trapped just forty miles from Canada , and after a five-day fight , the remaining 431 Nez Perce surrendered . Our chiefs are killed . Looking Glass is dead . Toohulhulsote is dead . The old men are all dead . It is the young men who say yes or no . He who led the young men is dead . It is cold and we have no blankets . The little children are freezing to death . My people , some of them , have run away to the hills and have no blankets , no food . I want to have time to look for my children and see how many I can find . Maybe I shall find them among the dead . Hear me , my chiefs . I am tired . My heart is sick and sad . I am incredibly proud of , and thankful to , these people now standing up to Empire in the name of our Mother , the Earth . Without them and their ilk -LRB- those willing to fight for a living planet , like Dane and so many who visit this site -RRB- , the future is not only bleak , but nearly nonexistent . The willingness to rise against inequity , in the name of compassion , is an honorable pursuit that must never be lost . Reply virginia says : December 1 , 2016 at 12:29 pm To Marinangeli : So beautifully written and with the deep emotion so many of us feel toward our native citizens for the sorrow and persecution bestowed upon them by our government . I am ashamed for America and hope the Lakota Nation will win this current cruel attack on them . Thank you for the comments on Chief Joseph , a man of true nobility who showed more courage in his time than all those now carved on Mt. Rushmore , combined . With that one soulful speech , he became immortal . Thank you for presenting your most timely and inspiring post . BaneB says : December 1 , 2016 at 4:37 pm We must question the role of governments , but certainly government of the sociopathic displays we see in the historical records and in our contemporary immediacy can not do its dirty work without the collaboration of the grass roots . Well , we might want to look in the mirror . People en mass collaborated in the theft of a continent . All the while waving a parchment that stated something about freedom and rights . We now know the entire build up to our modern entrapment was a confidence game of our own creation of government from the very beginning when two corporations , one in Massachusetts , and the other in Virginia , planted their flags and the cross -LRB- guilt -RRB- upon the beachhead , from whence went out we grass roots to conquer and destroy and build a ICBM . We have the luxury of a comfortable lament . We understand the foundation of corruption but can not turn back the clock . What we can do is recognize the fool 's paradise for what it is . We see the end game . It 's in the air . Earth Angel says : December 1 , 2016 at 7:23 pm Thank you Laura . Your words are beautifully spoken . Prayers for the lives of those standing for Mother Earth this day and success in their mission . There has got to be a break for those fighting for what is right and just , hopefully an awakening of higher conscience takes hold of the people of the world right now . The native peoples have been treated horribly in the past and now we are ALL being treated horribly by the same vicious offenders . It must stop now . God be with them on the front lines . Tremendous piece you shared with us . Gail - Yellowhead County Alberta says : December 2 , 2016 at 6:56 am Thank You Laura . You touched my Heart so Deeply . I am so Ashamed of some . Thank You for telling us about another Great Man in History . God Bless all the Standing Rock Protesters I Pray for their Strength and for all their needs to be provided for . . MS P says : December 2 , 2016 at 7:49 am Laura , Well said . I have read this book a few times in my life . I need to read it again . What a great book . In my late teens , I had a chance to go with some invited friends , to visit Hyemeyohsts Storm 's home , in Ojai CA . I 'll never forget that night . All the black & white photo pictures , from Seven Arrows , were framed & hanging on the walls . A lovely place to be . Hyemeyohsts Storm was so very kind . When I drive that back road to Ojai . I think of that night . The energy in the room , was so magical . Some very amazing people were there . We smoked his pipe , of a sweet mixture , at the end of the evening . There was so much to this night . Driving home on that back road . a big white owl flew across the windshield . The get together was of great importance . -LRB- North-Eastern AZ -RRB- . In 1980 the GOV had purchased a new location . It just goes to show how our Native Americans are still being treated . Deb Buckler says : December 2 , 2016 at 6:31 pm Laura , I am in tears reading this . Thank you for posting it . I can not believe what has happened to this country . Whatever the outcome , the world is changed forever after this . Pedro is right , it will take something really big to distract the world from Standing Rock . Thank you , especially , MS P. for sharing your story about visiting the home of Hyemeyohsts Storm and for the link to his page . Hyemeyohsts Storm has been a name I have carried in my heart with much respect since 1974 , when I first read Seven Arrows . The link you provided to his page was a wonderful gift that fills in much detail . It is the only image of the event . All feeds were wiped , all Radar returns frozen with negated archives .

Current Gov. Jack Dalrymple did not seek office again . Reply Deb Buckler says : December 1 , 2016 at 11:24 am Mr. Dalrymple will have blood on his hands after the issue with Standing Rock is over . Hopefully he will be behind bars soon . He knows very well that he has approved a devastating storm for that area . Dane Wigington says : December 1 , 2016 at 2:36 pm Hello Deb , yes , historically the Dakota winters are well known , but much has changed . If not for the climate engineers , their manipulation , and their toxic chemical ice nucleation , perhaps we would be seeing the kind of record heat we saw in the Dakotas that occured in 2012 , a winter high temperature of 94 degrees -LRB- this broke the former all time high record for that day by 32 degrees -RRB- . LoriBridgeford says : November 30 , 2016 at 11:49 pm Truly hope all camera devises work to capture every minute of this righteous stand , and will be interesting to see how Obama , or Trump who claims to value & honor our Vets . They are to arrive Dec. 4th and my CA radio news -LRB- Fox -RRB- stated the vets are bringing body armor , gas masks , ear plugs and other protection from abusive attacks . Or Drones . A new Governor to begin soon - so sketchy times . This situation has the hallmark of a documentary on persistent injustice to Natives . Look at the festering conduct of CDC , EPA , FDA , WHO , etc. . I wonder if the Canadian Indians have come on record with this Dakota assault . May they have LEGAL TEAMS in place as well . Reply BaneB says : December 1 , 2016 at 4:47 pm Their assurances are about as good as a signed Treaty . Let 's not forget the Titanic . The Titanic is the quintessential symbol of the boondoggle of our modern era . Deb Buckler says : November 30 , 2016 at 9:16 pm Well this is my worst nightmare . I mentioned that I was worried about them sending a nucleated ice storm to Standing Rock a while back . These ghouls are setting up to murder those people . 2,100 veterans will be arriving at Standing Rock in a few days and hopefully they will make a difference , but this needs to be documented and watched all over the world . Someone once mentioned that other countries should put sanctions on America because of it 's abuse to the native Americans and I think that 's a great idea . Shame , shame , shame . Indeed , many countries focus on America 's treatment of Natives . In the hey-day of our protests , there was the buckskin passport that some Natives used successfully to travel to various countries to testify to abuses . I 'd argue that in my lifetime , nearly 70 years , this is the norm for North Dakota , always a daunting winter that can come so fast so hard , that I worried not for Natives who are used to this , but for the others . Even some winters in South Dakota near Nebraska on Rosebud Rez , my in laws had to burn everything they owned each winter to survive . Winds there seem to blow in all directions at once and winter always comes early . Or , did . But , I guess since I was born after WW2 , who knows what would be normal . You might remember the photos in the snow , deep , intense cold snow at Pine Ridge , the fort there , during the first Wounded Knee , around 1890 . WOW . I 'm impressed . There has been absolutely nothing on the news in Australia about Standing Rock . It does not exist as far as our censored media is concerned . They will be wearing their uniforms when they stand in front of the oil police . One amazing marine just finished his trek of 200 miles to get to Standing Rock to stand in solidarity with them . Probably just after a good juicy story . No one would question it . The Native Americans are fully aware of chemtrails and toxic spraying and they do various things to cleanse themselves of it as much as possible . They have so much to offer the world as far as a better way of living and treating the environment . MAYBE the world will get a chance for a closer look now . Few will know how radical it is for this number of Vets to show up in support . And , apparently , few know the degree to which the government has been constantly trying all these decades , the last 100 years to kill every single Native one way or another . And , especially in North and South Dakota . The very fact that any remain is astounding . Keystone tried its trip through Rosebud lands and failed , coming up with this one which skirts by inches Standing Rock . A main issue is Sovereignty . Standing Rock is a Sovereign Nation , as are all tribes of the Oceti Sakowin , and all treaty tribes . This means a Nation State . Like say the US or Russia or Japan . This is Standing Rock 's legal standing . But , we know well how the treaties have been disregarded . Empty words . Yet they have legal meaning and standing , in theory . So , for Standing Rock , that is the main leg they are on . Alternative media helped destroy Keystone . They are trying , but a bit late , to do the same here . Much of this part of the pipeline is being paid for by Wells Fargo bank , and Citi Group . Stop funds and dealings with them now . As much as protecting the waters count , this is a test , make no mistake , of Standing Rock 's sovereignty . Our relatives in these two states have lived in dire poverty all this time . They do not get free housing as many think , nor are they free from taxes . No free ride at all . You may be surprised to know that many claim to be unaware of geoengineering . Many say they have seen no chemtrails . This stuns me . My nephew is aware , his mother is not . She is too focused on staying alive . Next door to her little home , finally paid for , is a pack of dogs that ate an old lady last year . These attacks happen all the time . Grandma had huge scars on her lower left leg from when a dog took her down , she so old , trying to beat the dog off as he ate her leg until a church lady driving by stopped and intervened . Daily life . Her oldest son wanted to start a dog pound of sorts on Rosebud , but not allowed . Almost no Native business allowed . Pine Ridge does better in this regard , it all depends upon Tribal Councils . And most members of those are corrupt . So , people keep their heads down , mind their own business . Most of my nieces and nephews have college degrees . Torn between two worlds , sweat lodges and the Sundance , and semi Catholic . It is a schizophrenic world they live in wherein the biggest social events are funerals . My sister in law 's counters in kitchen melt from having to keep the stove on for heat . The kids there have the highest suicide rate in the world . And Rosebud has the record for rapes . Nothing means more than family . For a long time now some conflict over flying the American Flag at Pow Wows and Sundances along with Native flags as so many opposed to the US , but moreso on the coasts than in SD and ND . So , we honor them . Many now refuse to do that . So , the Vets coming to support is very meaningful . The government has good reason to think no one cares . I hope that support continues after the drama ends , whichever way . You are so good at these . Thank you . Events really are coming to a head . This headline will not surprise many , but the full return of the Vampire Squid to acknowledged power and influence in the Empire is a nightmare .

I have lived here 60 years and have never seen anything like it , obviously , they were trying to make a point . It 's been nice to have you back . China has the upper hand and has us scrambling . Which made me wonder about the now dead TPP that was pushed so hard and in secret for so long , along with Obama 's pivot to the East , as in China . Really , China has done some very clever stuff in Space currently giving them the upper hand , if the story can be believed . Nothing ever seems to make sense . But cyber war does and it is very very scary . One moved because of trains . And that is just one line . . Somewhere there is a reciprocal negative space of phenomenal volume .

Marc says : November 30 , 2016 at 6:51 pm Dane , incredible expose of a crime in progress . I guess my intuition about the storm up there -LRB- from my bitter comments posted yesterday -RRB- has been validated by Dane 's more in-depth examination . In this vast , great and ALIVE universe I can not imagine a greater transgression against God 's creation than to knowingly and consciously commit acts of war against a whole planet and all beings who depend on it for survival .

Public perception also engineered . Reply Dane Wigington says : November 30 , 2016 at 7:18 pm Hello SD , yes , there was a report about California rains , but the reports do not give a real glimpse of the truth . Other than some specific locations , the overall precipitation has not been overly excessive . Stream flows in most locations of California are not at all excessive , in fact , many locations are still quite low . Each of us must learn to sort the truth from the lies as the mainstream machines of mass deception are now completely out of control . SD says : December 1 , 2016 at 6:46 pm A suspicious shallow -LRB- 10 km -RRB- earthquake of approx M4 was reported in central Poland several days ago . And once again , major weather change noted , with snow in Warsaw . BaneB says : December 3 , 2016 at 10:17 am SD : While my area of Mendocino County has received early rain off and on for the past month or longer , it 's the southern half of California that is the main booty for the weather warfare terrorists . It 's the agricultural lands they want . And the water rights . The north along the coast range is mountainous and mostly forested . The big trees were raked out of here years ago . My county is the poorest in California . We get rain only because it 's convenient to their overall weather scheme . Kinda like how these same Luciferians handle truth . Otherwise , a couple years ago we had no rain until mid-December I suspect because a greater need elsewhere or experimenting to just do it to do it . We have had several days now of high and excessive winds . A installed high has been intensified . The criminals pushed expected rain north and it 's headed to North Dakota . One good news is there is snow on the western slope of the Yolla Bolly Mountains that divide Mendocino from the northern Central Valley . Ron Barr says : November 30 , 2016 at 5:44 pm Dane , thank you so much for your work . I think there 's finally a flaw in their defenses we must pour thru , as an aware public that 's will demand change . America has lost all the moral authority it claims to possess . We have been accused and rightly so for being the number one terrorist nation in the world , responsible for more wanton killings of innocents than any other country . And , here , in one of our own states , America once again rears its historical ugly head and is subjugating innocent people standing up for their lands . If we all write to Gov. Dalrymple , or email his office , we can at least voice our opposition to his inhumane stance and tactics . There is a website given for his contact . Address : Gov. Dalrymple , 600 East Boulevard Ave. , Bismarck , North Dakota , 58505-0100 The following link will enable you to email him . I tried but ca n't get through . It may do little , but , then , it might do much . We have to try . On another note : it has been learned that Trump has a vested interest in the pipeline . And the Lakota still stand . May they be victorious in their fight . Please try to write to Dalrymple or try the email link . Thank you so much . Reply Rachel Robson says : December 1 , 2016 at 7:38 am Maybe what people do n't get is how for all this time the Lakota peoples have suffered . All these generations starving , freezing every winter . No help at all . The Dawes Act of 1887 was designed to divest the peoples of their lands and has nearly succeeded . As family lands were different sized and located all over the place via inheritance , no one could in any way manage their lands as few ever had a car that worked or money for gas . So the lands were leased for grazing . This was true all over the west , from the Missouri River west . The grazing fees were ridiculously low , but all together enabled people to survive . Barely . Except here and there the checks did not show up . No one had phones or any way to straighten this out . Some went to Tribal councils but too often the councils are corrupt , having learned all too well from the whites . The only alternative was to sell your land , a piece of it , back to the tribe , for pennies on the dollar . Eventually , nearly all did and so no longer have family lands . Elouise Cobell is the brilliant Blackfoot woman who figured it all out after years of work . Incredibly difficult work . All these grazing monies went into ONE slush fund-which had been robbed , more than 55 Billion dollars . In the spring of 2001 , Elouise took her work , all her ducks in a row , to Bush 2 . I still have the news clipping in which he owned up to this saying that Chrysler Corp. took about 5 billion , the military the rest , and yes , they would pay it back . Then the banking crisis . Talk about salt on a wound . No one cared . And , the military uses these lands on rez to mine and drill without the slightest concern for the people or the land or cleaning up their messes . North and South Dakotas are famously anti Indian . We have such a society where even saying Trump can trigger someone and put you in danger is that a sign of a healing society I do n't think so yes Trump is a clown he is not the most legitimate person running for president but I feel that he is not going to attack us and slather us like Hillary would and Obama has been doing I think he supports people speaking up on dire issues like vaccinations however he has started he does n't believe in climate change or global warming and may approve the pipeline while I do have problems with Donald Trump on many issues and he may be a puppet he may not be he may turn against us he may not I did n't vote I do n't think I would have voted if I could vote I do hope Donald Trump does n't approve the oil pipeline and he did say I think that he has an open mind to how humans can impact the climate so I do n't know it 's hard not to fear going outside these days but that does n't justify is taking antidepressants which can kill us depending on the individual and what they are talking or they could harm our health more like would harm our health and on and on and on we need to deal with life not run away from it thank you for publishing this article and yes I agree I noticed the same thing it 's snowing a lot in that region while raining everywhere else not only that but it 's stationary .

Filed May 29 , 1961 , Ser . No. 113,063 4 Claims . -LRB- Cl . 239-2 -RRB- This invention pertains to the art of cloud seeding . It relates to a new process and a new device for generating crystals of ice-nucleating materials for introduction of the same into supercooled atmospheric clouds . The seeding of clouds , i.e. the introduction into supercooled atmospheric clouds of materials which cause the formation of ice crystals in the clouds , has been practised for a number of years for the purpose of controlling or modifying weather conditions . Such foreign crystalline materials are known in the art as ice-nucleate ing materials and include chemical substances such as silver iodide , lead iodide , cupric sulphide , etc. , as Well as natural minerals such as zincite , nephelite and apatite , A list of ice-nucleating materials is given at page 227 of Physics of Precipitation , Publication No. 746 -LRB- 1960 -RRB- of the American Geophysical Union of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council . It is with the latter preferred method that the present invention is concerned . Ice-nucleating crystals , in particular silver iodide crystals , have heretofore been generated for introduction into clouds by means of special generators located on the ground or attached to aircraft . In these generators , the ice-nucleating materials are placed in a zone maintained at a temperature at which they have an appreciable vapour pressure , which in the case of silver iodide is at least 1500 C. , and are thus vapourized into the atmosphere where they recrystallize upon contact with the coolor In the case of generators located on the ground , the crystals are carried aloft by ascending air currents whereas aircraft generators produce the crystals within or in the near vicinity of the clouds . Typical generators are devices where a solution of silver iodide in acetone is injected or sprayed into a propane , oxyapropane or hydrogen flame or where coke impregnated with silver iodide is burned in an air-blown crucible furnace or where a rope or wick impregnated with silver iodide is burned in an open flame or in an air-propane blast furnace . 3,127,17 Patented Mar. . Cloud seeding tests showed a remarkable effect . This method allows the development of twin rotating horizontal cylinders of ice crystal thermal , which slowly rise , expand and entrain the supercooled cloud droplets to provide the supersaturated condition and time for the required growth of seeded ice crystals . When the thermal reaches the top of the cloud , it spreads horizontally while lowering the ice crystals of sufficiently large size and fall velocity resulting in an effective treatment of the existing and induced cloud volume for precipitation augmentation and the associated dynamic effect . The seeding method and apparatus for the operation are claimed . We await the results . But in the meantime , like Dane says , we all have got to do what we can , make phone calls , send emails , donate supplies , pray , mediate , share information , etc. , there are a lot of web sites out there that help us do that , just search Standing Rock . He was asked if he thought the pipeline be would be built . Maybe it 's bravado . Maybe he is thinking of his investors . Maybe he knew a weather assault was in the plan .
