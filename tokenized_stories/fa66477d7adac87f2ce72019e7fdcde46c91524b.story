We like to bring this chestnut back from time to time . Watch it , and you 'll know why . In 1977 , just a short month before Bing Crosby died of a heart attack , the 40s crooner hosted David Bowie , the glam rocker , on his Christmas show . The awkwardness of the meeting is palpable . Also find a Will Ferrell parody of the meeting here . We hope you enjoy revisiting this clip with us . Happy holidays to you all .
