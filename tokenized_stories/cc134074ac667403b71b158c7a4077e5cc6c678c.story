Morton County Police with additional support from other law enforcement agencies engaged in violent conflict with the Standing Rock Water Protectors through the night . The Water Protectors came under a sustained and dangerous attack by police on Highway 1806 , from approximately 6 pm -LRB- Eastern Time , ET -RRB- on Sunday , 20th November . Please note : The rest of this report contains some graphic reportage photography that readers may find disturbing . Serious Injuries Sustained By Standing Rock Water Protectors Reports of the wounded are still coming in , but Indigenous Rising Media issued a report via Facebook from the Head Medic at the Oceti Sakowin Camp at 11:11 pm -LRB- ET -RRB- . This stated that 167 Water Protectors have been injured , and that 3 of the casualties are tribal elders . There are , fortunately , currently no reports of fatalities , although there have been several reports of cardiac arrest with at least one Water Protector reported to be in critical condition in hospital . Video footage shared by Native Opinion shows Oceti Sakowan Medic , Leland Brenholt , reporting that he had seen at least 3 gunshot wounds to the head from police use of rubber bullets . Live-streamed footage of the police intervention includes statements that some Water Protectors had been vomiting and urinating in response to the aggressive use of tear gas against them . Update : The latest reports -LRB- source : the Guardian -RRB- are that there were over 300 casualties among the Water Protectors , with 26 of these being hospitalised . Injuries have included multiple bone fractures , as the photographs I have sourced from the Water Protectors show . While the majority of casualties were suffering from hypothermia from the combination of freezing weather and the use of water cannons by the police , other injuries include damage to vision and hearing , one individual suffering a grand mal seizure , and another who suffered internal bleeding . The Water Protectors are primarily an indigenous Native American community comprising a wide range of ages , from youth to the elderly , and including both women and men . Freezing Temperatures Significantly Increased The Danger On a brutally cold night -LRB- temperatures ranging between a below-freezing 20-25 degrees , with an additional wind chill factor making it feel even colder -RRB- , the Water Protectors appeared to have been kettled onto the Backwater Bridge , preventing any means of escape . Police then began using a range of military weapons against them over a period of several hours . It is not clear what , if anything , provoked this level of intervention . Weapons used by the Morton County Police overnight reportedly included : water cannon , tear gas , rubber bullets , concussion grenades , and LRAD sound devices which can induce permanent deafness . The tactics used by the police have been condemned by various civil liberties organisations , including Amnesty International , ACLU , and the National Lawyers Guild . Water Cannons Set A Standing Rock Precedent This marks the first time that water cannons have been deployed by police since this standoff began in April , 2016 . Eye-witness accounts from the scene claim ice formed on the hands and clothes of the Water Protectors and on-site journalists , as a result of the combination of cold weather and cold water . This claim is not supported by the video footage I have viewed . There has been a blockade of burned out vehicles at Fort Rice on Highway 1806 , erected by the National Guard since October 27th 2016 . The Water Protectors have made multiple attempts to remove the blockade since that date , but have repeatedly been refused permission to do so by the police . The blockade has since been reinforced with razor wire and cement barricades . The conflict began around 7 pm -LRB- ET -RRB- , when the Water Protectors made a further attempt to remove the burned out vehicles , to restore access to the road . The police responded by forming a line to kettle the Water Protectors on Backwater Bridge , and the situation rapidly escalated from there . The live-streams have dropped signal at various points throughout the night , and it has been widely alleged that this is the result of the police using signal jammers to prevent the streams from being broadcast . I have requested confirmation regarding the use of signal jamming equipment from the authorities in the area , and shall update this report accordingly as and when I hear back from them about this . Protesters in mass amounts , estimated to be around 400 , are on the bridge and attempting to breach the bridge to go north on highway 1806 . The Water Protectors dispute this account , stating that police started some of the , while others were small-scale attempts to combat the cold weather conditions . They have openly acknowledged returning the grenades fired at them by the police , by throwing these devices at the police . The events of last weekend are the latest aggressive acts since the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe set up camp to protest the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline . It is understood that there is an ongoing legal dispute about the rights to build and drill in the area , to which future reports shall be devoted to examining in more detail . It is now nearly three weeks since that comment . I will continue to report on the situation at Standing Rock , North Dakota , as it develops . The next report is likely to be on the planned deployment of US military veterans to this conflict , so stick around and support the work being made - you power this . If you like the article you just read , please make a pledge to the writer , so that they can keep on doing their valuable work .
