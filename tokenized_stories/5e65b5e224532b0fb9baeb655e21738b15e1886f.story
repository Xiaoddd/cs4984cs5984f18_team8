She has been conspicuously absent during these many months that these protests and illegal activities have been escalating . Although I disagree with her unprincipled mode of thinking , I get it . On one side she has a critical voting bloc with Native Americans . On the other side , she has oil and energy , critical to the North Dakota economy . She has , up until recently , been able to traverse the two . People are noticing her refusal to take position as evidenced on her own Facebook page . Regardless of her post content , the ensuing comments decry her for not taking a position on DAPL . The liberal left and environmentalists are noticing too . Senator Heitkamp , there are times when no decision is a decision . When no action is an action . The statement referred to here came after a Federal Court ruling , which sided with the pipeline company after full deliberation . His action stomped on the judicial process , exhibited extreme executive branch overreach , and gave the middle finger to the rule of law , the separation of powers , and the people of North Dakota . however , I want to hear you admonish the administration for this egregious action . This is exactly the type of situation in which the people of North Dakota want to know you will stand up to a President on their behalf . Yes , even if he is the leader of your party . You have no choice now , despite the unfamiliar territory of standing for something which may cause you to lose votes . Mr. Iron Eyes was part of your team of 2016 Congressional candidates , along with Sen. Glassheim and yourself . Yesterday Mr. Iron Eyes came out publicly supporting illegal activities of protesters in Bismarck and Mandan . In a very conspiratorial tone , he references Snowden , and implies the torching of vehicles and equipment was an inside job . Fault Mr. Archambault for many things , but he is not advocating violence . Senator Heitkamp , there are times when no decision is a decision . When no action is an action . When not saying where you stand actually says exactly where you stand . Come out now and denounce Mr. Iron Eyes , and repudiate all illegal and violent actions of the protesters . No more wavering and hedging . The people of North Dakota want to know if you have the fortitude to stand up for them .
