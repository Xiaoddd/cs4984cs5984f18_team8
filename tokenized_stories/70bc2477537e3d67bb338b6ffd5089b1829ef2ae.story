Here are five facts to get smart about who Betsy DeVos is and what her nomination could mean for America . 1 . Betsy DeVos Refused to Send Her Children to Public Schools in Grand Rapids , Michigan Betsy and her husband Dick DeVos , Jr. , have four children they raised in the prosperous town of Ada , Michigan , which is the headquarters of AmWay , the multi-level marketing company that made the DeVos family billionaires . She is also an heir to the Prince Corporation fortune from sun visors and other car parts . The public elementary , middle , and high school in Ada , a suburb of Grand Rapids , Michigan , are highly ranked , but she did not send her children to public schools . She has said that her two daughters were home-schooled for a number of years . Instead of sending their children to public schools , for nearly three decades , Betsy and Dick have focused on pushing vouchers for private schools and bankrolling politicians to advance their agenda to redirect American tax dollars away from truly public schools . 2 . He and the others who were charged challenged the reach of state statutes in court through various appeals from 2002 through 2004 , but they lost their efforts to prevent criminal trials . But , the fact that Jensen was charged with felonies for misusing public tax dollars for partisan political purposes did not deter Betsy DeVos from hiring him in 2004 to advance her personal agenda to change American schools on behalf of AFC . In 2005 , he was tried in state court and convicted on all counts . The judge sentenced Jensen to five years , including 15 months of confinement along with supervised release . Jensen appealed his conviction , and he also lost his office in the legislature , but he had a job with DeVos . In 2010 , after changes in the judiciary , Jensen won an appeal of his conviction and agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor crime to settle the case . It was the largest fine for violating election laws in state history . The primary organizations that DeVos has bankrolled to carry out these policy goals are the dark money group , American Federation for Children -LRB- AFC -RRB- , which is a 501 -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 4 -RRB- , and its affiliated 501 -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 3 -RRB- nonprofit group , Alliance for School Choice . These groups have become major contributors to the right-wing corporate education reform echo chamber . AFC has gone through several evolutions since its 1998 founding including name changes . Some of these changes occurred after political controversies such as violations of campaign finance laws in Ohio and Wisconsin , as noted above . AFC is and always has been a very important player in local state and national politics , helping to strongly support Republican candidates who move her education privatization agenda forward . Essentially , both ALEC and AFC want that national priority to be expanded funding for charter schools , which defunds truly public schools . The nomination of Betsy DeVos to be the head of the Department of Education is a clear sign that the nation is about to embark on a dangerously extreme national experiment in the privatization of our education system that could deal a death blow to our public schools as we have known them . K12 has paid its CEO millions in stock in the company , whose revenues come overwhelmingly from public school budgets . CMD has also documented how charter schools in the DeVos backyard of Michigan have been embroiled in fraud and scandal , and how the state has even received federal tax dollars for charters that never even opened . 4 . Theocracy : She Has Pushed for Vouchers and More to Get Tax Money to Support Christian Schools DeVos has approached the issue of education as a religious issue for her personally and as an area which she wants to change the law to reflect her personal views . EFF provides private funding for private school tuition , and is supported with significant donations from the DeVos family . And having grown up in families that are in the business world , we both believe that competition and choices make everyone better , and that ultimately if the system that prevails in the United States today had more competition , if there were other choices for people to make freely that all of the schools would become better as a result and that excellence would be sought in every setting . The DeVos family is a major funder of the Republican party . DeVos has served as chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party and was the finance chairwoman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee . The DeVos family fortune funds pro-education privatization , anti-union and pro-school voucher groups . The DeVos foundation has also contributed millions of dollars to other right wing organizations such as the State Policy Network , Heritage Foundation , the American Enterprise Institute , FreedomWorks , Federalist Society , Mackinac Center for Public Policy , and others . In 2015 , DeVos money also helped fund the push for adoption of a statewide religious freedom restoration act , or RFRA law , that awards adoption agencies in Michigan the right to claim a religious exemption from having to serve LGBTQ couples . Both the Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation and the Dick and Betsy DeVos Foundation gave money to Bethany Christian Services , which lobbied hard for passage of the controversial RFRA . Recently , the DeVos family also helped fund two pieces of extreme state legislation in Michigan . In one fell swoop , the law preempted local regulation of nine wage and benefit policies ranging from minimum wage to worker training and organizing .

Our only hope seems to be in electrifying the public , here & elsewhere , to wake up & work , tirelessly , to undo their hideous agenda . Reply Ken Stevens November 30th , 2016 at 6:06 PM -LRB- CDT -RRB- Yes , the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of Education for the United States must be rejected by the Senate . It is obvious that she is an enemy of our non-discriminatory system of public schools and is more interested in promoting schools that are not required to accept all comers and would indoctrinate the young in her religion . We need to contact our US Senators and urge them in the strongest terms to vote against her confirmation . Almost anyone would be preferable . Education is not the only thing these thugs hope to privatize . From this unconstitutional EO we get charter schools and the right to waive laws , rules and regulations across the nation thanks to the nonpartisan Congress effort to restructure not only our schools but our total society . The Clintons are equally as guilty . See Goals 2000 and the Dear Hillary letter from Marc Tucker when Bill was elected . It was on the web , but may be found in the Congressional Record . They are to be molded , shaped and taught to be content with the low level jobs selected by the assumed elite . This total plan destroys representative government and above all citizens lose control of their tax base . Gulen has schools on our military bases and across the nation taking the citizens money for unknown purposes . No doubt , this is to gear up for the proposed 20 billion USA dollars to expand vouchers nationally . I grew up in the Calvinist society that Dick and Betsy talked about in the interview and the doctrine of pre-destination means that they will have no reason to change their extremism . They believe that are destined to heaven no matter what they do . These are scary people . Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published .
