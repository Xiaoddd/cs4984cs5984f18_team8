He won victories against the French to acquire Canada for England and helped make England the world 's chief colonizer at the conclusion of the Seven Years War among the colonial powers -LRB- 1756-1763 -RRB- . The town of Amherst , Massachusetts , was named for Lord Jeff even before he became a Lord . Amherst Collegewas later named after the town . It is said the local inhabitants who formed the town preferred another name , Norwottuck , after the Indians whose land it had been ; the colonial governor substituted his choice for theirs . Click on the pictures to see full-size images . Smallpox blankets Despite his fame , Jeffrey Amherst 's name became tarnished by stories of smallpox-infected blankets used as germ warfare against American Indians . Waldman writes , in reference to a siege of Fort Pitt -LRB- Pittsburgh -RRB- by Chief Pontiac 's forces during the summer of 1763 : ... Captain Simeon Ecuyer had bought time by sending smallpox-infected blankets and handkerchiefs to the Indians surrounding the fort -- an early example of biological warfare -- which started an epidemic among them . Amherst himself had encouraged this tactic in a letter to Ecuyer . Lord Jeff 's letters during Pontiac 's Rebellion The documents provided here are made available to set the record straight . These are images of microfilmed original letters written between General Amherst and his officers and others in his command during the summer of 1763 , when the British were fighting what became known as Pontiac 's Rebellion . Pontiac , an Ottawa chief who had sided with the French , led an uprising against the British after the French surrender in Canada . Indians were angered by Amherst 's refusal to continue the French practice of providing supplies in exchange for Indian friendship and assistance , and by a generally imperious British attitude toward Indians and Indian land . The project was designed to preserve British historical documents from possible war damage . There are almost three hundred reels of microfilm on Amherst alone . The microfilm is difficult to read , and paper copies even harder . Nonetheless , the images obtained by scanning the copies are sufficiently clear for online viewing . The images are of key excerpts from the letters . An index is provided to show by document number the location of these images in the microfilm set . Ascii text of the excerpts is also provided . We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them . This indicates at least that the writers knew the plan could be carried out . It is curious that the specific plans to spread smallpox were relegated to postscripts . I leave it to the reader to ponder the significance of this . Several other letters from the summer of 1763 show the smallpox idea was not an anomaly . Amherst 's correspondence during this time includes many letters on routine matters , such as officers who are sick or want to be relieved of duty ; accounts of provisions on hand , costs for supplies , number of people garrisoned ; negotiations with provincial governors -LRB- the army is upset with the Pennsylvania assembly , for example , for refusing to draft men for service -RRB- ; and so on . None of these other letters show a deranged mind or an obsession with cruelty . Amherst 's venom was strictly reserved for Indians . The French and the Indians The sharpest contrast with letters about Indians is provided by letters regarding the other enemy , the French . Amherst has been at war with the French as much as with the Indians ; but he showed no obsessive desire to extirpate them from the earth . It was the Indians who drove him mad . He had a warm sympathy for the countryside , an interest in people and the way they lived . This humane attitude was reflected in his rules for the governing of Canada . Long then quotes from Amherst 's letter to Sir William Johnson : ... it would be happy for the Provinces there was not an Indian settlement within a thousand Miles of them , and when they are properly punished , I care not how soon they move their Habitations , for the Inhabitants of the Woods are the fittest Companions for them , they being more nearly allied to the Brute than to the Human Creation . These warriors would not stand in ordered ranks ; they fell back into the forests only to emerge again in renewed attack ; their leaders defied British logic and proved effective against a string of British forts ; these were the enemy that nearly succeeded in driving the British out , and became the target for British genocide . Conclusion All in all , the letters provided here remove all doubt about the validity of the stories about Lord Jeff and germ warfare . The General 's own letters sustain the stories . As to whether the plans actually were carried out , Parkman has this to say : ... in the following spring , Gershom Hicks , who had been among the Indians , reported at Fort Pitt that the small-pox had been raging for some time among them ... . An additional source of information on the matter is the Journal of William Trent , commander of the local militia of the townspeople of Pittsburgh during Pontiac 's seige of the fort . Trent 's entry for May 24 , 1763 , includes the following statement : ... we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital . I hope it will have the desired effect . Trent 's Journal confirms that smallpox had broken out in Fort Pitt prior to the correspondence between Bouquet and Amherst , thus making their plans feasible . It also indicates that intentional infection of the Indians with smallpox had been already approved by at least Captain Ecuyer at the fort , who some commentators have suggested was in direct correspondence with General Amherst on this tactic -LRB- though I have not yet found such letters -RRB- .

There is a smallpox virus Variola minor that is transmitted by inhalation , communicable for 3-7 days . There is a smallpox virus Variola major that is transmitted by inhalation and by contamination ; it is communicable by the former method for 9-14 days and by the latter method for several years in a dried state . See Ann F. Ramenofsky , Vectors of Death : The Archaeology of European Contact -LRB- Albuquerque , NM : University of New Mexico Press , 1987 -RRB- : Among Class I agents , Variola major holds a unique position . Although the virus is most frequently transmitted through droplet infection , it can survive for a number of years outside human hosts in a dried state -LRB- Downie 1967 ; Upham 1986 -RRB- . As a consequence , Variola major can be transmitted through contaminated articles such as clothing or blankets -LRB- Dixon 1962 -RRB- . In the nineteenth century , the U.S. Army sent contaminated blankets to Native Americans , especially Plains groups , to control the Indian problem -LRB- Stearn and Stearn 1945 -RRB- . While infected carcasses had long been catapulted into besieged cities , this seems to be the first time a known weakness in the immunity structure of an adversary population was deliberately exploited with a weapons response .
