Given the current rate of biodiversity loss , including climate change , what we are facing is a problematic future with no assurance of our system 's stability which is one of the milestones caused by this era on man : the Anthropocene . We ignore the decline of other species at our peril -- for they are the barometer that reveals our impact on the world that sustains us . He is pointing out the dilemma that the future may bring because of the human impact to the environment . Based on their findings of the analysis of 3,706 species , which is noted as the most comprehensive work yet , we have already lost 58 percent of animal population from 1970 to 2012 . Using the same rate , it could be foreseen that 2020 will leave a mark of wiping out two-thirds of the faunal species in the planet . Unsustainable harvesting of the resources , such as illegal fishing and poaching activities , greatly affects animal population too . Other reasons behind the decline of wildlife population are pollution and climate change . But though the picture can be a terrifying event that shows possible collapse of the nature 's system , a professor from Duke University claimed that the report may be broadly true , but efforts of having species that are now recovering should also noted . He said that the increasing population of these animals , with some even delisted from being endangered because of their notable population increase , can provide better options for a more sustainable future for everyone .
