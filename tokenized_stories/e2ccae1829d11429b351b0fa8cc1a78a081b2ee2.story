The commission is led by Quebec Court of Appeal Justice Jacques Chamberland . He said he first learned of it on December 20 , 2016 , and advised the deputy minister for public security the next day . No protocols in place Top provincial police brass who also testified Monday said there were no rules in place before Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux asked for the procedures to be tightened last fall . Those same protocols applied to surveillance requests involving lawyers , judges or politicians . That provincial police had no procedure in place may seem surprising , given the Supreme Court of Canada had already ruled on the importance of the confidentiality of journalistic sources . Most of the hearings will be public , but the commission also has the option of holding closed-door sessions . Montreal police Chief Philippe Pichet is expected to testify Tuesday . Both the SQ and Montreal police have confirmed journalists have been the subject of surveillance . They also allowed police to obtain the identities of everyone he spoke to or exchanged text messages with . Michel Cormier , the head of Radio-Canada , told the commission last week the spying scandal has cast a chill on journalistic sources . The commission is due to submit a report in March 2018 .
