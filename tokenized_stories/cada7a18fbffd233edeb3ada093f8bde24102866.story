This and killings of Freddie Grey and others are credited for the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement that is now catching media attention and raising debate on police insensitivity , tactics , and militarization . In spite of this growing national awareness , a recent American Values survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute shows more than 70 percent of white Christians believe that police killings of African-American men are isolated incidents . Since there is no reliable federal database on the excessive use of force , only anecdotal evidence for each case exists . Such cases like Hilton Vega and Anthony Rosario , suspected of nothing , shot in the back fourteen times while handcuffed and on the ground in 1995 . Or like A. Anderson , who was shot while handcuffed on the ground in 1996 . The startling list of such cases can go on and on . Perhaps the answer may be related to another social phenomenon . Although whites and blacks use illegal drugs at relatively the same rate , the US judicial system imprisons black men nine times more frequently than it does whites . What American society needs to understand is that these phenomena are part of a historical trend and institutionalized prejudice that is well understood within psychological and socioeconomic arenas . I. Psychological Factors : An Unseen Reality In the 1960s , Lestor Luborsky conducted an experiment that tracked eye movements of people viewing photographs . He discovered that if a photo contained images that people found morally objectionable or threatened their world view , their eyes would not even stray once to those images . In society , there are those who do not see but can , and then there are those who can not see because of institutionalized and learned systems of prejudice . Understanding Direct and Indirect Racism In 1918 an eight-month-pregnant woman named Mary Turner was lynched -LRB- murdered by an angry mob of whites -RRB- in Valdosta , Georgia . Ordinary citizens left their homes in a rage to give her the justice they felt she deserved . This was enough to make her their next target . She was later hanged upside down from a tree . They doused her clothes with gasoline and burned them off of her . Then used a hog-splitting knife to open her belly . Her infant fell to the ground , and cried briefly , until someone crushed its head with his heel . The mob then shot her hundreds of times . Thousands of black men and women were lynched in the United States in the first twenty years of the twentieth century alone . It is interesting to note that in the aftermath of lynchings like the one that killed Mary , her husband , and their unborn , hundreds of black people quietly and quickly evacuated their fine farmland leaving it ripe for new white tenants , including those who never held a knife , gun , or rope . This is just one of many prime examples of how the social structure became racially stratified through violence and how white families indirectly benefited over the years . As documented as it is , society often forgets how easy it was to create genocide and reap the benefits of stolen land , labor , or wealth from blacks , Indians , and other minorities . Much of this social stratification still lingers and its complete correction has yet to see fruition . More importantly , to understand the social conditions that lead to such atrocities , one must not look away from the larger picture . Racial hatred is not historically unique to the United States nor exclusively perpetrated by white Caucasians . Many empires have enslaved rival groups and whomever else found themselves on the wrong end of a sword -LRB- or legal system -RRB- . From an anthropological point of view , ethnocentrism likely predates racial hatred and could possibly be responsible for early racial inequality in early antiquity . As the demand for labor developed in feudal societies , slave classes became part of the social structures and often consisted of ethnic and cultural outsiders . When the Roma , or Gypsies started moving to Europe around 1000 AD , the Europeans responded to them as vermin and vile , brown creatures . Gypsy hunts in Europe foreshadowed Indian hunts that took place later in America and Aborigine hunts in Australia . Ethnocentrism -LRB- or racial supremacy -RRB- goes hand in hand with whichever racial class happens to be dominate . However , it was only as recent as the 16th century that White European supremacy began to manifested itself on the global stage . It all comes down to power and whichever group holds the power creates the social structures that restrict control of capital and societal privilege . Criminology and Justifying Racial Violence The historical development of racial hatred follows an almost unbroken pattern . First , as any criminal psychologist would agree , the perpetrators of any mass murder consider themselves the real victims . Secondly , in a sense they are the victims . For if one believes they are entitled to something that belongs to another -LRB- land , body , labor , etc -RRB- and that person resists appropriation or threatens the perceived entitlement , it is easy to understand how the racist killer could feel victimized . All hate begins with loss of privilege or fear of losing such rights , even if the alleged rights were based on exploitation and inequity . Thirdly , nearly all victims of genocide are first demonized through propaganda to stir up retribution for the loss of superiority . The result is Jews victimized Germans and were responsible for nearly everything wrong in the world . According to Nazi propaganda , Jews were alleged kidnappers of baby Aryans for sacrifice . The mass genocide of Native Americans throughout the American West was , too , not without hysterical myths about their savagery . The scientific explosion surrounding the Darwinian notion of natural selection inevitably led to an explosion of scientific racism , which declared that nonwhites were genetically inferior and thus destined to be superseded by whites . Motives Behind Racism Motivations for atrocities often vary . Sometimes it is overreaction to a real or perceived injury . When whites were still settling California , Indians killed a white trapper for attempting to rape a Mattole women . The local white settlement became enraged . We want the Philippines . The islands are enormously rich , but unfortunately they are infested by Filipinos . In 1920 , Canadian federal legislation required all First Nations children aged 7 to 15 to attend . Thousands of students died at residential schools in the US and Canada . Disease , fires , accidents , abuse , and suicide were among the main causes . It is important to note that whenever minorities resist their exploitation , the white majority are always the alleged victims . Ten thousand men , women , and children from Omaha broke Will Brown out of jail and hanged him because they believed -LRB- incorrectly -RRB- that he had assaulted a white child . When the white mayor of Omaha tried to stop them , he too was beaten to death . II . It is a little known fact that between 1609 and the early 1800s , as many as two-thirds of white colonists had been forced to come over to North America as slaves . Since white slavery was prevalent at roughly the same time as black , some historians such as Michael A. Hoffman use this to delegitimize black social injustices , as though the suffering of poor whites somehow negates or diminishes the suffering of members of other cultures and races . It can , however , point out the rationale for exploiting one or another group . When England claimed North America , King James I basically created a large estate by granting it to the Virginia Company of London . As true with black and Indian slaves , white slaves were regularly subjected to whippings , rape , torture , and murder . Conditions were so harsh that 80 percent of indentured servants died within their first year . The owners used fictitious debts or such petty crimes as stealing food , to maintain permanent control over the lives of their servants . Would-be indentured servants were acquired from taverns and fairs , while ship captains bribed judges and indebted prison jailers to secure prisoners who could be indentured . Prisoners were sold at auction for various terms and years . At the request of the Virginia Company , a bill passed in 1618 legalizing the capture of children eight years or older to be transported as slaves to America . Judges received up to 50 percent of the profits for the sale of children . It is estimated that tens of thousands of poor people throughout Great Britain were sold into slavery . Even after England abolished slavery in 1808 , children were still the cheapest exploitable labor . Society virtually considered them expendable as many factories employed them to clean smoke chimneys , even hot flues . In this context , it is obvious that the Portuguese pioneering the black African slave trade was not motivated by hatred . Perhaps it is a small wonder few today understand what racism truly is . Once again , society is looking away . Black Slavery Unified White Society In 1832 , proslavery philosopher Thomas Roderick Dew saw black slavery as the common unifier for society . So long as racial differences could be emphasized , poor whites would forget the rich whites who exploited them as surely as they exploited blacks . The poor historically perceived others on the bottom of the social latter as the source of their misery , and the misperception continues to this day . It is a manifestation of the selective blindness that besets us all . Still today popular culture is affected by the unquestioned assumptions that make education what it is , and that determine the words that are chosen . The social psyche manufactured via movies , books , newspapers , and television teaches that one kind of violence is violence , and another kind of violence is not . As a result , Clive Bundy and his armed militia who occupied federal lands in Oregon are not culturally labeled as terrorists , while a little brown boy in Texas who brings a clock to school does . It is no wonder that so often members of those groups that share common interests end up scapegoating each other , instead of looking together at the people and organizations exploiting them both . The first poor Irish immigrants were hated and despised for competing in an already tight job market . Having a long history of resistance to British exploitation , the Irish seemed like natural allies to other exploited groups , notably the nonwhite working class . They made sure at the very least to disassociate with the most oppressed class . They cared little for political theory , abolitionism , revolution , or worker solidarity . With the lives of their children involved , they used every advantage at their disposal , including their white skin . Oftentimes , blacks were sought out at their place of work , and terrorized away . For example a primarily Irish mob attacked and murdered the black employees of a tobacco factory in Brooklyn and burned down a black orphanage in the Five Points riots during the Civil War . As Ignatiev solemnly demonstrates , it did not take long for the Irish to become white . The laws of apartheid were drafted and implemented at the request of large mining companies , such as DeBeers , to explicitly serve their interests . Mines could only be held by whites and were worked almost entirely by blacks . Since a free market in labor could have driven up wages , this led to the Pass Laws of apartheid . Once again , the laws were not passed from any overt hatred , but for reasons of economy . African workers began to be confined to company compounds for the extent of their employment . Given that most natives lived off the land , and thus did not need to sell their labor , the government passed poll , hut , and even dog , taxes to force them off the land and into the mines . Since the natives had not previously been part of a cash economy , they had to go into mines to earn money to pay taxes . The Masters and Servants Bill gave legal right to beat nonwhite employees . The death rate in the minds fell between 8 and 10 percent per year , translating to 8,000-10,000 killed in mines just in 1899 . The rest is history . III . It sent forth 100,000 members to try men without courts and inflicted penalties for their loss of privilege , sometimes capital ones . In the weeks foregoing the Presidential election of 1868 , at least 2,000 people were killed or wounded by Klan violence in Louisiana alone . The Klan continued their acts of terrorism . Church meetings and political gatherings of African Americans were broken up , guns were confiscated , followed by lynchings , rapes , torture , and castrations . Between 1868 and 1871 , conservative figures estimate Klan murders at no less than twenty thousand . To simply blame the KKK would be to miss a deeper point . Though federal troops broke up the Klan by 1871 , the social conditions that gave rise to such violence were left intact . Manifestations In the US Legal System Since most blacks were terrorized away from the voting booths , elected legislatures began passing laws that legitimized black disenfranchisement . The political aims of the KKK were eventually achieved legally . Today in some states , nearly 25 percent of African Americans do not have the right to vote due to drug related felonies that disproportionately prosecute them . Felony disenfranchisement accounts for 13 percent of African Americans nationally . And when a black defendant and a white defendant are convicted of murders with similar aggravating circumstances , the black defendant is significantly more likely to get the death penalty . Economic Downturn and Public Relations : The Unholy Alliance The Klan was nearly bankrupt after WWI , and would have gone so , had its leader William Simmons not come into contact with one of the pioneers of the embryonic public relations industry , Edward Young Clarke . The Kleagle kept four dollars from each recruit , and passed the other six to his King . The King kept a dollar , and so on , up the scale . In order to sell memberships , the Kleagles were told to appeal to the fears of targeted communities . The Klan no longer burgeoned , but exploded . In less than a year , eleven hundred Kleagles were soliciting across the country . Klan violence grew apace associated with elections , with robed Klan members intimidating blacks , Jews , Catholics , socialists , and others into not voting . People liked what they heard . They liked what the Klan represented . By 1923 , at least seventy-five U.S. representatives owed their seats to the Klan . Warren G. Harding , was sworn in as a member of the Ku Klux Klan in the Green Room of the White House , using the White House Bible for the oath . The KKK taps a vein in US culture , a vein of rage that waits always to explode . It is important to note that the framing conditions in the culture that not only make this rage inevitable , but make inevitable , too , the turning of this rage onto inappropriate targets . According to the Klan , Catholics were going to take over the state . The KKK flourished when the end of World War I brought the soldiers home to find jobs that no longer existed when the wartime economy ceased , and folded with the end of the recession . If prisons are indeed a reflection of society , the racial component is very disturbing . In prisons , it is in the interest of guards and administrators for prisoners to be at odds with each other . In short , racism in America has and will change its manifestations to keep up with the times . Racial division just so happens to be a convenient mechanism of control . Chinese Migrant Workers Now that it has been demonstrated that racial hatred is a reactionary phenomenon to lost economic privilege based on exploitation , it is time to test the same formula in a different case study . In 1850 , Chinese workers were welcomed , desired , even renowned , in great measure due to their reputation as being strong , highly competent , hard-working , and reticent . In other words , they formed the perfect labor force for owners of capital . Chinese men were crucial to the construction of the transcontinental railroads . What made Chinese labor exploitative is that their crews were paid less than white crews and under dangerous conditions . Whenever they attempted a strike for better safety conditions , their food supply would be cutoff . No one will ever know how many Chinese died building the Central Pacific , but by 1870 some twenty thousand pounds of bones had been gathered from shallow graves along the tracks and returned to their homeland . Many thousands more of the dead remain in unmarked graves throughout the West . The reward on completion of the line was unemployment for the living , and although there had been fair resentment toward the Chinese by white Americans before , it then turned to hatred . Tens of thousands of workers were suddenly competing for jobs in an already competitive market . The resentment became all the worse when they showed signs of success everywhere they went . Even when the Chinese did not take jobs from white Americans , they drove down wages and working conditions . Next , the Chinese were demonized . Chinese women were viewed , as were black women , as a lustful threat to manhood , and Chinese men were viewed , as were black men , as threats to white women and children . Then finally , Chinese immigrants were lynched . They were hanged , burned alive , castrated , mutilated , and scalped . Their homes were burned . The homes of those who employed them were also burned . In once instance , twenty-eight Chinese men were massacred in Rock Springs , Wyoming , 1885 . All were burned alive and mutilated . Contemporary Racial Biases and White Privilege Social theorists familiar with black sociology see the stifled black upward social mobility in lower-class ghettos as a result of transient family life , job ceilings , crime , and institutional racism . Frazier argued that the social psychology of the black bourgeoisie , especially during the pre-civil rights era of the 1940s and 1950s , was based on fear of losing status . As a result , many maintained expensive homes and cars beyond their means . Despite occasional success stories and the support of the Negro press , black achievement in business was relatively insignificant . W.E.B. Not only does racial stratification exist in America today , it has seen further worldwide expansion through US globalization . Instead of bringing foreign workers into the factory , factories have simply moved to the foreign workers , sometimes sustained by the infamous sweatshops and child labor there . In some cases , if the foreign workers strike , so will death squads led by whomever multinationals keep in power in that region . A connection can be drawn here with the lack of prosecutions for US war atrocities as well . Furthermore , white supremacy still exists in the current social psyche , and it too is a global phenomenon promoted by non-white and white societies alike . It has reached every culture and continues to distort racial self-images and self worth . From North America and Europe to Africa and the Far East , white skin and Caucasian features are favored above all other skin tones in the business and marketing world . In Korea , people there commonly get plastic surgery to narrow the bones in their face to look more Caucasian . Black celebrity models often whiten their skin , as it proves beneficial for their careers . The only differences in the two were the names : Greg and Jamal . Of these , 46 percent were motivated by racial bias . White supremacy is so ingrained into mainstream culture that most are unaware of the very social symbols they attach to class . The purpose of the commercial media has always been to sell fear because it breeds insecurity , and then consumer culture offers any number of ways to buy a way back to feeling secure , however momentarily . People are fed these images of what everyone is supposed to look like : sulky lips , perky breasts , buns of steel , everlasting youth ; even white . In her book , Ancient Futures : Learning From Ladakh , Helena Norberg-Hodge studied the impact television had on indigenous cultures . In the Ladakh , part of the trans-Himalayan region of Kashmir , the arrival of television changed their value systems because idealized stars make people feel inferior and passive . The effects of television on indigenous communities are both immediate and insidious . In the 1980s , television was introduced into Dene and Inuit villages in the far north of Canada . Jerry Mander interviewed members of these communities . Television and movies project power structure of western society , and by projecting it , perpetuate it to make it seem normal . Once viewers have become familiarized to a certain type of story , they become indoctrinated with stereotypes . Nixon achieved his political success by subtle exploitation of Confederate nationalism . Racism as a social phenomenon did not originate from hate , but is rather just one of the many social side effects of Capitalism . The incentive of slavery was economic . Genocide and atrocities were not committed out of overt hatred until white privilege was threatened with competition within the labor force . These in turn influenced political institutions to further suppress black participation in the political process . Although the United States no longer has many lynchings , even in cases where a black man murders a white man , mobs allow the state to do the imprisoning or executing . The current penal system imprisons and disenfranchises minorities by legal means what the KKK strived to achieve . As black social mobility continues to be hindered by white privilege and the war on drugs , the very economic structure responsible for its social conditioning continues to create atrocities abroad in nonwhite countries . The U.S.-backed Shah in Iran killed thirty thousand people . US backed commandoes assassinated union leaders in Columbia . Between five hundred thousand and a million people were murdered at CIA urging and with CIA assistance just in Indonesia during the late 1960s because the Indonesians did not vote the way the CIA wanted them to . Similar stories can be told in the Congo , Guatemala , Iraq , Chile , etc. . One can not expect different results today from the very institutionalized socioeconomic structure that engendered slavery . Today , multinationals are responsible for the enslavement of countless millions around the world . Everyone in the industrialized world probably has slave products at home . If prisons were really about public safety , those responsible for the three hundred thousand preventable cancer deaths per year would be behind bars . And if prisons were about protecting property , those who looted the Savings & Loans would be serving terms proportionate with the amount they cost the public . Instead of demagoging prejudices or deflecting the issue of race inequality , politicians should tackle the socioeconomic conditions that create racism . Law makers might consider eliminating some of the causes of crime : the gap between rich and poor , child abuse , and an oppressive working class reality that needs to be neutralized through the use of drugs . This analysis does not suggest that nonwhites do not hate , nor that they do not commit atrocities . To do so would be hypocritical . By and large black culture does not wield the same sort of power as does white culture , making on a social scale white hatred far more dangerous . Therefore , racial hatred is often the result of a perceived threat to white privilege . Since white privilege is imbedded in American culture , most racists are unaware of their own racism . Until the social conditions of racism are commonly understood and engaged , it is unlikely that a majority of social conservatives will be persuaded to support any meaningful social action . The facts may continue to be that part of the photograph so many happen to subconsciously stray their eyes away from .
