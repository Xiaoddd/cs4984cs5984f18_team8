Pope Francis talks during a meeting Wednesday , Feb. 15 , 2017 , with indigenous people to mark the 40th governing council of the the International Fund for Agricultural Development -LRB- IFAD -RRB- at the Vatican . Francis spoke two days after a U.S. federal judge denied a request by tribes to halt construction of the final link of the project that sparked months of protests by activists aimed at stopping the 1,172-mile line . The Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes have argued the project would prevent them from practicing religious ceremonies at a lake they say is surrounded by sacred ground . Thousands of tribe members , environmentalists and others set up camps last year on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land in the North Dakota plains as protests intensified . But last week , the Army Corps granted a final easement , after President Donald Trump issued an order to advance the project days after he took office in January . Francis , who wrote a major encyclical letter in 2015 on climate change and the environment , told the group that new technologies could be legitimate but had to respect the earth .
