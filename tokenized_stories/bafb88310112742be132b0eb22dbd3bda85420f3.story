A cancer specialist at an Essex trust said they had never seen so many cancer operations cancelled . Share your experiences of the NHS this winter Read more Unprecedented numbers of patients requiring care has led to at least 23 hospital trusts declaring they can not cope since Monday , inquiries by the Guardian have established . Struggling hospitals have been forced to take highly unusual steps in order to manage a surge in demand for care . Hospitals are expected to come under even greater strain over the next few days as unusually cold weather sweeps across much of the country , which doctors fear could prompt a spike in serious breathing problems , among other conditions . At one point that day it had 27 patients who needed a bed but nowhere to put them . The hospital had nowhere to put the next patient brought in as an emergency by ambulance , it added . The Royal College of Emergency Medicine , which represents A&E doctors , warned that the already chaotic situation in the NHS could get even worse as the winter weather worsens and that the A&E system is at risk of breaking . He urged ministers and NHS leaders to draw up an urgent action plan to rescue A&E care to avoid the quality of care patients receive starting to deteriorate . However , it is understood that reports of a package of emergency funding for A&E units are wide of the mark and that the Department of Health will not be producing any more money , despite mounting problems . On Tuesday the Royal United hospital in Bath closed its Paulton Birth Centre for two weeks , which is usually used by women having a low-risk pregnancy who want a natural birth , and began using it to house medical patients instead . Mothers-to-be left disappointed by the temporary closure could have their babies at an unspecified location elsewhere , it added . Its main problem was its inability to discharge older patients , in order to free up beds , because local social care was inadequate , the trust added . It had also put more staff on to its frontline and cancelled elective surgery to help it cope . A doctor at the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS trust said it had decided not to declare an internal emergency because its bosses did not want bad publicity . Things are so stretched there that she had seen a patient with urinary problems being given a bed bath in the middle of a corridor , with just a plastic sheet to shield her from the rest of the ward .
