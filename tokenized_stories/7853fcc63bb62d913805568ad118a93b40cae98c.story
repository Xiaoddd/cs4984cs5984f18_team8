Jo-Ellen Darcy said she based her decision on a need to explore alternate routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing . Her office had announced on November 14 , 2016 that it was delaying the decision on the easement to allow for discussions with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , whose reservation lies 0.5 miles south of the proposed crossing . Tribal officials have expressed repeated concerns over the risk that a pipeline rupture or spill could pose to its water supply and treaty rights . The Dakota Access Pipeline is an approximately 1,172 mile pipeline that would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Pakota , Illinois . The pipeline is 30 inches in diameter and is projected to transport approximately 470,000 barrels of oil per day , with a capacity as high as 570,000 barrels . The current proposed pipeline route would cross Lake Oahe , an Army Corps of Engineers project on the Missouri River .
