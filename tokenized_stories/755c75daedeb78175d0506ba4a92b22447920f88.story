ANF talked to Salih Muslim , the foreign relations director of the Democratic Society Movement -LRB- TEV-DEM -RRB- about the meeting in Damascus and developments in the region . That 's why they are forced to listen to us . It depends on our process here how much Syria and the regime will change . We do not say , ` we will do that in 24 hours or a year ' . There is no such a situation . A delegation traveled there at the official request and invitation of Damascus . We do not yet know who they met and what was discussed there . However , there were already quite a few technical discussions and some work was done together . But these meetings and works did not take place in cooperation with institutions of the regime . In Tabqa there was a statement made . For the Tabqa dam technicians were needed . They came and met with the management of the dam . For the work then a few engineers came and worked there . However , that was perceived differently . These were state institutions , not institutions of the regime . From the beginning , we look at the institutions of the state differently . The institutions of the state are at the service of all and serve the population . The institutions of the regime are something else . That is why our meetings with public institutions in Tabqa and the joint work were understood as the beginning of a dialogue with the regime . But that was not the case . If there are positive developments , then there may be further steps There was an official invitation to the talks in Damascus , followed by a delegation from northern Syria that meant to understand whether the regime was sincere or not . We do not know the content of the talks . The participants said only that the talks were successful and that they had agreed on the formation of committees . If so , it is a positive step . Now everyone thinks the problem is so simple that you can solve it with a meeting . However , such a talk is something other than dialogue or negotiation . Everyone has their own style . At the moment , we can say it is a preliminary meeting to understand the intentions and build mutual trust . If there are positive developments in this sense , then further steps can follow . We have never gone beyond the unity of Syria The regime has been making propaganda about the Kurds since 2011 and says : ` They are by our side , the Kurds are with us and that 's good ' . But it is not like that . We have made a revolution . From the beginning to today , the true Syrian revolution is ours . Both socially , ideationally and structurally , we want to make some changes and have implemented them exemplarily in our areas with our revolution . Therefore , we would like to extend the model we created to the whole of Syria . The forces that call themselves opposition have no intention of change and only fight for power . Our fight is not like that . We represent a real revolution on both a mental and a social level . We are a part of Syria . We have never gone beyond Syria 's unity , we have always thought of Syria as a whole . But we have our model . We have seen that this model works and it is the best choice and want to spread it . There are comments that the talks with the regime were based on a pragmatic approach due to the occupation of Afrin . There can be no return to the old dictatorial system in Syria , that 's over . The rule of a party over the whole system as before 2011 is history . It is necessary to build a new Syria . We present our model as an example . But there is also the old regime . We will agree on a point so that we can live together in one country . But a lot is needed for that . If we had not protected ourselves , if we had not implemented our legitimate self-defense , no one would have listened to us . Even if we had not built our model , then nobody could have understood us . We have our model and our legitimate defense forces . That 's why everyone is forced to listen to us . It depends on our process here how Syria and the regime will change . We do not say , ` we will do that in 24 hours or a year ' . There is no such a situation . If negotiations begin , the committees will start by developing a roadmap . So , when we talk about reconciliation now , that does not mean that we agree on some things and make compromises in other things . Of course we want to do the best in the best way . That takes time , preparation and possibilities . But I think there is a basis for this , we can do something together . We 've based on our project for us so far and I think if everyone thinks well then they will adopt our model as well . We defend Syria 's independence , not its fragmentation . From the beginning we say that many ethnic groups live in Syria , such as the Kurds , Arabs , Turkmens , Circassians , Druze , Chechens and peoples of different religions , such as Muslims , Christians , Yazidis , Ismailis and Alevis . Our model includes the question of how co-existence can work . The previous model was a nation-state model , based on one language , one flag and one nation . Everything was unified . That does not work and that is no longer valid . Whoever lives in Syria should be able to live with his language , culture , faith , color and identity . Our model is aimed at such a Syria . That will certainly happen . Everyone believes in it . We have now entered a process . After the regime accepts it , it can be applied to all of Syria . Of course , there are certain identities that represent this in the regime . This is also a change of the mentality . As an example , one can not on the one hand recognise the Druze and then impose Arabization under one flag in Syria . The same applies to the Alevis and the Yazidis . We strive for a model in which everyone can live in their own color . Some press groups are asking about the attitude of the US and say that such negotiations could only take place with US permission . There is a deep-rooted attitude in the Middle East : there is no confidence in the peoples ' own forces , they have always looked to external forces . We broke that mentality . If we trust in ourselves and in the organization of our society , then we can achieve much . We have voiced this issue several times . Now in Syria , whether you like it or not , the international powers are present . Russia , USA , England , Iran , Saudi Arabia and others are here . If these powers really want a political solution in Syria , then they will help . If it is not so , then it means that they do not have the welfare of Syria in mind . We think so and expect this from everyone . Our relations with the US and the International Coalition are at the level of fighting against terrorism . That 's our agreement . Our political will belongs to nobody The Americans are here . But we have never tied our political will to anyone . Our political will lies in our hands . We have not lent anyone our political will , the will of the peoples and the structures we represent . When we have talks , we do that out of our own will . Be it the Russians , be it the Americans , if the international forces really want , then they will know what we have done and what we are trying to achieve . But that does not mean that we get permission from one side or the other , and they have respect for it . There is no request for permission from anyone . We do what is best for our people . This propaganda has existed from the beginning . Some consider us bound to Washington , others to the regime and others to Qandil . So it means we exist and we are a force . Who did not create us can not destroy us either . We are bound to our word . The political will is in our hands , we represent it . What we consider good for our population , for our country , we do . The regime still exists . Yes , the regime continues . But we will change that regime and democratize it . The regime will accept democratic standards , human rights and the diversity of Syrian society . Instead of the peoples hiding their faith and their identity and becoming Arabized , everyone in Syria will be able to live with their own identity . Citizens will say that I come from Syria and I am Kurd , Druze , Alevi etc. . We say that clearly and I believe we will be able to agree on this . At the moment , the Idlib operation is on the agenda . The regime is preparing for it . Idlib is important to us for two reasons . First of all , we said earlier that it concerns us wherever terror is taking place and there is a terrorist group in Syria . We defend Syria against terrorism . And on this basis we have an alliance with the international forces and have fulfilled our part in it successfully to this day . Wherever there is a terrorist organization , we are ready to fight it , but who we do it with depends both on us and on the military capabilities . That is another matter . But in principle we will do our part if there is a terrorist organization that harms the peoples of Syria . We will fulfill our task . To free Idlib is also our task In previous interviews , we said that Idlib is a powder keg in which all terrorist groups have gathered . The majority of them have been expelled from our region , they have previously fought against us . They fought us under the name of the ISIS . After that they cut their beards a little shorter , put on other uniforms and fought against us again . Then they have gathered there again . It 's almost like a blood feud between them and us . Surely we have to do something about it . That 's the first question . The second point concerns the plans of Turkey . Afrin is intended to be made the capital of terror in the place of Raqqa and other places . Afrin , however , belongs to us . Our population lives there . But many terrorist groups have moved to Afrin . For example , groups such as Ahrar-al-Sham and Faylaq-al-Sham were previously in Idlib but now some of them have moved to Afrin . To drive them out of Afrin , to fight them , is our duty . We certainly have to do something , but it is not clear yet how we will participate . To defend Afrin , we must certainly do something about Idlib . The Americans know who brought them there , which routes were used , and who supports them to this day . Certainly , those who have brought them there will try to continue to support and defend them . Therefore , it is not just a problem of Syria . I think it is up to all the forces fighting against terror ; the international coalition , the regime , us , Russia and America . The fact that so many terrorists are in Idlib is not only a threat to Syria , but to the entire Middle East and to the entire world . We have seen tensions between the Baath regime 's army and the Syrian Democratic Forces -LRB- SDF -RRB- in places like Tabqa , Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor . The regime tried to occupy certain places . But this is not the case . That 's the difference of us . Some places are liberated and after the liberation they are managed by the local population . They build their own civil and defense councils , we help them . The rest depends on the will of the local population . There are two commissions in the Council . A civilian and a military commission . The population and its commissions decide there , not us . This also applies to Tabqa , Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor . After liberation , the population decides itself . The regime would not allow that . It would not want to accept that everyone builds their own system and lives in their identity . Then the ISIS came and everything got worse anyway . But now we have freed these areas . The people of Tabqa , Raqqa and the other places are now making their own decisions . We want the people 's will to be respected I assume that nobody wants to live as a slave in Tabqa , Manbij , Deir ez-Zor or anywhere else , nobody accepts the dictatorship . We help them with that . We never wanted anyone to obey us . There , the Tabqa Council met with those responsible to put the dam back into operation . We definitively accept and respect that . The council there has decided and done so . It 's always like that . We expect the regime and everyone else to respect the will of the people . So far this has been the case in these areas . We support that . Everyone should express themselves freely and build the system they want . At the Sochi meetings it was made clear that none of you will be part of the commission for a new constitution of Syria . Without a representative of us , there can be no constitution of Syria . Yes , in Sochi it was like that : 50 people from both sides ; the opposition and the regime . Within the opposition , two Kurds are supposed to be and their right to decide , we know already , is in the hands of Istanbul or Turkey . But they know that it can not work without us . There are various deceptions , it is suggested that civil society organizations could take our seats . We say it openly , any constitution or law that we do not agree on with our own will and identity has no validity for us and its implementation is impossible . A decision in which we do not participate with our identity will not be binding us . For these discussions to lead to a real solution , the Constitution must be talked about jointly . If negotiations progress , there will certainly be a constitutional commission . There will be many commissions : politics , laws etc. every topic will be discussed for itself . Talking about Sochi , the dimension of Russia 's relationship to the regime is well known . That will be for sure . Anyone who thinks and wants to help the future of the Syrian population can take part . Russia is certainly in the picture . Well , they want to keep the regime on its feet and protect it . But if they think about all of Syria , then they have to develop a different perspective . They must think along with the Kurdish , Alevi , Druze and Sunni Arab populations . If they do that , then we will be happy . But imposing what the Baath Party wants on others is not possible . We hope that no one encumbers the political will . Our people have to believe in themselves . An organized population can do anything . They do not sell their will . We try to be worthy of the will of our people and will succeed .
