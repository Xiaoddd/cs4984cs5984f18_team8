The New Zealand parliament passed the bill recognising the Whanganui River , in North Island , as a living entity . Long revered by New Zealand 's Maori people , the river 's interests will now be represented by two people . The Maori had been fighting for over 160 years to get this recognition for their river , a minister said . The Whanganui River , New Zealand 's third-longest , will be represented by one member from the Maori tribes , known as iwi , and one from the Crown . The recognition allows it to be represented in court proceedings . Members of the Maori community celebrated the news with tears and music in New Zealand 's parliament . The settlement brought to an end the country 's longest-running litigation , the NZHerald reports . The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites .
