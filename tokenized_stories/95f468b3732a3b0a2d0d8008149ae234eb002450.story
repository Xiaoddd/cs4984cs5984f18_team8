Repealing it would result in significantly higher premiums , as some healthy people would elect to forego coverage until the moment it was needed . While the elder Murkowski was never able to make the drilling dream a reality , it is now within reach . On Wednesday , the Energy and Natural Resources Committee , which Murkowski chairs , passed a bill to allow drilling by a 13-10 vote , with Sen. Joe Manchin , D-W . Va. , voting in favor , alongside every Republican . That bill was in response to what are known as budget reconciliation instructions , a Senate maneuver that allows legislation to go through the full Senate with a bare majority and not be subject to a filibuster . The state has a permanent fund that is fueled by resource extraction , which cuts an annual check to state residents , so Alaskans are quite literally bought into the fossil fuel industry . The Intercept asked Murkowski on Wednesday whether she would be able to support a tax bill that included a repeal of the individual mandate , which would drive up insurance premiums and greatly increase the number of uninsured . Her answer , in pivoting immediately to ANWR , was instructive . Murkowski had been joined in opposition to health care repeal by Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , and Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , leaving the GOP just one vote short . Collins , for her part , said she has yet to decide how to vote on the broad package , but appeared to be leaning against it when talking to reporters Wednesday . But without Murkowski , it might not matter how Collins votes . Republican leaders may have other problems , however , as Sens. Bob Corker , R-Tenn. , and Jeff Flake , R-Ariz. , have made noises about opposing a tax bill that adds significantly to the deficit , while Sen. Ron Johnson , R-Wisc. , has problems with its manufacturing impacts . Top photo : Caribou at the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on June 18 , 2017 in Alaska .

In April 2017 , U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to expand drilling in the Arctic Ocean just four months after his predecessor Barack Obama banned , as a part of ` America First Energy Plan ' to reduce dependence on imported oil . In June Trump announced that the United States withdrew from the Paris agreement on climate change .
