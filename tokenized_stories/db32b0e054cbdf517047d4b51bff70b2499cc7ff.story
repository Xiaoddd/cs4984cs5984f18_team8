And if it does , water may become unaffordable for one-third of American households , according to a study , published recently in PLOS ONE , that maps the U.S. areas due to be hit hardest based on local incomes . When she first pitched the research idea to her colleagues , some scoffed . While water unaffordability is common overseas , Mack said , most assume Americans have the resources and the willingness to do whatever it takes to pay for water . But rising water prices are quickly eroding this line of reasoning , according to the investigation conducted by Mack and her colleague Sarah Wrase . Two years ago , a survey of 30 major U.S. cities found water bills rose by 41 percent between 2010 and 2015 . Mack took these reports and multiple others to expose how pocketbooks could be affected by escalating water prices on a national level . To do so , she peered into an American Water Works Association survey of water utilities across the U.S. in order to determine the annual water bill for an average consumer . The EPA also provides an estimate for how much Americans can afford to spend on water and wastewater services . The team examined median income data for individual areas in the U.S. to chart a map of the communities most at-risk for water poverty .

Image by Mack EA and Wrase S , 2017 , PLoS ONE The South , urban centers and low-income communities carry the most risk . For instance , 81 percent of high-risk and 63 percent of at-risk communities are concentrated in urban areas . Many of the at-risk areas also have higher rates of disability , food stamp usage , unemployment and black and Hispanic residents , according to the study . Washington , D.C. still runs water through wooden pipes from the mid-1800s . Most of the time , water pipes are installed by housing developers , said Theresa Connor of the One Water Solutions Institute at Colorado State University . But water utilities take over the costs of upkeep once they start serving a new neighborhood . Infrastructure replacement is the primary driver of the water price surge in America , Connor said . In Atlanta , which spends more on water than any other state , there was a regulatory initiative to prevent stormwater from discharging into wastewater . The move prevented raw sewage from mixing into the streams used for drinking water . But both Connor and Mattingly said those costs are small relative to the spending needed to address aging infrastructure . Urban flight is another factor in rising water prices . As populations decline in places like Detroit , water utilities are forced to spread their expenses across fewer people , which boosts rates . Meanwhile , cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas have low prices due to human growth . One tactic involves higher charges for those who use more water , rather than a flat fee for everyone . Billing rates can vary dramatically between water providers , even within a single city . In the future , Mack hopes to apply the same analysis on individual cities to offer more guidance on water affordability . As Flint , Michigan and other cities with water catastrophes have proven , the stakes for water infrastructure improvements are high . Delays can expose citizens to health hazards .
