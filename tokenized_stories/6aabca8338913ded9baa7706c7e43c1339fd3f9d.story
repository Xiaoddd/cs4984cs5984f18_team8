On November 20 , peaceful , praying water protectors were subjected to many of the above attacks . Over 300 were injured , many severely and one elder had a heart attack . A young woman had her arm shattered and still may lose it to amputation . He was apparently having a great time cavorting across Europe . But , now incredibly the response from the Obama administration via a statement from the Corps of Engineers is that the Water Protector camps will be closed to the public as of Dec. 5th , and those who remain will face citations . Throughout this struggle and the heroism of the valiant Water Protectors , this so-called president has obstinately refused to stand up to Big Oil . The nation is in an uproar as demonstrations were held across the country , on November 15 , in support of the beleaguered Standing Rock people and their allies . Obama ignored the will of the American people and remained mute . As I stated in an earlier column , if Obama does not defend the republic , the Constitution and the law of the land , including Native American treaties , this sets a very dangerous precedent . This is particularly true in light of the incoming presidency of Donald Trump and also in light of the fascist tactics of North Dakota law enforcement . So far , he has not even had the moral courage to make a personal statement since the war crimes and atrocities at Backwater Bridge on November 20 . There should be an encampment set up that will be ready to engage in civil disobedience until Obama acts on behalf of the people of this land , and not the money hungry , fascist jackals that he is now serving .
