Organizers of the protest against the Dakota Access pipeline hold a news briefing near Cannon Ball , N.D. . They say they have a right to remain on land where they have camped for months . On an unseasonably warm Saturday , people were chopping wood and setting up tents at the encampment , which is more than a mile from a Missouri River reservoir where the final large segment of the pipeline is yet to be completed because of the corps consulting with the tribe . Authorities had set up a staging area about a mile away on a hill overlooking the site . President Obama raised the possibility of rerouting the pipeline in the area this month , something Kelcy Warren , CEO of Texas pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners , said is not an option .
