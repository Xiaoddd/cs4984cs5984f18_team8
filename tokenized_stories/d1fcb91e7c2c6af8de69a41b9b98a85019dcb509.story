regarding the true nature of the troglodyte now soiling the Oval Office , the timing of their comments nullifies much of what they say . Both have used the occasion of their impending retirements from the Senate to say what brave men and women should say as a requirement of public service , not as they leave it . Flake and Corker were in positions to do something about the Trump problem . Now that they have chosen to leave office , Flake and Corker are just another couple of homeless cranks wandering the Capitol , cajoling their fellow senators to speak out and to govern . Both Flake and Corker were preceded in the Senate by Republicans from their respective states who , in earlier presidential crises , demonstrated immense personal bravery , principle and patriotism . The sickness is within the party , not just the White House . On and on and on and on . They must be stopped . Persons of conscience must act now . Listen to these two cranks . Flawed as Flake and Corker are , we can hope that they will use their next 15 months in office to continually speak out against Trump and the fanatics who created him . Flake and Corker must use whatever power they have left to renounce radical Republicanism and to remove Trump from office and put him away . That is the only way Flake and Corker can redeem themselves . And the nation . All rights reserved .
