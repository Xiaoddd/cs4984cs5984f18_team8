Energy and Environment U.S. scientists officially declare 2016 the hottest year on record . That makes three in a row . By Chris Mooney Chris Mooney Reporter covering climate change , energy and the environment . Email Bio Follow January 18 , 2017 -LRB- NOAA -RRB- This story has been updated . The agency also noted that the record for the global temperature has now successively been broken five times since the year 2000 . degrees Fahrenheit higher than the prior record year of 2015 . The last five years have been the hottest on record , according to scientists from the World Meteorological Organization , the United Nations weather agency . Scientists have been far less guarded . NASA and NOAA produce slightly different records using somewhat different methodologies , but have now concurred on identifying 2014 , 2015 and 2016 as , successively , the three warmest years in their records . There was a noticeable difference this year , however , in how much two agencies judged 2016 to have surpassed 2015 . World temperatures hit a record high for the third year in a row in 2016 , creeping closer to a ceiling set for global warming , U.S. scientists said on Wednesday . At present , that means that while scientists would expect 2017 to be quite warm , relative to , say , a year in the 1990s , there has been little talk of a fourth record year in a row . degrees Celsius above the temperature average between 1961 and 1990 , 2015 was very close at .76 degrees Celsius higher . The difference between the Hadley Center and NASA once again comes down to the treatment of the Arctic , Schmidt explained . NASA further noted in its analysis that compared with the late 19th century , the planet has now warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius , or 2 degrees Fahrenheit . degrees away , in Celsius , based on these figures . Among major 2016 events , the devastating bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef did not stand alone . In a catalogue of some of the extremes the planet witnessed during the year , NOAA also noted the megafire that engulfed Fort McMurray , in Alberta , Canada , at the beginning of May , relatively early in the year for wildfires . F -RRB- was recorded in Delhoran on July 22 . For the contiguous United States , 2o16 was merely the second-warmest year on record , but for Alaska , it was the warmest yet recorded , underscoring once again the sharpness of Arctic warmth , in particular . All of that said , because of the extreme warmth that occurred early in 2016 , the record just announced does not come as much of a surprise to weather and climate watchers .
