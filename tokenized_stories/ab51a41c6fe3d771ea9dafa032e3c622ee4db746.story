Sen. John Hoeven , R-N.D. , said Tuesday , Jan. 31 , 2017 , that the Acting Secretary of the Army has directed the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with an easement necessary to complete the pipeline . Thousands of veterans were present , having traveled to North Dakota for the weekend in a large show of support for the Standing Rock Sioux and other Native American tribes . But Hilton , 61 , celebrated with hesitancy that night , as did nearly everyone else at the campsite . Acting Secretary of the Army Robert Speer announced to Congress that the Army intended to grant the final permit . Diggs and a small number of other veterans returned to protest camps in North Dakota this week to make plans for more of their group to arrive . Protest leaders have asked the veterans to help with tasks around the camp , including building new shelters . The veterans will remain nonviolent , Diggs said . Hilton and many other veterans who traveled to North Dakota in December are on standby , preparing for the call to return to protest . While building a shelter at a Standing Rock camp in December , Hilton explained the water crisis that he experienced was part of his motivation to travel the 1,200 miles to stand with others who feared for their water supply . Energy Transfer Partners has been waiting to complete the final piece of the 1,172-mile , multibillion-dollar pipeline , which , if complete , would route approximately 450,000 barrels of crude oil each day through North Dakota to pipeline networks in Illinois . The last 1,100 feet of the pipeline route would stretch under Lake Oahe , a reservoir on the Missouri River about a half-mile from the Standing Rock reservation . Opponents of the pipeline say the construction infringes on sacred grounds and , if ruptured , that oil would contaminate drinking water . Energy Transfer Partners has maintained the pipeline is safe . Hilton has the help of Sean Mercer , a nonveteran protester . Hilton said the drinking water crisis in Flint motivated him to help the Sioux tribe protect Lake Oahe . All Rights Reserved .
