Please . We are protecting the water for our children and yours . Send one out here to negotiate . Cars were searched and impounded , personal possessions were taken by police . Lost in that day , in the horrific stories of degradation , is a small story of victory . Everyone by now has seen the videos of the assault last Thursday . But lost in that day , in the horrific stories of degradation , is a small story of victory , of how 40 to 50 Native people stood against more than 250 police on a bridge on County Road 134 in rural North Dakota . Word-of-mouth announcements went out to the Oceti Sakowin camp that there was going to be a police raid of the front-line camp that had been set up in the way of the pipeline . A raid means people are in imminent danger , and that is widely understood here . Over Labor Day , campers were attacked by dogs and pepper sprayed by Dakota Access security . My original plan was to take County Road 134 to photograph the pipeline being forced into the earth . History rarely teaches us about when Natives win against the state . Instead , I found a blockade of wood logs and hay bales set up in an area where water divided the back country road . No one there was armed with anything other than prayer . If they were stopped at this bridge from the east , they could only come from the north . In the morning , police did come , and from both sides . People began dancing to a hand drum , entranced by the power of prayer . Please . We are protecting the water for our children and yours . Send one out here to negotiate . He was met with no negotiation . But the water protectors held the bridge . For hours and hours , police advanced and retreated . This was an unforgettable moment unfolding . With the dancing going on and the veteran trying to negotiate out front , a young woman stepped up and began moving her body to the beat of the drum . She was power incarnate . Her arms were wide open , her pink fingernail polish glistening . She was crying . The untold story of this day was that those troops never made it from the east to join the others in raiding the camp , dehumanizing the friends and families of those on that bridge . History rarely teaches us about when Natives win against the state . On October 27 , when a colonial force armed with military weapons faced off on a bridge against veterans armed with only prayer , the Natives won . No Paywall . No Ads . Just Readers Like You .
