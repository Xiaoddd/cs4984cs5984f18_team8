No Pay . They came on snowmobiles , in bulldozers and in the vehicles of war : Humvees , BearCats and an armored vehicle built to withstand explosions in Iraq . They were searching for the last resisters . At its peak , as late as December , the camps near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation were inhabited by up to 10,000 self-proclaimed water protectors . Then came brutal blizzards , minus-18-degree nights , floods looming with the spring thaw and a temporary government reprieve ripped to shreds by a new president . Police clad in riot gear surrounded tents and teepees , evoking images of the United States Cavalry as they poked their weapons through teepee flaps . Law enforcement and company helicopters thundered overhead . This militaristic presence in the Northern Plains was made possible by the taxpayers of North Dakota . The rest of us have picked up the tab for additional forces , many of whom showed up recently as backup : the Border Patrol , National Park Service rangers , Bureau of Indian Affairs police . Few North Dakota officials have criticized this use of public funds . But camp medics report that over the last 10 months , they have treated at least 1,000 people for chemical poisoning , hypothermia , rubber-bullet and beanbag wounds , and other more serious injuries , all at the hands of police . Some 750 people were arrested . Now the state faces a civil rights lawsuit and a United Nations fact-finding mission , both of which center in part on one bitter-cold November night on the Backwater Bridge . Montalvo was one of hundreds of unarmed water protectors facing down North Dakota police at the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on Nov. 20 . The clashes began after protesters attempted to clear the bridge of two burned-out trucks that had been blocking the highway since mass arrests three weeks earlier . That night , Montalvo looked up through white mists of tear gas , pierced by screams and shouts on the bridge . Native elders stood in front of barricades of razor wire , clutching feathers , burning prayer bundles of sage , holding their ground . To ward off clouds of pepper spray , some shut their eyes tightly , while others held up plywood shields or the tops of plastic bins . Others say the order to disband never came . All agree that police soon unleashed a fire hose , soaking protesters in the subfreezing temperatures . Icicles formed in their hair . Their winter coats crunched . Montalvo moved swiftly toward the front line , carrying bottles of water and Milk of Magnesia to relieve the tear gas sting . Police in riot gear began firing rubber bullets . A tribal elder fell , his staff clattering to the pavement of the shutdown state highway . Then police launched a barrage of smoking tear gas canisters from grenade launchers . A tear gas canister hit Montalvo squarely in the chest . He inhaled its smoke deeply , then wandered aimlessly , hands over his eyes . Two minutes later , he could see again . Another device exploded at his feet . He saw a brilliant white light . Then everything went black and silent . Montalvo began shaking uncontrollably . Medics whisked him off the bridge . Others fared worse that night . Sophia Wilansky , 21 , nearly had her arm blown off . Vanessa Dundon , a 32-year-old Navajo , was hit in the face with a tear gas canister . The impact badly damaged her retina , requiring three surgeries to try to regain sight in her right eye . Days later , Montalvo said he still could taste the tear gas in his mouth . On Dec. 4 , just after thousands of veterans arrived to stand with Standing Rock , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied an easement for the pipeline to cross under the Missouri River while it undertook an environmental impact statement . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe declared victory . Celebrations erupted in the camps . A lot of people went home . Two months later , on the orders of President Donald Trump , the corps reversed itself , announcing final approval of the pipeline project . Construction crews resumed work almost immediately , despite vows by the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes to stop the pipeline in court to prevent contamination of the Missouri , a source of water for the Sioux people and at least 10 million others downstream . But by then , the collective population of the three protest camps had fallen into the hundreds , not nearly enough to disrupt construction crews and the police lines protecting them . As the Feb. 22 deadline to evacuate the camp drew near , police , military and private security vehicles moved into formation , poised on the ridges nearby . Witnesses to the Backwater Bridge confrontation and others like it describe being shot in the face and head or pelted by munitions . Dakwar recently traveled to Standing Rock to facilitate testimonies for the U.N. Working Group on business and human rights , which will prepare a report for the U.N. General Assembly . In many cases , however , police in riot gear , holding plastic shields , have been protected behind concrete barriers and layers of concertina wire . In some cases , protesters have thrown logs or sticks at officers or tossed tear gas canisters back across police lines . Police accused one woman of discharging a weapon at a demonstration ; her case is pending . Protesters have chained themselves to construction equipment and have been charged with burning equipment . Protesters say they have acted in response to what they believed was infiltration of their movement . Police also claim that protesters have thrown bags of feces at officers , which protesters vehemently deny . Previous police claims that protesters wielded pipe bombs or bows and arrows later were recanted by a North Dakota sheriff during a confrontation recorded in late October . The response from North Dakota lawmakers has been to get tough . Gov. Doug Burgum recently signed a law making it a crime to wear a mask during demonstrations . Other bills awaiting his signature would sharply increase fines and prison time for riot offenses , the label authorities have given the pipeline protests . Linda Black Elk , a member of the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council and a professor at Sitting Bull College on the reservation , is incredulous . Hovland is described as fair-minded by lawyers who have worked in his court . But he has a reputation for standing firmly with the interests of the state . He allowed police and state employees to redact their names from sworn statements about Standing Rock , fueling the narrative of law enforcement under siege . The case will continue in federal court , likely for at least another year . A former Baltimore police commissioner called the police actions excessive , citing an unnecessary use of force . As the world watched via live stream last week , the restraint Frazier called for seemed to be on display . Police did not use tear gas , rubber bullets , beanbag rounds or sound cannons to expel the protesters this time . Nor did they use water hoses to douse them as they had Nov. 20 , when temperatures dropped to 22 degrees . Journalist Jenni Monet , on assignment for Indian Country Today and Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting , was arrested Feb. 1 while covering a police sweep of a rogue protest camp near Standing Rock . She was charged with criminal trespass and engaging in a riot . Jack Dalrymple declared a state of emergency . North Dakota officials overwhelmingly approved the request and subsequent amendments . One of those was the first bill new Gov. Doug Burgum signed in January . Tim Mathern was the lone dissenter in a recent Senate committee vote to authorize the bank line of credit . Mathern wanted to know more about what the state was paying for , so he traveled to Standing Rock on Jan. 27 to visit the police line just north of there . Police would not allow Mathern to cross their roadblock and head south toward the protest camp near Standing Rock . So Mathern drove across gravel roads , arriving at the main Oceti Sakowin camp , where he met with activists . It was bigger than all but nine cities in North Dakota . By the afternoon of Feb. 23 , when the last protester was expelled , few remnants of the village remained : bent rods on which flags of 300 tribal nations had flown , mounds of abandoned clothes , a whiteboard with guidelines for nonviolent direct action . By then , a frigid wind blew through camp , with no one around to notice it . Do n't miss the next big story . Brave investigations that change minds , laws and lives . Emailed directly to you .
