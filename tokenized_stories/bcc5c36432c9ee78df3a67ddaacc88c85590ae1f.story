Block Kavanaugh 's nomination . By Steve Horn and Itai Vardi Believe it or not , there 's a key connection to Russia and its president , Vladimir Putin , in the fight over North America 's controversial Keystone XL pipeline . Owned by TransCanada , this tar sands oil pipeline was halted by former President Barack Obama in November 2015 . In fact , a DeSmog investigation reveals that much of the steel for Keystone XL has already been manufactured and is sitting in a field in rural North Dakota . DeSmog has uncovered that 40 percent of the steel created so far was manufactured in Canada by a subsidiary of Evraz , a company 31-percent owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich , who is a close ally of Putin and a Trump family friend . DeSmog 's findings comes as Trump is under scrutiny from Congress , U.S. intelligence agencies , and others for his personal and presidential campaign team 's ties to Russia . The Office of the Director of National Intelligence concluded in January that Russian state-sponsored actors had hacked into the email databases of both the Democratic National Committee and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton 's campaign in order to influence the election in favor of Trump .
