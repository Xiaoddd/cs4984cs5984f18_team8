They 're about clean water , police brutality , treaty rights and the rights of future generations . URGENT . My friends in Standing Rock just sent this to me & asked me to share it . They are surrounded by militarized police RIGHT NOW . Monthslong demonstrations at Standing Rock are scheduled to end Wednesday ; the United States Army Corps of Engineers and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have issued an evacuation order for the morning of Feb. 22 , according to the official website for the Oceti Sakowin camp . Peaceful protesters gathered there seemed to score a victory in early December , when the Army Corps of Engineers denied a permit that would have allowed construction of the Dakota Access pipeline to continue along its previously planned route , under Lake Oahe . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe opposed the pipeline on the grounds that it threatened ancient tribal lands and could pollute a crucial water source , the Missouri River . Fireworks over Oceti Sakowin on Dec. 4 , 2016 as demonstrators celebrate the decision to effectively halt construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline . Many Standing Rock demonstrators , meanwhile , were skeptical of the decision to halt the project and decided to stay , even as blizzards battered Oceti Sakowin camp .
