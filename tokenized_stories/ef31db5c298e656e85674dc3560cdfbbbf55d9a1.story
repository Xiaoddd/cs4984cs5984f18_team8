It was the second major oil pipeline spill in the Yellowstone River in four years . During the abbreviated cleanup , a total of 1,200 gallons of oil was allegedly recovered from the river . At the peak of the cleanup effort , a spokesman for the company that operates the Poplar Pipeline said that oil was being recovered at the rate of one teaspoon every ten minutes . At that pace , it would have taken 1,753 years to remove all the oil from the river . Federal regulations require that pipelines be buried only four feet underneath rivers despite evidence that large rivers like the Yellowstone can scour 40 feet deep during floods and ice jams . January 24 , 2015 Nearly a week has passed since an oil pipeline ruptured underneath the bed of the Yellowstone River in eastern Montana , contaminating drinking water supplies for the 6,000 residents of Glendive , sickening several people , and taking an unknown toll on fish and wildlife . Oil recovery efforts have been hampered due to the fact that the Yellowstone River in the vicinity of the spill is locked under two feet of ice . Meanwhile , an oily sheen has been spotted as far down river as Williston , North Dakota . The city is expected to lift its bottled water order this weekend . Bridger Pipeline LLC has a long history of pipeline safety violations . According to the Pipeline Safety Trust , the company has double the average number of pipeline safety incidents per mile of pipeline over the past six years . It is unknown at this point whether the section of pipeline that ruptured under the Yellowstone River was of this variety . The last time this pipeline was inspected was in 2012 . Meanwhile , as this oil spill tragedy continues to unfold , the U.S. Senate is debating a bill to approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline , which would cross the Yellowstone River approximately 20 miles upstream of the spill site . On the other side of the capitol , the U.S. House passed legislation on Wednesday that would expedite the approval of new natural gas pipelines , giving government regulators less time to evaluate their potential environmental impacts . Tell the Obama Administration to protect our rivers by strengthening the environmental standards for these pipelines . And you can look our website about powerful love spells .
