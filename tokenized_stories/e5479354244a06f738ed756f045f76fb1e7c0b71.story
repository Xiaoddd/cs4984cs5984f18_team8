Outgoing Chairman Darrin Old Coyote sent a letter to federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement Director Joe Pizarchik requesting talks similar to administration communications with opponents of the Dakota Access oil pipeline . The Crow Tribe has allied itself with mining companies in pushing coal export terminals and now is questioning the OSMRE rule . Inadequate consultation is a frequent concern for American Indian tribes nationwide . In the letter , Old Coyote said the tribe did not have enough time to review the vast amount of materials associated with the stream rule but concurred with critical comments submitted by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and coal companies in the state . Old Coyote is concerned the new regulations could reduce or halt production at the Absaloka mine operated by Westmoreland Resources Inc. . Westmoreland recently threatened to shut down the mine , prompting the tribal council to scale back severance taxes and other revenue , steps that prompted a backlash from tribal members . With his term ending in January , Old Coyote said Chairman-elect Alvin Not Afraid Jr. agreed consultation should not begin until then .
