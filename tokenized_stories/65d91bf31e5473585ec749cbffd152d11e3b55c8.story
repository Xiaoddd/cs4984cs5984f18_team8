You can not be a party which on one hand says we 're in favor of working people , we 're in favor of the needs of young people but we do n't quite have the courage to take on Wall Street and the billionaire class . People do not believe that . You 've got to decide which side you 're on . We need a Democratic National Committee led by a progressive who understands the dire need to listen to working families , not the political establishment or the billionaire class . We 'll deliver your signature to members of the DNC to send a strong message about why Keith should be DNC Chair . Our Revolution is a 501 -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 4 -RRB- organization .
