Block Kavanaugh 's nomination . Join 2,596,706 signers . We launched this billboard in Times Square for a simple reason : The American people , Congress , and President Trump himself need to see the nationwide strength of our movement . So we 're making a splash that millions of people will see -- and we hope you 'll share it far and wide , so folks who are n't walking around Times Square can see it , too . Donald Trump continues to taunt rogue nuclear powers , attempt to cut taxes for wealthy corporations , and undermine our nation 's healthcare system . He 's a clear and present danger to the United States . Enough is enough . Americans across the country are declaring that this president is unfit for office and must be removed . We need to speak up together and demand an end to his presidency .
