DAKOTA ACCESS Government , tribe slam company 's ` legal fallacy ' Ellen M. Gilmer , E&E News reporter Published : Monday , January 9 , 2017 Dakota Access litigation lit up again last week as the Obama administration and Standing Rock Sioux Tribe tried to block legal maneuvering by the pipeline company . Lawyers for the Army Corps of Engineers on Friday urged a federal court in Washington to reject a request from Dakota Access LLC to resolve the case in its favor . The pipeline , which could transport 570,000 barrels of oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois , was held up for months last year while thousands of tribal and environmental advocates protested against it . The Obama administration ultimately decided against granting the final approval needed for the oil line to cross a section of the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota -LRB- Energywire , Dec. 5 , 2016 -RRB- . A win for the company would be monumental , allowing the pipeline to cross the river right away . But many experts have said it 's a long shot -LRB- Energywire , Dec. 6 , 2016 -RRB- . The company 's request put both the administration and the tribe on defense . In a brief Friday , government lawyers slammed Dakota Access ' theory , arguing that no-impact findings earlier this year dealt only with pipeline approvals under the Clean Water Act and Rivers and Harbors Act . The easement needed to cross Army Corps-managed property is a separate consideration governed by the Mineral Leasing Act . The Standing Rock Sioux and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe , which is also a party to the litigation , urged Obama appointee Judge James Boasberg to toss the company 's request .
