A robust press is critical to democracy and good government . It 's why I 'm dedicated to reading it daily and helping to support the cost . The Last Wild Place The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands is one of the most remote places on Earth . Faith Betrayed Guam 's predominantly Catholic community has been torn apart by decades of allegations of sexual abuse by beloved priests . We examine the causes of visitor deaths . Saving Coral Cutting-edge research in Hawaii aims to counter climate change . Joeseph and Michael Arnoux dragged heavy-duty tarps on a sled through the icy mud and snow so that they could use it as insulation inside one of their teepees that sat alongside the Cannonball River less than half a mile from the bridge where police used a water cannon to hose down demonstrators in below-freezing temperatures . They said they have no intention of leaving . In fact , they expect to live on the land until spring . Tribal elder Troy Fairbanks hugs a Standing Rock supporter after learning that the Dakota Access Pipeline route through Sioux country had been blocked . Despite that , the mood of many was cautious . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced it would halt the project , which is nearly completed , so that alternative routes could be studied as part of an environmental impact statement . President-elect Donald Trump adds another wrinkle . He supports the project as is , and has the ability to influence its fate once he takes office . So too did the fact that many people had been arrested or injured during clashes with police . Some of those wounds are still healing and many cases have yet to be heard . Veterans rallied in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux . Tribal leaders quickly moved to shoo demonstrators from the bridge . Security was tightened at the camps to keep others from heading toward the police barricades , all in an attempt to diffuse any tension . One of them , Troy Fairbanks was moved to tears as he addressed the growing crowd , recounting how many Native Americans risked their personal safety to have their voices heard protesting the pipeline . He also tried to dispel any notion that demonstrators had become violent with police during past confrontations . We fought with one thing , the most important . Gabbard is a major in the U.S. Army National Guard . Gabbard met with Archambault on Saturday after her arrival in North Dakota and again Sunday at the Oceti Sakowin Camp where protesters have congregated . Ernest Aleita from Crownpoint , New Mexico , speaks to Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard , left , during a veterans rally to support the Standing Rock Sioux . As a former Marine , he had planned to take part in the numerous events Veterans for Standing Rock had organized to support the Sioux and oppose the pipeline . Those plans fell through rather quickly for Turalde , who now plans to return home in time for finals next week at the University of Hawaii , where he is a student . The barricades are still up . The people are still there . The drill pad is still there . But everyone here is excited . Originally from the Big Island , he was one of the Native Hawaiian protesters who camped on Mauna Kea to oppose plans for the Thirty Meter Telescope . He said numerous Native Americans and other indigenous people from other parts of the world , particularly New Zealand and other Pacific Island nations , had come to support the protests on Mauna Kea . And like Mauna Kea , he believes that Standing Rock will be inspirational for others across the country , particularly among indigenous cultures . Several protesters from Hawaii have been living in this teepee , including Turalde since his arrival . Sign Up Sorry . That 's an invalid e-mail . We 'll send you a confirmation e-mail shortly .
