The dismissed cases all stem from an October 22 , 2016 mass arrest of over 120 Water Protectors , some of whom were rounded up by police while sitting and praying . 116 of the 120 individuals were arrested and charged with the same crimes : Criminal Trespass and Engaging in a Riot . In an attempt to extract guilty pleas , the State is waiting to dismiss each case until the last minute before trial , which has created great hardship and uncertainty for many Water Protectors , particularly those living out-of-state who have to book travel to any appearances . Although the dismissal is a reprieve , it does not mean the cases are over . WPLC staff attorneys Sandra Freeman , Sam Saylor and Andrea Carter , many WPLC Pro Hac Vice attorneys , and local North Dakota counsel are working together to determine how to best defend the next round of cases . These ten dismissals follow dismissals of five other Water Protector cases from the first week of May that also arose from the October 22 , 2016 mass arrest date . So far , no cases from that mass arrest have been brought to trial . Nevertheless , over 80 other cases from the October 22 date remain open and are set for trial in May and June .
