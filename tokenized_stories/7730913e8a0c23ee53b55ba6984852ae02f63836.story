But scientists and engineers around the world keep innovating , looking for ways to make solar panels more efficient and less expensive . Much of this innovation is now coming from China , the world leader in both manufacturing and deployment of solar energy . That can enable a 10 percent boost in output , especially if you put the panels on a roof or other area that is painted white to help reflect the suns rays . Bloomberg New Energy Finance projects these panels could capture a remarkable 40 percent share of the market by 2025 . In this case , the solar cells harvest power from the movement of raindrops that fall on them . Since solar panels typically generate only one tenth of their potential output during rain , and virtually nothing at night-time , the advance could address one of the biggest problems facing solar power : its variability .

The recent Chinese breakthrough was to figure out how to make it work in a simple and efficient manner for a solar cell . It could be a while before the technology makes its way into a commercial product for widespread use , though . We are still 3 to 5 years from a prototype according to Sun . But if the technology takes off , we may actually have solar panels that work rain or shine .
