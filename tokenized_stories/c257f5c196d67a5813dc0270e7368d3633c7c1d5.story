It is no longer accepting RSVPs . There has been a call for solidarity actions , which Climate Convergence is responding to by organizing an Emergency IntersAction at Georgia and Howe in downtown Vancouver . This is a very visible intersection where the main Vancouver branch of the TD Bank is located - one of the major investors in the Dakota Access pipeline . We ask everyone to join us in standing in solidarity with indigenous nations asserting their right to self-determination and defending everyone from these unnecessary and dangerous projects which are literally destroying the planet . It 's an action where we flood an intersection on all sides with people crossing -LRB- on the light -RRB- with signs and banners without stopping the flow of traffic . This way we can be seen by and engage with the most people . We encourage responsible activism , and do not support using the platform to take unlawful or other improper action . We do not control or endorse the conduct of users and make no representations of any kind about them . This website uses cookies for personalisation .
