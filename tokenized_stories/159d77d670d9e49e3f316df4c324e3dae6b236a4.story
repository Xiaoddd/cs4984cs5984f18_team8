They 've come from Japan , Russia and Germany . Australia , Israel and Serbia . And , of course , there are the allies , not exclusively Native American or indigenous , who 've flocked here from all corners of the US . They 're fighting against what they see as corporate greed , an environmental threat and an assault on sacred land . Demonstrating is their proud daily work . The Standing Rock Sioux call this reservation home , and many are not on the frontlines of this months-long , and at times violent , protest . Read More The answer to that last question : Not even close . Wishing they 'd go home No one makes this clearer than Robert Fool Bear Sr. , 54 , district chairman of Cannon Ball . The town he runs , estimated population of 840 , is just a few miles from the action . It 's so close that , given the faceoffs with law enforcement , you have to pass through a police checkpoint to reach it . It 's about time people heard from folks like him , he says . Fool Bear has had it with the protesters . He says that more than two years ago , when members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe could have attended hearings to make their concerns known , they did n't care . Now , suddenly , the crowds are out of control , and he fears it 's just a matter of time before someone gets seriously hurt . Go down to the camps , he says , and you wo n't see many Standing Rock Sioux . The presence of all these people has become a downright nuisance to his community , he says . Given the roadblocks , residents of Cannon Ball are often forced to go more than 40 miles out of their way . Native Americans march to the site of a sacred burial ground that was disturbed by bulldozers building the Dakota Access Pipeline on September 4 , 2016 near Cannon Ball , North Dakota . Not long ago , he found three teenage girls from Ontario , Canada , camped out inside his storage shed . A white woman from Spokane , Washington , came to see him for help , saying she 'd come here with nothing and her car had broken down . When he was at the casino recently , someone approached him about two young kids who were on their own because their parents had been arrested . The situation has dissolved to madness , he says , and he wishes Dave Archambault II , the Standing Rock Sioux chairman , would speak up . And he 's not alone in feeling this way . Two women who listen in as he talks keep nodding in agreement , but they do n't want to speak . Just look at a recent vote in the community for further proof that Fool Bear 's not the only naysayer . When protest organizers presented a request to build a new winter camp in Cannon Ball earlier this month , his community shot it down . Of the 88 people who voted , he says 66 were against the camp , less than 10 were for it and the rest remained undecided . A Standing Rock Sioux flag flies over a protest encampment near Cannon Ball , North Dakota . Even though Fool Bear is against the protests , that does n't mean he 's not preparing to help people out , too . He anticipates opening the community gymnasium for people without beds come winter , and a growing pile of sleeping bags and blankets sits in his office . Those protesters from Arizona , Georgia and California wo n't know what hit them when the cold rushes in , he says .

A fight worth having The tribal headquarters sits in the Sioux County seat of Fort Yates , nearly 30 miles south of the protests . To hear it from those hanging out in Club Diamond Z , a bar and deli , Standing Rock Sioux support of the protests is universal . They ca n't fathom how anyone would disagree . Artist Roger Valandra , 61 , says he travels north to join the protests once a week . A proud Vietnam Vet , he says the freedom to peacefully demonstrate was something he fought for , just like his nieces and nephews who 've served in Iraq . To feel suppressed by the nation he 's served offends him . He 's baffled by the flood of law enforcement from nearby states and North Dakota counties he 's never even heard of . Any violence , he says , was provoked by them . Valandra and those around him at the bar begin to rattle off the offenses , many of which they heard about through social media . They talk about tear gas , rubber bullets , sound cannons and concussion grenades . They speak about the elder who was beaten with a club , the horse that had to be put down , the boy whose wrist was broken . She grew up believing racism did n't exist ; not anymore . She brings up the recent acquittal of Ammon Bundy and six others , who occupied a federal wildlife refuge earlier this year . She pulls up a Facebook post , showing a photo of a number scrawled on a man 's arm after he was arrested Thursday and words likening the treatment to what Nazis once did . Online comments and the stereotyping of her people leave her stunned . She wants people to know this battle is n't about race . Her father does n't question what will happen to the reservation 's water if the pipeline goes in . Just look at the track record of oil companies , he says , and understand that the problem will grow . Dismissing the pinnedPlayer if another video players plays a video . Police remove pipeline protesters 01:20 A shrug of indifference Ten miles west of the protests , a man who does n't want to be named , for fear of retribution , admits he looks forward to the pipeline . It 'll mean fewer trucks barreling down these rural highways and fewer trains flying down the tracks . Back at Cannon Ball , however , Carl Bruce , 52 , is n't afraid to say his piece . For this Standing Rock Sioux who has lived his life here , the pipeline does n't matter . If it breaks , he says he 'd just work around it . The pipeline is coming , like it or not , he says . The world may watch this ongoing battle and believe it 's a unifying force for his people , but Bruce just shrugs his shoulders and walks away . Turner Broadcasting System , Inc. .
