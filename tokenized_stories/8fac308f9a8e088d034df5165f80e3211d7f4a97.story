Photo by Ernest Swanson SHARE TWEET A Haida clan in British Columbia has stripped two hereditary chiefs of their titles because they supported the construction of an Enbridge pipeline that the Nation fought in court . The two chiefs signed a letter in support of the pipeline , and one of the chiefs told VICE News he met with the company and received per diems , but he believes the issue is being blown out of proportion . On Saturday , in front of 500 people , clan members in Old Massett held a ceremony marked with traditional dances in which the hereditary chiefs were stripped of their leadership , and matriarchs appointed new chiefs in their place . A ceremony like this one has n't happened since smallpox struck Haida Gwaii , an archipelago along the coast of northern BC , in the 1800s . Tensions ran high at the potlatch when a group of five clan members crashed the ceremony in opposition , according to clan spokesperson Ernest Swanson . But three RCMP officers guarded the doors , and a group of matriarchs stood between the potlatch crashers and ceremony organizer Chief Darin Swanson to protect him . The two former chiefs who were stripped of their leadership , Carmen Goertzen of the Yahgu 7laanas Dadens Clan and Francis Ingram of the iits ` aaw Yahgu ` laanaas and jaanas Clan , did n't attend the potlatch , saying they were n't invited . As the heads of their clans , hereditary chiefs are appointed by family matriarchs and are expected to demonstrate and uphold the morals of their families , including peacefulness and modesty . But in this case , because they went against the wishes of their families , their actions are being taken as a betrayal , according to Ernest Swanson , Darin Swanson 's nephew . Ernest Swanson said their leadership was revoked because they received money from Enbridge and signed a letter in support of the company 's Northern Gateway pipeline , which the Haida Nation has long opposed because , among other reasons , the influx of tanker traffic would increase the risk of oil spills . A letter the two hereditary chiefs signed asking for an extension for Enbridge 's Northern Gateway pipeline . The Haida Nation celebrated a victory in late June when a court overturned the pipeline 's approval , finding the federal government failed to fully consult seven First Nations that would be directly affected if the project went through . The NEB did n't grant the extension , and Enbridge has no permit to build the pipeline . Over the phone on Friday , Ingram denied that he ever asked for an extension for Enbridge , although VICE News pointed out that his signature appears on the letter . Ingram also denied receiving any money from Enbridge . However , Goertzen said Enbridge had paid the chiefs per diems in exchange for meeting with Enbridge . He said he has n't brought any disrespect to his clan . Ingram , who is 73 and was a crab fisherman for much of his life until he retired , echoed this sentiment . Now , Haida fishermen are only hauling in 1,000 crabs a week when they used to get 2,000 in one day , he explained . According to Ingram , it 's a similar story for the logging industry . That 's tanking the economic opportunities for Haida members , especially in Old Massett , where Saturday 's potlatch happened , he said . The clan conflict is also taking place as the Haida Nation tries to rebuild its traditions that were lost when Canada 's residential schools stripped the First Nation and others across the country of their traditions . The stripping of the chiefs ' authority is meant to reassert those traditions , Swanson explained . We 're still very much trying to create that cultural continuity that we 're missing . We 're rebuilding right now . Follow Hilary Beaumont on Twitter .
