The nine-member council unanimously approved an ordinance to end its nearly two-decade relationship with its primary financial services provider , Wells Fargo , which is an investor in the pipeline and the company building it , Energy Transfer Partners of Texas . The tribe , which says the pipeline threatens its water supply and sacred sites , said Tuesday it would continue to fight the project 's completion . The area also has a large Native American community that has actively opposed the pipeline , and one member of the council , Debora Juarez , is an enrolled member of the Blackfeet Nation tribe in Montana . Another council member , Kshama Sawant , is a socialist . Seattle City Councilwoman Kshama Sawant , left , as fellow Councilwoman Debora Juarez , right , is embraced by Rachel Heaton , a Muckleshoot tribal member , before Wednesday 's council meeting .
