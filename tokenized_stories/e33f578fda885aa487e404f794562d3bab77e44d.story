Mandan , ND - On Friday December 2nd at approximately 2 pm CST Water Protectors from Oceti Sakowin camp will fulfill a donation list that the Morton County Sheriff 's Department released on November 22 , 2016 . Water Protectors offer these donations to the Morton County officers in generosity and compassion , despite the aggression and hostility they have shown innocent unarmed Protectors of this camp . Despite this excessive financial support , Morton County officers are asking taxpayers to donate supplies . The Oceti Sakowin camp is a prayer camp , and a resilient , self-sufficient community . The camp is full of abundance -- in spirit , in humanity , and in resources . Oceti Sakowin has enough to share .
