Camille had recently returned from Standing Rock , where she spent a month documenting the growing indigenous-led movement there . She shared photographs and video that had never been seen before . The protests there have been met with heavily militarized police , tear gas , attack dogs , sonar weapons , and the arrest of non-violent protesters and journalists . We support and appreciate your work and the necessary enlightenment and strive for fairness for all inhabitants of this fragile Earth .
