Many protesters may not be aware of the unfortunate fact that exercising their First Amendment rights may open themselves up to certain risks . Those engaging in peaceful protest may be subject to search or arrest , have their movements and associations mapped , or otherwise become targets of surveillance and repression . It is important that in a democracy citizens exercise their right to peaceably assemble , and demonstrators should be aware of a few precautions they can take to keep themselves and their data safe . Here we present 10 security tips for protesting in the digital age . 1 . Enable full-disk encryption on your device Full-disk encryption ensures that the files across your entire device are encrypted . This is a form of encryption that protects data at rest , as compared to in-transit encryption , which protects data that is transferred over the Internet . Full-disk encryption protects everything from your local database of text messages to the passwords you have stored in your browser . This is useful in case your device is confiscated by police , but also protects you in situations where the device is lost or stolen . Protest situations are often unpredictable , so losing your phone is distinct possibility . These should be protected by a strong password : 8-12 random characters that are nonetheless easy to remember and type in when you unlock your device . 2 . Remove fingerprint unlock In the past , iOS and Android used the same password to both boot your phone and to unlock it . Recently , both iOS and Android introduced a mechanism to allow you to unlock your device with your fingerprint . This is a convenient way to ensure that you enjoy the benefits of full-disk encryption without sacrificing convenience . A police officer can physically force you to unlock your device with your fingerprint . And as a legal matter , while the state of the law is in flux , there is currently less protection against compelled fingerprint unlocking than compelled password disclosure . In Android , disabling this feature may depend on your device manufacturer . 3 . Take photos and videos without unlocking your device Catching that perfect shot is something you want to be ready for , and powerful images can help bolster the cause . If you 've chosen a strong password , entering it into the device takes precious time , and you risk the moment passing before you 're able to take the shot . Luckily , newer versions of iOS and Android allow you to take photos and videos without unlocking your device , giving you the time to capture the moment . With Android Nexus devices , double-press the power button . At the iOS lock screen , you can swipe to the left . But we believe Signal is the better option because it implements best practices for secure messaging . In addition to encrypting one-to-one communication , Signal enables encrypted group chats . The app also recently added the functionality of having messages disappear anywhere from 10 seconds to a week after they are first read . In contrast to some other services like SnapChat , these ephemeral messages will never be stored on any server , and are removed from your device after disappearing . These lower-end devices can be purchased along with a SIM card at most large retail stores , and current federal regulation does not require you to show your ID -LRB- but your state may -RRB- . Let your friends know your temporary number , and use this to coordinate activities . Remember that the location of mobile devices can be determined by the cell towers they connect to , so if you do n't want your identity known , turn off your prepaid device before going home or anywhere that might lead to your identity . Using GPS should be safe , since GPS is a receiver and does not transmit any information , but your device may store your coordinates . When you 're done with the phone , it can be safely recycled or discarded from a location that is not linked to you . Keep in mind that if you carry both your regular device and a prepaid one with you , the location of these devices can be correlated as a way to compromise your anonymity . 7 . Back up your data Take precautions to limit the possible costs that can be incurred by the loss of a device . Backing up your data regularly and storing that backup in a safe place can save you a headache later on . 8 . Consider biking or walking to the protest Automated License Plate Reader Systems -LRB- ALPRs -RRB- automatically record the license plates of cars driving through an area , along with the exact time , date , and location they were encountered . Amassed in huge databases , this data is retained for an unknown period of time . Effectively , your location can be tracked over time by your driving habits , with very few legal limits in place as to how this data can be collected and accessed . Consider using alternative means of transportation if you would prefer that your movements and associations remain private . 9 . Enable airplane mode Airplane mode ensures that your device will not be transmitting for the duration of your time at the protest , and prevents your location from being tracked . Unfortunately , this also means that you wo n't be able to message or call your friends , so plan accordingly . You may want to select a nearby meet-up spot where you and your friends can rendez-vous if you get separated . 10 . Organizers : Consider alternatives to Facebook and Twitter Facebook and Twitter provide a large user base for you to promote your cause , but these popular social media platforms also carry risks . Viewing an event page , commenting on the event , and stating your intention to attend are all actions viewable by law enforcement if the pages and posts are public , and sometimes even if the pages are n't -LRB- subject to a court order -RRB- . For actions that require a more cautious approach , consider forming a group chat via Signal as described above . Please check your email for a confirmation link .
