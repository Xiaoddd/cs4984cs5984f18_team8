The activists have set up a tipi in front of the headquarters to protest the pipelines , which cut through land , threaten Indigenous rights and human rights , put drinking water and wildlife at risk of oil spills , and contribute to climate change . Indigenous Peoples are in danger , we need Europeans to act , to divest , to organise within their respective nations to make their banks accountable for Indigenous human rights abroad . This protest is the latest in a growing international movement to stand up for Indigenous and human rights and take climate action against pipeline companies like Energy Transfer Partners , Kinder Morgan , Enbridge and TransCanada , along with the banks that fund them . Energy Transfer Partners sued groups like Greenpeace International in the United States for nearly a billion dollars for supporting the Indigenous-led movement opposing the Dakota Access pipeline . Greenpeace Switzerland published a new report today that revealed that , per capita , Swiss banks provide more funding for fossil fuel companies than any other European country . But Credit Suisse and UBS have a responsibility too . Major banks around the world are already pulling out of projects which fuel climate change . Nature , our environment and the people affected tend to pay dearly for the short-term vision and greed of both banks . As long as extreme fossil fuels are still being produced , the carbon bubble and the financial climate risks will grow . Activists from Greenpeace Switzerland are calling on the major Swiss banks to submit plans by the end of this year outlining how they will bring all their financial flows in line with the Paris climate agreement .
