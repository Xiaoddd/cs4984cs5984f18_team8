A Canadian reporter was barred from entering the US . Ed Ou is used to crossing borders . The award-winning Canadian photojournalist has spent the past decade travelling to the kinds of places where being in the media can be a hazard to your health : Iraq , Yemen , Somalia , Egypt and Turkey , to name a few . So when he booked a flight in October to the US from Canada to cover the Standing Rock pipeline protests in North Dakota for the Canadian Broadcasting Company , he was relieved to be somewhere with press freedoms . When he refused to unlock his mobile on the grounds that it contained confidential information about sources , they forcibly took his Sim cards and made copies of his reporter 's notebook and personal diary . Then they barred him from entering the US . Legal experts and free speech advocates have spoken out against his treatment at the border , and say America 's press freedom laws do n't stand a chance against a government that has grown increasingly hostile towards the press . The American Civil Liberties Union , which is representing Mr Ou , and the Canadian Journalists for Free Expression have both condemned the incident . But according to the law , what happened at the US-Canada border is entirely legal . But that 's not guaranteed . The Obama administration has pursued legal action against leakers such as Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning , and has subpoenaed many journalists to try to get them to testify against their sources .

But the directive he laid out in a departmental memo is a guideline and not a law , and it remains to be seen what will come of it as a new administration takes hold . The Customs and Border Protection agency told the BBC it can not comment on individual cases , but that people who feel they have been treated unfairly can complain to the Department of Homeland Security , which oversees border security . For his part , Mr Ou says the issue of privacy and government surveillance is n't limited to the US . The Canadian spy agency recently admitted keeping a database with people 's information , and Montreal police admitted spying on journalists ' phones .
