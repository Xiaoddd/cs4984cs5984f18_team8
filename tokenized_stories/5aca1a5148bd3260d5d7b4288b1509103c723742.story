We will do this in courts , we will do this on our radio station , and we will commit to our descendants to work hard to protect this land and water for them . - Winona LaDuke This week , our water protectors were not protected . Without going into detail , I just want to say that I am in solidarity with these warriors . The Indigenous elders have asked for our prayers and our ceremony , as well as our actions and our phone calls . They need supplies . And I am doing what I can to support them from afar . This month , I am in prayer with Standing Rock . Las Ofrendas is compiling a list of folks , healers & artisans who are contributing some of our cash flow from our businesses to Standing Rock . I invite you to be in solidarity with these folks , and to make conscious purchases this season . Let your act of buying gifts for yourself and your kin support our warriors . As we gather in our own ways this week , let us remember to commune in healing ways . Let us remember to open our hearts and pray . To reflect on our actions and hopes in the world , to rest , and to pray for the Indigenous protectors of this land . It 's time to activate my loves . It 's time to educate . It 's time to be out about our beliefs , and to write them down for ourselves , like a sacred contract . It is time . Next month , we are writing in Spirit Poems : Writing in Times of Revolution . Stay resilient , stay creative , stay close to the ground , the Earth , the water , and your heart . It 's free and it 's beautiful . Register here to pray with us .
