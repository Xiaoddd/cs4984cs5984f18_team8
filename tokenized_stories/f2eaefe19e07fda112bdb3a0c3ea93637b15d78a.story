Start Preamble AGENCY : Department of the Army , DoD . ACTION : Notice . SUMMARY : This notice advises the public that the Department of the Army -LRB- Army -RRB- , as lead agency , is gathering information necessary to prepare an environmental impact statement -LRB- EIS -RRB- in connection with Dakota Access , LLC 's request to grant an easement to cross Lake Oahe , which is on the Missouri River and owned by the US Army Corps of Engineers -LRB- Corps -RRB- . This notice opens the public scoping phase and invites interested parties to identify potential issues , concerns , and reasonable alternatives that should be considered in an EIS . DATES : To ensure consideration during the development of an EIS , written comments on the scope of an EIS should be sent no later than February 20 , 2017 . ADDRESSES : You may mail or hand deliver written comments to Mr. Gib Owen , Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works , 108 Army Pentagon , Washington , DC 20310-0108 . Advance arrangements will need to be made to hand deliver comments . End Further Info End Preamble Start Supplemental Information SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION : The proposed crossing of Lake Oahe by Dakota Access , LLC is approximately 0.5 miles upstream of the northern boundary of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe 's reservation . The Tribe protests the crossing primarily because it relies on Lake Oahe for water for a variety of purposes , the Tribe 's reservation boundaries encompass portions of Lake Oahe downstream from the proposed crossing , and the Tribe retains water , treaty fishing , and hunting rights in the Lake . The proposed crossing of Corps property requires the granting of a right-of-way -LRB- easement -RRB- under the Mineral Leasing Act -LRB- MLA -RRB- , 30 U.S.C. 185 . To date , the Army has not made a final decision on whether to grant the easement pursuant to the MLA . The Army intends to prepare an EIS to consider any potential impacts to the human environment that the grant of an easement may cause . Specifically , input is desired on the following three scoping concerns : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Alternative locations for the pipeline crossing the Missouri River ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- Potential risks and impacts of an oil spill , and potential impacts to Lake Oahe , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe 's water intakes , and the Tribe 's water , treaty fishing , and hunting rights ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- Information on the extent and location of the Tribe 's treaty rights in Lake Oahe . On July 25 , 2016 , the Corps granted permission to applicant Dakota Access , LLC , under Section 14 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 , 33 U.S.C. 408 -LRB- 408 permission -RRB- , for a proposed pipeline crossing of Lake Oahe . Lake Oahe is on the Missouri River and owned by the Corps . The approximate 1,172-mile pipeline connects the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil market near Patoka , Illinois . The pipeline is 30 inches in diameter and is projected to transport approximately 570,000 barrels per day . The 408 permission was accompanied by a Finding of No Significant Impact based on an Environmental Assessment -LRB- EA -RRB- , as contemplated under the National Environmental Policy Act -LRB- NEPA -RRB- . The EA included a brief description and characterization of factors used in evaluating a potential alternative crossing location that was considered and eliminated during the analysis phase . The alternative route , which was eliminated , would cross the Missouri River approximately 10 miles north of Bismarck , ND . On December 4 , 2016 , the Army determined that a decision on whether to authorize the pipeline to cross Lake Oahe at the proposed location merits additional analysis , more rigorous exploration and evaluation of reasonable siting alternatives , and greater public and tribal participation and comments as contemplated in the Council on Environmental Quality 's -LRB- CEQ 's -RRB- NEPA implementing regulations , 40 CFR 1502.14 and 1503.1 . Currently , the Corps is developing a plan to implement the Army 's December 4 , 2016 direction . This notice of public scoping should be integrated into the Corps ' plan of action . Consistent with CEQ 's NEPA implementing regulations , an EIS will analyze , at a minimum : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Alternative locations for the pipeline crossing the Missouri River ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- Potential risks and impacts of an oil spill , and potential impacts to Lake Oahe , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe 's water intakes , and the Tribe 's water , treaty fishing , and hunting rights ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- Information on the extent and location of the Tribe 's treaty rights in Lake Oahe . The range of issues , alternatives , and potential impacts may be expanded based on comments received in response to this notice and at public scoping meetings . While you can ask in your comment that your personal identifying information be withheld from public review , the Army can not guarantee that this will occur . Authority : This notice is published in accordance with sections 1503.1 and 1506.6 of the CEQ 's Regulations -LRB- 40 CFR parts 1500-1508 -RRB- implementing the procedural requirements of NEPA , as amended -LRB- 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. -RRB- , and the Army and Corps ' NEPA implementation policies -LRB- 32 CFR part 651 and 33 CFR part 230 -RRB- , and exercises the authority delegated to the Assistant Secretary of the Army -LRB- Civil Works -RRB- by General Orders No. 2017-1 , January 5 , 2017 .
