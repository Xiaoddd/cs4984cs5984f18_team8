The 1,100-mile pipeline , the subject of controversy and mass protests , will be fully operational June 1 , according to Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- ETP -RRB- , the company that built it . But in April , a mechanical failure caused an 84-gallon oil spill northeast of Tulare , a tiny town in South Dakota . The spill was entirely contained and is considered small . Watch the VICELAND documentary on Standing Rock : The spill happened April 4 during the testing of a surge pump , according to Brian Walsh , an environmental scientist with the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources . At this particular pump station , oil is pumped into what 's called a surge tank , which measures flow rates , among other things , and then pumped back into the main line . The surge pump had a mechanical failure , but the entire spill happened within a lined containment area . Gravel on top of the liner that covered with oil was collected and disposed of , and oil never touched the unlined ground . Walsh told me that South Dakota typically gets 200 to 300 spills a year from fuel leaks , pipelines , oil wells , and various other sources . But Jan Hasselman , an attorney with Earthjustice representing the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in court , says that 's beside the point . It 's all but inevitable . Maybe next time it 's next to an elementary school or a drinking-water reservoir . State regulations require companies to report spills right away , and Walsh said ETP did -LRB- it reported the spill two days after the fact , on April 6 -RRB- . Cleaning up is happening , and it wo n't be fined or penalized in any way . The South Dakota government tracks spills of all kinds on a map on a website , searchable by date , type of spill , and responsible party . But there are no announcements of any particular spill ; a reporter for the Aberdeen American News , a local outlet , broke the story of the DAPL after finding it on the site . The state 's full report on the spill is n't complete yet . Walsh said it will take a couple of weeks , once ETP submits documentation to show that it disposed of contaminated materials properly . Meanwhile , the tribe 's legal battle against ETP continues . They has asked a judge to declare that the Trump administration 's reversal of the environmental study and issuing the permits was illegal . That decision could take weeks or months . In the meantime , new reports have emerged revealing that the company does n't yet have emergency equipment in place to handle a major spill in the future . As for the April spill , Hasselman pointed out that it would have received more attention if it were a major spill that affected drinking water .
