Also known as Dakota , Lakota , and Nakota , the Oceti Sakowin , with allies around the world , work to protect the water and land from the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- . Photo courtesy of Jaida Grey Eagle . The Standing Rock movement continues the momentum of Indigenous and other women-led social and environmental movements . As a Dakota , one way I interpret these movements is as caretaking kin , but I must clarify this designation . First , I use kin in ways that contradict patriarchal White settler ideas of it . Second , although I see women-led movements as caretaking , I do not view caretaking as the sole domain of cisgendered , biologically-reproductive women . Nor do I view women as being the only members of our communities who caretake . Men and gender-nonconforming people , and brave youth -LRB- who deserve particular recognition -RRB- also help caretake our peoples , make relations , and add to our collective strength . But nevertheless , the women-led condition of these movements is striking -LRB- see Wilson 2015 -RRB- . It organized round dances in public spaces as well as blockades of rail lines and highways in order to call attention to fossil-fuel and other industry infringements on Indigenous land rights . Ladonna Bravebull Allard , Standing Rock Sioux , has written about the DAPL in the context of histories of settler colonialism and Indigenous genocide . While Indigenous people have been killed outright , another eliminatory tactic has been to sever our sustaining relations with other-than-human relatives . Bravebull Allard writes about continued police violence against nonviolent , prayerful Water Protectors while the all-White , heavily armed militia led by Cliven Bundy was acquitted after its armed takeover of federal land . Today , as in earlier centuries , the colonial U.S. state and its White supremacist citizens , whether armed ranchers or oil industry executives and their private security henchmen , work to eliminate Indigenous peoples from these lands and they work to eliminate our relations with these lands , ensuring White occupation and profit in the process . They heard them talking about the campfires and the Horse Nation . Here , Nation and people are translations for the Lakota word Oyate . Rather , Indigenous women-led movements provide alternative visions for being better relatives with each other and the planet . Their work will go beyond these camps . I have faith in these women-led movements . Two Spirit leadership is also key . A Two Spirit camp was established at Standing Rock . BLM emerged in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman , killer of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin . BLM responded to multiple acts of police brutality against Black people nationwide . Black Lives Matter ... . BLM activists also work for criminal justice reform , the rights of trans and gender non-conforming people , domestic workers , immigrant justice , and human rights . Their organizing demonstrates powerful -LRB- queer -RRB- women-led governance . I see them caretaking their peoples and others as they defend bodies marginalized in a brutal anti-Black , antitrans , anti-immigrant , and antiworker world . References Wilson , Alex. 2015 .
