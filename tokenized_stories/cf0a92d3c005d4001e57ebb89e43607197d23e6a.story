Two cows have been reported dead near the site but Seuss said the cause of the deaths is unclear . The section of the oil pipeline where the leak occurred has been isolated and the spill has been contained . The spill is about 18 miles from the creek feeds into the Little Missouri River , which then feeds into the Missouri , a major drinking water source . Frigid temperatures have made cleanup conditions difficult , but has also slowed the movement of oil down the creek because the water has frozen , Seuss told Reuters . An investigation by federal regulators into the incident is ongoing . It was first reported on December 5 . In 2011 , the company reported two major leaks , one that spilled more than 1,900 barrels of refined products Campbell County , Wyoming , and another that leaked 1,000 barrels of crude in McKenzie County , North Dakota , according to Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration data .
