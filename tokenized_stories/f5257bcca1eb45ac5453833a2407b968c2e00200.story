Environmental groups in Louisiana are gearing up to fight a proposed 162-mile oil pipeline that would cut through the Atchafalaya Basin , a project involving the same companies building the controversial Dakota Access pipeline between North Dakota and Illinois . The proposed Bayou Bridge Pipeline would cross 11 parishes , beginning in Calcasieu and ending in St. James . It would link Louisiana refineries to a major hub in Texas that connects to larger pipelines throughout North America , including the Dakota Access . The new pipeline would cross a south Louisiana landscape that 's already a dense patchwork of smaller oil and gas pipelines , but some environmental groups say it 's time for the state to take a close look before adding another .

The Bucket Brigade , the Louisiana chapter of the Sierra Club , the Gulf Restoration Network , the Atchafalaya Basinkeeper and five other environmental and conservation groups have joined in a formal request that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers deny the federal permit needed for the pipeline . A public hearing on the permit application is set for 6 p.m. on Jan. 12 in Baton Rouge . Past pipeline projects in the state have been approved with little fanfare , but Rolfes and others hope media coverage of protests in North Dakota over completing the Dakota Access pipeline could bring more scrutiny to the Louisiana project . She said Louisiana , long known as an oil-and-gas state , should be shifting away from fossil fuels to renewable energy . The Bayou Bridge Pipeline project is being jointly pursued by subsidiaries of Phillips 66 , Sunoco Logistics and Energy Transfer Partners . All three companies have a stake in the Dakota Access Pipeline . Environmental groups opposing Bayou Bridge take issue with that , saying building a pipeline does n't necessarily mean rail , boat and truck transport will stop . The groups also worry that state and federal regulators do n't have the resources to ensure pipelines are maintained properly . Environmental groups also have raised concerns about impact of building a new pipeline through historic wetlands in the Atchafalaya Basin . That 's little comfort to Dean Wilson , executive director of the conservation group Atchafalaya Basinkeeper . Wilson said the Basin ecosystem has already been fouled by dirt dug out to install prior pipelines and then left piled high along the trench , serving as a levee to block the natural flow of water through the swamp . In written objections to the Bayou Bridge permit , the environmental groups argue that no clear process has been laid out to ensure wetlands would be returned to their natural state , with no spoil banks left behind . The Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association-West , a group of Basin crawfishermen who have long complained about pipeline spoil banks , has joined the environmental groups in opposing the proposed pipeline . A public hearing on the proposed pipeline is set for 6 p.m. on Jan. 12 in the Oliver Pollock Room of the Galvez Building at 602 N. Fifth St. in Baton Rouge . The hearing is being jointly held by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which decides whether to issue the permit , and the state Department of Environmental Quality , which must give its OK on water quality impacts as part of the Corps ' permit approval process .
