We have verified that although Veterans Stand corresponded with WorldViz , no contract was signed and no payments were made . This story has been corrected . The 38-year-old activist slid a contract across the coffee shop table , complete with his aggressive , looping signature across the bottom of the page . It was just a few days before Christmas in Playa Vista , California . Wood wore gray sweatpants with one leg hiked up to his knee , exposing a muscular , almost hairless leg and ankle-high socks in black Nike slides . He wore his dirty-blond hair high and tight . A fireplace flickered , and a light breeze sent palm trees swaying . Wood , who is originally from the suburbs of Baltimore , worked as a cop for 11 years and became known for speaking out against police brutality on Twitter . He was frequently quoted by the media , describing systemic problems in policing , particularly inside the Baltimore Police Department , his former employer . At the time , he said , it seemed like a good idea . He never thought that his pilgrimage to the wintry plains of North Dakota would ultimately derail his life and leave him at the center of an ethical controversy . Wood already had been accused of misspending some of the money he raised and misleading donors in his work at Standing Rock . So that day , we agreed to talk off the record . The next morning , I sat down with Wood again to revisit his ultimatum . Many of those campaigns accepted money without necessarily offering accountability , either to their donors or to the causes they claimed to represent . In the case of Veterans Stand , chaos and disarray become the hallmarks of a campaign that initially galvanized thousands of veterans and inspired more than 26,000 people from around the world to donate . That money was , at best , squandered and at worst , egregiously misspent . Graham Smith Wesley Clark Jr. , a 49-year-old Army vet with short dark hair and wide-set eyes , makes a lot of his friends on Twitter . His page bears a red-and-yellow sigil as his profile photo , strikingly similar to the Ferrari logo . He began following Michael Wood , intrigued by his police reform efforts , and then , in October 2016 , met him in person on the California set of The Young Turks , a left-leaning video blog . Both vets cared about social justice issues , and they stayed in touch . A month later , Phyllis Young , an elder of the Standing Rock Sioux , asked Clark if he could use his connections with veterans to raise awareness of the struggle against the Dakota Access Pipeline . But also , I was just shocked . As the summer wound on and I was following what was going on out there , I saw these people clearly being abused . Even as the tribe and its allies fought the pipeline in court , a grassroots movement erupted on social media and drew a powerful response from across the country . Veterans Stand was one of the hundreds of campaigns that started GoFundMe pages . Both Wood and Clark felt an urgent desire to get to Standing Rock as soon as possible , so they agreed to deploy on Dec. 3 , just a short month away . Wood told me that his expectations were initially low , but his interest was piqued . He believed the partnership could work . But there were signs of trouble from the beginning . Clark , according to Wood and other Veterans Stand volunteers , did not take naturally to a leadership role , so Wood stepped in . But their duties were never clearly delineated . Wood still acted as if Clark were in charge of the mission , while Clark followed his lead and assumed Wood was taking care of crucial planning . So that job fell to Wood . Wood said . By Nov. 10 , 2016 , Wood and Clark had recruited a handful of volunteers . Thousands of well-intentioned veterans made the journey to North Dakota . Dispatching from her funky studio apartment in Santa Monica , California , Sedef Buyukataman was one of them . A tall and lean woman of Turkish descent with short curly brown hair , she was brought on board by Clark . She considered him a close friend , even though they had only met on Twitter a few months prior . She offered to help with social media and , because she had a background in corporate human resources , assist Wood and Clark with general planning . Chris Duesing , a tall , tired-looking man whose shaggy blond hair had long since outgrown his former military crew cut , handled travel logistics . In North Dakota that November , as Veterans Stand was gaining momentum , thousands of protesters flocked to the demonstration . On Nov. 1 , 2016 , President Barack Obama announced that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was re-evaluating the pipeline plans to see whether it was possible to reroute it . Meanwhile , Buyukataman and Duesing created a public Google spreadsheet that served as the roster for veterans interested in joining the demonstration . By Nov. 18 , just a few days after the Veterans Stand campaign went live on GoFundMe , a few hundred supporters had signed on . The money was supposed to go toward food , transportation and supplies for any veterans who went to Standing Rock . Then the protests took a dramatic turn . The roster rapidly filled . Hundreds of volunteers became a thousand , and many had questions that neither Wood nor the other organizers knew how to answer . Wood and Buyukataman fielded hundreds of messages on Facebook , Twitter and the GoFundMe page . Wood , Clark , Buyukataman and Duesing scrambled to organize the thousands of volunteers , but between frantic phone calls , videoconferences and uncoordinated messaging , plans changed with the whims of whoever took charge that day . Despite the growing chaos , Wood was pleased ; according to Buyukataman and other volunteers , he seemed to view the deluge of support as the only important barometer of success . The GoFundMe account was receiving donations at a terrifying speed . They were very much enjoying the attention that they were getting . Already , more than 2,500 veterans had left for Standing Rock . They were scattered across the country . Volunteers ran late , and Clark could not be reached . By 10 a.m. , he was at cruising altitude , hurtling toward North Dakota . Hidden among the idealists , however , were opportunists and con artists , eager to cash in on this explosion of benevolence . Crowd-funding sites like GoFundMe are a relatively new phenomenon . There are few regulations safeguarding people who give money to causes , however dubious . While the platform allows people to report suspicious and possibly fraudulent campaigns , little public evidence exists that GoFundMe actively polices complaints . The data HCN uncovered in its investigation revealed a wide spectrum of efforts . While some campaigns provided receipts and accounted for how much money they spent on their GoFundMe pages , the majority did not . Red Warrior Camp , which was ordered to decamp in early 2017 by the Standing Rock Sioux tribal council , continued to collect money . The Standing Rock Sioux did not respond to multiple requests for comment . Graham Smith When Michael Wood arrived at the Bismarck airport , the reality hit him . He saw large groups of veterans in their old uniforms and badges : Desert Storm , Vietnam , Afghanistan . They were everywhere , searching for outlets to charge cellphones , asking where the buses for Standing Rock were . There was camaraderie and a growing excitement as they discussed their shared mission . Wood , not in uniform , slid past unnoticed , toward the baggage claim . This is going to be a problem . Once he retrieved his bag , Wood climbed into a rental car driven by Anthony Diggs , a homeless former Marine and volunteer from San Diego . Diggs , an olive-skinned 26-year-old with curly brown hair , talks quickly and at times incoherently . I spoke with Diggs recently , and he recalled running down the list of problems waiting for Wood : Veterans were not meeting at the designated check-in point in Eagle Butte , while volunteers were scattered from the Oceti Sakowin camp to the Prairie Knights Casino in Cannon Ball . There was a lot of miscommunication . People were stranded on the side of the road outside Bismarck , where yet another bus had broken down . Thousands of dollars worth of supplies had not been delivered to the post office box that , according to Wood , Clark failed to set up . On top of that , a blizzard was expected that night . The inside of the Prairie Knights Casino was a disorienting sight . In stark contrast to the blinking and bleeping of slot machines , the floors of the hotel and gaming area looked like a makeshift emergency shelter . As the weather became increasingly sinister and local law enforcement grew more aggressive , protesters fled the Oceti Sakowin camps and crowded in . Sleeping bags and canteens were piled in corners . Every available outlet was plugged with chargers . Wood hoped to find Clark and other volunteers for Veterans Stand . Instead , he met a new cast of opportunists and idealists rising through the ranks of his topsy-turvy outfit . Loreal Black Shawl , a 38-year-old woman of Oglala Lakota and Northern Arapaho descent , was recruited from the casino floor to be a spokeswoman for the group . She joined at a particularly chaotic time . In the chaos , Wood managed to reconnect with Duesing . Buyukataman , however , was still en route to the casino with a busload of veterans . Wood abruptly decided to put Buyukataman , whom he knew as kind , calm and collected , in charge of handling all the reimbursements . I was hurriedly putting together a reimbursement form from my bus seat on the way to North Dakota . And there were already hundreds of vets there . In the meantime , Wood stationed himself by a payphone and began reimbursing veterans with what cash he was able to withdraw from his bank account . He was having problems accessing the GoFundMe money , and with nowhere to sleep , he curled up in the corner with a blanket , using his bag as a pillow . When Buyukataman arrived at the casino the morning of Dec. 4 , she was shocked . When Buyukataman finally located Wood , he passed her a haphazard collection of receipts or scraps of paper with names , phone numbers and addresses scribbled on the back . Buyukataman realized that no one had been using the roster to keep track of or reimburse the nearly 3,000 veterans who had signed up . Hundreds of people were unaccounted for , and Veterans Stand was supposed to be responsible for them . Meanwhile , Duesing and Pate Hutson , a Navy veteran from Upper Arlington , Ohio , struggled to bring order to the camps . Some came for a fight ; some came for a peaceful war of some sort . There were a lot of vets who suffer from issues like PTSD and traumatic brain injuries , and they were getting triggered . Suddenly , uproarious cheering broke out : The Obama administration had denied a crucial easement for the pipeline . The water protectors had won a crucial battle . Then , on Dec. 5 , the blizzard hit . Temperatures hovered around 3 degrees Fahrenheit . Wind gusts hit 50 mph . Propane fuel gelled up in the cold , and an estimated 4,000 veterans organized by Veterans Stand were stranded , scattered across the plains , on the reservation and at the casino . The casino auditorium was filled with a mix of Standing Rock Sioux elders and tribal members , veterans and water protectors . The dozens of journalists who sat on the floor in the front row wielded cellphones and cameras as Clark spoke slowly into a microphone . Wood and Buyukataman felt uncomfortable . They felt like Clark was drawing attention away from the moment , from the Standing Rock Sioux , and focusing it on himself . Later that day , Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II ordered an estimated 14,000 protesters to go home . Clark left on a private jet while Wood , Duesing and Buyukataman tried to figure out what would happen next . There were still hundreds of veterans unaccounted for , and the remaining campaign organizers scrambled to figure out how to get home . When they got home , they planned to use the GoFundMe money to seed a nonprofit organization . Wood announced that he would be president , and Buyukataman readily signed on . Graham Smith In February 2017 , Buyukataman was still combing through the thousands of receipts left over from the December deployment . However , Buyukataman had begun to have serious reservations : There was no transparency , she felt , and there had been questionable uses of the money . Despite his status as president , however , Wood maintains that he was merely a volunteer who never made key decisions . At one point , according to Buyukataman , Wood suggested they use part of the GoFundMe donations to set up a home office in Southern California , where he could live while running media operations . Diggs could live in the condo , he said , and do important organization tasks . Wood said he hoped that Diggs would , in time , take his place as president of Veterans Stand . Still , he never gave a complete picture of how the money was spent . With the chaos of Standing Rock behind it , Veterans Stand felt like its true mission was forming . On March 10 , Wood and Diggs travelled to Washington , D.C. , for a demonstration urging the public to support the water protectors and divest from banks that helped finance the Dakota Access Pipeline . My interviews with Wood , Diggs and other organization members left me uncertain about whether the group was , in fact , a 501 -LRB- c -RRB- 3 or a 501 -LRB- c -RRB- 4 . In a formal information request to the Internal Revenue Service , however , I found out that it was neither : The organization never completed the registration paperwork . In fact , the group never responded to a follow-up request from the California attorney general for more information . Wood and Diggs promised the public an audit , but never followed through . They voted not to . Wood told me that the rest of the organization was in favor of the move . He claimed Buyukataman and Diggs selected the property , but they both deny this . On numerous occasions , in interviews for this story , other members expressed discomfort with the arrangement . People inside the organization began asking questions . Few of the central leaders could even remember who sat on the board . Meanwhile , Veterans Stand was drifting away from its original GoFundMe mandate . Wood and Diggs wanted to concentrate on outreach to veterans , but others wanted to continue direct action with the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux , who were still fighting the Dakota Access Pipeline . With little leadership or direction , Duesing and Pate Hutson continued work on the Standing Rock Reservation . They returned to North Dakota in March , putting their personal money on the line , using their own credit and debit cards . Duesing wanted a tax-exempt number for supplies , but neither Wood nor anyone else in the organization was able to provide it . Graham Smith In June of 2017 , tensions finally erupted during a videoconference call between Wood , Diggs and other volunteers . As was indicated on the gofundme page . Despite the increasingly vocal criticism , Wood remained defiant . The -LRB- GoFundMe -RRB- fundraiser was not a charity . When I spoke with Wood , he was unrepentant . By August 2017 , Duesing , Hutson , Panzironi and Buyukataman had left Veterans Stand . She is still trying to make sense of what happened to Veterans Stand . According to Duesing , the new organization got no financial help from Veterans Stand . Michael Wood and Anthony Diggs were the last two volunteers remaining with Veterans Stand . To do that , Wood and Diggs went on the Vans Warped Tour , a popular punk-rock summer festival that tours the country . They set up a Veterans Stand booth promoting a virtual reality technology that was supposed to help returning war veterans cope with civilian life and the effects of PTSD . But the ghosts of Standing Rock were beginning to catch up with Diggs and Wood . Brandon Boucher , a veteran from New Hampshire who participated in the December 2016 protests , complained that he never received his promised reimbursement . Boucher asked Diggs on a Reddit thread . As part of the Warped Tour , the two Veterans Stand members went to Albuquerque ; Milwaukee , Wisconsin ; Salt Lake City and Nashville . Diggs returned to the streets of Southern California , where he had been homeless before and would be homeless again . Neither Wood nor Diggs will say who erased Veterans Stand from the internet . He also claims that 8 percent of the money went to various banking , money transfer and GoFundMe fees . In his decision , Boasberg explained that the tribes would be unlikely to prevail in their lawsuit and denied their request to halt construction of the pipeline , or to stop oil from flowing through it once construction was completed . Today , Bakken oil flows through the pipeline , and Wood lives in a condo flanked by palm trees and luxury vehicles , financed by donations meant to help veterans and the Standing Rock Sioux . Help us investigate more stories like this . Michael Wood moved to Playa Vista in the spring of 2017 , and it was Anthony Diggs , not Wood , who eventually abandoned the Vans Warped Tour . Additionally , Wood arrived in Bismarck from Los Angeles , not Baltimore . Look for it in your email each Saturday . All rights reserved .
