The money was , in part , an acknowledgement of the months of anti-pipeline protests that had taxed local agencies during construction , but it was also a nod to the possibility of environmental contamination . Less than a month later , in Cambridge , the Iowa section of the Dakota Access pipeline would experience its first spill . Since the leak was contained at the site , it went unreported to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources , although it did make it into a federal pipeline monitoring database . The Dakota Access pipeline leaked at least five times in 2017 . According to federal regulators , no wildlife was impacted , although soil was contaminated , requiring remediation . Together , the two make up the Bakken pipeline system . ETCO leaked at least three times in 2017 . According to regulators , water was not impacted in any of the cases . Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation spokesperson Kim Schofinski told The Intercept that reporting the spill to the agency was not required because it was contained within the pumping station where it occurred . LaDuke is now pushing to stop construction of the Enbridge Line 3 oil sands pipeline in Minnesota . She noted that four leaks occurred before the pipeline system went into service during a testing period and were contained on a protective liner , although PHMSA notes that those incidents involved soil contamination . Caliber Midstream , the company behind the feeder line , did not respond to a request for comment . The 350-mile pipeline would carry ethane , butane , and propane from the Marcellus Shale fracking area to an export facility near Philadelphia . Pennsylvania regulators documented more than 100 spills of drilling fluid , ranging in size from 1 gallon to 160,000 gallons , entering creeks , lakes , wetlands , and fields since May . In at least two separate incidents , the fluid entered private wells , clouding drinking water and requiring locals to switch to Sunoco-provided bottled water . According to Neil Shader , spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection , lubricating drilling fluid is expected to leak when pipeline builders bore under streams . When a pipeline crosses a waterway , builders can either divert the water flow and build a big trench into which the pipeline is buried , or they can drill under the stream using a method called horizontal directional drilling . According to Shader , pressure causes the drilling fluid to look for pathways of escape , which is how leaks happen . Because of the risk , permits are required in advance of drilling . Additionally , the department has called for the company to address all alleged impacts to water wells in the Silver Spring Township , where wells were contaminated by unpermitted drilling , including restoration or replacement of the water supply and reimbursement for any costs . Regulators found traces of diesel fuel in samples taken from the spill . The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission forced the company to halt Rover construction for several months after the massive spill , although it was allowed to restart in September . In December 2016 , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under President Barack Obama denied ETP a permit to drill underneath Lake Oahe , part of the Missouri River system , and ordered an environmental impact statement for the project . However , Donald Trump had already been elected to the presidency , and within his first days in office , he issued an order to expedite permitting . Since the November spill , massive truckloads of contaminated soil have been hauled away . According to a filing with the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources , groundwater was impacted 6 feet below the surface , although TransCanada reported that testing of two local drinking water wells showed contamination below Environmental Protection Agency safety levels . The pipeline restarted operations less than two weeks after the spill . We depend on the support of readers like you to help keep our nonprofit newsroom strong and independent .
