The US Army Corps of Engineers announced that it would not authorise the final section of the pipeline in order to allow alternative routes to be considered . Two years ago , news of plans for the pipeline reached those at the Standing Rock reserve . The tribe resisted the proposals : the pipeline would cross near sacred territory , carrying an average of 500,000 barrels of oil each day beneath the reserve . They also feared it could contaminate their drinking water . But the pipeline seemed an unstoppable force , driven by the Dakota Access Pipeline company and backed by Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- ETP -RRB- , international banks and other rich stakeholders . As the months went by , the Sioux were joined by members of other indigenous tribes and increasingly by protesters from around the world . Among the dozens of other Native American tribes to offer support , some had previously been estranged from or enemies of the Sioux for several generations . Their campaign was decisively nonviolent . Before the announcement was made , this weekend , thousands of US veterans stood in solidarity at Standing Rock , acting as human shields between protesters and police . The news has been greeted with cautious celebration . But the victory has been accompanied by a note of caution . Concerns have been raised that the decision could also be appealed and reversed . With such weighty commercial interests at stake , the possibility of the pipeline being defeated for good seems slight , some say . And it is just one of many similar battles taking place around the world . They can not be defeated by force .
