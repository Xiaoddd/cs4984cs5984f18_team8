FBI surveillance planes , drones and low flying helicopters are ever present over camp and armored vehicles and snipers are positioned on hilltops nearby at the ready . Undercover provocateurs and DAPL employees frequently infiltrate the camp perpetrating violence against people . Water Protectors are being met with violence as riot police indiscriminately swing batons and deploy tasers , gas , water cannons , and projectiles at peaceful people . But theres hope . The resistance continues to grow , and recently a Copwatch group has been formed on the groud at Standing Rock WeCopwatch has been at Standing Rock for the past week supporting the formation of a Copwatch at Standing Rock . This is a Native run group who have been holding it down on the front lines . These cameras will be used for actions , police assaults , and security at the camps .
