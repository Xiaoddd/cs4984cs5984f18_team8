Nicolle spent time with us sharing the history and traditions of Native childbirth practices and made introductions to other maternal advocates and birth activists in the region . Nicolle has been working with other members of the Native American birth community to provide culturally appropriate , respectful care to the women who are there . Within weeks , a crowd had amassed in solidarity . By June , Nicolle Gonzales , a 36-year-old Navajo nurse midwife and mother of three living in Ildefonso Pueblo , New Mexico , noticed events unfolding on Facebook . Since 1956 , Indian Health Services , the federally mandated system that once sterilized indigenous women to control the population , has been the only medical option for Native Americans living on reservations . As the only Native American midwife in her graduating class , Gonzales understands the skepticism some in her community have toward midwifery . These women were the ones we could go to for information about how to care for ourselves , what songs do we sing as the baby is born , what herbs to use , how to be healthy in spirit , body and mind . We understand the birth place is sacred and we behave differently here . While Gonzales recognizes the pipeline protestors may not be around forever , she has been working tirelessly to establish a free standing clinic that will address the clinical and traditional healthcare needs in that community now and in the future .
