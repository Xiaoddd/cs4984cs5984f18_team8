Your support of our work is inspiring and invaluable . It is great for those who promote it , for those who personally benefit . Capitalism creates wealth and only becomes redeemable when people who understand what money can do , decide to do humanistic things with it . Bill Gates and Warren Buffet are proof of what benefits conscious capitalism can provide . The production of goods and services is based on supply and demand in the general market -LRB- market economy -RRB- , rather than through central planning -LRB- planned economy or command economy -RRB- . The purest form of capitalism is free market or laissez-faire capitalism , in which private individuals are completely free to determine where to invest , what to produce or sell , and at which prices to exchange goods and services , without check or controls . With the emergence of the Trump Administration , we are about to enter the late rounds of a two-year-old bout . The main event is Capitalism vs. Freedom of Religion . Our collective underwear as a nation is showing and the skidmarks of hypocrisy have left a stain . If you have watched the relationship of what America has done in the treatment of the First Nation on what was once their land , it is what is ugly about America and how we came to power . The operative word here is rare . In fact , for much of our history , many Native American ceremonies were illegal and people were imprisoned for practicing their religion . Over the course of the stand-off , there have been some 300 Tribes represented at Standing Rock in North Dakota . If capitalism cared about the human organism , toxic water , community crises like those in Flint Michigan and Newark , New Jersey would not exist . Unsafe levels of toxic chemicals found in drinking water in 33 states contain high levels of fluoridated compounds that have been linked to cancer and hormone disruption according to the National Institutes for Health -LRB- NIH -RRB- . Clearly , capitalism and the individuals driving the bus can not protect us in this regard so I clearly understand the First Nations concern and desire to protect their interest and ours . You have to start here , it starts with the incorrect indoctrination in our education system that diminishes the role of a valiant proud people that did not want invaders . In order to understand this struggle , Ego needs to be set aside and there must exist a desire to obtain some sort of spiritual awakening to achieve a higher range of thought and purpose for your life and the lives of others , the lives that have come before you and the lives that will come after you . For the Capitalist , this is about money and investment . This gentleman -LRB- and I use the term loosely -RRB- is now at the forefront of a belief that global warming is a hoax . No religion , perhaps , lays as much emphasis on environmental ethics as Hinduism . The Mahabharata , Ramayana , Vedas , Upanishads , Bhagavad Gita , Puranas and Smriti contain the earliest messages for preservation of environment and ecological balance . Nature , or Earth , has never been considered a hostile element to be conquered or dominated . In fact , man is forbidden from exploiting nature . The Maori have a unique relationship with their natural world . They view themselves as one with the natural world . The people , the land , the sea , the forest , and all living creatures are members of the same family . The Luhya of Western Kenya have a deep respect for nature as an important part of the universe . According to them , God turned Himself into objects of nature such as trees , rocks , hills , mountains , rivers after completing creation . They believe that each object of nature has an ancient name that is used to communicate with it and to command it to do His will . At a certain level of understanding in Luhya thought , there is no such thing as a nonliving thing . In the case of the First Nations , their environmental wisdom and spirituality is legendary . Animals are respected as equal in rights to humans . Among the hunter-gatherers the land was owned in common : there was no concept of private property in land , and the idea that it could be bought and sold was repugnant . They have and will continue to die for this belief . The First Nations do not recognize our national government boundaries . The white man was hell-bent on destroying not just the Indians , but the whole natural order , felling forests , clearing land , killing animals for sport . There is no respect for the Nature Spirit . They taught how to pray with our eyes closed . We need to educate ourselves about climate change , the environment , what the world is doing about it , what we can do to help and spread the word . Those law firms that benefit richly from Casino gaming revenues need to be forced to step up and take a position on behalf of their clients . We desperately need to shame and vote out the elected officials who condone the type of continuous disrespect to the First Nations as we have seen with the North Dakota Pipeline , and to us as stewards of this country , this land . The Supreme Court has often failed to treat Native American religious practices on a level playing field with other religious claims . The Trump Administration will have the luxury of picking the next 1 maybe 2 Supreme Court picks . These 2 individuals will be part of the decision making process of what happens in decisions that affect the First Nations . We must hold that Administration responsible . We need to respect and understand what this land means to the indigenous people and for the future of our children . If we are smart , it will mean exactly the same to us as it does to the First Nations . So far , we have been the disease . We need to have some honor as a nation and keep our word , abide by the Treaty , protect their religious freedom , and allow these water protectors to do what many of us have failed to do .
