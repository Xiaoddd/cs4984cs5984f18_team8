A recent analysis from Greenpeace U.S. found that the pipelines of just three companies , Kinder Morgan , TransCanada , and Enbridge , have spilled on average once per week in the U.S. alone since 2010 . Another analysis of pipelines owned by Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- ETP -RRB- and Sunoco -LRB- which is now owned by ETP -RRB- , found an average of one spill incident every eleven days since 2002 . ETP is the company behind the Dakota Access pipeline , which sparked the iconic Indigenous-led resistance at Standing Rock . But it gets worse . Massive new oil pipelines do the exact opposite . They help expand the production and consumption of fossil fuels , locking us into higher emissions and increasing our addiction to oil at precisely the time we need to be scaling down the fossil fuel industry and its infrastructure through a just transition to renewable energy . Because of these and other concerns , many Indigenous communities are opposing plans to build new pipelines through their territories . Indigenous Land and Water Protectors are leading the growing movement against pipelines and for a better future for us all . Rather than owning up to its issues and working to address them , the pipeline industry has been using nefarious tactics to silence and undermine those standing up for Indigenous rights , a sustainable economy , and a healthy environment . But the movement has not been deterred . The many beautiful and inspiring examples of people fighting back against the oil industry could fill a entire book . The building of the Watch House was followed by mass peaceful civil disobedience against the Kinder Morgan pipeline , which has resulted in about 200 people being arrested since March , including grandmothers and grandfathers , Greenpeace co-founder Rex Wyler , and two sitting Members of Parliament . In 2016 , this iconic resistance movement drew global attention to the misdeeds of the pipeline industry . The lawsuit is aimed at silencing critics and driving a wedge between Indigenous Water Protectors and allies such as Greenpeace . This tactic has failed , and both Greenpeace and the wider movement have redoubled support for Indigenous-led pipeline resistance . Here too , Indigenous people are leading the fight . Indigenous Water Protectors and allies have been peacefully putting themselves in the way of construction to stop this harmful project from going ahead . Read a personal account here .
