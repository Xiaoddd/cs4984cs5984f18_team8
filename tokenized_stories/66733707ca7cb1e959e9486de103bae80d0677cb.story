The bill intends to make it easier for natural gas pipelines to get approved . S. 1844 would weaken provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act -LRB- NEPA -RRB- . NEPA was created with bipartisan support in Congress almost fifty years ago and establishes a process through which federal agencies identify and consider the environmental impacts of projects that involve federal resources , permits or licenses . The law then requires an agency to thoroughly consider all costs and benefits of a proposed project , develop alternatives that maximize benefits while minimizing costs , and provide the public with an opportunity to review and comment . It improves collaboration , consensus , accountability and transparency in government decision-making . Some politicians and industry officials blame NEPA for delaying projects and would like to shortcut environmental review and public input . However , the vast majority of new natural gas pipeline proposals are already approved within one year , and any delays in processing applications usually result from applicants submitting incomplete or inaccurate information to the regulatory body that governs natural gas projects , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -LRB- FERC -RRB- . During a NEPA review , in addition to the lead federal agency , other federal agencies as well as state , local , and tribal agencies may wish to participate in the review process . S. 1844 would establish new , unnecessary processes that would make it more difficult for other agencies to provide valuable expertise and input on environmental impacts . In other words , S. 1844 would limit thorough and comprehensive environmental reviews of natural gas pipelines . Given the climate and other impacts of these massive multi-billion dollar projects , they should be getting more review , not less . In addition , S. 1844 would allow for the approval of natural gas pipelines before environmental review is even completed . These reasons apply to many other new pipeline proposals , too . These massive dirty energy projects threaten rivers , streams , wetlands , drinking water wells , clean air , wildlife habitat , private property , public safety , farms , and the climate . The co-sponsor of this new bill , Senator Angus King of Maine , said that the bill is needed to deliver natural gas to Maine consumers more efficiently . Before weakening our bedrock environmental laws , Congress should instead ensure that FERC promotes efficient use of existing pipelines , which have significant excess capacity , before approving any new ones .
