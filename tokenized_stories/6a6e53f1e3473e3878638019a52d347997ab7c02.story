Ever fearful of plots to overthrow him , Kim is said to have had 140 senior officials executed since he succeeded his father , Kim Jong-il , in 2011 . In a Kafka-esque twist , the most recent victim of regime purges is the man in charge of them : General Kim Won-hong , chief of the secret police and minister of state security , who was sacked last month . But the method allegedly used to assassinate his troublesome playboy half-brother , Kim Jong-nam , in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday recalls a similar incident in South Korea in 2011 , when a North Korean agent attacked an anti-regime activist with a poisoned needle concealed in a pen . Aged about 34 , he is reportedly chronically overweight and suffering from diabetes . It was a provocation exactly timed to put both men off their swing . In fact he may simply be following the example of other world leaders . An instructive example of how to get away with murder is the 2006 poisoning in London of Alexander Litvinenko , a Putin opponent . His death was officially blamed on named Russian agents , but none has been arrested or prosecuted . The death on foreign soil of Kim Jong-nam , a potentially subversive critic , recalls the 2015 abduction to the mainland of five Hong Kong publishers by Chinese state agents . The publishers did not die . But nor was anybody punished . Perhaps Kim thinks he can act with similar impunity . Perhaps Kim figured that , in the Trump era , it would be no big deal to bump off a troublesome relative . This is the sort of mano a mano respect the dysfunctional , isolated Kim craves .
