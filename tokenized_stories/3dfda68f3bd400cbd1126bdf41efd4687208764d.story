South Florida sits atop two gigantic underground stores of water : the Biscayne and Floridan Aquifers . So environmentalists are concerned that Florida Power & Light now wants to dump full-on radioactive waste into the that lower water table , called the Boulder Zone . A small group of activists called Citizens Allied for Safe Energy -LRB- CASE -RRB- tried to stop FPL 's plan , but their legal petition was shot down this past Friday . CASE had filed a petition with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission , but the NRC on Friday threw out CASE 's complaint , saying the environmental group had filed too late in FPL 's approval process . The fight stems from the energy company 's plan to build two nuclear reactors at the controversial Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station south of Miami by roughly 2030 . The towers might not be operational for a decade or two , but that does n't mean the public should stop paying attention to them . FPL is submitting numerous proposals about the project to the government . CASE alleges the government failed to address a host of concerns about the power company 's plan . Environmentalists say the plan could leak carcinogens such as cesium , strontium 90 , and tritium right into the drinking-water aquifers . But CASE 's November complaint cited both government data and FPL 's own engineers , who admitted in separate hearings that waste could leak upward from the Boulder Zone into the Biscayne Aquifer . CASE 's petition says the NRC failed to address this issue . The report states flatly : Recent studies by the U.S. Geological Survey of seismic-reflection profiles acquired in onshore canals and offshore in Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic continental shelf have indicated the presence of tectonic faults -LRB- one strike-slip fault and multiple reverse faults -RRB- and karst collapse structures , and these studies substantiate the utility of this approach for locating feasible vertical-fluid flow pathways . The strike-slip fault and karst collapse structures span confining units of the Floridan aquifer system and could provide high permeability passageways for groundwater movement . If present at or near wastewater injection utilities , these features represent a plausible physical system for the upward migration of effluent injected into the Boulder Zone to overlying U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designated underground sources of drinking water in the upper part of the Floridan aquifer system .

But the company 's credibility with the public is not in good shape . Now , White says , he and CASE plan to lobby state lawmakers to try to outlaw injections into the Boulder Zone through state law . To put things mildly , CASE is fighting an uphill battle : FPL is one of the largest campaign donors in Florida politics . Jerry Iannelli is Miami New Times ' daily-news reporter .
