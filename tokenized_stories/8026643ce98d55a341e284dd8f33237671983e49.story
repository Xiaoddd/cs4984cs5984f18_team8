Winds light and variable . And with that I began preparations to join fellow veterans in North Dakota . A call had gone out that the Water Protectors at Standing Rock needed us . I was to answer that call along with 2,000 to 3,000 other military veterans . The last time I was in North Dakota I was traveling home from a series of meetings . It was late February , and I ended up stranded in some motel room just off the interstate for two days . The blizzard had shut North Dakota down . Weather can be brutal on the plains and I had experienced it , stuck in a motel with a full service restaurant and cable television . I expected the camp at Standing Rock would have no such amenities . The advantage I had this time was that I heeded the organizers recommendation to be as self sufficient as possible . I put the call out to my Prairie Farm and Menomonie communities asking for any interested traveling partner as well as food and clothing donations to be offered to the Oceti Sakowin Camp . The decision to go had been made , and it was not going to change . I would simply go it alone . Using the internet , I developed a list of items that the water protectors were in need of . Publishing the list to my Facebook page , I soon had a great many offered donations . Arrangements were made with friends willing to serve as drop off points in both Prairie Farm and Menomonie . People donated boxes of glove and sock warmers , boots , jackets , shovels and flashlights . One person provided three new pairs of insulated coveralls . A half dozen wool army blankets came in . Another friend coordinated making and gathering of baked goods . I was a very popular veteran when I arrived in camp and unloaded my car . To be as self sufficient as possible , I began making up containers of food . Soon there was a cooler of precooked meals consisting of chili , spaghetti and beans . My cooking equipment was stowed , sleeping gear and extra clothes were packed . I intended to sleep in the back of my car . A phone call changed my planning for the better . In this community , word of need gets out . Someone knew someone who heard of someone needing a ride back to Standing Rock . Soon Leland Brenholt and I were playing telephone tag . Although we had not met before , Leland grew up in the same Menomonie church Lavonne and I attended for over 30 years . We had a connection and he had experience , having been to Standing Rock twice before as part of the medical team . Leland was needed back at camp as soon as possible . His experience camping on the North Dakota prairie in winter guided him to purchase an insulated tent , a dome often used for ice fishing . I was to join him in the tent , and we would use the car for storage . We left my home , bound for North Dakota . Entering the Standing Rock reservation from North Dakota at Fort Yates was increasingly considered problematic . Cars were being stopped and searched . Rumors of civilian travelers being told they would be arrested for bringing supplies to the reservation were beginning to surface . It was suggested that we approach Standing Rock from the South Dakota side of the reservation . Veterans were now planning to stage at Eagle Butte , S.D. From there , we would be transported by bus to the Oceti Sakowin encampment . As I was leaving , a group of cars and trucks were lining up to convoy the 40 miles or so to the camp . Leland needed to be there as soon as possible , so we joined the convoy for the ride north . The veterans would arrive by bus the next day . Upon entering camp , we were asked by the guard if we had any drugs , alcohol or weapons , all items banned from the camp . After setting up our tent , I went in search of veterans and was directed to a familiar-looking olive drab mess tent that served as headquarters for a group of veterans that have been at Standing Rock for months . I enjoyed some food and conversation then headed out to explore the camp . At the time , the weather was great , a nice warm and sunny winter afternoon , a good day to wander the camp and watch as the new arrivals came in . Wherever you turned , you found signs that it is a peaceful and prayerful camp . Radio Standing Rock kept up announcements , music , prayers and commentary from 5:45 a.m. until 10 p.m. Various rituals were followed and customs shared among the many indigenous people from around the globe . People continued to arrive , and the camp grew by the hour . Leland had been amazed at the growth he saw just within the week he had been away . Tents were being set up all over the place , wherever they could fit between existing tents another tent would pop up . The weather remained friendly all day , and other than a chill in the air most people remained comfortable . Other columns are available at joeplouffpolicyandpolitics.wordpress.com .
