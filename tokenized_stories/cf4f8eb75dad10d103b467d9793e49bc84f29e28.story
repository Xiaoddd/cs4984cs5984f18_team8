That 's the case with a GoFundMe account set up to assist veterans who intended to come and Stand with Standing Rock . The use of over a million dollars in donations is being questioned and former members of the military are upset about statements made on their behalf . The population of the main protest camp fluctuates depending on many circumstances , with weather being one of the main factors . The camp recently saw a an influx of veterans due to the Veterans Standing for Standing Rock movement . I thought this was the perfect chance for me to go . Grzywa feels the two organizers of the Veterans Standing for Standing Rock took him and other former members of the military for a ride . Those who have served in the armed forces were invited to join the demonstrations against the Dakota Access Pipeline . Veterans were promised their expenses would be reimbursed for coming to the camp . Grzywa says many of his brothers have not received the promised reimbursement from a Go Fund Me account that was set up for that purpose . Another of Grzywa 's points of contention comes from an apology that Wes Clark , Junior one of the other organizers made on behalf of all veterans . That should should come from the president of the United States . Grzywa wants all veterans to be reimbursed . Wood and Clark who are hosts and contributors for the news organization The Young Turks have received a lot of backlash over how the event was run .
