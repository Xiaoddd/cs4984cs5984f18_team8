Tensions have also been raised in migrant communities around the US , over a series of raids carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement -LRB- Ice -RRB- . The Ice raids were the first major immigration enforcement actions since Trump took office and signed an executive order which broadened the range of undocumented migrants considered to be priorities for deportation .

The Ice field office director in Los Angeles told the Guardian on Friday some people held in the raids were simply charged with being in the US illegally , but denied reports that some of those held had been denied access to attorneys . Trump also addressed the subject of his promised wall on the US border with Mexico on Twitter on Saturday . Officials including Vice-President Mike Pence have long denied that Flynn discussed sanctions with the ambassador , an allegation now reported by multiple outlets , based on a transcript of a call shared by intelligence sources .

That statement brought condemnation from major figures in both parties , appalled that a president of the US would suggest moral equivalency between his country and an authoritarian regime . On Friday , they and their wives ate dinner with Robert Kraft , the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots . Saturday brought golf for Trump and Abe and a cultural visit for Melania Trump and Akie Abe . The Abe visit represented the beginning of a busy spell of diplomacy for Trump , in which he will host the Canadian prime minister , Justin Trudeau , and Israeli prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu . He also comes to Washington to meet a president who has mused openly about pulling out of Nafta , the free-trade agreement between the US , Canada and Mexico . The Netanyahu visit may also produce fireworks . Although Trump has boasted about his ardent support of the state of Israel and campaigned on moving the US embassy there from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem , he has changed his tone in recent days .
