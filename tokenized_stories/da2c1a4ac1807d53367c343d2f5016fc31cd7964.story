Hydraulic fracking requires fluids to be injected at high pressure into a drilling pipe to crack rocks and release oil . Environmental campaigners are opposed to the process , claiming it can contaminate water supplies and cause small earth tremors . Oil and hydraulic fracking fluids were included in the spills . Figures previously released by the EPA were significantly lower , with 457 spills reportedly occurring between 2006 and 2012 in an eight-state area . North Dakota saw the highest number of spills with 4,453 incidents , something that may be credited to sterner laws which require spills over 42 US gallons -LRB- 159 liters -RRB- to be reported . Colorado and New Mexico saw 476 and 426 spills reported respectively , but these stats have a much lower reporting threshold of 210 US gallons -LRB- 795 liters -RRB- . Most spills occurred within the first three days of operation with half of those covered in the report relating to the storage and movement of fluids via pipelines . All rights reserved .
