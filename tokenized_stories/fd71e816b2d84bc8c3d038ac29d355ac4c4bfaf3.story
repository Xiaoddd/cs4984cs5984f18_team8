United States Senator Ben Cardin , -LRB- D , Maryland -RRB- , has promised to introduce a resolution to block President-elect Donald Trump , who recently softened his position on gay marriage , from being administered the oath of office and taking office on January 20 , 2017 , the day that Trump 's term is supposed to begin . Cardin is basing his resolution on the clause in the United States Constitution that prohibits presidents who still have vested corporate and foreign interests from taking office . Trump has failed to divest himself of his corporate and foreign interests and has made arrangements for his adult children and son-in-law to run his domestic and foreign companies during his presidency . What complicates the matter What complicates the matter is the fact that Trump 's children and son-in-law are playing an active role on the Transition Team . In that capacity , the Trump children play an active role in the selection of the Secretary of State , the National Security Advisor , the Ambassador to the United Nations and the ambassadors to all the countries to which the United States has economic ties . The decisions of these key people affect trade policies , embargoes , and sanctions and tariffs , all of which play a role in the profitability or non-profitability of Trump 's companies , foreign manufacturing , investments , etc. . Unless Trump , his adult children and his son-in-law are divested of any and all of their interests in Trump 's companies , investments and economic interests , a conflict of interest will ensue . Ethics lawyer weighs in Cardin is not the only notable who has legitimate concerns over Trump 's failure to divest himself and his clan of his domestic and foreign economic ties . Richard Painter , who served as legal counsel to Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama , has formally asked the Electoral College to withhold voting for Trump until and unless he divests himself of any and all of his economic , corporate and foreign interests for the duration of his tenure as President . Stein launched her effort after rumors of irregularities and discrepancies emerged in the wake of the November 8 , 2016 election . Stein is challenging the votes in Wisconsin , Michigan and Pennsylvania . Hillary Clinton has joined Stein in the recount effort ; although Stein is paying for it .
