The arteries inside her arm are blown away . As many as 20 operations lie ahead , Mr. Wilansky said , and it was unclear whether she would keep the arm . Her injury is the most serious to have been reported during months of increasingly acrimonious conflict over the 1,170-mile Dakota Access Pipeline , which Native American tribes , led by the Standing Rock Sioux , fear would pollute the Missouri River and harm sacred cultural lands and tribal burial grounds . The project was delayed in September when the Obama administration temporarily blocked it from crossing under the Missouri River . And this month , President Obama called on both sides to show restraint and revealed that the Army Corps of Engineers was considering an alternative route for the project . But Kelcy Warren , the chief executive of the pipeline company , Energy Transfer Partners , told The Associated Press last week that it would not consider a different route . On Wednesday , Gov. Jack Dalrymple , Senator John Hoeven and Representative Kevin Cramer , all North Dakota Republicans , urged Mr. Obama to authorize the Army Corps of Engineers to allow construction to resume . All the while , the protests have gone on , and the polarization between the police and protesters extended to their sharply differing explanations of how Ms. Wilansky was injured early Monday . Law enforcement accounts suggest that fellow protesters caused the explosion ; the demonstrators insist the police are to blame . They were turned back by officers using water hoses ; several protesters were treated for hypothermia . Mr. Wilansky , who spoke by telephone and checked details with his daughter as he did , said the explosion had taken place around 4 a.m. Monday , when most of the protesters were gathered around a bonfire near the foot of the bridge . Image Sophia Wilansky was injured while protesting against the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota this week . Lt. Tom Iverson of the North Dakota Highway Patrol offered a different version of the episode , which he said was being investigated by the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives . Around the time of the explosion , Lieutenant Iverson said , officers fired sponge and beanbag rounds at three people who had shielded themselves behind a length of plywood near a burned vehicle on the bridge . The three were thought to be acting suspiciously and refused orders to emerge , he said . Officers saw someone roll metal cylinders to the protesters by the burned vehicle , Lieutenant Iverson said , and then heard an explosion . Afterward , he said , several protesters ran up , pulled a woman from under the vehicle and ran off . Three propane canisters were recovered from the vicinity of the explosion early Tuesday , he said . Lieutenant Iverson said that officers did not use concussion or flash grenades at any time . Instead , officers used tear gas , pepper spray canisters and what are known as stinger balls , round grenadelike objects that spread tiny rubber pellets to try to disperse protesters , he said . Friends said they were not surprised that Ms. Wilansky would gravitate to the North Dakota protest . She had also protested the construction by Spectra Energy of a natural gas pipeline in New York . In June , she locked herself to an excavator at a natural gas pipeline dig in Vermont . About three weeks later , she was arrested in Massachusetts after lying down in a trench dug for the West Roxbury Lateral pipeline .
