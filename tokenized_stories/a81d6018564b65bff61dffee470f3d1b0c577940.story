Thousands had marched to the border at the start of a six-week protest , dubbed the Great March of Return . The Israeli military said soldiers had opened fire after rioting . UN Security Council members meeting in New York have called for an investigation into the violence . Palestinians have pitched five camps near the border for the protest . They are demanding that refugees be allowed to return to homes that are now in Israel . The Israel Defense Forces -LRB- IDF -RRB- said there were about 17,000 Palestinians in five locations near the border fence . Although most protesters stayed in the encampments , some groups of youths ignored organisers ' calls to stay away from the fence and headed closer to Israeli positions . A spokesman said all those who were killed had been trying to breach or damage the border fence , the Jerusalem Post reports . Israel said it had targeted sites of the Hamas militant group . Israel deployed tanks and snipers . Witnesses said a drone had been used in at least one location to drop tear gas . By Rushdi Abu Alouf , BBC News , Gaza The death toll from Friday 's rally is the largest since the last Israeli war on Gaza in the summer of 2014 . Since then Gaza has seen a long period of calm but difficult economic conditions and the Israeli blockade may be the final chapter in the four-year truce between Hamas and Israel . Despite the call for peaceful demonstrations , the confrontations involving angry Palestinian youths were not surprising . Young men have been demonstrating near the border with Israel on numerous occasions , but this time Israel 's response was exaggerated . Tomorrow , the Palestinians will bury their dead and head back to the border with Israel to throw stones at the soldiers . Hamas , the militant group that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007 , does not recognise Israel 's right to exist but last year said it was ready to accept an interim Palestinian state limited to Gaza and the West Bank . Palestinian health officials said at least 400 people had been wounded by live ammunition . It said one of those killed was a 16-year-old boy . The Israeli military oversees a no-go zone along the Gaza border , citing security concerns , and has doubled its troop presence for the protest . It fears the protest could be an attempt at a mass breach of the border .
