We have also been providing daily no-cost care for acute and chronic conditions to thousands of people assembled peacefully to exercise their first amendment rights . The vast majority of cases we have witnessed and treated -- in patients ranging from the young to elderly -- have been the direct result of the following : Blunt force trauma , including but not limited to near amputation , retinal detachment , and multiple fractures , concussions , lacerations , and contusions as a result of rubber bullets , battery with batons , and concussion grenades , Bites from attack dogs Exposure to chemical weapons . Hypothermia as a result of water cannons power blasting individuals in freezing temperatures . The blockade makes quick and expeditious travel by emergency services to the nearest level two trauma center in Bismarck impossible . What should be a 35 minute ambulance ride in an emergency becomes over an hour due to this blockade and checkpoints . This has been and continues to be a major threat to public health that has been not been addressed by local health agencies . Of greatest concern is the previously mentioned December 5th eviction notice by the Army Corps of Engineers upon the Oceti Sakowin camp . Based upon all evidence to date we have good reason to believe that excessive , violent force will be used against unarmed people in winter conditions that threaten life simply through hypothermia . In our professional opinion , the Oceti Sakowin community composed of several thousand women -LRB- many of whom are pregnant -RRB- men , children , elderly , are firmly committed to remaining upon the land that was clearly outlined by Treaty laws belonging to the Lakota and Dakota peoples . We affirm that during the entire term of our service we have never seen any evidence of weapons , whether in the form of firearms or incendiary devices . If the goal is to protect health and well being , that purpose will best be served by allowing the Oceti Sakowin to remain , unmolested , in full exercise of their constitutionally protected First Amendment rights . We want to make clear that the SRM&HC is committed to fulfilling the spirit of the Geneva Convention by providing medical services to Oceti Sakowin regardless of the decisions and conditions imposed by state agencies . This decision occurs despite clear observations that designated and labeled medics are being unethically and illegally targeted by law enforcement -- once again in violation of the Geneva Conventions -LRB- Rule 25 . Medical personnel exclusively assigned to medical duties must be respected and protected in all circumstances -RRB- . We urge your respective agencies to prevent the alarming threat to loss of life and limb on December 5th . From our assessment as the medical team on the ground , the violence from law enforcement has been the largest threat to public safety . The immediate opening of northbound county highway 1806 to allow expeditious travel by emergency health services . The Army Corps of Engineers has the power to immediately de-escalate the situation by denying the easement and bringing a permanent end to the construction of the DAPL through Lake Oahe .
