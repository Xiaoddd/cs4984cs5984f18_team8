Meanwhile , violence broke out in the streets of D.C. as anti-Trump protesters clashed with Trump supporters and law enforcement . But while the nation is distracted by the selection of the latest puppet-in-chief , violence has returned to North Dakota in the ongoing fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline . After a relatively quiet December and early January , tensions are running high at the site of the Dakota Access Pipeline near Cannonball , North Dakota . On Monday , Tuesday , and Wednesday , social media accounts connected to the fight against the DAPL and in support of the Sioux posted several videos showing law enforcement using tear gas and rubber bullets on water protectors who attempted to set up a tipi on Backwater bridge off highway 1806 . Backwater Bridge was the site of conflict throughout the months of October and November . By 8:30 pm , the crowd of protesters had grown to approximately 150 . During the following four hours , protesters started three tire fires on the bridge and two fires on each side of the bridge as well as erecting two tipis further blocking the bridge . Morton County reported 14 arrests on Monday night and Tuesday morning . On Monday night , the water protectors held rallies and marches to commemorate Martin Luther King Jr. . Day . The Avenger is a humvee-mounted , low altitude surface-to-air missile system . In the background of the ongoing violence , legal battles over the fate of the Dakota Access Pipeline continue to be fought . The legal process now moves into the formal comment period , which lasts until February 20 . Despite the call for an EIS , the Standing Rock Sioux say the Corps is neglecting to do a full environmental study . The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Sioux had no standing in their arguments against construction . The Sioux were attempting to get the court to issue a preliminary injunction to stop construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline based on threats to sacred and cultural sites . For the time being , it seems the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline will continue in the fields of North Dakota rather than the courts . The incoming fossil fuel-friendly Trump administration is likely to move on the project soon . Water protectors are preparing to put their bodies on the line to stop a project that threatens the environment , their culture , and the health of future generations .
