The U.S. just shattered all previous photovoltaic installation records , with 4,143 megawatts of solar PV installed in just the last quarter of 2016 . In 2017 , solar is expected to break records again . With an 88 percent growth rate for solar installations in the U.S. in 2015 , and the pace of installation showing no signs of stopping , there is really no need for oil and gas companies to keep tearing up our land , harming natural ecosystems , and poisoning our water . The solar industry is also providing jobs , and helping to change environmental degradation . The solar market now enjoys an economically winning hand that pays off both financially and environmentally , and American taxpayers have noticed . With oil costs constantly shifting too within a rigged market , it is also great news that solar is about to get ridiculously cheap . The cost of installing solar panels on rooftops is expected to drop 60 percent , and solar energy is expected to be the cheapest source in many countries over the next 15 years , according to a new report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance . In Countries like Mexico , they are already close to producing three cent per kilowatt hour solar energy . Solar technology improvements could help the cost continue to fall , too . Just one emerging technology is the perovskite solar cell which has the potential to be just as efficient but cheaper than traditional silicon solar cells . MIT scientists have also already also developed nano-solar cells that are 1,000 times more efficient than traditional solar cells . By stacking materials that are just one molecule thick , these solar cells are 20-50 times thinner than the thinnest solar cell conventionally manufactured . If we truly can power the entire world with less than one percent of the sun in the Sahara , imagine what energy freedom awaits us .
