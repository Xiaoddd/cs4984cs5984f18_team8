Last week , the Facebook event , which was launched by Army veteran Wesley Clark Jr. and former Marine and Baltimore cop-turned-reformist , Michael A. Wood Jr. , received widespread media attention . Their event page states they have over 2,100 veterans signed up and are exploring options for a second trip . The group has a strict no weapons policy but is stocking up on body armor and protective gear like gas masks to withstand potential attacks from the heavily militarized police , who have arrested at least 400 of protesters so far . According to on-site medics , hundreds of protesters have also been injured . Last week , a 21-year-old woman was reportedly hit with a concussion grenade , leading to a severe injury that may require her arm to be amputated . With 2,100 veterans signed up to make a stand , it appears police will be forced to reconcile their aggressive behavior with the nonviolent show of veterans , who intend to march toward police on site . The group has gained substantial financial backing since word of their mission spread . In a short period of two days , the picture changed dramatically . The funds will also go toward bailing out members of the group who are arrested during their demonstration . Anti-Media spoke to one Navy veteran , Jake Bagwell , who heard about the event last week through social media and is now scheduled to head to Standing Rock , pending his request for time off from work . Anti-Media has reached out to Veterans Stand for Standing Rock to learn how they plan to respond to these demands and will update this story if they respond . Here 's our Cookie Policy .
