Veterans For Peace will continue to support this effort . As veterans , we see the connections between greed , racism , violence and environmental destruction in our own communities , and war and militarism abroad . We believe the Standing Rock action is consistent with our philosophy and approach to help build a more just , peaceful and sustainable world . They also suspended a 14-day waiting period which means that the drilling could already be starting .
