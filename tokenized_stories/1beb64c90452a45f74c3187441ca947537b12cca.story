There is much in it that I knew , and quite a bit that I vaguely remembered , and some that I had never assimilated , but to have all that information in one short text , expertly woven and explained , is a devastating indictment of American violence and its imperial hubris . The footnotes alone are more than worth the price -LRB- which is very low , especially if we compare it to a Tomahawk missile -RRB- . It is really like a mini-encyclopedia of American expansionism , but written with the verve of a political thriller , and with the murderer being chased and nailed down step by misstep . I told you many years ago how much I admired his book War Without Mercy when you recommended it to me , and this book simply adds to that admiration , with this additional comment : The Violent American Century has a chance to affect at a massive level our understanding of the world we live in , the one that America has shaped but has been unable to dominate . Still , give Donald Trump credit . Only the really , really big bombs , whether North Korean nukes or those 21,600 pounds of MOAB , truly get his attention . It was undoubtedly the awesome look of that first MOAB going off in grainy black and white on Fox News , rather than in Afghanistan , that appealed to the president . It 's brilliant . It 's genius . Call it thrilling . Call it a blast . Call it escalation . Or just call it the age of Trump . Anyway , here we are and , as so many of his critics have pointed out , the plaudits have been pouring in from all the usual media and political suspects for a president with big enough ... well , hands , to make war impressively . Call it mission creep on steroids . Institutionalizing War and Its Generals Above all , President Trump did one thing decisively . Quite the opposite . In its history , the United States has engaged in quite a remarkable range of wars and conflicts . Nonetheless , in the last 15 years , forever war has been institutionalized as a feature of everyday life in Washington , which , in turn , has been transformed into a permanent war capital . When Donald Trump won the presidency and inherited those wars and that capital , there was , in a sense , no one left in the remarkably bankrupt political universe of Washington but those generals . Anything but the norm historically , such a decision may have seemed anomalous and out of the American tradition . The previous two presidents had played the warrior regularly , donning military outfits -- in his presidential years , George W. Bush often looked like a G.I. Joe doll -- and saluting the troops , while praising them to the skies , as the American people were also trained to do . Think of Trump as a chameleon among presidents and much of this makes more sense . A Republican who had been a Democrat for significant periods of his life , he conceivably could have run for president as a more nativist version of Bernie Sanders on the Democratic ticket had the political cards been dealt just a little differently . If you want to know just where we are in an America that has been on the march toward a different sort of society and governing system for a long time now , look at him . On war , too , think of him as a chameleon . Right now , war is working for him domestically , whatever it may be doing in the actual world , so he loves it . Things go well . Praise is forthcoming . Approval ratings are heart-warming . Donald Trump got none of this . His approval ratings quickly headed for the honeymoon cellar or maybe the honeymoon fallout shelter ; the media and he went to war ; and one attempt after another to fulfill his promises -- from executive orders on deportation to repealing Obamacare and building his wall -- have come a cropper . His administration seems to be in eternal chaos , the cast of characters changing by the week or tweet , and few key secondary posts being filled . In only one area has Donald Trump experienced that promised honeymoon . Think of it as the honeymoon of the generals . So far , in other words , the generals are the only ones who have delivered for him , big-league . The last two presidents put up with permanent failing war , making the best they could of it . When the praise begins to die down , the criticism starts to rise , and questions are asked , watch out .

Great powers savaged one another . Hostilities engulfed the globe . Mobilization extended to virtually every sector of every nation . Air war , including the terror bombing of civilians , emerged as a central strategy of the victorious Anglo-American powers . The devastation was catastrophic almost everywhere , with the notable exception of the United States , which exited the strife unscathed and unmatched in power and influence . The death toll of fighting forces plus civilians worldwide was staggering . In contrast to World War II , postwar death and destruction has been comparatively small .

Part Field Notes from a Catastrophe , part 1984 , part World War Z , John Feffer 's striking new dystopian novel , takes us deep into the battered , shattered world of 2050 . The European Union has broken apart . Multiethnic great powers like Russia and China have shriveled . America 's global military footprint has virtually disappeared and the United States remains united in name only . Nationalism has proven the century 's most enduring force as ever-rising global temperatures have supercharged each-against-all competition and conflict among the now 300-plus members of an increasingly feeble United Nations . As he navigates the world of 2050 , Julian West offers a roadmap for the path we 're already on , a chronicle of impending disaster , and a faint light of hope .

The next year , she began following grievously wounded American soldiers from the moment they came off the battlefield all the way back home . Her journey proved to be nothing short of an odyssey .
