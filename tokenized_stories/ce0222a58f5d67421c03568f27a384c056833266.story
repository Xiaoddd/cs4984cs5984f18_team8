From there America 's energy resources would be shipped overseas , very likely driving up consumer and energy prices here at home . The pipeline route would require massive use of eminent domain , seizing jurisdiction over Americans ' property across several states to benefit a Canadian company and other private interests . Some of our best hunting and other public lands would also be impacted , especially from the increase in fracking and drilling that would spread across northwestern Colorado . More fracking and drilling would be harmful for air quality and put further strain on water resources . It also goes against the best available science , which supports keeping most remaining known reserves of fossil fuels in the ground . The Pacific Connector pipeline would drive more fracking and drilling on our public lands , developing America 's publicly owned energy resources for foreign export . The pipeline would require the seizure of land against property owner wishes . NO to LNG Export Stop Jordan Cove Take Action Take Action Ready to Resist Although the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has twice rejected the Jordan Cove pipeline , project boosters hope to revive it under Trump . The Pacific Connector pipeline that Jordan Cove wants to build to supply this terminal with would transport 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas supplied from Colorado 's Piceance Basin and elsewhere in the Intermountain West . This new pipeline would cross 230 miles of public and private land , creating a 95-foot permanent clearcut and crossing 400 streams and rivers .
