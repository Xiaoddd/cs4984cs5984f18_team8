One woman , resolute in a tree , has stayed 32 feet above the ground under the threat of legal action since April 1st . Public Pressure has been mounting on Governor Northam to do something about the situation . His office has deflected any responsibility onto the local law enforcement . However , starting on Saturday night , they began shining the light at the base of the tree instead . This signaled a major shift in tone from the Roanoke Police . In addition to a decrease in torture tactics , the police have relaxed the starvation techniques used on Red . She is now receiving food and water from law enforcement , who maintain that this was their plan all along . However , on Apr 13th , the PIO for Roanoke County Amy Whitaker had been contacted regarding Red . Whitaker said . Whatever the case may be , ground support is in high spirits as they feel they are winning this fight . Politicians came by the camp Monday , and Red is now a national celebrity . The crowd on the ground is a local one . Families from Bent Mt and the community come up to Red to donate supplies for the camp , talk , tell stories , play music , and relax by the fire . Children play in a nearby creek that is threatened by the MVP . The family has not always been opposed to giving up sections of their land for the public good .

They are going to resist eminent domain for private gain to the bitter end . She has been more well-behaved than her mother , and had been given a smaller perimeter from which supporters can see her and talk to her .
