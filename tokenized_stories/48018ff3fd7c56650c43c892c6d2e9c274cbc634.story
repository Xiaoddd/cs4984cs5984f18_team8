The Obama administration had rejected it . The approval reversed a 2015 decision by the Obama administration , which had blocked the project by refusing to issue a permit for the pipeline to cross the Canadian border . Environmental groups sued the Trump administration , saying its reversal broke three laws and that it failed to conduct additional , updated environmental reviews before granting approval . The Trump administration now has until March 21 to release the documents or the privilege log . The Problem of Out-of-Date Documents A few days after President Donald Trump took office , he issued an executive order to give the pipeline a green light . The project 's developer , TransCanada , renewed its permit request six days after Trump 's inauguration , on Jan. 26 , 2017 . The State Department granted the permit in March , and TransCanada has said it could begin construction in 2019 . Environmental groups contend that the Trump administration based its decision on old environmental reviews . Among other things , a drop in the price of oil and a surge in domestic production undermined the economic analysis of the old environmental impact statement . A Bid to Undermine Environmental Reviews The administration , meanwhile , is attempting to make it more difficult for environmental groups to sue under the National Environmental Policy Act -LRB- NEPA -RRB- , which requires environmental reviews of major federal actions . The current timeframe for legal challenges is six years . Environmental groups have said the infrastructure plan would gut the environmental reviews that are at the heart of bedrock environmental laws . Your inbox . Every weekend .
