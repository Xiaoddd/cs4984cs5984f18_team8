To the Editor : I support the Standing Rock Reservation and their peaceful protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline . There has been very little governmental intervention to de-escalate the tension and violence occurring over the pipeline and to peacefully resolve this conflict . This is surprising considering this is the first time since the 1800s that all the Sioux tribes are gathered in one place to support one cause . What a spectacular moment in history it would be to have the United States government join the Native American people at Standing Rock and have a peaceful resolution to this conflict . I encourage others to also show their support for the people at Standing Rock and for a resolution that benefits all people .
