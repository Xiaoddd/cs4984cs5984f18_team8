Officials fear the camp near the Cannonball River will soon flood due to warm weather and rapid snowmelt . They worry trash and debris left behind by people who have left in recent weeks might pollute the Missouri River and other nearby waterways . Ryan Hignight said . Garbage ranges from trash to building debris to human waste , according to Morton County Emergency Manager Tom Doering . The Standing Rock Sioux and others believe a pipeline leak under the Missouri River would contaminate water for millions of people . Developer Energy Transfer Partners says the pipeline is safe . The tribe has asked protesters to leave the area , and has been coordinating cleanup at the camp since late last month . Gov. Doug Burgum , State Engineer Garland Eberle and state Environmental Health Chief Dave Glatt on Tuesday issued a statement pushing for an accelerated cleanup . The camp area has seen frequent and sometimes violent clashes between protesters and police . North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum said the state could start lining up additional contractors as early as Thursday . Who would pay the cost could be decided later , he said . Doering said local authorities are hoping for a presidential disaster declaration to open up the prospect of federal aid . Burgum on Wednesday issued an evacuation order to complement the Corps deadline , though he said arresting people would be a last resort . Hignight said the Corps was still working out details about how the shutdown would be handled . The effort will be funded through the Corps budget , meaning taxpayers ultimately will foot the bill .
