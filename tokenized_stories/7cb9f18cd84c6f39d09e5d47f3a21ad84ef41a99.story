A November 2016 Standing Rock march in North Dakota . For months , Standing Rock has led a coalition in vehement opposition to the proposed pipeline , which crosses lands promised to the Great Sioux Nation under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 . For many , it is contentious and even offensive to suggest that colonialism endures in the present . In the American popular imagination , colonialism ended either when the thirteen colonies declared independence from Britain in 1776 , or when the frontier closed and open warfare against indigenous nations ceased following the massacre of more than three hundred Lakota at Wounded Knee in 1890 . Colonialism , according to these narratives , is Ancient History . But ongoing colonialism is the central injustice that the indigenous movement resists and seeks to change . If the Left is to understand and stand in solidarity with Standing Rock and the indigenous movement , it must take colonialism seriously . American colonialism is rooted in the theft of land from indigenous people . It endures in the ongoing disavowal of indigenous sovereignty . Indigenous presence must be contained , removed , and then forgotten so that the United States can continue to live on , and profit from , lands taken from indigenous people . It enables the proliferation of myths , dreams , and even utopias predicated on fantasies of free land without a prior and rightful guardian . It explains why Dakota Access was rerouted from upstream of Bismarck south to Standing Rock . It explains how , after months of unprecedented protests and visibility , Trump can claim that he received no complaints about the pipeline . This explosive truth can lead even the most radical thinkers to fatalism . Confined to the past , American colonization of indigenous people appears inevitable if regrettable . Brought into the present , colonialism seems irreversible . Algerian-style liberation is neither possible nor desirable . Americans are never leaving , nor should they . This has become their home too . But despite all the forces brought crashing down upon indigenous people , we are still here . They came for our land . They came for our resources . They came for our children . They came to destroy us , our communities , our territories , our families , our bodies , our languages , our cultures , our knowledge , our love . But yet we remain . We stand for something that is undeniably right : water that sustains life and land that gave birth to people . The stubborn unwillingness to stop fighting for what is right , to just go away , is our tradition . As long as we are here on the land of our ancestors , the men who put profit before planet and people will not and can not win . As long as we are here , colonialism has failed . The indigenous movement very nearly defeated the Dakota Access pipeline . The Obama administration , after months of unrelenting pressure , halted the pipeline and ordered an Environmental Impact Statement . With the election of Donald Trump , there was not much more that could have been done . In order to reroute or stop Dakota Access , Standing Rock needed Hillary Clinton , or even better , Bernie Sanders , to win the presidency . It was the Democratic Party leadership , not the indigenous movement , who failed . Now Standing Rock will face further repression . Earlier this month , seventy-six protesters were arrested while attempting to establish a new camp closer to pipeline construction . Last week , news emerged that the FBI is investigating three Standing Rock organizers as terrorists . Meanwhile , North Dakota legislators have introduced a bill calling on Congress to amend the Constitution to shift Indian reservations from federal to state jurisdiction . The plan would upend over a century of federal Indian policy by converting sovereign Indian land , which is often regulated and held in trust by the federal government , into private property . The indigenous movement will be fighting a battle on two fronts : not only against pipelines but also against a full-frontal assault on indigenous rights and sovereignty . Standing Rock has proven that the indigenous movement can take on the extractive industry and win . Under Trump , the indigenous struggle against colonialism and for the universal goods of equality , self-determination , and environmental justice will be more important than ever . Far from Ancient History , the indigenous movement is integral to the future of the planet and a winning left . We have seen the promise of a more just future for the first people of this land and all who share it with us .
