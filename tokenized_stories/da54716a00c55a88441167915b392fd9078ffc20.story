President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday potentially reviving the Canada-to-Texas pipeline , the subject of a multi-year saga that cast a long shadow over Canada-U.S. relations . Trump signed a series of executive orders related to infrastructure and construction , the highest profile of which involved the pipeline project that if completed would carry more than one-fifth of the oil Canada exports to the U.S. . It also encourages U.S. federal regulatory agencies to respond the opposite way the Obama administration did : quickly , and favourably . TransCanada responded with an official statement thanking President Trump .

The promise of a quick approval appeared to contradict statements from Trump and his own spokesman , both of whom said Tuesday they would seek to negotiate a better Keystone deal for U.S. taxpayers . Keystone XL would carry more than one-fifth of the oil Canada exports to the United States , taking it to the already-built southern leg that connects with major refineries on the Gulf of Mexico . The amount of Canadian oil sent to the U.S. has increased more than 60 per cent since TransCanada Corp. first applied for a permit in 2008 . Those exports have largely rolled into the U.S. on trains . In a 2015 interview , a leader of the anti-Keystone movement explained the long-term goal : sabotaging the oil industry . Bill McKibben of the group 350.org helped organize the first big national protest against the project , which had previously been a localized land-rights issue in Nebraska . The goal is to make it less efficient , less profitable to force a faster transition to clean energy . The last time around , TransCanada was so confident they literally mowed the strip where they planned to build the pipeline , before people power stopped them .
