Another disturbing detail mentioned in the report was the fact that ETP is using legal threats and lawsuits to silence critics of pipelines . In addition to these shady deals and intimidation tactics , the report also highlighted numerous problems caused by the company . Testimony from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe described how workers with ETP destroyed at least 380 sacred and cultural sites along the DAPL route . The company also hired private security firms like TigerSwan , who used excessive force and military tactics against protestors , all while operating without a license to operate in the state of North Dakota . The numbers are staggering . The website displays a map of oil pipeline spills from 2010 to present , and it is discouraging , to say the least . Clearly , the main selling point put forward by Energy Transfer Partners , and those who stand to reap billions from its construction is a lie . Put in terms of the amount of crude oil spilled , pipelines are more dangerous than rail cars or trucks . But this is not an appeal to continue relying on railroads and highways for transporting oil . The shocking data on oil spills , the threat to human health and the environment , and the assaults on the rights of landowners and Native Americans brought about by the DAPL construction point to one conclusion . Now , more than ever , we need to speed our transition away from fossil fuels and fully embrace renewable energy . The technology is there , and the free market is making great strides to make this happen . But the corporatocracy still has an enormous grip in perpetuating the oil era , as we can plainly see in the construction of DAPL and the increased oil production through fracking . The corrupt partnership of corporate behemoths and government players is keeping us mired in the era of oil , putting human and environmental health in ever greater risk with more and more pipeline construction . Winning this battle is as simple as choosing to abstain from the violent corrupt old system and participating in the new and peaceful system that hands the power back to the people . We feel that PIVX is this system . PIVX takes the control the banking elite has over money and gives it back to the people .
