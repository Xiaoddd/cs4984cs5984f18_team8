Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections : For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S. , particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election . We too were alarmed at the patterns we were , and still are , seeing . It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy , disciplined , and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before . It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time . We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century . The comments of our readers are the most vibrant , best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News . Accordingly , we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services . It is , however , important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in . Adapt and overcome . It is like using money to fight money . We better learn how to do this ; we will need this tactic in the days ahead when we fight global warming .
