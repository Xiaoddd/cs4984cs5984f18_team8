The Oglala Sioux nation and its allies have pledged that they will stop the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline by any means necessary if it encroaches on their territory . Now , members of the Sioux Nation have begun touring the United States and Canada to rally support for their pledge . The following joint statement comes from : Honor the Earth , the Oglala Sioux Nation , Owe Aku , and Protect the Sacred . They have done what is right for the land , for their people , who , from grassroots organizers like Owe Aku and Protect the Sacred have called on their leaders to stand and protect their sacred lands . And they have : KXL will NOT cross their treaty territory , which extends past the reservation boundaries . Their horses are ready . So are ours . We stand with the Lakota Nation , we stand on the side of protecting sacred water , we stand for Indigenous land-based lifeways which will NOT be corrupted by a hazardous , toxic pipeline . WE ALL NEED TO STAND WITH THEM . On Friday , January 27th , the State Department issued its Environmental Impact Statement on the Keystone XL Pipeline . 3 -RRB- This pipeline will , in fact , increase carbon emissions and cause grave and irreversible environmental harm globally . 4 -RRB- In recognition of our responsibilities to protect Mother Earth , Native peoples will not allow this pipeline to come across our treaty areas . We will defend our lives , and our mother Earth , and we need Barack Obama to do the same . Oil Change International , and others , where the night will be alight with our resolve to keep fighting . We need to show the media , big oil and the President that we , as Indigenous Peoples -LRB- especially from the Great Sioux Nation -RRB- , the entire state of Nebraska , and the tens of thousands of American citizens that have signed up to put their bodies on the line using non violent civil disobedience in every state in the lower 48 and Alaska , First Nations , and allies in Canada , are mobilized and unafraid . The statement has sparked solidarity across Native American Nations and activist communities alike . Debra White Plum of the Lakota Sioux nation is a trainer for the grassroots organization . She said that the group has been training Native activists for this moment for the past year . This training includes seminars on knowing your rights , blockading and self-defense , first aid and social media . She says that the training has brought together many geographically distant native groups , fighting towards a common goal . Politicians , she said further , have left the group with no other choice . For her and those she is training , this is not simply a matter of doing what is right for the environment , it is also about the government honoring treaties made with Indigenous Peoples . This is simply acting out of an aboriginal legal order to stand up for what is right .
