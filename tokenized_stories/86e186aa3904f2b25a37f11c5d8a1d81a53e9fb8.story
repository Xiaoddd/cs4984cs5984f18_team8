An estimated 63,000 gallons of crude oil spilled into the river from a pipeline . The breach occurred on a Sunoco Logistics Partners LP pipeline in the area of Gamble Township , around 100 miles -LRB- 160 kms -RRB- north of Harrisburg , according to state authorities , who estimated the spill at about 1,300 barrels -LRB- 55,000 gallons -RRB- . The gasoline leaked into Wallis Run , a tributary of the Loyalsock Creek as a result of floods and landslides during heavy rainfall on Thursday night , the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection -LRB- DEP -RRB- said in a statement . The Loyalsock Creek runs into the West Branch Susquehanna River around 15 miles -LRB- 24 kms -RRB- south of where where the spill occurred . Pennsylvania environmental officials said that since rain is predicted to continue , it could be later on Friday night or Saturday before the water recedes and the break area on the pipeline can be found . Pipelines : The Worst Way to Move Oil , Except For All the Rest A drop in pressure on the eight-inch pipeline was detected by the Sunoco Logistics Control Center shortly after 3 a.m. on Friday . The pipeline was shut down and emergency response personnel dispatched to the scene , Sunoco Logistics said . Pennsylvania American Water said in a Facebook post it would notify customers when its water conservation notice is lifted . The spill came as the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and environmental activists protest against construction of a 1,100-mile -LRB- 1,886-km -RRB- North Dakota oil pipeline Sunoco will operate , saying it threatens water supply and sacred sites . Sunoco Logistics spills crude more often than any of its competitors with more than 200 leaks since 2010 , according to a Reuters analysis of government data .
