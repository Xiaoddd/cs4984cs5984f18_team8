He said that anywhere in the world , when you have an issue that involves the use of land , occupied , owned , or as the sole territory of indigenous people , that those indigenous people should have the final say in anything that happens on that land . The indigenous people in this case are the Sioux tribes of the Dakotas trying to protect their sacred land , their sacred waters , their sacred burial sites from the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline , which is a completely unnecessary and poorly executed oil pipeline . He also went on to say , according to EcoWatch , that destruction of the environment is a sin . If you go through the Christian Bible , there are numerous passages in there that talk about protecting the Earth . Any destruction that we do upon it is an affront to God . When we have a sitting Pope coming out and attacking , well , not necessarily attacking , but discussing the disgustingness of United States income inequality , United States environmental destruction , the complete disregard for indigenous people , maybe we need to listen to him on these couple issues . Oh , God , no . But on these issues , maybe we could listen , because we do have an ally over there in the Vatican . He is standing up for people .
