Karl Mayo , 32 , and Sen Holiday , 26 , who had safety ropes and climbing gear , dangled from the rafters on the stadium 's east side throughout the Vikings ' 38-10 win . Play was not interrupted , and Minneapolis police spokesman Corey Schmidt said a Hennepin County Medical Center doctor found both protesters to be medically sound after hanging from the rafters for most of the game . No one was harmed as a result of the incident , Schmidt said . Mayo and Holiday were arrested and booked for misdemeanor trespass and burglary charges , police said in a statement . Both were released from custody at the Hennepin County Jail Monday . A 27-year-old woman has also been accused of burglary and obstructing legal process . Police have n't released details of her role in the incident . The action was a protest urging U.S. Bank -LRB- whose name is on the stadium -RRB- to withdraw a credit line from Energy Transfer Partners , the company that is responsible for the Dakota Access Pipeline . The two protesters were suspended in the air above Section 120 and one protester in a No. 4 Brett Favre Vikings jersey -- Mayo -- shimmied down the banner . Six rows of fans were cleared below the protesters . Rescue workers used rappelling gear to navigate the truss above the stadium , where they eventually convinced the protesters to climb down a ladder connected to the truss . The protestors told police negotiators they wanted the media present as they descended from the rafters . They were not made available to reporters . Mayo and Holiday climbed down to a round of boos from fans who remained in the stadium to see how the episode would play out . Members of the media were sent a statement saying the action was a protest urging U.S. Bank -LRB- whose name is on the stadium -RRB- to withdraw a credit line from Energy Transfer Partners , the company that is responsible for the Dakota Access Pipeline . The project is an underground pipeline for oil that crosses through four states , but protesters argue that it could damage the environment and poison the water in neighboring areas . U.S. Bank had no comment . Schmidt referred questions to stadium security about how the protesters got a 40-by-10-foot banner and climbing gear into the stadium , which will host Super Bowl LII after the 2017 season .
