FILE PHOTO : Neil Chatterjee , chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , answers questions during a Reuters interview in Washington , U.S. , November 15 , 2017 . Some recent approvals of natural gas pipelines , such as the Atlantic Coast Pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina , have taken two years or more . Chatterjee said he hoped a timeline of two-plus years would not become the new industry norm . He did not identify any specific green groups , but the Sierra Club and 350.org both have campaigns to reject pipelines filled with gas from hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , projects . The groups are fighting development of fossil fuels including oil , coal and fracked natural gas , because they say the production slows the transition to cleaner sources , like wind and solar power , and the conservation and storage of energy . The Trump administration is trying to boost output of the fuels to increase jobs in the industry and sell energy exports to allies . The lawyers with green groups exert pressure on the FERC review processes using legal strategies on federal endangered species , clean water and environmental review laws , said Chatterjee , a Republican . Ultimately , lengthier approvals mean projects are better able to withstand legal challenge , he added . As energy companies seek to transport gas to cities and to a growing number of liquefied natural gas operations for export , the approval of pipelines will top the agenda next year for FERC .
