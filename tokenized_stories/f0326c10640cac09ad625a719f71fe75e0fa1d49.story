The Cheyenne River tribe , who are co-litigants in a lawsuit against the pipeline , sharply rebuked the plan , citing that the area on which the targeted camps lie are Sioux territory per the 1851 Fort Laramie treaty signed by the Sioux and the US federal government . However , groups of military veterans from around the US are set to arrive at the camps to protect protestors on December 4th , a day before the eviction notice takes effect . This could make for a truly explosive confrontation between the Americans who have chosen to fight for their beliefs and those who have chosen to back the will of the state and corporations .
