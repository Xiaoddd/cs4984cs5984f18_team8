In a video statement Dave Archambault thanked the thousands of Native American and environmental activists who travelled to North Dakota to help the tribe fight back against the pipeline , which they feared would contaminate their water source and destroy sacred sites . Xhopakelxhit , who is Nuu Chah Nulth , Coast Salish , and Cree , said that opinions in the camp were divided about what to do next , with some wanting to stay and fight and others wanting to respect the wishes of the tribal leadership . Xhopakelxhit also criticized the idea that rerouting the pipeline constituted a victory . Howaste Wakiya , an enrolled member of the coastal band of the Chumash Nation , rejected the idea that Archambault could direct the movement , which has garnered support from hundreds of indigenous tribes , as well as climate change activists , celebrities , and , this week , hundreds of US veterans . However individual activists choose to proceed , few will be leaving immediately . The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning on Monday for much of the state . Several inches of snow and wind gusts of up to 50mph were predicted through Tuesday evening .
