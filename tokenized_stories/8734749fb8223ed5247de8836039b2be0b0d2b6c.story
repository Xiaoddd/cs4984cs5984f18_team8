I joined the Sioux Nation -LRB- my second visit -RRB- responding to a call for military veterans to come stand with them . It was to be an incredible collection of experiences during my stay in the camp . I met people from Scotland , France , Germany , Spain , Japan - from Oregon , California , Florida , Maine and many states in between . The World is not only watching Standing Rock , they are coming to Standing Rock . I also learned something I 've not seen reported - A Sioux child has been born in the camp . I had the incredible opportunity to greet the mother and child as they participated in the daily Water Ceremony . The Tribal Matriarch and overseeing Tribal Elder , only a few feet from me , were visibly moved in joy and gladness at the sight of this precious pair . It was again made very clear on this visit - The Sioux do not condone nor promote any aggressive actions . None . Theirs ' is a peaceful movement . So if you should feel so inclined , please add your prayers to theirs .
