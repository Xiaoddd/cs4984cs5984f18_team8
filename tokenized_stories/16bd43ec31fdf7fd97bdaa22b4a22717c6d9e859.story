Incidents like this do little to inspire confidence that the plan would be thwarted . weepingjebus says : January 1 , 2017 at 2:54 pm Yes , why would anyone in Minnesota need gas or heating oil . They were mad the Redskins were not in MIN so they could all protest again . It must be the raw meat and living with women that dont shave . gscott104 says : January 1 , 2017 at 3:08 pm I work for the Panthers , my wife was with me that game last year with the protestors . On the way in , with media credentials , we were frisked and wanded twice , and my wife had to give up an umbrella she was carrying . When we saw those protestors rappelling over the side right in front of us , we knew it was an inside job . Same thing here .

Lots of prep for these arena games . shaggytoodle says : January 1 , 2017 at 3:58 pm Maybe the league needs to stop letting fans bring in signs then . If this is a cause for concern .

All rogue scholars for sure . whatjusthapped says : January 1 , 2017 at 8:11 pm Rumor has it the banner was hidden inside the trophy case so of course , nobody saw it because everyone already knows , there is nothing to see there . strummer174 says : January 1 , 2017 at 9:46 pm Whatever you think of their message , you have to admire their commitment . stellarperformance says : January 2 , 2017 at 10:27 am uncommon1 says : Jan 1 , 2017 7:30 PM Minnesota also has the highest disparity between whites and non-whites when it comes to accepting Government assistance . carlpanzramwasatypicalminnesotan says : January 2 , 2017 at 10:48 am Minnesota . The land of fewer lakes than Wisconsin . And fewer championships . And fewer teeth per person . And fewer brain cells per person .
