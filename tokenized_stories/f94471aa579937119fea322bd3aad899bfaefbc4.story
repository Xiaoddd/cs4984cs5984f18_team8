mom is originally from here , from Cannon Ball . When the DAPL thing started , they asked for women and children to be there . The kids were there ; they did n't understand what was going on at the time , so now we 've told them . We 've been here since then . We 'll be going home soon . We 'll probably leave in maybe the next week or two . What American greed does to people , does to my reservation . But just being here , the experience , meeting everyone , it 's nice to know that there are a lot of people to support us , to support Standing Rock . that 's what I was saying , I 'm so happy . I 'm Navajo from Arizona . two months . What really drove me here was to do something that 's a passion , because I 've been protecting the water in Arizona , trying to protect my local rivers , but that really did n't work out . It got polluted . I just do n't wan na see another oil spill happen because you ca n't clean oil . first of all , I never liked the media . You feel everybody 's energy , you feel everybody 's presence here . It 's very heartwarming cause out in the streets , when I walk around , people do n't even say hello or smile , but here it 's like that all the time . I do n't know ; it 's really touching because I never was a people person , but now I 'm realizing , I do n't know , this is home . And second , I do n't agree with Trump being in office . been here for ten days now . Where I come from in California , our addiction to fossil fuels affects us physically and psychologically . The day-to-day habitual usage of ` car living ' and ` sitting in traffic ' has isolated our people and hinders our community . So , I spent a couple of months not using fossil fuel transportation and traveled a couple hundred miles through California . I only got in a car to come here . At least , I hope we 'll stop it soon . Our consumerist attitude hurts our souls more than we even realize . Many of us do n't choose to acknowledge the fact that we are constantly at war for our resources . We need to realize that the best things in life are free : sunrises , clean water , clean air . So , I would like to let the American public know that if they spent less time driving , more time walking ; less time consuming , more time repairing the things that they have , that they would be happier and healthier . I think we are on the brink of this realization . I 've seen the pictures of my ancestors . been here about two weeks . I 'll only be here a couple more days . There are many leaders here . I think the media is n't picking up that the matriarchs are very powerful in their message . They 're having to fight through the patriarchal civilization , society , even within the Lakota nation , to get the message out . We have to return to the matriarchy , and if you want to know the new age , this is the Age of Aquarius . And stand up for yourselves . You 're standing up for my child and I really appreciate that . I got here in early September . I was here before , I had my mother with me , and I was doing it for her and for my daughter . My daughter 's nine , my mother 's 74 . I 'm here and taking care of my kid . I have to support myself and my daughter and that 's pretty much the women 's role here . I ca n't imagine the women with five kids , there 's a woman here with six boys and a husband . first trip here was from September 9 to 11 . I came just for a short visit . After that I could n't stop thinking about it . So about a month later I came back for a week . After that second visit , going home , again , I could n't stop thinking about it . I just jumped in the car and came right back . We 've been here for a week this time . Men and women are so different from each other , and so everyone has a separate , but just as valuable , role in this society 's way of being . necessary . Our culture is not a trend . It 's very real wisdom about how to live on this land and I really do feel like the knowledge of how we , as a society , move forward , remains with the indigenous people . It 's not just some spiritual mumbo-jumbo . All living beings need this in their life . We all need to know , we are all pure and indigenous , our ancestors live and thrive within us . But mainly there needs to be clarity about what the issue is . Some people do n't understand that the treaty , the Fort Laramie Treaty , granting the right to all of this land that we see from far beyond where the burned land is over there . This movement , in part , is to restore the relationship of the indigenous people to our land and to our water . From personal testimonies heard , it took the fire department eight hours to respond . I was here that first weekend that people were arrested . Police serve the people , so police should be protecting the water protectors . I do n't know , I thought it was a really brilliant perspective for a veteran to be here . This is not only an area concern for the people around here , but it should be a concern for everybody who lives in the US . We are united through the American Indian movement . She 's been here in honor of her mom , who passed away , I believe in July . She passed away from cancer , so Red Fawn decided that she wanted to come up here and fight in honor of her mother , so she 's been pretty active and well-known through the community here . She 's very loving , caring , and speaks her mind , and will always try to stand up for what 's right . She was at the front line and she was one of the first Oglala 's to be arrested . They knew who she was , especially because she has a strong voice and is always talking to the police officers . I do n't know exactly what happened , but I know that she was singled out , they followed her , some officers , and they beat her . You can see pictures of her ; her face is beat up . Then the police said that they heard shots fired to cover it up . There 's a line , and if you do n't cross the line , you wo n't be arrested . If you crossed the line , you knew you were going to be arrested . It was nonviolent , completely nonviolent . This time she was up there as a medic , she 's walking away from the line , she 's retreating and then they go and they grab her . Six officers start beating her , and then they release the rubber bullets . She was shot close range , three to six times . So , I do n't know if they were saying that they found a gun on her to justify how badly her face was beaten . September I was out here for about a week . I did n't feel complete when I left . I felt like I had left a huge part of me here . I felt that I needed to come back to find it and refigure everything out . Serrano . We call it Yuhaviatam in California . I wish that people would actually care about it . I wish that people would see the colonization that 's happening in front of them , the deprivation of people 's rights . wish that more people would come , more people that could help . We need workers here . A lot of people are calling it Woodstock , and it 's not a Woodstock , it 's not a place where we can all go have our own personal downtime . Let 's bring hands and get this job done . It was beautiful . My tribe is also at risk , we are the brother tribe , bordering the Standing Rock Sioux on our north side . Reservation life is hopeless with a lack of opportunity . Messed up roads , long miles in-between communities with little or no services . Federal funds are limited , with so many strings attached , we can hardly use the money . There is so much death from suicide , kidney failure , cancer . But we survive . We make the best of it . We cling to our culture . Our language is dying but we are protecting it . Our environment is threatened by carcinogenic contamination from mercury , arsenic , and other chemicals used in oil pipelines , gold extraction . All of this is our environment , but we live on . So , I 'm Chumash from California , the central southern coast . I live in Oakland right now , and for the last year I 've been working with the Indigenous Peoples Power Project -LRB- IP3 -RRB- , and it 's really picked up for this , obviously . So , what I 'm doing out here is just supporting and helping , also training in nonviolent direct action . For every day that is n't an action day , we have training at 2 pm . But even beyond that , I think there 's a larger goal . There 's a lot of healing that needs to happen in Indian Country and I think that this is all part of it . All of these nations coming together , standing up together , saying we are powerful , and we 've been here , and we 've resisted , and we survived , and we 're still surviving , and we 're very much alive , we 're not a myth . You can come in from one side of the Oceti Sakowin Camp , but the other side is blocked off , and around a hill that always looked to lead nowhere . On one side is the Oceti Sakowin Camp , the kids , the people , and on the other side is a fleet of police , the two separated by a short bridge and a barricade of old burnt car parts . Mary spoke openly to the group of journalists , reporters , children , and family , leading us closer and closer to the barricade . Finally stopping at the bridge that set us a few 100 feet back from the wall of cars , she spoke with determination . Our spirits come from the oneness . So it 's a testimony that you see every color as you turn your head , and what even makes it more enriching is that you 're young . It 's no longer the elders or somebody that has to have a high-stature age category to stand up for us . You carry the water and the water has memory . You have their DNA . So when you feel alone , you 're not . When you feel weak , you get this awakening of your ancestors in you that says you 're not alone . We have survived since the beginning of time and we 're gon na continue that survival . So you can keep those future generations whispering their names from years before . We will prevail . The woman looked at me and told me that his story needed to be heard . Fifteen minutes later , he passed away . Today is his birthday . He 's four years old today . Right now , it 's kind of a hard time , but I want to do that to honor him . I love my nephews and nieces with all of my heart . I love my family with all my heart . I 'm here to fight for them and their future . I want them to have clean water . So if I have to die during the fight , so be it , because I 'd die for my nephews and nieces , my grandchildren , and all our future generations ahead . I 'd die for them . I 'm ready to meet my nephew . my god , they 're amazing . It 's not just this movement , but they wan na move forward with things after this movement , to help continue to make this place sacred . Not even this specific place , but Planet Earth , Mother Earth . They 're working hard to find unity . It 's amazing because they 're the ones leading these peaceful protecting marches , going up to the front lines , offering the officers blessed and sacred water , just as a gift of kindness . mom is originally from here , from Cannon Ball .

We 'll probably leave in maybe the next week or two . We ca n't stay for winter ; we 're not really equipped to stay for the winters here in North Dakota . Yeah , we 've just been in a tent the whole time , and this is fourth tent we 've been in . The wind is the worst in North Dakota . I just think it 's wrong , you know , what they 're doing . What American greed does to people , does to my reservation . But just being here , the experience , meeting everyone , it 's nice to know that there are a lot of people to support us , to support Standing Rock . I feel like I 'm really proud that we were the last nation , and the first to bring all these people back together . That 's beautiful . So , that 's what I was saying , I 'm so happy . I 'm glad to be from Standing Rock . My name is Frankie Tso Junior . I 'm Navajo from Arizona . My native name is Grass Buffalo . About two months . What really drove me here was to do something that 's a passion , because I 've been protecting the water in Arizona , trying to protect my local rivers , but that really did n't work out . It got polluted . I just do n't wan na see another oil spill happen because you ca n't clean oil . Well , first of all , I never liked the media . But now I 'm starting to realize that there 's good media , like you guys , because you guys are getting the right word out , instead of them saying that we 're a bunch of protesting terrorists on our own land . That 's just stupid . But the first thing I wan na say , is that you have to come here and see for yourself . You feel everybody 's energy , you feel everybody 's presence here . It 's very heartwarming cause out in the streets , when I walk around , people do n't even say hello or smile , but here it 's like that all the time . I do n't know ; it 's really touching because I never was a people person , but now I 'm realizing , I do n't know , this is home . Yeah , exactly . First of all , I do n't agree with Trump being in office . And second , I do n't agree with Trump being in office . And third , I do n't agree with Trump being in office . I 've been here for ten days now . Where I come from in California , our addiction to fossil fuels affects us physically and psychologically . The day-to-day habitual usage of ` car living ' and ` sitting in traffic ' has isolated our people and hinders our community . So , I spent a couple of months not using fossil fuel transportation and traveled a couple hundred miles through California . I only got in a car to come here . I came out of frustration of the injustices that our Native American friends suffer . Well , a lot of people like to say , ` I 'll be here through the whole winter , ' and there 's a power in that statement , but I prefer to say that I 'll be gone next week , because I think that we are gon na stop this thing soon . At least , I hope we 'll stop it soon . Hopefully I 'll be able to leave with our mission complete in the next couple of days . I think they should be aware that so many of the products that we use are coming from dirty sources . Our consumerist attitude hurts our souls more than we even realize . Many of us do n't choose to acknowledge the fact that we are constantly at war for our resources . We need to realize that the best things in life are free : sunrises , clean water , clean air . So , I would like to let the American public know that if they spent less time driving , more time walking ; less time consuming , more time repairing the things that they have , that they would be happier and healthier . I think we are on the brink of this realization . I have three different tribes ; I 'm also very much European . I 've seen the pictures of my ancestors . There was a lot of shame , that information is n't right there for me because it was shamed . I 've been here about two weeks . I 'll only be here a couple more days . I 'm with a non-profit out of California and we 've been funnelling supplies and money into here since late August . There 's a lot of confusion here . There are many leaders here . I think the media is n't picking up that the matriarchs are very powerful in their message . They 're having to fight through the patriarchal civilization , society , even within the Lakota nation , to get the message out . We have to return to the matriarchy , and if you want to know the new age , this is the Age of Aquarius . Women have to start right at home . And men need to support that . Good men will follow great women . And stand up for yourselves . You 're standing up for my child and I really appreciate that . I 'm a member of the Oglala tribe . I got here in early September . I plan on staying until we defeat the black snake . When I was here before , I had my mother with me , and I was doing it for her and for my daughter . My daughter 's nine , my mother 's 74 . They named it the black snake because there was a prophecy about this , and they talked about it , that we 're going to have to a face a black snake someday . This was a long time ago , a hundred years ago , I forget who said it , but there was more than one Indian who prophezied this . It 's a lot to take on . I 'm here and taking care of my kid . I have to support myself and my daughter and that 's pretty much the women 's role here . I ca n't imagine the women with five kids , there 's a woman here with six boys and a husband . So she has a man , and all her boys , and then she 's running around being on the front line , then we have to cook , we have to take care of camp , a lot of us are cutting wood . My first trip here was from September 9 to 11 . I came just for a short visit . After that I could n't stop thinking about it . So about a month later I came back for a week . After that second visit , going home , again , I could n't stop thinking about it . I just jumped in the car and came right back . We 've been here for a week this time . Yeah , Jemez Pueblo . My experience has very much been like womanhood , motherhood , understanding our roles in society as women . Men and women are so different from each other , and so everyone has a separate , but just as valuable , role in this society 's way of being . So that balance of the masculine and feminine is something that I 've begun to understand . Both the men and the women play very strong roles , are working all day in different ways . Both of these forces are needed . And necessary . When you live with each other and are working as a community to make food every day and to stay warm together every night , you know , you appreciate people , even the smallest job that anyone does . Our culture is not a novelty . Right , right , it 's not a trend . Our culture is not a trend . It 's very real wisdom about how to live on this land and I really do feel like the knowledge of how we , as a society , move forward , remains with the indigenous people . It 's not just some spiritual mumbo-jumbo . The transition to a more sustainable future starts here and it starts with looking back and paying attention to the indigenous knowledge and traditions . My DNA resides in the Navajo and Cherokee bloodline . I arrived at my camp the beginning of September , planning to visit a couple of days , but found myself staying since . The people and frequency here is euphoric and grounding . All living beings need this in their life . We all need to know , we are all pure and indigenous , our ancestors live and thrive within us . Every one of us . Arrow Woman : The need for treaties to be honored . Jacqueline : I just wan na make sure that my grandkids and my grandkids 's grandkids , as well as everybody else , have the right to clean water . A lot of media reports focus on making it look violent . Arrow Woman : The media are coming out with a lot of controversial things . But mainly there needs to be clarity about what the issue is . Some people do n't understand that the treaty , the Fort Laramie Treaty , granting the right to all of this land that we see from far beyond where the burned land is over there . This movement , in part , is to restore the relationship of the indigenous people to our land and to our water . I just want people to be informed and know that this is a human rights issue , not just an indigenous rights issue . Jacqueline : You also have environmental racism because this was originally meant to go through north of Bismarck and because of the community 's outrage on that , they rerouted it to come through and impact our drinking water . There 's so many different things happening : racism , environmental racism , mistreatment of indigenous people . Arrow Woman : We should explain what we were talking about where they bulldozed the burial sites . Jacqueline : It was a Friday night . They came in and they were n't digging , they just bulldozed , they just leveled the ground like five miles wide . Arrow Woman : So , that 's why there are reports that there 's no evidence of sacred sites . My husband is a firefighter in Denver , and I told him that and he said that 's complete neglect , even for a rural community , it 's absolutely unbelievable . From personal testimonies heard , it took the fire department eight hours to respond . The fire could have easily crossed over the road and into the camp , where hundreds of people are staying . I was speaking to someone who actually called the fire department . He had the times written down that he called . He said he called about midnight , they did n't respond till 8 am . Yes . It 's disgusting . Arrow Woman : It 's hard to believe that with all of the drones and all of the helicopters we see above us right now , with all of their surveillance , it 's hard to believe that they did n't catch the description of that man who was driving , whatever vehicle he was in , or his license plate . Especially with all the police around . Arrow Woman : From my own personal experience , I have not seen any water protectors act in aggression or violence . But of course , there 's a concern that a person who is pro-DAPL has infiltrated and caused some of those aggressive situations . Jacqueline : I was here that first weekend that people were arrested . There 's a video of her getting arrested , so she 's just standing there and the cops are in full-militarized gear and this is what the tone of the ` protests ' were . Arrow Woman : Also , I actually had a really great conversation with a US veteran of 20 years this morning , and he says he ca n't afford to be arrested , but when he goes on the front lines , if he does see a crime happen from police officers doing something wrong to civilians , he will intercede and stop it because he feels he 's still in service . Police serve the people , so police should be protecting the water protectors . I do n't know , I thought it was a really brilliant perspective for a veteran to be here . He could lose his benefits if he 's arrested . I 'm so sorry , for what is happening here . Jacqueline : This is not only an area concern for the people around here , but it should be a concern for everybody who lives in the US . But it is good to know that we have national support from different areas of the world . For context , I stopped recording , but then a woman who originally did not choose to participate in the conversation asked if I 'd heard about Red Fawn . I 've seen a lot about her . I wanted to ask someone , I just did n't know if it was sensitive . We are united through the American Indian movement . She 's been here in honor of her mom , who passed away , I believe in July . She passed away from cancer , so Red Fawn decided that she wanted to come up here and fight in honor of her mother , so she 's been pretty active and well-known through the community here . She 's very loving , caring , and speaks her mind , and will always try to stand up for what 's right . She was at the front line and she was one of the first Oglala 's to be arrested . Arrow Woman : Law enforcement . Jacqueline : They manhandled her and arrested her , so that was the second time . They knew who she was , especially because she has a strong voice and is always talking to the police officers . I do n't know exactly what happened , but I know that she was singled out , they followed her , some officers , and they beat her . You can see pictures of her ; her face is beat up . Then the police said that they heard shots fired to cover it up . They took the opportunity to target her . Anonymous : There 's a line , and if you do n't cross the line , you wo n't be arrested . If you crossed the line , you knew you were going to be arrested . It was nonviolent , completely nonviolent . This time she was up there as a medic , she 's walking away from the line , she 's retreating and then they go and they grab her . Six officers start beating her , and then they release the rubber bullets . She was shot close range , three to six times . So , I do n't know if they were saying that they found a gun on her to justify how badly her face was beaten . It just kind of seems like they 're using her now to make inaccurate media reports . Arrow Woman : They needed that story ; it was for themselves . Somewhere between a week and two weeks ago . It 's my second trip out here . In September I was out here for about a week . I did n't feel complete when I left . I felt like I had left a huge part of me here . I felt that I needed to come back to find it and refigure everything out . I could n't just leave without it having been seen it through , it 's like unfinished business . The time I spent here was really peaceful , but when I got back to Portland I heard that one of the camps got raided , it hit me really hard . So I just kind of figured everything out on my end , closed the lease on my house , moved all my stuff into storage , and just came out here and brought my dog . Yeah , I have some cousins that came in , just today . I 'm Serrano . We call it Yuhaviatam in California . My sister 's gon na be here next weekend , and the cousins , we 'll be a pretty big family out here . You know , I just wish that it would be covered properly . I wish that people would actually care about it . I wish that people would see the colonization that 's happening in front of them , the deprivation of people 's rights . I wish that we can all kind of see that and have some sort of collective care for it and we do n't have that . Some sort of humanity . Some sort , any sort . I wish that more people would come , more people that could help . We need workers here . A lot of people are calling it Woodstock , and it 's not a Woodstock , it 's not a place where we can all go have our own personal downtime . Let 's bring hands and get this job done . Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe . I think it was back in July , mid-summer . It was beautiful . The night sky was amazing . I was very happy to see so many tribes come together for one cause , to save Mother Earth and our water source . My tribe is also at risk , we are the brother tribe , bordering the Standing Rock Sioux on our north side . Our water intake is only 70 miles down the lake . That treaties are a contract between the US and the Sioux Nation . The Dakota Access Pipeline encroached about 23 miles into our treaty lands north of the Standing Rock reservation . Reservation life is hopeless with a lack of opportunity . Messed up roads , long miles in-between communities with little or no services . Federal funds are limited , with so many strings attached , we can hardly use the money . There is so much death from suicide , kidney failure , cancer . But we survive . We make the best of it . We cling to our culture . Our language is dying but we are protecting it . Our environment is threatened by carcinogenic contamination from mercury , arsenic , and other chemicals used in oil pipelines , gold extraction . All of this is our environment , but we live on . We must . It references a time when the United States government attempted to assimilate Native Americans into western schooling by stripping them of their culture , languages , and indigenous education . Just over a week ago . I 'll be here for another week or two . Sure . So , I 'm Chumash from California , the central southern coast . I live in Oakland right now , and for the last year I 've been working with the Indigenous Peoples Power Project -LRB- IP3 -RRB- , and it 's really picked up for this , obviously . So , what I 'm doing out here is just supporting and helping , also training in nonviolent direct action . For every day that is n't an action day , we have training at 2 pm . That 's basically for everyone who 's just showing up at camp to get an orientation so that they can go out on the line as water protectors . That this is all about stopping the pipeline . But even beyond that , I think there 's a larger goal . There 's a lot of healing that needs to happen in Indian Country and I think that this is all part of it . All of these nations coming together , standing up together , saying we are powerful , and we 've been here , and we 've resisted , and we survived , and we 're still surviving , and we 're very much alive , we 're not a myth . The unity and power from this camp is so amazing and important . Mary Lyons We had heard that there were buffalo crossing the road , which is what drew us to the site in the first place . You can come in from one side of the Oceti Sakowin Camp , but the other side is blocked off , and around a hill that always looked to lead nowhere . On one side is the Oceti Sakowin Camp , the kids , the people , and on the other side is a fleet of police , the two separated by a short bridge and a barricade of old burnt car parts . Mary spoke openly to the group of journalists , reporters , children , and family , leading us closer and closer to the barricade . Finally stopping at the bridge that set us a few 100 feet back from the wall of cars , she spoke with determination . As she spoke , two men poured sacred water onto the hill and a cop used a mirror to reflect light on the ceremony . Our spirits do not have boundaries . Our spirits come from the oneness . So it 's a testimony that you see every color as you turn your head , and what even makes it more enriching is that you 're young . It 's no longer the elders or somebody that has to have a high-stature age category to stand up for us . We smile upon you because your ancestors are within you . You carry the water and the water has memory . You have their DNA . So when you feel alone , you 're not . When you feel weak , you get this awakening of your ancestors in you that says you 're not alone . We have survived since the beginning of time and we 're gon na continue that survival . So you can keep those future generations whispering their names from years before . We will prevail . Water is life . Man Who Sang For context , we were interviewing someone when two people came over . The woman looked at me and told me that his story needed to be heard . At the Fort Thompson Pow Wow . Fifteen minutes later , he passed away . He died in my brother 's arms . I 'm so sorry . If he was alive today , he would be here with me right now . Today is his birthday . He 's four years old today . Right now , it 's kind of a hard time , but I want to do that to honor him . I wan na sing two songs : The one we made , and then one for his birthday . I think that 's beautiful , thank you . Right now , it 's how I feel . I love my nephews and nieces with all of my heart . I love my family with all my heart . I 'm here to fight for them and their future . I want them to have clean water . So if I have to die during the fight , so be it , because I 'd die for my nephews and nieces , my grandchildren , and all our future generations ahead . I 'd die for them . I 'm ready to meet my nephew . Whenever that comes , I 'll still be fighting for our future generations . Allison Dew , 18 We found you with the youth council . Yes . Oh my god , they 're amazing . It 's not just this movement , but they wan na move forward with things after this movement , to help continue to make this place sacred . Not even this specific place , but Planet Earth , Mother Earth . They 're working hard to find unity . It 's amazing because they 're the ones leading these peaceful protecting marches , going up to the front lines , offering the officers blessed and sacred water , just as a gift of kindness . It 's really crazy to me , because this group of people are really just trying to change the world , and that 's exactly what they 're doing . Everyone that we 've talked to around the camp , who 's older , has given so much praise to the youth council . It 's amazing ; they lead so much here . It 's really insane .
