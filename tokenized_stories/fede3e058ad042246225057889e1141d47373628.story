With the curtain lifted , suburban life looks bitter and soulless . TWITTER On Aug. 7 , 2005 , Showtime unveiled Jenji Kohan 's Weeds , starring Mary-Louise Parker . The dramedy went on to run for eight seasons on the premium cabler . The Hollywood Reporter 's original review of the first episode is below : Last fall , Desperate Housewives became the most recent TV series to establish that not everything is what it seems when you peer behind the safely smug facade of middle-class suburbia . Now along comes Weeds with a different variation on that theme , one that is bleaker , less comedic and far less hopeful . Truth is , most characters in Weeds are more desperate than any of the Wisteria Lane wives ever thought of becoming , and not without good reason . Gifted actress Mary-Louise Parker stars as Nancy Botwin , who might have led the only idyllic existence in suburban Agrestic , at least while her husband was alive . When the series opens , though , Nancy is newly widowed , her husband the victim of a heart attack while jogging . To keep the mortgage paid and the Range Rover operating , Nancy began selling marijuana to friends and neighbors . Her new career is no secret to her accountant , Doug Wilson -LRB- Kevin Nealon -RRB- , a city councilman and one of many clients , but she somehow has managed to keep her two sons and her best friend , neurotic PTA president Celia Hodes , from finding out . Hodes , wonderfully portrayed by Elizabeth Perkins , is one of many shallow , frightened and hypocritical residents of Agrestic . Indeed , the most level-headed , straight-talking and practical character in the series is Heylia James -LRB- Tonye Patano -RRB- , the matriarch of the black , urban family from which Nancy buys her inventory . Nancy 's friend , Celia , has a teen daughter who is promiscuous and a younger daughter who commits the even greater sin of being overweight . Her husband is having an affair with the tennis instructor . Doug 's son is a rival marijuana dealer . Even Nancy 's kids spend most of their time tormented by their situations . Whereas the Desperate Housewives characters have fairly clear ideas of the ideal life to which they aspire , the residents of Agrestic just hope to keep the lids on their secrets for one more day . Good fortune and joy elude this community almost as if prohibited by municipal ordinance . Showtime is pitching Weeds as a comedy , and though it does have some darkly humorous moments , the overwhelming theme is a struggle for survival . As part of a new scheduling strategy , Weeds also can be seen at 10 and 10:30 p.m. Mondays , Wednesdays and Fridays and , starting Aug. 14 , at 10:30 p.m. Sundays .
