Oh , before America began to sing , I sung her to sleep , held her cradleboard , wept her into day . My song gave her creation , prepared her delivery , held her severed cord beautifully beaded . My song helped her stand , held her hand for first steps , nourished her very being , fed her , placed her three sisters strong . For the subsequent hundreds of years , Indian people , and the wrongs done to our contributions and us , have been forsaken . On Thanksgiving Day at noon , as they have for the past 46 years , Native Americans whose heritage lies in the band of Indians called Wampanoag will gather on Cole 's Hill in Plymouth , Massachusetts , to commemorate a National Day of Mourning . We Are Not Conquered . It is a message that lives in the hearts and minds of indigenous people the world around : We are still here . Six hundred Pequots were destroyed after laying down their weapons and accepting Christianity . This was nothing to be thankful for . In 1621 , the Wampanoag amassed the food to help the Pilgrims . Most Americans know something of the true history by now and perhaps not everyone cares . After all , there is a virtue in gathering with family and friends one day a year to eat a lot and share company , if you remove the historic significance . Those who do care have been vocal about supporting the fight for clean water preservation at Standing Rock , North Dakota , an opposition by water protectors , Native Americas and non-Native people , that has waged on for seven months . Last Sunday night it grew still worse when 400 people were teargassed and sprayed with freezing water from powerful hoses . Still , it can be damaging to share the realities of a genocidal story with young children . Instead , for each of the past two years , in coincidence with these school lessons and plays , I have donned my tribal regalia , as have my school-age children . I visit their classrooms and share elements of Native American culture , food and agriculture with curious minds , as my mother and elder relatives did for my elementary classes . In this way , I enforce a presence of gratitude , something all children can understand and benefit positively from . In Native American Heritage Month , it seems a good time to recognize not only the legacy of Native people and how we continue to survive but also how our approach to treating our Earth is the only way civilization as a whole will remain . As the stewards of the land , the water and the sky , Native Americans have great historical lessons to teach of kindness , of respect , of temperance . I would argue that these are lessons for all people on Thanksgiving Day . My song will make it so ... . When she grows far past her self-considered purpose , I will sing her back , sing her back . I will sing . America , I sing back . And so it will be again , as it was .
