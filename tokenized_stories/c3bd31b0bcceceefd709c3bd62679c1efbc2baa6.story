Trump has attacked all the major car companies over plans to import vehicles , particularly from Mexico , for sale in the US . We had Whirlpool up yesterday . As soon as he was inaugurated on Friday , Trump ordered the heads of every executive-branch department and agency to stop sending new regulation to the Federal Register . On Monday , Trump announced a hiring freeze , drawing the ire of union leaders . Private industry remains friendly to Trump : Barra attended his inauguration , and Fields praised the president for withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership , a complex multilateral trade deal between 12 countries including the US . Industry lobbying group the Alliance of Auto Manufacturers sent Trump a letter asking him to ease regulations from the National Highway Safety and Transportation Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency . The Alliance represents car companies including GM , Ford and Volkswagen , which is currently on the hook for tens of billions in fines after its emissions-cheating software became an international scandal .
