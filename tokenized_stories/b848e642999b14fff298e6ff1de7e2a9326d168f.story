Read the full statement below : For more than three years now , Dakota Access Pipeline has done nothing but play by the rules . The Army Corps of Engineers agrees , and has said so publicly and in federal court filings . In spite of consistently stating at every turn that the permit for the crossing of the Missouri River at Lake Oahe granted in July 2016 , comported with all legal requirements , including the use of an environmental assessment , rather than an environmental impact statement , the Army Corps now seeks to engage in additional review and analysis of alternative locations for the pipeline . As stated all along , ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe . Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way . This statement should come as no surprise . Nothing in the Army Corps statement even hinted that the pipeline would not move forward , but the water protectors at Standing Rock have fought and bled to reach even this moment . If they had sat down while the U.S. government and its corporate cronies bulldozed through the blood and bones of their ancestors , they would not be fighting , living to see another day . I salute them . And I salute all who answered their call . Black people in the United States have been fighting these same white supremacist capitalist forces for centuries , but we still fight . We call a win a win even though we have n't won it all . Advertisement Because as I previously reported , this is not over . The Army Corps denied the easement that would have allowed construction to continue . Construction of the pipeline has desecrated sacred burial grounds and threatened the water safety of indigenous tribes and others who live further down the Missouri River . President Barack Obama -LRB- center -RRB- talks with Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault II -LRB- left -RRB- during the Cannon Ball Flag Day Celebration in Cannon Ball , N.D. , on June 13 , 2014 . His statement reads in part : Today , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that it will not be granting the easement to cross Lake Oahe for the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline . Instead , the Corps will be undertaking an environmental impact statement to look at possible alternative routes . We wholeheartedly support the decision of the administration and commend with the utmost gratitude the courage it took on the part of President Obama , the Army Corps , the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior to take steps to correct the course of history and to do the right thing . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and all of Indian Country will be forever grateful to the Obama Administration for this historic decision . We want to thank everyone who played a role in advocating for this cause . We thank the tribal youth who initiated this movement . We thank the millions of people around the globe who expressed support for our cause . We thank the thousands of people who came to the camps to support us , and the tens of thousands who donated time , talent , and money to our efforts to stand against this pipeline in the name of protecting our water . We especially thank all of the other tribal nations and jurisdictions who stood in solidarity with us , and we stand ready to stand with you if and when your people are in need . Treaties are paramount law and must be respected , and we welcome dialogue on how to continue to honor that moving forward . We are not opposed to energy independence , economic development , or national security concerns but we must ensure that these decisions are made with the considerations of our Indigenous peoples . On Friday , U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that law enforcement had the full support of the Justice Department , without condemning the violence that water protectors have already faced at their hands . Lynch also suggested that more assistance would be deployed , without specifying what that assistance would look like . As previously reported by The Root , thousands of veterans have traveled to Standing Rock to stand in solidarity . The decision today by the Obama Administration to further postpone any action on the easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline is a serious mistake . It does nothing to resolve the issue , and worst of all it prolongs the serious problems faced by North Dakota law enforcement as they try to maintain public safety . Senator Hoeven , Congressman Cramer and I have repeatedly asked for the easement to be granted and for the pipeline crossing to move forward so that the federal government can bring this to a conclusion . But the Army Corps ' decision is a victory that speaks to the unwavering spirit of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe . They refused to be silenced and they refused to be moved . And they made the entire world pay attention . Monday , Dec. 5 , 2016 , 5:30 a.m. Monday , Dec. 5 , 2016 , 5:30 a.m. . We are working to restore service .
