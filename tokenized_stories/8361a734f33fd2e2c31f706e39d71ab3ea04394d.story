Done Editing Tags Share this article 21 21 21 Police blockade at the northern end of the Backwater Bridge by the camps of the Water Protectors at Standing Rock , ND I visited Standing Rock from November 12th to the 14th . My mission was to photograph the actions in order to help document this amazing , impactful , peaceful uprising . Survival of the water protectors is the story to be told . Note : this is the second of a multipart account of a visit to the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota . Each week a new part will be published by the author . Oceti Sakowin Camp is the largest water protector encampment at Standing Rock Reservation . Food , sanitation , health and mental health services are provided . A midwifery tent takes care feminine health . Life at camp is defined by work . Part of this are the actions . People wake up early , before sunrise , for prayer ceremonies . After that , those who will participate in actions are organized and given direction as to where to go . On the day the article was being written , a confrontation took place . It was serious , and many people were injured . To read more about this , please click here . A person involved with the actions told me that they would go to different locations . Most of the actions involved obstructing the pipeline construction . Therefore , these actions are making it very costly to build there , which also incentivizes the builders to build elsewhere , away from the water . Other actions taking place are protests not at the pipeline construction . A day after my arrival , I heard of events in Bismarck . On the news , I saw a protest at the building housing the Army Corps of Engineers . Regardless , these actions are all peaceful and they stay on message . Although the actions take most of the news coverage , they are not the only thing that camp residents do . There is a lot of work done at the camp by a large number of people who do not participate in the actions . Food , for instance , is a major endeavor . A very large kitchen sits in the middle of the camp , relatively close to the main entrance . The kitchen is equipped with a massive , covered grill . Everything is cooked on it . California State Assemblymember-Elect Ash Kalra -LRB- D-San Jose -RRB- told me that when he visited the camp with a small delegation from the South Bay , he saw a whole squash being grilled . Another resident told me that she brought elk when she arrived at the camp . This too was cooked on the grill . The pantry is extensive , and it includes everything from buckets of flour , to pallets with fruits and vegetables , to other goods . A large truck provides water to camp residents . Chopping wood for the grill is a very important task that never ends . The wood is chopped daily and constantly . The need for firewood in the cold nights is such that the wood for the grill needs to be protected . Therefore , a large sign indicating that the wood was only for the kitchen was necessary . Wood has become quite relevant in the camp . There is wood everywhere . First , of course , is the wood used for cooking and heating . But structures are being built in preparation of winter . The sound of power tools can be heard from almost everywhere . Now , the police are cracking down on that , with what I believe is a stratagem to prevent the water protectors from resisting throughout the brutal North Dakota winter . The police are a constant presence at the camp . The camp is located on the south side of the Backwater Bridge that crosses a segment of the Missouri River . For a visual of the bridge , click here . This is about one hour south of Bismarck . Police enforcement is located at the north end of the bridge . The satellite antennas protruding off the command trucks are imposing , though . The command unit , from the Bureau of Indian Affairs , is located between the camp and the casino , at the intersection of Highway 24 . I never realized it was the Bureau of Indian Affairs until I stopped to take the picture . The lettering of the BIA was very small in comparison . I wonder why the BIA was there siding with the police . It shocked me to see that the BIA was on the wrong side of the equation . Anywhere from 20 to 50 police cars can be seen on their side of the bridge . Google Earth only shows very old photos , so this is not a conspiracy to hide anything from the public . All the camps are considered to be sanctuaries for the water protectors . The police can not come in , and as long as one is in the camp , one is technically safe . Yet , the ever-present visual of the cops , plus flyovers by unmarked aircraft , make it impossible to forget that the camps are technically under siege . At least twice a day a helicopter or a propeller plane , sometimes both , fly at extremely low altitudes over the camps , especially the main one . Both types of aircraft are painted yellow and white , and have no kind of identification numbers whatsoever . On normal planes , there are numbers painted on the underside of the wings , which work as license plates of sort . The same is true of normal helicopters . As a result of these aircraft having no identifiable markings , there is no way by which anyone outside of law enforcement can 100 percent positively identify them or who they belong to or represent . This law enforcement anonymity is representative of the constant pressure that camp residents live under . Just to illustrate how bad it can get , on my first day I focused my photography outside of the camp . I walked up the road , ND 1806 , northwards . I had no idea what I would find there . I saw beautiful vistas of the camp , especially Turtle Island , which I began to photograph . Then , I went back to the freeway and continued to travel north on the bridge . I eventually found the leftovers from previous confrontations . There was a burnt car , and up ahead were two incredibly large trucks that had also been set on fire . They were so burnt and twisted that at first I was unable to recognize what kind of trucks they were . On the other hand , it was painfully obvious that those trucks now formed a blockade between the factions . I walked towards the trucks , trying to figure out how to best photograph them . I reached an orange line on the ground that was spray painted . It was very clear to me what it meant : do not cross this line . Nothing else indicated that , no signs and no warnings , but my instinct guided me . Later I knew I was right to not even step on it . Some people told me that that line was indeed a boundary . I photographed the best I could . I was trying to get a shot of the bridge , the burnt trucks , and the line of police cars behind the trucks . The molten pavement and the graffiti on it caught my attention , so I photographed those too . When I was done taking pictures , I noticed a wall of people on the road behind me . I became excited that maybe an action was going to take place right there and then , so I rushed back to them . I saw a man looking at me , smiling , and trying to get to me . I smiled back , and once he reached me he asked me about the cops . Two on one side , and three on the other ; or so I was told . I was so focused on what I was doing , so lost in my art , that I lost any sense of my surroundings . I entered the creative vacuum where the only thing that matters is the subject , and nothing else . Only inspiration exists . The man explained to me that this was the reason everyone had congregated on the road , and on a small hill on the side of the road . There must have been about 100 people all together who came to possibly rescue me from the police . Granted , most people I talked to just saw a crowd forming and decided to check what was going on . The camp is considered a safe place . The road between the camp and the bridge is considered a safe place . Yet the police presence is omnipresent and hard to forget . And if you happen to get lost in the daily activities of the camp , a plane or a helicopter will remind you . Be it building shelters , erecting teepees , chopping wood , cooking , providing care to others - be it medical or legal - people in the camp are busy . Being busy is an excellent distraction from the tension of their situation . No one is there for a nice vacation with the kids - and if they are , they should leave . This is a dangerous situation for all involved . All it could take is a careless photographer for the tensions to explode and a confrontation to begin . We all need this illusion in order to survive . If the illusion were to be shattered by the reality of a raid or something like that , we will find ourselves in an apocalyptic world of the horrors of injustice that all seek to avoid . Therefore , the illusion of safety is essential to survival in this crazy dystopic reality .
