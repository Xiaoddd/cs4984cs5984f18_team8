Now that the appeal has been decided , the lawsuit will move forward in the US District Court for the District of North Dakota in Bismarck . Dundon v. Kirchmeier is a federal civil rights class action lawsuit challenging police violence on the night of November 20-21 , 2016 , at Backwater Bridge near the water protector camps and the site of the DAPL pipeline just north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota . The case was filed on November 28 , 2016 , in the U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota by nine named plaintiffs on behalf of everyone who was injured by law enforcement that night . Together with eight other named Plaintiffs , she represents a class of several hundred people who were injured by high pressure fire hoses , explosive grenades , chemical agents and impact munitions while peacefully protesting and engaging in prayer in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline . The brutal and militarized police violence on Backwater Bridge on November 20 , 2016 , should not have happened and must never happen again . While the appeal was pending it was revealed that Energy Transfer Partners hired security firm TigerSwan to surveil and wage a disinformation campaign against the indigenous-led anti-DAPL movement . Nearly 400 Water Protectors are still awaiting trial in their state criminal cases and six are preparing for federal felony trials . The first federal trial will be Red Fawn Fallis at the end of January , 2018 .
