The order directs Sunoco , a subsidiary of Dakota Access Pipeline builder Energy Transfer Partners , to stop Mariner East II construction activities across Pennsylvania . The 306-mile pipeline project would carry 275,000 barrels a day of butane , propane and other liquid fossil fuels from Ohio and West Virginia to the Atlantic coast for export . Construction has been plagued by numerous spills and contaminated drinking water supplies for homes in Silver Lake Township , Pennsylvania . The only activities allowed will be those associated with ensuring the shutdown is done safely and without further environmental damage . Patrick McDonnell said in a statement announcing the order . Pipeline opponents called on the department to go further . A May Food & Water Watch report called attention to the role that Mariner East II would play in efforts to convert ethane from fracked gas wells into a new glut of plastics , citing the health hazards for workers and communities near petrochemical manufacturing , as well as the growing plastics gyres in the Pacific Ocean . More directly , Sunoco has a checkered record nationwide when it comes to hazardous materials pipeline spills . This is not the first time Mariner East II has been halted . Last summer , a Pennsylvania court ordered Mariner East II construction temporarily suspended following numerous objections , until Sunoco agreed to stronger project oversight from the state . Energy Transfer Partners , parent company of Sunoco Pipeline , said that it did not plan to abandon construction efforts . Still , there are signs that investors are growing frustrated with delays . The project 's permits originally anticipated that construction would be done by 2016 . This fall , Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren told investors during an earnings call that it might try to bring in a joint venture partner to help carry the costs . Pipeline opponents say that the risks wo n't end after construction is over , citing safety concerns associated with the liquid fuels Mariner East II will carry very close to schools , senior homes and businesses through the densely populated suburbs of Philadelphia . An analysis by FracTracker found that over 100,000 people live within a quarter mile of Mariner East II 's proposed path . A worst-case scenario explosion could bring a fireball with an even larger radius , a study by commissioned by a local safety coalition found last year , prompting one school to start conducting safety drills . That 's in addition to the environmental concerns associated with the problem-plagued construction . Public safety advocates said that they considered Wednesday 's order a partial victory . Other grassroots activists have staged tree sits and other protests to halt Mariner East II 's construction at a Camp White Pine in Huntington County . Elise Gerhart and her mother Ellen , a retired public school teacher , have said the company attempted to illegally cut trees on their land to clear the pipeline 's path . Given the company 's record , she questioned whether Sunoco would adequately follow the DEP order 's new requirements . Reposted with permission from our media associate DeSmogBlog . The scorecard shows that 140 House members voted against chemical safeguards every time , while 149 members consistently voted for chemical safety protections . However , the action fund praised the lawmakers that bucked their party to vote for chemical safety , including Reps. voted for funding chemical reviews and against a farm bill that included pesticide safety loopholes . Florida Reps. A Preview of the People , Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule , two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Updated and reissued every five years , these guidelines are the nation 's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations . supply . These nominees will be well-known in their fields , and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers , academics and practitioners . part of the process is happening in real time . what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors . Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff , and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally . Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries . And here 's the first place you 'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition : rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected , USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first , soliciting public comments in the process . In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts , it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance . And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious . After the committee is announced in early 2019 , it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report . all appearances , the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs . though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable , plant-based diets have been all but stymied , there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle . Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance , including the meat industry , dairy industry , and sugar-sweetened beverage associations , as well as formula companies , which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers . -LRB- This may be happening in real-time , too . Exposure can be caused by contact , ingestion or inhalation . Short-term health effects can range from skin irritation and numbness to fever and headaches . Long-term exposure can lead to cancer , liver failure and sperm damage . is traditionally called blue-green algae is actually a class of microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria . Cyanobacteria can be toxic and can also produce various types of cyanotoxins that have different hazards . With their small , developing bodies , children are especially endangered by algae exposure . was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption . But it probably wo n't be the last , especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year . Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets . If you believe your pet may have been exposed , be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy , seizures , diarrhea or vomiting . And as climate change gets worse , the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks , creating a toxic feedback loop . The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish . Communities that struggle with regular , serious toxic algae outbreaks , like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie , can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation . The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth . The women were all non-smokers , had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies . Macrophages , which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body , protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles , such as bacteria and pollution particles . The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants . That 's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA 's Office of Inspector General -LRB- OIG -RRB- , the agency 's internal watchdog . EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement , and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was required to respond to the April 2017 petition within 90 days , but nearly 17 months have passed with no finding . more than 97,000 giraffes remain in the wild , and the species is gravely imperiled by habitat loss , civil unrest , hunting for meat and the international trade in bone carvings , skins and trophies .

But so , under this definition , are multi-thousand-acre corporate entities using automated machinery to grow genetically engineered corn . Size of the farm is not a factor ; neither is the style of agriculture . A family farm may not even have a family that owns or works the land . issue with such a broad definition of family farming is primarily in the discourse . Aid is divvied up by revenue among family farmers , with additional programs going to some specialized farmers , like young or beginning farmers , organic farmers , and sustainable farmers .
