Supporters also addressed the Palo Alto City Council and asked the City to join other cities including Seattle , Davis , Santa Monica , Alameda , Oakland and San Francisco in divesting from DAPL . The City of Palo Alto has a long history of action on climate change and sustainability including the following . In light of the imminent dangers from human-caused climate change and the resolutions adopted by the US and 194 countries at COP21 in Paris , we urge the Council to divest from all financial institutions having investments in the Dakota Access Pipeline and its construction entity , Energy Transfer Partners , as well as any new fossil fuel infrastructure . The Dakota Access Pipeline is a particularly egregious project because it tramples on the human , land , air and water rights of Native American peoples . Furthermore , we urge the City of Palo Alto to conduct its business with financial institutions that have values aligned with ours , and lending practices that support , rather than harm , our communities and our shared climate .
