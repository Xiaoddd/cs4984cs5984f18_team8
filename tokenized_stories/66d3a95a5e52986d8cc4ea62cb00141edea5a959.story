Post Nation Dakota pipeline protest camp : Ten arrested , dozens more believed to remain after evacuation deadline By Mark Berman Mark Berman National news reporter Email Bio Follow February 22 , 2017 Protesters of the Dakota Access pipeline have reportedly set fires in their camp ahead of the deadline requiring them to leave the area . Campers set structures on fire in preparation of the deadline to evacuate Wednesday . The Associated Press reported that praying protesters said they were burning the structures , including a yurt and teepee , as part of the ceremony involved in leaving the camp . Burgum said that during the fires , a 17-year-old woman was severely burned either during a fire that got out of control or an explosion of some kind . She was being airlifted to Minneapolis for medical care , he said . The evacuation deadline Wednesday afternoon in North Dakota was the latest confrontation in a bitter fight over a crude-oil pipeline , a standoff on a desolate prairie that drew movie stars , military veterans and investment bankers to an unlikely front line . A federal judge has left open the possibility of further court intervention , and the company behind the pipeline has said that oil could flow within the next 30 days . The Associated Press reported that about 150 of them marched out of the camp about 1 p.m. , an hour before the deadline to leave . Emotions are running high as some water protectors choose to leave . A hard decision to make , but some can not risk arrest . But I am handing that over so that I have no weapons on me . He added that anyone who remained after the deadline could be arrested , as his office said it was a crime to refuse to comply with an emergency evacuation order . State authorities said Tuesday that they set up a travel assistance center for protesters leaving the camp .
