They stand to protect the Earth , water , global climate , and the sacred sites , Indigenous rights and communities of the region . Their voices are critical not only for the wisdom , solutions and pointed analysis that they offer , but also because of the direct , violent impacts of the fossil fuel industry that are often borne disproportionately on the bodies of Indigenous women . With conviction and care , the women convey that protecting water and sacred places has always been their traditional role as women , and they are taking a fierce stand to ensure a healthy life for generations to come . They speak of the need for ceaseless action for Indigenous sovereignty ; for a new relationships between Native communities , governments and corporations ; and for a paradigm of socio-ecological balance based on respect for women and the Earth . Women on the frontline also decry the rapidly escalating militarization and abuses of local law enforcement , which has included the use of attack dogs , mace , intrusive surveillance and physical violence against those involved in ongoing non-violent direct actions based in traditional prayer and ceremony . Since the collection of these statements , mass arrests , check-points , violence and intimidation against land and water defenders has grown more dire . Leaders from diverse national and international institutions point to a long legacy of colonial injustices against Native peoples in the U.S. , ongoing through environmental racism , human and Indigenous rights abuses and damage to the Earth by corporate and state actors who continue to push forward pipeline construction . The words and determination of these women stand strong as beacons of hope , resistance and love that shine far beyond the corporate pillage of Energy Transfer partners and the banks and corporations financing the pipeline . The insights of these dedicated Indigenous women leaders call out to a world facing climate disaster and massive degradation of the Earth 's ecological systems . We have been here since then , standing up in prayer , doing our best to stop a pipeline that will damage our water . First and foremost we are water protectors , we are women who stand because the water is female , and so we must stand with the water . If we are to live as a people , we must have water , without water we die . So everything we do as we stand here , we must make sure that we do it in prayer , and that we do it in civil-disobedience . We do it with goodness and kindness in our hearts , but we stand up . We will not let them pass . We stand . Because we must protect our children and our grandchildren . If you respect women , you respect Earth and you respect water ... It 's so simple , this whole fight , it has nothing to do with being an activist , but it has everything to do with being a mom . As a mom , it 's really hard to lose a child , you are never the same , and so when my son died , I buried him on that hill over there , so that he would be right there to watch the mouth of the Cannon Ball and the Missouri Rivers . And when they told me they were going to build a pipeline I was like , ` I ca n't allow that , I ca n't allow anybody to put a pipeline next to my sons graves ' . I knew that this was the place I was meant to be , the place where I would benefit my people most ... I felt the call , and I 've just been active in this fight ever since , because I feel the pain of what the government is doing to our Mother Earth . They are raping her , across the world they are cutting up her belly and bringing out all her guts and it 's just not right . We as woman we can feel her pain , we have that connection to her . We can hear her screams even though she does n't have a voice , we see it . There used to be so many snows here , there used to be so many animals , and they are gone . It 's only going to take two hours for the oil to reach my community and reach my people . There will be no warning for us , they are n't going to tell us if the pipeline breaks , they are going to try to cover it up . Our water would be contaminated ... that 's environmental racism . It is . On my people . This is our future ... I am here for my children that have not yet come . I want to tell them someday , hey , I loved you so much that I gave my life for you , I gave my life to defend your land and your water . Everything man made breaks , including our laws and our government , and it is up to us , as citizens of the United States , as citizens of this great country , we have to hold them accountable . And that is what we are doing here . Champa Seyboye Champa Seyboye -LRB- Spirit Lake Sioux living in Mandan , North Dakota -RRB- Osprey Orielle Lake I am here at the Oceti Sakowin camp to support clean water , to support Mother Earth . There are so many bodies of water around the world that we can no longer drink from , and the Missouri River provides water to so many of us . If it gets contaminated a lot of people will be affected . This is a pipeline that is over 11,000 miles in length , and which is endangering everyone all along the water corridor down to the Gulf of Mexico and out to the world . Immediately in this location we have millions of people that will be impacted directly , so this is not just about the few of us holding it down here in Cannonball , North Dakota - this is about all of us who live downstream . This is about protecting our water sources - it is not just about one pipeline . The big picture is that the fossil fuel industry is on its way out . This country mostly , and our choices as human being around the world , are causing climate chaos , and that is why we see rising ocean levels and Pacific Island states disappearing and people being displaced from their homes . That is equivalent to 21.4 million new vehicles per year . If this country of the U.S.A. was really serious about reducing emissions , we would absolutely not allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to be built . I was given those names by my people because it 's been my life struggle to protect the water . I grew up on this river , I was removed and displaced when I was 10 years old , and I have never been compensated for the home that my grandparents lost . ... We have been on a campaign for life , and it is our life struggle to maintain this river where we have lived all of our lives , under international principles of treaty that govern our relationship with the United States . We want no pipeline . We want no oil going through our river , through our land . The sun is our natural world , and we need to utilize the solar and the natural energies that probably will devastate the capitalist world , but that 's how it has to be . We 're at a new threshold of human rights . It 's not about just us . It 's about the whole world . It 's about Mother Earth , having endured her suffering for this long , she needs our help . She needs our protection . She 's a female , and Indigenous people are the keepers of Mother Earth . We 're obligated to keep her water for her , and maintain the life as created , and for us . We are invoking all of our rights to the water , to the treaty crossing , and we need allies to help us continue ... We are here for the long haul . We are here . We 're staying here until there is no pipeline . I 'm here to protect these people all around us , this land , this is sacred land , there are burial sites all through here ... This is a youth led movement , people forget that , that the youth are here fighting . Come to Standing Rock . ... You will be taken care of , that is the way of our people . We are bringing our prayers , we are bringing our Chanupas , we are bringing our tobacco . We are stopping this black snake that would kill us . This pipeline here would kill us , it would give us cancers , it would give our kids cancers . There 's gon na be no future generations if this pipeline is built . Go look out at the soil by the pipeline . They are not here for themselves or us , they are here for the money . Pipeline workers , police , if you hear this , you need to understand how you are hurting us , how you are hurting the children . Shrise Wadsworth Shrise Wadsworth -LRB- Hopi of the Bear Strap Clan from Shungopavi Village , Second Mesa , Arizona , pictured on the left -RRB- sprey Orielle Lake I am here joining the peaceful protesters here at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation to be a part of all of this , to show my support for my brothers and sisters , and to spark inspiration and motivation in my generation to get out there and embrace their heritage , embrace who they are as people , to show my community that they too do have a voice and their voice does matter . It is a beautiful thing to be here and see all the Nations reunited , together as it should be . And she said that the women were going to be in front of this fight , women were going to be standing in the front in red shawls ... and you see that happening here ... we have to be ready to fight them , and we have to to take everything that we learned and teach elsewhere . That 's a paradigm that has no place in today 's world and so that 's why I 'm here . We are fighting the Dakota pipeline , but we 're also fighting the whole system of violence . The whole system which has called us savages . That respects its women . That gives its children priority . That will teach its children the traditional knowledge of life , that will give them life ... When I saw the young women crying out for help , I said I have to be there because I 'm not going to watch these people be desolated for the greed of a corporation that does not love this land , that is not part of this land . That 's the beautiful work that we 're here for . ... When we have natural resource development which is unsustainable , which threatens the very life of human beings and the natural world , we say absolutely no , it 's unacceptable . We deserve better than that . We 're not going to let the future of America , the future of Turtle Island to be robbed and taken and stolen from us . I came here to stand with my Indigenous relatives for something that is much larger than just a single project . We want to stop this project but we also want to take a stand and say , ` no more ' . Enough is enough . Indigenous people have been targeted for far too long and we 've had to give up everything . And so I am hopeful that when we stop this project , it will be a moment in which people will realize that Indigenous nations are here , and we are sovereign , and we are not going to tolerate the conversation as it is today . It 's always so important for me to be here , to be there for the people , the people we must feed to stay strong , so they can stay here and do the work they are doing for us all . Morning Star Gali Morning Star Gali -LRB- Achomawi Band of Pitt River , Northeastern California -RRB- Osprey Orielle Lake We are here , with the frontline defenders , with the women , with the women that are holding the line ... with a woman who is facing felony charges , all because she is standing for her children , who are here at the camp . All of us here are here for our future generations , so that we will have clean water . The atrociousness regarding what happened with the burial sites being dug up by machinery , it 's unfortunately not an uncommon occurrence for us , for Native peoples . As women , we are life givers , we are nurtures within our communities , and have such a strong connection to Mother Earth as well . Violence against Mother Earth is violence against our women . And , that is part of what we stand for . We are here to provide our support and to stand together as women in the movement , and with all of our relatives here . We carry that water inside of us . And this is about this to , this is about connection . ... We have to listen to our core , our core responsibilities as humankind , let us honor ourselves , let us honor each other , let us take care of ourselves as we take care of the world around us . ... There is a prayer that has been laid down here and it 's not just for our generation , is for the next generations , and so we carry that , we carry that forward for healing and wellness for the Earth . And we are not being asked to do this alone , it is time for all people of all nations to wake up and listen to the water . Water is life .

The scorecard shows that 140 House members voted against chemical safeguards every time , while 149 members consistently voted for chemical safety protections . However , the action fund praised the lawmakers that bucked their party to vote for chemical safety , including Reps. voted for funding chemical reviews and against a farm bill that included pesticide safety loopholes . Florida Reps. A Preview of the People , Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule , two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Updated and reissued every five years , these guidelines are the nation 's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations . supply . These nominees will be well-known in their fields , and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers , academics and practitioners . part of the process is happening in real time . what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors . Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff , and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally . Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries . And here 's the first place you 'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition : rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected , USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first , soliciting public comments in the process . In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts , it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance . And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious . After the committee is announced in early 2019 , it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report . all appearances , the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs . though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable , plant-based diets have been all but stymied , there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle . Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance , including the meat industry , dairy industry , and sugar-sweetened beverage associations , as well as formula companies , which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers . -LRB- This may be happening in real-time , too . Exposure can be caused by contact , ingestion or inhalation . Short-term health effects can range from skin irritation and numbness to fever and headaches . Long-term exposure can lead to cancer , liver failure and sperm damage . is traditionally called blue-green algae is actually a class of microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria . Cyanobacteria can be toxic and can also produce various types of cyanotoxins that have different hazards . With their small , developing bodies , children are especially endangered by algae exposure . was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption . But it probably wo n't be the last , especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year . Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets . If you believe your pet may have been exposed , be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy , seizures , diarrhea or vomiting . And as climate change gets worse , the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks , creating a toxic feedback loop . The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish . Communities that struggle with regular , serious toxic algae outbreaks , like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie , can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation . The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth . The women were all non-smokers , had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies . Macrophages , which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body , protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles , such as bacteria and pollution particles . The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants . That 's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA 's Office of Inspector General -LRB- OIG -RRB- , the agency 's internal watchdog . EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement , and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency .
