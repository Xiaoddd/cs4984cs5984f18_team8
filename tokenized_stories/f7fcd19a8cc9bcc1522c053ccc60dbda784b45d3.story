Forget the Bill of Rights , Abbott is proposing a bill of sale , effectively transferring the title of our national government from the people to the plutocrats . The American Legislative Exchange Council , at the direction of the Kochs and their corporate cohorts , wrote this bill of sale . Convening an explosive convention , permitted under Article V of the Constitution , is a longtime dream of those elites seeking an American Koch-istan , and ALEC is spearheading a hodgepodge of right-wing groups that , believe it or not , are alarmingly close to succeeding . At the convention , it would attempt to rewrite our nation 's fundamental governing document by adding a balanced budget amendment , along with Abbott 's other eight . Of course . Well , ALEC and the Kochs sure do think they can . But their diabolical schemes do n't stop with Gov. Abbott and changing our constitution . They want to take over our country 's entire political system . Having already spent hundreds of millions of dollars to get their policy-pushing puppets like Abbott into office , the Kochs want to bend the will of the people as well . They recently started a new program that they call the Grassroots Leadership Academy that gives how-to lessons in everything from mounting successful protest actions to recruiting middle of the road voters . About 10,000 people have gone through some of the training sessions in three dozen states . The brothers ' grandiose scheme is to take over the Republican Party and use it as their tool to rebuild America itself into a Kochlandia , ruled by the superrich . Koch College for right-wing social engineers is peddling a status quo agenda of corporate elitism and trickle-down ideology , which the vast majority of Americans have openly rebelled against . It 's like trying to sell chicken salad made out of chicken manure . To keep up with the costs of creating great content , we increasingly need to run more advertising to support the business .
