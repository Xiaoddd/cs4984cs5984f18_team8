Incidents of random hot spots for Internet reception with alternating GPS locations , hacked laptops and cellphones , are too many to count . Bugs or listening devices were planted in meeting rooms at the nearby Prairie Knights Casino & Resort . Fiber cable boxes were broken into . Additionally , cars en route to and from Oceti Sakowin broke down without warning , and have not been the same since . Possible suspects that remain include the federal government and TigerSwan , the North Carolina security firm whose services were paid by Energy Transfer Partners , the parent company of Dakota Access LLC . Headed by former Delta Force officer James Reese , both Reese and TigerSwan face a civil lawsuit filed by the North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board for illegally working in the state despite repeated warnings . The cyber and cellular attacks at Standing Rock on activists ranged from malware , IMSI catchers , to electromagnetic field devices , IT analysts report . Malware typically comes as viruses through emails , links , or attachments and acts with stealth , not programed to alert the owner . The electromagnetic field device is a cyber weapon used in the Middle East to block cellular phones sending data to Improvised Explosive Devices , or IEDs . It is a short burst of electromagnetic energy meant to disrupt or damage nearly any equipment with a microchip . Only government entities can authorize a cyber or cellular attack . Plucked from the war-torn fields of Afghanistan and Iraq , TigerSwan employees are well trained in military tactics , and the company not only advertises its military-grade data and human intelligence capabilities on its website , it has a history of partnering with hi-tech companies , such as its 2012 partnership with Saffron Technology . While IT technicians continue the hunt for additional proof of cyber weaponry used at the Standing Rock camps , the Water Protector Legal Collective , which operates in partnership with the National Lawyers Guild in defending many activists , reports Kourtni Dockter , a former DAPL security employee , is not the only whistleblower . On Tuesday night , Kyle Thompson , the former project manager for Leighton Security Security Services , came forward live on Digital Smoke Signals with owner Myron Dewey , and began to tell his side of the Dakota Access Pipeline story , making hints that more is to come . Late November outside of Standing Rock , Glover-Herzog was trying to stay warm . She spent months at the camps training people and helping improve communication technology . Geeks Without Bounds is a Washington-based humanitarian organization that works toward improving communication and technology . Cooper Quentin , the staff technologist on the cyber team with Electronic Frontier Foundation , a nonprofit organization defending liberties in the digital world , spent a few days at the Standing Rock camps . He looked at computers , mobile phones , but said he found nothing conclusive . Extreme temperatures can do weird things to phone batteries . Quentin is still interested in investigating further , however , but the case needs a digital forensics expert , which is costly . If the server is owned by law enforcement or TigerSwan , then you have solid attribution . She had 80 percent battery left when it got hit , but even after trying three separate chargers , her phone was never able to call or text again . She learned to adapt quickly ; stowed the battery in one pocket , and her new phone in the other when she went to the frontlines . Cars broke down when a helicopter flew by , she noticed . Ling turned whistleblower in 2014 , and her testimony was featured in the 2016 documentary film National Bird . On her second trip , she said random places in the camps had connectivity . She knocked on tent and tipi doors asking people if they had boosters . No one had any . Such an attack is not legal for a private company to issue , and Ling said it should not be legal for law enforcement to utilize without warrants . FOIA requests to the Office of the Governor of North Dakota , to the Bureau of Indian Affairs , to the North Dakota National Guard , so far , have revealed that no warrants were issued for the use of cyber weapons outside of Standing Rock . So if you managed to turn your phone off when that thing came by , then your phone would n't get zapped . Ling brought radios to the camps to help with communication and safety during sub-zero temperatures , she said , but TigerSwan operatives discovered their frequencies and harassed them . Internet cables were cut inside the dome by infiltrators , she said . The automobile breakdowns coincided with either the private Cessna that circled the camps , or with helicopters . He spotted and photographed a Stingray device near Highway 1806 where Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II was arrested . The device has been identified by multiple sources as a semi-mobile Stingray rogue field intercept cell tower antenna array with collection and detection gear powered by a grid utility pole with a battery backup . Dewey is also a filmmaker , uses drones , and lost at least three to gunfire and electromagnetic field devices , he said . Charges against Dewey were dropped this week , and he is waiting the return of one of his drones in Mandan . Dewey claims that TigerSwan operatives on snowmobiles chased him while he was driving , and he has video to prove the harassment . One of his drones was hit at Treaty Camp , which was taken over by law enforcement on October 27 , 2016 . His mobile phone also got hacked , Dewey said . In addition to the cyber attacks , TigerSwan operatives , or security personnel working under the TigerSwan umbrella , boarded vehicles like pirates to a ship , he said , smashed out windows , stole radios to report misleading information , and curse . The threats were difficult to ignore as they brought on old fears from native oral stories and traditions handed down for generations . The first electromagnetic pulse hit the camps in August , Dewey said . The cyber field of battle sits in a legal gray zone , but inside the United States only a government entity has the authority to utilize use cyber weapons . Private companies , even if they are attacked first , can not legally reciprocate on their own volition . Outside of the NSA , the CIA , the FBI , and a handful of other government agencies , only criminal organizations and massive corporations have the funds to purchase and store high-end disruptive cyber weapons . Harris is a senior correspondent at the Daily Beast and covers national security , intelligence , and cyber security . Cyber warfare began in the 1990s . Early pioneers , or cyber warriors , blazed a complicated legal trail into the 2000s until 2013 , when former President Barack Obama issued executive order PDD-20 , effectively paving the way for more streamlined cyber defense and offense . The president must order all cyber strikes internationally ; no private companies are authorized for digital , cellular , or cyber offensive actions . Oil pipelines are included under the infrastructure category by the Department of Homeland Security , as are dams , chemicals , emergency services , communications , critical manufacturing , healthcare , water and wastewater , transportation , information technology , and government facilities , along with other sectors of economy . Approximately 85 percent of the computer networks in the United States are owned and operated by private groups and individuals , and any one of the telecom companies , the tech titans , the financial institutions , the defense contractors , could be the weak link against cyber attacks . The lines between spies , saboteurs , or intelligence gathering and military operations are blurred . Intelligence gathering techniques fall into a legal gray area and while the tactic may not be illegal for a federal or police agency to conduct on US citizens , the evidence obtained by such means may still not be allowed in a court of law . Daily , TigerSwan coordinated and provided intelligence to Energy Transfer Partners and others . TigerSwan placed operatives in the law enforcement joint operations center , and were responsible for in-depth analyses of cyber , workforce , facility , electronic , and environmental security threats , according to the North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board . I worked in the National Guard and the term was used there , but I have never heard the term battle rhythm used in a civilian setting . The idea that women are not funny never entered my mind . Editorial Wisdom from a forgotten flagpole by Sabrina Hornung Photo by Sabrina HornungI had a little bit of gravel-road therapy this weekend , found myself cruising rural Burleigh County and made a pit stop at Lake Mitchell . Participants were judged on creativity , flavor , and presentation ; and this year we added a new category . I suffer from acute scoliosis in my lower back , and pain radiates from this area on a daily basis .
