But things could get ugly . They have multiple times in the past . And they are well prepared . This barbarism had been darkly par for the course for police . After all , if live ammunition is fired by police and National Guard against unarmed water protectors and U.S. military veterans on land rightfully belonging to Native Americans via several treaties , the fallout would be rightly insurmountable for those in charge . Some of the vets see protecting the camps as atonement for fighting in wars they later learned had far more to do with natural resources or the whims of politicians and corporations than anything remotely pertaining to freedom . OH YEAH , since we are not corporate or government owned help us out here .
