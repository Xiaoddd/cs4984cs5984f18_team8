Wrong . The producer of the film series was Shell . We are not told that she is a member of the US National Petroleum Council . The film also features Richard Newell , who is identified as a Former Administrator at the US Energy Information Administration . Michelle Michot Foss , who offers skepticism about battery production for renewables , is identified as the Chief Energy Economist at the Center for Energy Economics at the University of Texas at Austin . You may notice a pattern . The very experts we assume to be objective , and the very centers of research we assume to be independent , are connected with the very industry the public believes they are objectively studying . Moreover , these connections are often kept hidden . To say that these experts and research centers have conflicts of interest is an understatement : many of them exist as they do only because of the fossil fuel industry . They are industry projects with the appearance of neutrality and credibility given by academia . After years conducting energy-related research at Harvard and MIT , we have come to discover firsthand that this pattern is systemic . The trend continues at Stanford , where one of us now works . For comparison , imagine if public health research were funded predominantly by the tobacco industry . Yet such conflicts of interest are not only rife in energy and climate research , they are the norm . The myriad benefits of this strategy to the fossil fuel industry -LRB- and its effects on academic research -RRB- range from benign to insidious to unconscionable , but the big picture is simple : academia has a problem . As scientists and policy experts rush to find solutions to the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced , our institutions are embroiled in a nationwide conflict of interest with the industry that has the most to lose . Our message to universities is : stop ignoring it . We are not saying that universities must cut all ties with all fossil fuel companies . Energy research is so awash with fossil fuel funding that such a proposal would imply major changes . Two parallel approaches can help . First , mandatory standards should be established in climate policy and energy research for disclosing financial and professional ties with fossil fuel interests , akin to those required in medical research . And second , conflicts of interest should be reduced by prioritizing less conflicted funding and personnel . One way or another , the colonization of academia by the fossil fuel industry must be confronted . He has a PhD in Applied Physics from Harvard University .
