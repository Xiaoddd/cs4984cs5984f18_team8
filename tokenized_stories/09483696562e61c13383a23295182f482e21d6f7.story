From these memoranda , it is plain that Trump intends to push both projects through the federal permit and easement process as quickly as possible , with no regard for tribal rights and interests . The Corps published its Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS in the Federal Register last Wednesday , January 18 . Tuesday , however , President Trump issued a memorandum directing the Corps to reverse course . Specifically , the memorandum directs the Secretary of the Army to instruct the Corps to consider withdrawing the Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS for the DAPL Lake Oahe crossing . The about-face the President has called upon the Corps to make would evince a clearly arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act . President Trump has known ties to the industry partners behind the pipeline project . Shoving the project through , as his memorandum attempts to do , would avoid necessary environmental review , including consideration of alternative routes . Neither the President nor the Corps has authority to rely on an EA when an EIS has been deemed necessary . The Lake Oahe crossing was the primary focus of DAPL opposition last year because granting the easement would allow construction of DAPL under Lake Oahe , destroying sacred sites and threatening the sacred waters of the Missouri River . Both Executive Memoranda urge the respective federal agencies to treat the previously conducted , inadequate environmental reviews as satisfying the consultation duties imposed on the agencies by law . Our right to consultation is meant to protect our treaty rights , our culture , and our spirituality . This attempt to shortcut through the legal process shows disrespect for the law and for Indian tribes . The Tribe has battled the Dakota Access pipeline by peacefully protesting at the Standing Rock Camps , filing a lawsuit against two federal agencies that have given approval for the project , challenging the issuance of a state permit in South Dakota , and testifying before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights . Likewise , the Tribe has been fending off the Keystone XL pipeline through state agency proceedings , a pending appeal in South Dakota court , and countless protests and direct actions over the past several years . 2 years ago Very well said . To the Yankton Sioux Tribal Chairman , Robert Flying Hawk , you have members of other tribes standing with you . Prayers are with those that remain at the camps in North Dakota as well as those who protest elsewhere . OUT OF OUR PAIN , OUR UNITY BECAME STRONGER . I think Trump is pulling so much crap all at once to keep us dizzy . We hardly know where to turn , what to do when . My focus on Twitter is SocSec , Medicare & ACA-but others are watching out on other subjects . likes Trump much . I think in their private meeting Trump promised US would pay for wall , then 20 min . later came out & told media Mexico would pay for wall . A bit later Mexican Pres. I leave you with one final thought : the money . He has some financial interest in the pipelines , too . He has grandchildren growing up and he should remember the things he does while in office will affect them also . Agnes Help support Native News Online by clicking on our sponsors ' advertisements .
