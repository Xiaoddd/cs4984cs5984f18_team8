Credit : Reuters The confrontations between police and Dakota Access pipeline protesters grew even more violent in recent days , including what protesters describe as a concussion grenade thrown by police that may cost one protester her arm . Hundreds of protesters stood before the police line throughout the night in sub-freezing temperatures after the confrontation began . Michael Knudsen , a medic with Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council , said he was at a loss to describe Sunday 's confrontation with police . A spokesperson for Morton County Sheriff denied the use of concussion grenades or anything else that would have caused such a powerful blast . Grenade pieces were removed from Wilansky 's arm in surgery and will be saved for evidence , said the Standing Rock Medic & Healer Council , a group that provided medical assistance to protesters during Sunday night 's standoff . Wilansky , who had traveled from New York to support the protest , was handing out water to unarmed pipeline protesters early Monday morning near the police line when the explosion occurred , according to the medic group . He said his group treated at least 300 people , 26 of whom were transported to medical facilities . Wilansky 's injury appeared to be the most serious .
