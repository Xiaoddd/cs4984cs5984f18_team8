Winds NE at 5 to 10 mph . -LRB- Former Gov. Jack -RRB- Dalrymple and -LRB- Morton County Sheriff Kyle -RRB- Kirchmeier , in their questionable wisdom , mustered troops from near and far to suppress the First Amendment rights of non-violent demonstrators and defended the so-called right of a multi-billion-dollar fossil fuel corporation to threaten the lives and livelihood of sovereign Native American nations . Shamefully , they also introduced violence and militarism into a previously peaceful action by citizens . The folks who should rightfully pay the fiddler for protecting their hoped-for , not-yet-approved pipeline river crossing would , of course , be Dakota Access Pipeline . Nowhere does state or federal law require citizens to subsidize the costs that private corporations incur in obtaining approvals or implementing plans . On an environmentally risky and controversial proposal like this , expenditures for security are to be expected . Whether or not Dakota Access Pipeline budgeted for this contingency , however , would be totally beside the point . Absent this project , such security forces would never have been requisitioned . Accordingly , their cost should be covered by the private corporation that benefited . I rest my case . We taxpayers have more important things for our elected and appointed officials to be doing .
