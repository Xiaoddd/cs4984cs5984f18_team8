Thousands of brave Americans in North Dakota faced brutal weather and unnecessary police force to stop a pipeline from being driven through the heart of America and potentially ruin their source of clean water . This was no ordinary protest . Not only did it bring together over 500 tribes , but it also became the rallying cry to millions across the world who believe we need to make the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy . And its effect was also remarkable : President Obama and the Army Corps of Engineers made an historic decision to pause , conduct an Environmental Impact Statement and look at alternative routes . 2017 might be a very different year . America is on the verge of becoming the dominant clean energy superpower in the world . Retreating into our reliance on the fuels that powered the last century is the equivalent of trading in the digital age for reams of notebook paper . Our future can be cleaner and more prosperous . For those of us who want to see our children inherit a new era of American prosperity that is built on innovation , 2017 will be pivotal . The Standing Rock movement needs all of our support now more than ever . If you were in North Dakota or are still there , stay inspired and stay peaceful . Donate money for legal and logistical support . Contact your political representatives and make your opinion known . Share news of the movement in your social and digital networks . 2017 can be a pivotal year in transforming how America creates energy and treats her citizens . I look forward to it .
