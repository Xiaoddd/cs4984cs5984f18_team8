I drank the kool-aid , and believed there was something different and superior , about the people who lived inside of those artificial made-up lines on a map written by DC politicians 140 or so years ago . North Dakotans used to be very proud of leading the nation in being the cleanest , most pollution free state . Just about all the people there , used to be friendly and helpful to strangers Now many , if not most , of North Dakotans have changed . I could go on and on about the leaks from the wells , and about explosions from the wells , and pipelines . I could go on about the pipeline rupturing next to the Yellowstone River in Montana , or about the leaks and spills into the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers near Williston .
