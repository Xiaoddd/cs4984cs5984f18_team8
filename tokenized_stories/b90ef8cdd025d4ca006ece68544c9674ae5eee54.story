Now , Native groups are organizing for justice in a growing Native Lives Matter movement . One minute earlier , three police officers had arrived , summoned by staff at a nearby hospital . Cursing them , she refused . They pumped two shots into her chest and another into her back as she fell to the pavement . Fifteen seconds had elapsed from the time they exited their vehicles . That July evening in 2014 , Riley became another Native American killed by police . Patchy government data collection makes it hard to know the complete tally . The Washington Post and the Guardian -LRB- U.K. -RRB- have both developed databases to fill in the gaps , but even these sometimes misidentify or omit Native victims . To get a clearer picture , Mike Males , senior researcher at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice , looked at data the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- CDC -RRB- collected from medical examiners in 47 states between 1999 and 2011 . When compared to their percentage of the U.S. population , Natives were more likely to be killed by police than any other group , including African Americans . Yet these killings of Native people go almost entirely unreported by mainstream U.S. media . In a paper presented in April at a Western Social Science Association meeting , Claremont Graduate University researchers Roger Chin , Jean Schroedel and Lily Rowen reviewed articles about deaths-by-cop published between May 1 , 2014 , and October 31 , 2015 , in the top 10 U.S. newspapers by circulation : the Wall Street Journal , New York Times , USA Today , Los Angeles Times , New York Daily News , New York Post , Chicago Sun-Times , Denver Post , Washington Post and Chicago Tribune . Corey Kanosh , an unarmed 35-year-old Paiute man , died in the Utah desert on Oct. 15 , 2012 . Police , believing the car in which he was a passenger to be stolen , chased it to a stop . After Corey got out of the car , police shot him and left him overnight . In the morning , he was pronounced dead . Pregnant , homeless and threatening suicide , 34-year-old Suquamish tribe descendent Jeanetta Riley was shot and killed by Sandpoint , Idaho police on July 8 , 2014 , seconds after they exited their vehicles . Riley was holding a knife , and her shooting was ruled justified . On Dec. 30 , 2014 , just one day after attending a Native Lives Matter protest , Allen Locke was shot and killed by a police officer in his Rapid City , S.D. , home . A police investigation found the shooting justified because the 30-year-old Lakota man was holding a knife . The Denver Post ran six articles , totaling 2,577 words . The killing of Suquamish tribal member Daniel Covarrubias , shot when he reached for his cell phone , received a total of 515 words in the Washington Post and the New York Times -LRB- which misidentified him as Latino -RRB- . The other 27 deaths received no coverage . Compare this media blackout with the coverage of the next-most-likely group to be killed by police . The researchers found that the 10 papers devoted hundreds of articles to the 413 African Americans killed by police in that period , as well as to Black Lives Matter -LRB- BLM -RRB- protests and police violence more broadly . Nor did major media report on a spate of Native jailhouse deaths in 2015 . Whether the deaths are due to police action or neglect , the department is considered accountable . According to the report , Larry Kobuk , identified in news articles as a 33-year-old Alaska Native , who had a heart condition known to his jailers , died in January 2015 while being held face down by four officers . Sarah Lee Circle Bear , a 24-year-old Sioux mother of two jailed in South Dakota , died after reportedly complaining of pain and being refused medical care . From our October Issue Buy Issue Subscribe The list of 2015 deaths goes on : 53-year-old Choctaw medicine man Rexdale Henry , in a jail cell in Mississippi ; Alaska Native Gilbert Joseph , 57 , in Alaska ; Yurok tribal member Raymond Eacret , 34 , in California . Protestors sang , drummed and shouted taunting references to the 1890 shooting death of Lakota spiritual leader Sitting Bull at the hands of Native police officers . Yet even this story received no coverage in the 10 largest papers . The Claremont researchers stress that they are not criticizing the important attention paid to the movement for black lives , but they note that a larger narrative is at play : Racial issues in the United States tend to be framed as black and white , while other groups are ignored . Federal investigations have found that on the borders of reservations , Native Americans are treated as second-class citizens by police and public agencies in ways that echo the experience of black Americans in towns like Ferguson , Mo. . Rexdale Henry , a 53-year-old Choctaw medicine man , was arrested in Philadelphia , Miss. , for a minor traffic violation and outstanding tickets . On July 14 , 2015 , he was found dead in his jail cell . After telling jailers that she was in excruciating pain , Sarah Lee Circle Bear , 24 , was found dead in her Aberdeen , S.D. , holding cell on July 5 , 2015 . Police later said the Lakota woman died from a meth overdose , but her family notes that she had been in police custody for two days before she died . Mah-hi-vist Goodblanket , 18 , a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes , was Tasered twice and shot seven times in his Clinton , Okla. , home by police on Dec. 21 , 2013 . His mother had called the police to request help keeping her son safe during a mental health episode . Over the past 40 years , the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights -LRB- USCCR -RRB- , an independent government agency , has held numerous hearings on discrimination in border towns surrounding reservations : in New Mexico , near the Navajo reservation ; in South Dakota , near the Sioux reservations ; and , just this August , in Billings , Mont. , near the Crow and Northern Cheyenne reservations . Incidents aired even in recent hearings sound like tales from the pre-civil-rights Deep South . They ranged from denial of service in public places to police brutality to the failure to investigate murders . In Northern Plains states , USCCR members personally observed staff in restaurants and stores hassling or refusing to serve Natives . This is the context for Native deaths at the hands of police . People threatening suicide and experiencing other mental health crises made up one-quarter of all those killed by cops in the first half of 2016 , according to data collected by the Washington Post ; they made up nearly half of the Native deaths examined by the Claremont researchers . As funding for mental healthcare continues to plummet , police are increasingly the first responders to mental health crises that they are untrained for and ill-equipped to handle . Mental health resources for Native Americans are even scarcer off-reservation , in the so-called urban-Indian communities , where about half of the Native population lives . There , clinics are funded at a lower rate , says Duran . This is also where the largest share of police killings occur : 79 percent , according to Chin . Some police departments have responded by training officers in crisis intervention , which teaches them to slow down and find alternatives to the immediate application of lethal force , or by pairing officers with mental health professionals on calls that clearly involve such issues . Research is not yet conclusive about what works best , says Duran , but she stresses that the best solution is to address the problem at the root : Fund social services . On April 21 , 2015 , Lakewood , Wash. , police shot and killed 37-year-old Daniel Covarrubias , when they mistook his cell phone for a gun . The shooting of the Suquamish man , a descendant of Chief Seattle , was later ruled justified . His family is calling for an independent investigation . The next day , Nov. 14 , 2014 , she was found handcuffed to her cell door and unresponsive . On March 27 in Winslow , Ariz. , a police officer shot and killed Loreal Tsingine , a 27-year-old Navajo woman who had been holding medical scissors . Fellow police have said that in training , the officer was unable to control his emotions and was too quick to use his weapon . Native Lives Matter The grassroots Native Lives Matter -LRB- NLM -RRB- movement is attempting to bring attention to the deaths , and to the larger social and economic oppression of Native Americans . Started in late 2014 , the concept was inspired by Black Lives Matter , says one of the founders , Chase Iron Eyes , a Lakota attorney and Democratic candidate for Congress from North Dakota . On Dec. 19 , 2014 , Iron Eyes and other Natives marched in Rapid City , S.D. , to draw attention to police brutality against Natives . The next day , Rapid City police fatally shot a Native man , Allen Locke , who had attended the protest . From the beginning , Iron Eyes says , NLM was intended to encompass numerous issues affecting Natives , from child welfare to incarceration disparities . The Native Lives Matter Facebook page and Twitter feed show the idea has proliferated across Indian country , with grassroots groups adopting the slogan as an umbrella term to advocate for environmental and social causes . Enter the Puyallup tribe -LRB- pronounced p-YAH-lup -RRB- , an economically powerful , 4,000-member Northwest Indian nation with a successful casino , numerous tribal and individual fishing enterprises , and a real-estate portfolio of commercial and industrial properties . The Puyallup were catapulted into the issue of police violence on January 28 . Shortly before midnight , Tacoma police officers approached a parked car . A convicted felon , Kenneth Wright , 36 , who was wanted on drugs and weapons charges , was in the passenger seat ; his pregnant girlfriend , 32-year-old tribal member Jacqueline Salyers , was the driver . Minutes later , one of the officers had shot Salyers in the head , and Wright had escaped into the night . Almost immediately , relatives began to question the police account of the incident . They are now in the process of conducting their own investigation . There is no video record : Tacoma officers used no body or dash cams at the time , a police surveillance camera overlooking the street allegedly malfunctioned during the event , and police apparently destroyed three security cameras on a nearby house during their investigation . His partner , Aaron Joseph , stopped their cruiser across the street . The two officers challenged Salyers and Wright to put their hands up . According to Campbell , Salyers then accelerated the car toward him ; he says he shot at her to save his life . Of the eight shots discharged , four hit Salyers . No shots hit Wright , who , when apprehended weeks later , told investigators he had ducked down . After the gunfire , the officers took cover . The police account raises a number of questions . Cool declined to comment further , citing the possibility of a lawsuit . Once in the new location , Salyers was dragged back out of the patrol car and onto the pavement , where Campbell performed chest compressions . Medics arrived and Salyers was pronounced dead . At some point , her right arm was broken , but not by a bullet ; her family discovered this while preparing her for burial . But a video shows the Rosebud Sioux man holding the knife only to his own neck . Family say he was having a schizophrenic episode and needed assistance , not violence . Raymond Eacret , a 34-year-old Yurok tribal member , died in a Humboldt County , Calif. , jail on June 26 , 2015 . Police shot and killed the White Earth Ojibwe man as he ran toward them with a screwdriver . Gary Harrison , a 48-year-old African-American veteran , was awakened by the gunfire . The shooting happened right in front of his home . He had known the young woman . Nearly 300 people turned out . At press time , no decision had been made whether to undertake one . They recount their stories in a traditional Puyallup talking circle -LRB- during which participants express themselves in turn and without interruption -RRB- , then share a meal . On the evening of June 20 , In These Times attended one of the meetings . As participants filtered into the community center , they hugged , exchanged bits of gossip and found places in a circle of chairs . They were Native , black , white and Latino , young and old , united by concern about friends , family and neighbors lost in encounters with the police . Silvia Sabon , a 53-year-old Tlingit tribal member , described the death of a 23-year-old Latino family friend , Oscar Perez-Giron , whom she says was killed on a bus platform by police challenging his lack of a ticket . African-American mother Crystal Chaplin , 52 , said that in May 2015 , Olympia , Wash. , police shot both of her sons , Andre Thompson , then 23 , and Bryson Chaplin , then 21 , in the back . Both survived , but Bryson was paralyzed . A proposed police reform bill in Washington state bears his name . When jailed in Anchorage , Alaska , on Jan. 27 , 2015 , Larry Kobuk , 33 , told the attending nurse he had a heart condition . Within minutes , he was unresponsive ; he never regained consciousness . On Dec. 16 , 2012 , at a travel plaza 35 miles north of Las Vegas , tribal police from the Moapa Band of Paiutes Tasered and then shot to death Marcus Lee , a 28-year-old father of four . Lee , who was killed in front of one of his sons , was wanted on several warrants . The FBI cleared the officers involved in the shooting . This approach makes sense culturally to the Puyallup . In addition , says tribal council member Reynon , a tribe can be effective in a ways an individual advocate or advocacy group can not . The Puyallup tribe supports a Washington state ballot initiative that seeks greater police accountability for lethal use of force . The bill that the initiative would put before the legislature is named for John T. Williams . He is one of few Natives whose death-by-cop , in Seattle in 2010 , received more coverage . Then 50 , he was shot by an officer who first claimed Williams lunged at him with a knife , though eyewitnesses contradicted this . The shooting was termed unjustified , but the officer never faced criminal penalties . Puyallups have joined individuals and groups statewide , like the NAACP , that are collecting signatures ; 250,000 are needed by the end of 2016 to put the measure before the legislature . It appears to be the only police department in the state to issue a positive response to the potential change . In another development , state legislative leaders have appointed Reynon to a new Joint Legislative Task Force on Deadly Force and Community Policing , a committee drawn from community groups as well as law enforcement . The bill establishing the task force acknowledges the danger police are often placed in as they protect the community , but it also seeks ways to reduce violent interactions between law enforcement and the public . Wichita , Kansas police officers shot Karen Day-Jackson , 45 , a mother of three and grandmother of 11 , on July 10 , 2012 . Puyallup tribal member Jacqueline Salyers , 32 , was at the wheel of a parked car when police spotted Kenneth Wright , 36 , who had multiple outstanding warrants , in the passenger seat . Police shot and killed the pregnant Salyers while Wright escaped . The Puyallup have long been easy victims in Tacoma , Bennett says . Traditionally , they lived in communal longhouses , but late-19th-century presidential proclamations and Congressional actions broke up the reservation and forced tribal members to move to isolated cabins on separate plots . The Justice for Jackie , Justice for All effort will succeed , Bennett believes . Purchase a copy here or subscribe to the magazine .
