This Bill introduced changes to the Criminal Code of Canada by including section 279 to address the growing concern over trafficking in women . Since the Bill received its Royal Assent , there has been a reported increase in concern of trafficking in Indigenous women . For example , in November of that same year , a report was published by the First Nations Caring Society calling for more analysis , research , and documentation of trafficking in Indigenous women and girls -LRB- Sethi 68 -RRB- . The term settler is often mistakenly used to describe individuals of European descent . This banishment from cities and towns often led to the displacement of both Indigenous people from their own communities ; unfortunately , it most often led to the displacement of Indigenous women from their community in disparate comparison to Indigenous men -LRB- Boyer 78 -RRB- . One such policy that continues to exist today is the Indian Act . The Indian Act is a legislation that has undergone many changes since its enactment in 1876 . During colonization , the settlers began to redefine the roles of Indigenous men and women by disparaging the role of Indigenous women in Indigenous communities -LRB- Boyer 75 -RRB- . Before settlers arrived , Indigenous women often held prestigious roles in their communities -LRB- Boyer 75 -RRB- . Unfortunately this changed with the creation of the Indian Act in 1876 . These sections relating to prostitution within the Indian Act underwent significant changes , which added more force and more provisions than their preceding sections . For instance , initial sections only affected Indigenous women . However , later modified sections affected both Indigenous men and women , and allowed for policing of Indigenous bodies and sexuality in their own homes -LRB- Boyer 78 -RRB- . Finally in 1892 , the CCC was enacted and all sections relating to prostitution were removed from the Indian Act and then added to the CCC -LRB- Boyer 78 -RRB- . There is almost no recognition of this history of prostitution laws in Canada in current research that attempts to address the growing concern over human trafficking in Indigenous women and girls . At the heart of colonization is Othering where the Other is seen as the problem . Thus , this colonial and violent legacy of the NWMP lives on through the RCMP . It is often described as an exploitative relationship between two individuals where one controls , coerces , or forces another to do labour , which is most often sexual labour , through intimidation and violence , and the RCMP definition emphasizes that a human trafficking victim does not have to be moved to be trafficked -LRB- Royal Canadian Mounted Police 2 -RRB- . One of the major legislative problems relating to human trafficking is the unclear and often complex definition of human trafficking -LRB- Sikka 4 -RRB- . It appears that these legislative and research efforts to combat trafficking in Indigenous women and girls are genuine . As mentioned earlier , research on this growing topic concerns itself with examining the causes of trafficking in Indigenous women and girls . In Decolonizing Methodologies : Research and Indigenous People , Smith examines limitations of research through the discourse of the Indigenous problem . -LRB- 92 -RRB- This growing concern over trafficking of Indigenous women and girls is initiated and maintained through Canadian policies , like Bill C-49 , and through the continued policing of Indigenous bodies . In other words , the settlers create an Indigenous problem and maintain this problem as one where Indigenous bodies must be controlled to further exploit Indigenous lands , as historically demonstrated through the creation of the Indigenous problem , the Indigenous women as a prostitute , and the creation of the NWMP and its living legacy , the RCMP . If human trafficking is defined as exploitive relationships including fearing for their safety and experiences of violence , then there should be an increase in human trafficking victims . As such , the conceptualization of a legitimate victim is demonstrative of the colonial agenda . Historically , Indigenous peoples were seen as savages and uncivilized -LRB- Comack 69 -RRB- . Today , as indicated above , they are seen as having no capacity for agency , and need to be rescued . One might argue that there are legitimate human trafficking victims that are deserving of support and the services to help rehabilitate the victims of human trafficking . Yet , the RCMP emphasizes , as indicated earlier , that a domestic human trafficking victim does not have to include the movement of the victim . The colonial agenda persists through the conceptualization of domestic trafficking victims , as being non-agents , and domestic trafficking perpetrators , as being closely related to Indigenous women and girls .

I am saying that human trafficking legislation is an extension of the colonial agenda , should be re-examined , and that conflating these issues with MMIW is a problem . account .
