On Sunday , December 4 , the United States Army Corps of Engineers issued a memorandum denying the easement under Lake Oahe , a dam-controlled reservoir on the Missouri River that lies just half a mile upstream from the Standing Rock Reservation . What we do know is that the fight will continue on all fronts , and the best we can do is stay as informed as possible . That seems to be the multi-billion dollar question . The protest camp at Standing Rock . It seems that any efforts by Trump to reverse course would likely face a variety of legal and procedural hurdles that could delay construction indefinitely . On July 27 , 2016 , the Standing Rock Sioux initiated a lawsuit against the Army Corps of Engineers for having improperly issued permits authorizing the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross Lake Oahe . Arguing that the pipeline threatened their drinking water supply , ancestral lands and sacred sites , the Standing Rock Sioux sought a declaratory judgment and injunction and asserted claims based on the Clean Water Act , National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historic Preservation Act . Such a move , however , could flood the protest camps .

But , that is only the tip of the iceberg . ETP is also facing a major challenge to its TransPecos Pipeline Project in the Big Bend of Texas where they have falsely labeled it an intrastate pipeline even though it terminates in Mexico making it an International pipeline . ETP is facing huge objection from the people of West Texas , particularly the ranchers and farmers whose property would be seized by eminent domain to build the pipeline . I understand that some of the water protectors in North Dakota are now heading to Big Bend , where the air is warmer and the land is privately owned by people who will welcome their support in opposition to the pipeline . Meanwhile , on the economic front , many of the biggest banks financing Kelcy Warren and ETP have pulled their financing leaving ETP in a major financial hole at a time when cashflow is most needed . Everything is working against ETP , and hopefully these will kill the company . Reply Merrick says : December 24 , 2016 at 2:44 am This article mentions the possible water contamination for the Souix but fails to mention their water intake is more than 70 miles from the proposed DAPL crossing . Reply Andy G says : December 27 , 2016 at 7:47 pm Also fails to report how many thousands of people that also use the Missouri River for their water supply that are situated downstream . There was a figure that gave how many gallons per hour was going to be pushed through that 30 or 36 inch pipeline . How many hours will pass if a breech happens . Reply vicfurman says : December 28 , 2016 at 6:06 pm Trump Reply Marc says : December 28 , 2016 at 7:08 pm Merrick , apparently you are unaware of how water migrates . The World Heath Organization has places aniline tracer dyes in water in the United States and found that exact same water in Europe , Asia and Africa . A mere 70 miles is a pittance of distance . The Enbridge pipeline spill on Talmadge Creek in Michigan in 2010 , polluted all of Talmadge Creek plus at least 90 miles of the Kalamazoo River , killing over one million fish , birds and animals and driving about 40 families from their homes . You so easily dismiss the threats to those living downstream , but if it were YOUR water being threatened , then I would guess you would have a vastly different concern and perspective . It amazes me how easily you disregard the health and safety of others in your defense of a corrupt company who began building their pipeline BEFORE having secured the proper permits or having done the required environmental impact studies to determine potential threats . All that aside , as I already stated , ETP is already screwed because they will NOT open that pipeline in less than 72 hours , which puts them in technical default of their contractual obligations to their customers who counted on moving their oil through that pipeline . Reply Facts says : December 30 , 2016 at 10:23 pm Marc , you are sadly mistaken on this issue . Sorry to rain on your parade . Also , your comments on the shippers and oil prices are ridiculous . Oil is actually higher now than when the shipping commitments were made . No issue there . Lastly , the permits were issued . Jo Darcy , at Obamas command , ignored the actual Army Corp recommendation for final permitting and denied the permit . She has that power . However , unfortunately for the protesters , the new admin has the power to reinstate the already granted permit . It will stand in court against challenge , just like it did twice in Federal courts thus far . Face it , DAPL will be completed and this protest built on mistruths will end . This was never about the water . In addition to the extensions on the contracts , the claim protesters have made any impact on the financing is simply ridiculous . Laughable . Especially when other investors immediately snapped up those investments . The US Army Corp of Engineers validly and legally issued the permits for this project in June 2016 after a years long process . The Army Corp as directed by the Dept of Justice hacks Obama brought in reviewed the issuance of the permits and found them properly issued and legal . The DoJ scumbags were forced to admit the same in their early Dec release refusing to release the easement . And the District Court and Court of Appeals have agreed . There is ZERO legal basis to refuse the ministerial act of providing the easement document for the already approved easement for the Lake Oahe crossing . None . The Corp has NO DISCRETION to withhold an approved document . And the career Corp staff all know this . The Corps testified under oath to the Court that all requirements were legally met . The Court reviewed the record and agreed and an appeals panel affirmed . They now claim , after further consultation with the tribe , that an EIS is required . This claim is made despite NO NEW evidence being uncovered or presented . And perpetrates a fraud upon the Court . The Court chose to delay just long enough for the new admin to be able to act and undo the illegal actions by the Corp. . But Judge Boasberg also telegraphed a clear message to settle this . And set scheduling so it would be quickly addressed if the new admin does not timely act to resolve this . None . They only have to find that the decisions forced upon the Army Corp by the previous admin and their DoJ henchman are not supported by the record or the law . Which any first year law school student could do . Obama appointee Jo Darcy already know she is toast . The career staff at the Army Corp will be only to happy to help her out the door so they can try to get their reputation back . Reply WP says : January 15 , 2017 at 4:26 pm A. Scott , you fail to address the fact that the Corps has no legal RIGHT to issue such a permit , since Standing Rock retains the subsurface rights to the land that DAPL is supposed to go under . How many pipelines already exist under the Missouri River in the DAPL corridor . Just curious . We the people will lose . Water is the source of all life . With out water we all die . What good is money in your greedy pocket . You can not eat money -LRB- greed -RRB- or drink oil .
