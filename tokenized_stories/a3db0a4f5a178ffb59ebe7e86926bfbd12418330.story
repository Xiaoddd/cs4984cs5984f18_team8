More than 100 internal documents leaked to The Intercept by a TigerSwan contractor , as well as a set of over 1,000 documents obtained via public records requests , reveal that TigerSwan spearheaded a multifaceted private security operation characterized by sweeping and invasive surveillance of protesters . As policing continues to be militarized and state legislatures around the country pass laws criminalizing protest , the fact that a private security firm retained by a Fortune 500 oil and gas company coordinated its efforts with local , state , and federal law enforcement to undermine the protest movement has profoundly anti-democratic implications . Energy Transfer Partners has continued to retain TigerSwan long after most of the anti-pipeline campers left North Dakota , and the most recent TigerSwan reports emphasize the threat of growing activism around other pipeline projects across the country . The leaked documents include situation reports prepared by TigerSwan operatives in North Dakota , South Dakota , Iowa , Illinois , and Texas between September 2016 and May 2017 , and delivered to Energy Transfer Partners . The documents also provide extensive evidence of aerial surveillance and radio eavesdropping , as well as infiltration of camps and activist circles . TigerSwan did not respond to a request for comment . Photo : PowerPoint screen grab Additional documents , obtained via public records requests , consist of communications among agents from the FBI , the Department of Homeland Security , the U.S. Justice Department , the Marshals Service , and the Bureau of Indian Affairs , as well as state and local police . In the internal situation reports , TigerSwan operatives comment frequently about their routine coordination and intelligence sharing with law enforcement . Some of those named are well-known activists , while others have minimal public affiliation with the water protector movement . The situation reports also suggest that TigerSwan attempted a counterinformation campaign by creating and distributing content critical of the protests on social media . We are also publishing two additional situation reports dated October 16 and November 5 , along with PowerPoint presentations shared with law enforcement that correspond to the same dates . The names of private individuals whose actions are not already in the public record , or whose authorization we did not obtain , have been redacted to protect their privacy . The Intercept will publish the remaining situation reports in the coming weeks . The FBI did not respond to a request for comment . Police guard a bridge near Oceti Sakowin Camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation outside Cannon Ball , N.D. , on Dec. 3 , 2016 . The police became notorious for their use of so-called less than lethal weapons against demonstrators , including rubber bullets , bean bag pellets , LRAD sound devices , and water cannons . Other security firms working along the pipeline included Silverton , Russell Group of Texas , 10 Code LLC , Per Mar , SRC , OnPoint , and Leighton , documents show . TigerSwan then did so , but the board denied the application on December 19 . The fusion of public and private intelligence operations targeting water protectors was underway . Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier , who was regularly involved in policing the protests , also received at least one of the TigerSwan briefings . Danzeisen did not respond to a request for comment . As the water protector movement expanded from North Dakota to other states , so did the surveillance . Also in attendance were representatives of the Joint Terrorism Task Force , Department of Homeland Security , Iowa Department of Emergency Services , Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Iowa Department of Wildlife . Topics covered included the current threat assessment of the pipeline , the layout of current security assets and persons of interest . One of the daily intelligence updates notes plans to obtain night-vision goggles , LRADs , body armor , and FLIR -LRB- forward looking infrared -RRB- cameras . The reports also reveal a widespread and sustained campaign of infiltration of protest camps and activist circles . Throughout the leaked documents , TigerSwan makes reference to its intelligence-gathering teams , which infiltrated protest camps and activist groups in various states . TigerSwan agents using false names and identities regularly sought to obtain the trust of protesters , which they used to gather information they reported back to their employer , according to the TigerSwan contractor . The September documents make numerous references to Silverton personnel , who were overseen by TigerSwan , attending protests in Iowa . Silverton did not respond to a request for comment . On February 19 , TigerSwan makes explicit its plans to infiltrate a Chicago protest group . Perhaps one of the most striking revelations of the documents is the level of hostility displayed by TigerSwan toward the water protectors . TigerSwan consistently describes the peaceful demonstrators using military and tactical language more appropriate for counterterrorism operations in an armed conflict zone . TigerSwan pays particular attention to protesters of Middle Eastern descent . Haithem El-Zabri , a Palestinian-American activist singled out in the reports , was shocked to hear his name mentioned in that context . Such ethnic and religious profiling of protesters was not unusual . In an interview , 63-year-old Tomlin , who covers the local school board for the Galesburg , Illinois , Register-Mail , said he had set out to travel the length of the pipeline and write a story about it as a freelancer . Tomlin laughed at the notion that he was working with protesters . When he arrived at the camps in North Dakota , few people would talk openly with him . Cody Hall , a prominent native activist whose movements are tracked closely in the TigerSwan reports , told The Intercept he knew he was being followed whenever he left the camp . Robert Rice hosted a series of videos critical of the pipeline protest movement without disclosing that he was working for TigerSwan . The videos , which were posted on two Facebook pages , were taken down after The Intercept reached out to the firm for comment . The public relations mission quickly became a priority for the firm , documents show . On numerous occasions , TigerSwan agents stressed the need to change the public narrative established by protestors and to swing public support in favor of the pipeline . None responded .

Join Us Oil and Water Leaked documents and public records reveal a troubling fusion of private security , public law enforcement , and corporate money in the fight over the Dakota Access Pipeline . Research : Sheelagh McNeill and Talya Cooper . There surely will come a day of revolt on a mass scale . The police and military will ultimately be caught in the middle . The private contractors beholden to their own thirst for greed and power will serve the elite during the revolution to be sure . They outright guard them now and conduct counter-insurgency ops pre-revolution . Online media , including The Intercept , would have to feature prominently the solution to all societal problems , which is the reign of the heart over the ego , if we are to achieve sustained relief on any social problem . This means all negativity is purged , and replaced with pure positive , i.e. zero harm in all activities . The time is now . There is no other way . LRADs , for those who do not know , are high-intensity sound generators , which severely incapacitate those exposed , with capacity to generate permanent hearing loss , along with frequencies causing severe nausea . The first US internal use was documented in 2009 aimed at protestors against economic policies , US aggressive wars , climate policies , and more . While I can not speculate on these particular mobile weapons having the ability to dial in lethal levels , such lethal weapons have been developed , able to damage internal organs as well as eardrums , and are lethal Long Range Acoustic Devices . Counter Surveillance experience is also desired however , actual surveillance experience is a MUST . They quite literally attacked law enforcement and destroyed private property and took over public land . This is all well documented . This was all funded and coordinated by sources outside of North Dakota and Standing Rock . Sorry , I have zero tolerance for the antics of the protesters , who by the way ignored the democratic process during the democratic approval process . I applaud the actions of North Dakota law enforcement , who were forced into a very tough position by petty criminals posing as idealists . There is zero evidence for any of your statements . On the other , there is documentary evidence of the police and private security forces attacking unarmed protesters . Sorry I have zero tolerance for liars like you . I can see now who the troll is around here . You have no understanding of what went on . Just hush and go away . Will Parrish , a most Twertogian name you have got yourself there . But the chickens do have a way of coming home to roost . It seems they are creating the situation of it being more than security . But not now . This opinion discredits the entire court . Thank you for this , because this information would never find a place on state run propaganda networks . They have forgotten who they work for , and it is our fault . We allowed this to happen , and now we have to stand up against it . If we want Democracy we better start thinking differently and start to act like it . Private contractors are our future . The super wealthy elites will use them for their own protection . Local police are becoming increasingly militarized . Dissent will become criminal . Demonstrations will be blocked by military tactics . With all this endless left-right warring , people need to rally around the one little tiny center we have , which is this tiny portfolio of what rights that we have inherited from brave ancestors and somehow managed to keep our hands on so far . Simple as that . domain for a fucking ball field . They have Tackleberry syndrome . As an Australian citizen I find this kind of behaviour by the American authorities to be despicable and deplorable and a definite sign of a society in decline . Just like Rome , America as it is , will disappear . What those indigenous people were fighting for e.g. water and life on earth , will reign long after this corrupt America disappears . THIS IS COLONIAL ACTIVISM ON THE PART OF WALLSTREET CORPORAT THIEVES . This style of abuse of Mainstreet America is of THE VERY SAME TEMPLATE used to push WMD , used to rob Ameicans of homes , used to produce LIFG which resulted in the Manchester bombing and likely the bombings in France . Wallstreet thieves and their media whores who may have conspired with the DNC in such times and places so as to precipitate the MURDER OF SETH RICH . I am not so sure how you get from TigerSwan to Hillary . The Seth Rich murder by Hillary has been debunked . At the time of this article , private militias is the theme . Who knows what goes on behind the scenes . Certainly not myself . I do see mercenaries for hire are creeping into our homeland . Even Prince , head of Blackwater mercenary , is brother to De Vos has entered into this administration . The dots are beginning to line up . surveillance , intimidation and exploitation of internal schisms are par for the course . looking forward to the rest of this . In reading my old files of saved articles , I saw that the federal government used FBI . and DOJ departments in the movements against AIM . American Indian Movement , back in the 1970s and 1980s . We must free Pelletier now . He is a left over of these efforts . But this use of Tiger Swan is even worse . Thank you so much for this article . As I was leaving Standing Rock , I spoke to two white men , wearing masks , about a car with California license plates , that drove north , and then south , without looking out the window . I told the two young demonstrators I was concerned , that they were undercover . The one young man , had a dead expression in his eyes , instead of concern , and it reminded me of an undercover policeman at an ant-war demonstration in NYC , years ago , He had a dead expression , of boredom , in his eyes . I got in our car , and we drove north , to the airport . I was shaken . During these threats they try to recruit . Right now everyone with half a brain is protesting the lack of progress on the MURDER OF SETH RICH . A very simple case and the silence and suppression of the wallstreet whore media speaks volumes . They say the cover-up is worse . This is great , super informative reporting . The bland headline for the piece could be better , I think . That is , though peripheral to the issues of treaty , indigenous nation rights , care for the environment , etc. , of interest . One should perhaps act to assist voting , or speak encouraging those who are of voting age to do so . I remember Russ Means pointing out how those who live in the Lakota nation should function also engaged with the governance in place . One can generally expect , though , that many did . Commentors may not understand that North Dakota has MANY new and relatively temporary residents involved in the Bakken oilfield extraction , whose personal short-term interests are aligned with that of Trump and republican corporate interests . Without exploring demography and political demography of the massive influx , one can still presume that it may well be of such proportions that ND would have still gone overwhelmingly for Trump . You will have to explore the amazing frequency of spills that occur on pipelines . The indigenous native population of the USA remains the MOST discriminated against of all definable ethnic groups . While ethnicity is invidious , past history since the 1600s shows that discrimination was once the province of Euroamericans , against all other identifiable excluded group . Unfortunately now , it is the go-to of every self-identified ethnic group or individual . It has been shown that artificial light is harmful to ALL organisms evolved with diurnal cycles . That hell you see in the photo includes about 8 new wells drilled per day , for years now . THe dark middle of ND includes around the rez . Private firms working for the Oligarchs who intend on crushing citizens , ignoring laws , ignoring rights to free speech , and creating actual laws to hinder constitutional rights need to be addressed . We are at a turning point . The way it looks right now , it appears to have already gone dictator , giving the corporations more power and rule over citizens here , mimicking other third world nations who are in utter corruption and chaos right now . It may well be too late even to hold onto the threads of democracy we cling to now . the mentality of the private guards and the national guard was exactly the same . Agents shone searchlights on the tent villages at night and fired bullets into the tents at random , occasionally killing and maiming people . The steel-covered car was built in the CF&I plant in Pueblo , Colorado from the chassis of a large touring sedan . As strike-related violence mounted , Colorado governor Elias M. Ammons called in the Colorado National Guard on October 28 . Guard Adjutant-General John Chase , who had served during the violent Cripple Creek strike 10 years earlier , imposed a harsh regime . On March 10 , 1914 , the body of a replacement worker was found on the railroad tracks near Forbes , Colorado . The National Guard said that the man had been murdered by the strikers . In retaliation , Chase ordered the Forbes tent colony destroyed . The attack was launched while the inhabitants were attending a funeral of infants who had died a few days earlier . The strikers persevered until the spring of 1914 . By then , according to historian Anthony DeStefanis , the National Guard had largely broken the strike by helping the mine operators bring in non-union workers . The state had also run out money to maintain the Guard , and Governor Ammons decided to recall them . The power of special and corporate interests in the post-Citizens United era , the call for a convention poses a huge threat to the nation . As obomo ramped up his attacks on Americans for the last 8 years leftist cheered him using the IRS against the Tea Party , militarizing the dept of the interior , BLM and distributing military equipment to local law inforcement . Obomo normalized a hostile occupation force for just these types of situations . You are historically illiterate . 1 . See the FBI under J. Edgar , and , more recently , how the FBI orchestrated a plan to infiltrate , monitor and destroy Occupy . You are utterly ignorant . You never refuted the fact that leftists cheered the last 8 years as obomo militarized our local police and attacked the Tea Party which was my whole point . You never refuted the fact that leftists cheered the last 8 years as obomo militarized our local police and attacked the Tea Party which was my whole point . A great example of embedding the lie within a specious attack . When you respond to the attack , you tacitly accept the lie . The federal government will no longer provide heavy military equipment like tanks and grenade launchers to local cops following weeks of backlash against officers who confronted protesters in Ferguson , Missouri , in armored vehicles and camouflage last year , President Barack Obama said Monday . And if they want other , less-imposing military equipment , local law enforcement agencies will have to submit to stringent federal oversight and restrictions , according to the White House . Yet the idiots here continually respond to the provocation rather than the lie . No wonder they end up repeating Republican narratives as if true . Love the analysis . Good advise as well . Hillerysghost is very confused . Under rivers is not the best game plan . The most recent was in January 2015 , when the Poplar oil pipeline spilled 40,000 gallons of oil into the Yellowstone River in eastern Montana , contaminating water supplies for local residents and harming valuable fish and wildlife habitat . During the abbreviated cleanup of the Poplar spill , a total of 1,200 gallons of oil was allegedly recovered from the river . At the peak of the cleanup effort , a spokesman for Bridger Pipeline , the company that operates the Poplar Pipeline said that oil was being recovered at the rate of one teaspoon every ten minutes . At that pace , it would have taken 1,753 years to remove all the oil from the river . You speak about accidents of badly planned and badly maintained pipelines . Even if you argue that accidents are inevitable then compared to road or rail or tanker transportation even these accidents are relatively small . Nearly two million people die from a lack of safe drinking water every year . Our planet does contain over a billion trillion litres of water . But very little of that is safe to drink . Of the fresh water that remains , over two thirds is locked away in ice caps and glaciers . Most of the rest is trapped in soil or underground aquifers . That leaves a tiny fraction available for us to use . Almost everything we do involves water in some way . No computers or mobile phone or television. , that can not be produced without the oil left in the ground . Welcome back to the stone age . we need to do those things , and not attack people protesting business as usual and protecting their homes , using vile and illegal private security companies -LRB- or vile and illegal actions by official government employees . Personal attacks like this show a complete lack of any legitimate position . That said , first and foremost you are wrong : there was trading and bartering thousands of years before industrial society or oil . Moreover , to respond to your BS , I would gladly give up all of the things that you mentioned in exchange for a compete global ban on oil extraction . The right thing to do regarding transportation is to immediately stop all new oil drilling leases , both onshore and off - , and to invest enough money in public transit projects -LRB- including public works if needed -RRB- to provide adequate public transit everywhere . Educating women -LRB- getting them PhDs is best -RRB- and empowering them -LRB- free and completely unrestricted access to birth control and abortion -RRB- are the least coercive ways to accomplish this , but countries with spoiled and self-entitled populations like the U.S. will probably also need a one-child-family policy of carrots and sticks like the immensely successful one in China . There was life , even human life , way before all of this crap , and the Earth was in much better shape then . Some of this is very long-term . So some of this will take hundreds or even thousands of years . Sorry for my slow comprehension . we need to get off fossil fuels as quickly as possible . This is a fascinating , important and well-reported story . And here it is , in featured position , with a couple hundred comments . Meanwhile , there is also this story , published today on The Intercept : Villagers Say Yemeni Child Was Shot as He Tried to Flee Navy SEAL Raid Five civilians including a child were killed and another five were wounded in the latest U.S. Navy SEAL raid in Yemen , according to eyewitness accounts gathered by The Intercept . The raid by U.S. commandos in the hamlet of al Adhlan , in the Yemeni province of Mareb on May 23 , also destroyed at least four homes . Navy SEALs , with air support from more than half a dozen attack helicopters and aircraft , were locked in a firefight with Yemeni tribesmen for over an hour , according to local residents . Details from five eyewitnesses in the village conflict with statements made by the Department of Defense and U.S. Central Command , which have not acknowledged that civilians were harmed ... Let us not massacre and maim these people further , citizens . We have done enough . There are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world , only a very tiny fraction of which ever grow up to kill Americans . We all have our priorities . For me , they are , in order of importance : 1 -RRB- protecting and restoring the natural environment ; 2 -RRB- protecting traditional indigenous people and their land ; and 3 -RRB- opposing war . Your goals are noble and righteous , but your ordering of priorities is confused . If you want to serve your first two goals , you need to start by opposing war . But my priorities are not confused . The Earth comes first , for both moral and pragmatic reasons . A test conducted somewhat recently found that no U.S. military person who would have to take the physical action that would launch a nuclear weapon would actually do so . Moreover , the root causes of all environmental problems , including war , are overpopulation and overconsumption . War is a symptom of this , not a cause , as are the problems that you outlined . Wars are mainly fought for resources -LRB- directly like oil , or indirectly like Afghanistan -RRB- , which is overconsumption . Additionally , the order of these priorities is minor compared to the fact that I prioritize them over all other issues . I am very strongly and unequivocally opposed to war , and have spent countless hours in the streets demonstrating against wars , starting with the Vietnam war when I was in high school . THAT is the best thing any American can do to oppose war . If you want to stop a power plant , same thing . What these protesters were trying to do amounts to a giant act of theft . We are sick and tired of pests wanting to satisfy their whims for free . That is comedic genius . whims . trying to make sure they have potable water . atlas shrugged was a long , turgid fantasy that some idiots take seriously . kept the author in spare change till it was time for her to avail herself of government support . People like YOU are the thieves . All land in the Americas and Australia was stolen . They were bootleggers . Perhaps you never heard of MURDER , INC. . The methods of population control and domination have not changed in the US . In some way , the rise of private armies in the US to kill protesters seems congruant to the murder of Seth Rich . The reward for Who Murdered Seth Rich keeps going up . The lack of leads itself points to a likely CIA . Surely the NSA has the details in their archives . Here is yet another piece for the jigsaw puzzle . I mean , like that woman who told on Monica Lewinsky , or the goons who kept going after Hillary Clinton for wanting to have some private email . hmmm . That kind of figures in . Same with Vince Foster . They dont kill repubs because 1 . it is too easy to get the repubs to wave the flag for war , they are more likely to do the killing than be the victim . 2 . political orientation differences would cause internal power struggles They Keeping it simple , in the family . CFR indoctrination , conditioning , molding . But fair-mindedness of dems makes them vulnerable to be branded as betrayers . Hannity has been reported to be in hiding since advertisers started leaving his program . The truth is , the idea that Seth Rich was murdered because he either was or was suspected of being the leaker of the emails makes a heck of a lot of sense . Killing a supposed traitor helps keep everyone else in line . Perhaps Hannity is simply gullible and stupid . It is certainly difficult to rule that out . If these people were really good they might have leaked the document themselves . Are you guys -LRB- at Tigerswan -RRB- that smart or just a bunch of second tier office jockeys . Manuer . And it could have easily been so very different . But perhaps I am guilty of idealizing my vision of the Clinton administration , which of course seems alluring compared to the gritty reality of President Trump . But perhaps I am guilty of idealizing my vision of the Clinton administration , which of course seems alluring compared to the gritty reality of President Trump . Your fantasy that Trump and Clinton are the same is all in your mind . An invention . Meanwhile the lives Trump and the Republicans destroy as they sell the country to the highest bidders will not be fixed by your false equivalences or your lame attempts at sarcastic inversion . You should at least acknowledge your own role in this political shitstorm that drowns decency with dishonesty and dumbshittery . Even your pathetic attempt to squirm away from yourself reveals you . You wanted this , you got it . Yes . She was SoS for four years . Certainly she had ample opportunity . I suppose anything is possible . Revisionist history is not my specialty . Trump sold our infrastructure for 20billion Saudis Public Investments Fund . Blackstone is headed by Schwarzman a long time friend of Trump who has an estate near the Florida retreat . So , now all our bridges , road , sidewalks , etc. will be used to collect tolls , etc. from us and the profits will go to the Saudis via Blackstone . Bit by bit , our country is being sold off to the highest bidder . The real truth of it is that we were given disasterous choice 1 versus disasterous choice 2 ; it was going to be tragic no matter whether if it was Trump elected or Clinton . We Progressives warned you Liberals that Hillary would lose to Trump . Of course , no Progressive could ever vote for Trump , but knowing what I know about Hillary , I could NEVER have voted for her ; she was a stupid choice for a candidate . What makes more sense right now is to build consensus for a rational relationship between We , The People , and the ultra-rich . First , I voted for Sanders in caucus . I understand and share some of the concerns about Clinton you express . I understand why people find her unappealing . But to say she and Trump are equally disastrous is just incredible . Trump is insane . Literally , clinically insane . Even now , even at this very moment , the august and sagacious poobahs of US punditry discuss whether Steve Bannon , Mike Pence , or Jared Kushner should be more involved in advising and restraining Trump . Think about that . I am speechless . As far as nuclear war with Russia , that is straight from FSB . Mutually Assured Distruction -LRB- MAD -RRB- still regulates the use of nukes . The very , very last thing Russia , the US , or any other nuclear nation wants is unpredictability . Read something about MAD to understand why unpredictability is so dangerous in a nuclear world . So do I. And ruination is exactly the future we confront . This story is a perfect example of why there has been so little protests . A reordering of economic activity is vital to creating a workable world free of the poison of the ultra rich . So much for freedom under capitalism . And look what a great job the capitalists have done as stewards of great wealth . Trash everywhere . Polluted air . Filthy water , dying corals . Yup love those god fearing moneygrubbers at the top . This stuff seems too obvious to be excused as sloppy surveillance . After that , the rest is easy . We were outnumbered . This is a big reason why so many veterans mobilized to Standing Rock . Intimidation . This was not lost on the Canadian government which had been fighting a losing battle against public protest of all manners including pipelines , in large part due to the reluctance of our police and courts to move against protesters . Further , this moved such suspects into the purview of the Canadian security and intelligence agencies which operate in secret and use disruption tactics on those that it targets . No muss , no fuss . It all has been removed from the public eye and the courts by secrecy . Nothing to see here folks , move along , move along . If I share an Intecept article , the graphics appear on fb . However , when I visit the real site here I see nothing but pitch black where the graphics should be . I usually ignore him , but I get why some do do snark . When the government is also a private company . Tiger Swan has grown through the years , like so many other predatory agencies , because the State Department has poured tens of millions of tax dollars into the company . The Obama administration did this . Now I understand why he did not let Leonard Peltier out of prison , because giving Native American any kind of hope would be dangerous to people fighting to make money off the environment . Presidents are not willing to have the FBI revolt against them , even if the price of keeping the FBI on their side is failing to do the right thing like freeing Peltier . You should give her a call . She will be happy to hear from you . She must be a recluse and in need of a companion . It was first published in 1983 ... As an aside , however , note that the private security contractors -LRB- Tigerswan , Silverton , etc. -RRB- that Kelcy Warren , CEO of ETP , hired in an attempt to disrupt the anti-pipeline protesters were also trying to undermine farmers who opposed the pipeline along its entire route . Their opposition was based on the threat to agicultural land posed by oil spills . Part of their agenda was to keep this group of mostly white rural farmers and ranchers from politically coordinating with Native American reservation residents whose water supplies were threatened by oil spills . There are some interesting legal questions here , however . First is , this is an example of paramilitary organizations hired by a billionaire to infiltrate and attack peaceful protest groups , operating in cooperation with North Dakota law enforcement groups and the U.S. Department of Justice without legal licenses . This seems to fall into this category of activity : ... That article is about mostly right-wing anti-government militias that were notorious for involvement in things like the Oklahoma City bombing in the 1990s . Pity that our law enforcement agencies tend to side with them and against peaceful people attempting to exercise their constitutional rights . I hope you enjoy the thirty pieces of silver you got for helping destroy the environment and democracy . Thomas Jefferson questioned the problem with basing an economy on the profits derived from surplus . The Native American culture abhorred the practice of hoarding . There is a better way to foster a healthy human society that justly serves its members , other than one that resembles the functionality of the insect or animal kingdoms . Capitalistic society promotes and protects materialism , racism , and militarism . A healthy human society could promote and protect fulfilling meaningful needs , community , and harmony . Capitalistic society promotes an educational and propaganda system that keeps the empowered secure by the masses serving the few . A healthy human society promotes what is needed to enlighten and inspire its people to serve each other in a way that spreads a sharing of fruitfulness . This case is the epitome of a canary in a coal mine . And that canary is feet up . This canary is no more . It has ceased to be . This is a late canary . Bereft of life , it rests in peace . This is an ex-canary . No wonder I was -LRB- and am being -RRB- followed . Not that it would matter . The American Public seems fine with most of it . Either out of apathy and fear of not knowing what to do about it -LRB- a lot like how the German People felt while Hitler did his thing , but never gets mentioned -RRB- , or because those folks are not boat rockers . They could yank folks out of their homes and shoot them dead in the streets . Yeah . I know a few of those folks . One in particular , in fact . This matters . All of it . Everything leading up to it as well . This report should be all over the national and local news . Bought . Through fear , phony patriotism , greed , and viability . Nope . That have monied interests in that project . That has already spent millions on its production . That Slippery Slope just turned into an express lane with no foreseeable obstacles . The Scandinavian model is the solution . Denmark , Iceland are not Stalinist hellholes . Social democrats are not fascists . what if you take away gov. Get them out of business all together ; make political pay very small . You nailed it . They were also his best work . He was right that capitalism sucks , but his solutions , while seemingly moral and correct , were not . We can see the same problems with civil service workers in this country . A much better solution than the government owning everything -LRB- communism -RRB- is worker-owned coops . It was interesting to see the way they describe their jobs and services . To really understand this situation you should compare the treatment between the Water Protectors and the Patriot Movement . A great number of these protesters were heavily armed and they had set up sniper positions directed at the federal agents at a road block in effect threatening the lives of law enforcement officers -LRB- if a police officer can use deadly force because they feel threatened by and shoot dead unarmed person then this would seem to be a case where the use of deadly force would be expected -RRB- . The FBI backed down and withdrew and the protesters went on to public property and released the cattle . Some of the same group went on to Oregon and took over the wildlife refuge and got the same kid glove treatment . Compare that to the treatment of the Standing rock protestors and it is obvious that Law Enforcement and the Legal system is a repressive force whose primary mission is protecting the interests of those that own this country and not the citizens of this country . In the past when law enforcement faced armed protestors it was common that the national guard would be called out . There are instances in the past where the NG open fired with machine guns on protesters and in some cases even brought in artillery to protests . Now we see local police being militarized so local law enforcement does not need the out side approval needed to call out the national guard and they can still face down citizen protests with over whelming force . Of course they only use that force against those they see as a threat . He who makes peaceful protest impossible makes armed revolution inevitable . It treats everyone equally unequal compared to white male euro-americans -LRB- though there is a hierarchy of oppression -RRB- . When protesters peacefully object , treating them as terrorists is an injustice and a crime . The hope is that if you treat them as terrorists , they will eventually start acting like terrorists . The US military has spent the past decade training in counterinsurgency techniques . Everyone is excited by the prospect of a domestic insurgency and the opportunity to try out their new techniques . Someone should tattle to the Tea Party about this crap . They are one faction within the Republican party who will not stand for this . The same tea party that put Paul Ryan & Stephen miller where they are have made it perfectly clear they care about an agenda of alt right extremism first & foremost . With this report , you have provided an extremely important public service to anyone who cares about democracy and who is concerned about the undue influence of corporations . Thank you for this very thorough and important reporting . Sadly , US pipeline companies have been going down this road for decades now . This protects the pipeline company in court if things get sticky . And yes the local , state and federal authorities are no match for these hired bullies . They will play your local police chief like a fiddle , your sheriff and your city council too . The quality of the bunkum they spread is often laughably lacking , but they stick to what works and get results : pipelines in the ground , victims silenced , business as usual . That is very true . One hell of a report ; hoping this report is picked up and widely circulated . This report leaves me believing that all is lost . The destruction of our society would be the final result . Hopelessness is not a feeling that I am willing to get accept . I guess I did not see this coming to this extent so I am a fool . Still stunned . Maybe they are already here . Well , either there will be some kind of upheaval , or revolution or we doomed . Maybe of the society that we know and are a part of with some type of positive re-birth -LRB- hopefully positive that is to say -RRB- , but the other route -LRB- not doing anything at all -RRB- insures the destruction of not only society but everything . Take care . Probably not . He relies on what the media reports just like the rest of us . I voted for Bernie -LRB- absentee -RRB- in the California Primary . Anyway , after he sold out to the Ice Queen I was done with him . Just another politician in my book . It comes with the territory . Their positions demand that in reality they are not loyal to their constituents . They all speak with forked tongues . It certainly makes me not trust him . He was frozen when it came to foreign policy , especially history . It was as though the cat had his tongue . And for that matter , he failed in any discussion of Indochina . He just said the word Indochina and that was it . Then he smiled.He never described the Kissinger policy in Latin America , never . He knew , and he said nothing . He had the opportunity , the cameras were rolling , we were waiting on the edges of our seats . This is a very detailed writeup , The Intercept . Oh , btw : fuck off , TigerSwan . Once again law enforcement shows that corporations matter more than people . The wars in Southeast Asia and the Middle East , come home to roost . This is where those wars were directed , in the end . People feel these things , but hesitate to talk about it for fear of being labelled as conspiracy theorist . Unfortunately , what is described in the comment above is in fact what is going on . Eric Prince , Blackwater owner , is sister to Dept. of Education Secretary Besty DeVos . This is where the editorial privilege to censor identities of law enforcement may conflict with the public interest . The publication of this information may be one of the only means of effectively responding to such there is . That includes being potentially privy to whether an individual within their group has previously gone undercover and stifled the rights of protestors before . The Constitution is the foundation on which the country is built . The spirit of the Constitution is that the people should be protected from an overbearing government . The Constitution is being ripped to shreds by the FBI , DEA , NSA , military , and private contractors . King George was never this powerful . Sticking to science , reason and rationality is critical . I would be interested to know the exact basis for your certainty that there are no chemtrails . I was in the unusual position of seeing a friend of mine become obsessed about chemtrails . She even convinced me and number of her other friends that they existed . She was considered an authority about them on the Internet . Unfortunately , we watched her more and more paranoid , including suspicious of friends . To try to help her I undertook a huge -LRB- for me -RRB- internet research project on chemtrails . During the course of it I discovered a bunch of her buttressing points that had garnered my belief were simply phoney , and my conclusion was that chemtrails did not exist . I mean , I see them . Daily . Could be , but not sure . Then , the skies become sprayed . Back and forth . Large swaths of cross sectioning going on . As I watched through time , I noticed how those white lines turn fuzzy and wide . They feather out , actually . After watching this happen from time to time , you get used to seeing the patterns and what happens in the aftermath of that seeding . Eventually , they begin looking like actual clouds . If you never paid attention to what actual clouds LOOK LIKE , that is . Anyway , so here is my more direct question : so like that day I noticed all this activity in the skies overhead , there was no other clouds in the area . No REAL clouds , anyway . Sue me . One simple one is that other forms of air pollution are responsible for the depositions of whatever materials that are settling out . We are worse than Stalinist Russia in some regards , because on the one hand the corporate media reported on these protests with no hint of an agenda and are complicit with the narrative supplied by these idiots . This reminds me of Northern Ireland when the British worked with private militias . Those militias ended up killing innocent people . When it was finally laid out in the open David Cameron claimed he was outraged . I had the gas co remove my meter years ago . I cant comment on this without mentioning the use of firewood at the camps and that wood burned petro to get hauled there . Almost completely . Thank you for helping Mother Earth . I think I am well informed on the history of our country and present day . We still are . An informed public can fight back . We just have to do it together . I am so angry after reading this article I can hardly think of anything else . Even knowing how our govt works today and in the past , I still can not believe the inhumanity , the greed , the incidents of ignoring our Constitution . We have a duty today to stop this attack on our constitution . It is our responsibility . Vote them all out , protest when you can , and fight for our rights , that we are so close to losing . Your mistake is the intention of the constitution . The constitution presented to the states did not contain the bill of rights . The BoRs were force negotiated into the constitution by the representatives of the people in the legislatures of the states . The argument about whether or not the rich and power should rule was not the issue , the issue was how to protect the people against the R&P . But 37 other banks have directly financed DAPL . That was made possible by the Obama-Republican joint effort to lift restrictions on exporting U.S. oil & gas , passed in 2015 . Trump is really just picking up where they left off -LRB- as his love-in with the Saudis should make clear -RRB- . Thank you for this link and info . Never mind the treatment of native amerucans since the founding of the united states . The u.s. goverment among other things used mercenaries , the F.B.I , C.I.A. , ARMORED PERSONEL CARRIERS AND TANKS , and promoted a conflict and armed two sides resulting in a civil war that killed hundreds of people INSIDE THE UNITED STATES . All using tactics developed in vietnam and other cold war conflicts . This is not new . It is only new to the rest of america that stuck their heads in the sand while it happened to native americans for over 200 years . I can feal the dead indian elders rolling their eyes at just how naive you all are about the united states of america and what it realy stands for . I can feel dead coal miners rolling their eyes at just how naive you are . Yeah , I pretty much agree . The above article is incredibly important , a stellar example of investigative journalism at its finest . Further , I , too , thought of the Pinkertons ; the historical parallels are obvious . But the piece is hardly flawed for not being a comprehensive history of private policing assisting corporate greed and law enforcement in America . I think the investigative work by these journalists is superb . The story will hopefully encourage further study . Instead of two Political Parties working together By , Of and FOR The People they are each working against each other . The chickens have come home to roost . This looks like a privatized Counter Intelligence Program , or is it more like the Pinkerton Detective Agency . Now we have wealthy corporat interests hiring other like-corporations in the business of taking down democratic ways and means . Taking everything into account i am reminded of any species of bird that do some really amazing nest building , a home to live . we are birds , giant carnivorous birds , and we can fly . There is no reason under the sun why people should tolerate mercenaries within our society . We need to mount a national effort to rid ourselves of these cowards with guns . There is no reason why any member of the public should pay any attention to any mercenary attempting to express authority over the populace . He should be shoved out of the way . He has no right whatsoever , to impede public expression of dissent . This country belongs to all of us , not just to those who can afford illegal , private , armies . Wellsaid . Anyone remotely paying attention , except republican conservatives , could see the playbook they were using . All these prople wanted to do was keep big business off their kand and out of their water and once again , white businees men stole from them in a most heinous way . I am still amazed the security company did not massacre men women snd children and blame it one the people killed . ASHAMED TO BE AN AMERICAN . Certainly not . The white man is the greediest animal to ever set foot on the American continents . From cutting the trees down , plowing the land up , polluting the air and waters and slaughtering the other animals everything the white man has done with or to the land has been favorable only to themselves and detrimental or destructive to all of the other living things on the land who had as much right to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness as did the white man . More disinformation and deception . Anyway Mona I noticed you mentioned McClatchy so I thought you might find this interesting . Now that is over a year old video from 2016 . Hell , all I have is a water pistol . Find the protestors and kill them . Not all but many are Native Americans . So kill them . I never imagined Americans would be treated like this , even native Americans who have long been singled out for special abuse by our governments . This clearly is the future of how any protesters opposing government-industry dictatorship will be treated . Sadly , it is only part of a very dark shadow moving over the Earth . Of course the government used military-style counterterrorism measures at Standing Rock . Anyone who does not go along with corporate , uh , I mean government desires , is at risk ; and anyone who would dare publicly protest is a terrorist . Some water might be wet . I bet Trump nationalizes the many assorted militias to be paid brown-shirts . The militarization of police forces is bound to implode eventually , but perhaps this would present a way for concerned but heavily armed citizens , their being conservative-voting Christians purely incidental , to be deputized so they can feel like they are contributing . They would proudly protect their communities from terrorism through assisting law enforcement with harassing , beating , raping , robbing and murdering anti-establishment dissidents , immigrants and refugees , journalists , and anybody else who looks at their bruised egos funny . Seriously , we have the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association pushing for law enforcement officers around the country to refrain from enforcing gun-control laws . We have the FBI pushing Shared Responsibility Committees , which will invariably lead to lynch mobs . I can so see this happening . A good companion read from The Intercept in 2015 : MANUFACTURING TERROR : An FBI Informant Seduced Eric McDavid Into a Bomb Plot . Maybe in the name of the Earth Liberation Front . Or maybe not . Fitting for the muddied plot , their motivation was as unclear as their targets . Anna even provided the recipe for homemade explosives , drawn up by FBI bomb experts . Members of the group suggested , in conversations with her , that they regarded her as their leader . Last November , federal prosecutors admitted they had potentially violated rules of evidence by withholding approximately 2,500 pages of documents from McDavid . No wonder the US is losing in the middle east . This is disturbing on so many levels , especially considering the fact that this was , to my recollection , a totally peaceful protest by the Water Protectors . These assholes were expecting war . Great and excellent reporting . This must be disseminated everywhere . Thank you . Of course you are correct . An ignoramus spews : This is happening across this country to everyday Americans too . Search engines are your friend . If Marcy has an argument contra , she needs to set it forth . There is no doubt , now . A totally disgusting series of actions . These aholes TigerSwan need to have their asses shut down . What a disgusting group of subhumans . We are awash with people who serve no useful social or economic function , completely cut off from the real economy and value creation . Truly pathetic . About 3 years ago i worked for The Department of Health in Florida , you can look up the address 1105 E Kennedy Blvd. Bylaw you have to give a statement on accident . They literally went into the insurance companys system and tried to destroy my verbal claim of the accident and who was involved -LRB- multiple agencies -RRB- . I learned they were doing this many years ago and prepared and knew this would happen . Just more proof tampering with evidence . Should sound familiar to you as there are those on here who work with this site doing the EXACT same thing which was done in my fase . I lost my job of 20 years and will clear my name and the others who have come foward for years only to be laughed at , especially on this site by the very same people telling us to come forward . In order to tell a factual insane story which slowly some are waking up to you have to know the issues and present the evidence in a manner in which the deceived public would believe and realize we have been waiting for years and tired of the other idiots , who are telling the truth , but sound like idiots because they have no clue whats going on . Unfortunately , most people are complete idiots to begin with . Again the accidents and police report paper shown in some of the videos is real and you as a nobody can verify if this is BS or not . Sorry so long i wrote this very fast as a response , but go watch the movie called Spotlight or read up on it . What other things are right before our very eyes for YEARS only to be covered up and hidden , but all institutions of power who were supposed to protect the innocent were the very ones doing the hidious acts . ALL HIDDEN FOR DECADES until someone got off their lazy ass and did some real journalism . Pathetic . And yet , doing that is good practice for making a convincing argument . Also just in case things go wrong that way you can wait six months or so and start over from the beginning if you have to . When they call you a terrorist it is used as a pretext to justify terrorizing you . Here is a list of narcissistic abuse tactics for you to compare with the counterterrorism manuals on wikileaks . We are a Constitutional Republic . Instead they are ALLOWED to use the authority that was delegated to the branch or to a named Office within a branch for as long as they do the duties as described in the contract , take and KEEP the Oath to support and defend the US Constitution before the orders of superiors of any level , and before the duties of the position they occupy . That way the PERSON serving is no longer serving , and has power . Under the US Constitution they are ALLOWED to use power of the position they occupy for as long as they follow the contract . That is also why the push for a Con Con -LRB- Article 5 Convention -RRB- . If they do not even know what type of government they have , they are easily controlled and power usurped . Okay , from what I understand , that was actually war committed against the American people as the people were doing a constitutionally PROTECTED action . Van Horne v. Dorrance , 2 Dall . 304 . Ellingham v. Dye , 231 U. S. 250 . Du Pont v. Vanhorne v. Dorrance , supra . Before you say that the US Constitution means nothing , understand that the enemies of freedom have been working since the inception of our nation to destroy it . Color of law . The appearance or semblance , without the substance , of legal right . It was written to establish a Federal Government and to place the boundaries by which that government would operate . -LRB- June 25 , 1948 , ch . 645 , 62 Stat . 696 ; Pub . 11 , 1968 , 82 Stat . 75 ; Pub . 4396 ; Pub . 1970 , 2109 , 2113 , 2147 ; Pub . Summary : Section 242 of Title 18 makes it a crime for a person acting under color of any law to willfully deprive a person of a right or privilege protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States . Persons acting under color of law within the meaning of this statute include police officers , prisons guards and other law enforcement officials , as well as judges , care providers in public health facilities , and others who are acting as public officials . It is not necessary that the crime be motivated by animus toward the race , color , religion , sex , handicap , familial status or national origin of the victim . The offense is punishable by a range of imprisonment up to a life term , or the death penalty , depending upon the circumstances of the crime , and the resulting injury , if any . The reason for that is : The government of the United States is that set of actions by public officials that are consistent with the Constitution . Outside of its constitutional powers , the government of the United States has no legitimacy . It has no authority ; and , it really even has no existence . It is what lawyers call a legal fiction . They are its disabilities ; what it does not have legal authority to do . It guarantees freedom of speech , freedom of press , freedom of religion . This kind of reporting is why I read the Intercept . Great work , guys . Fascism at its best . Thank you both the whistleblower and the Intercept . The big pay day for counterinsurgency firms like TigerSpawn will be when their infiltrators have fully trained the protestors in terrorist techniques and provided them with weapons of mass destruction . Then the demand for counterinsurgency services will go through the roof . Investors should be patient , however . But they are methodically laying the groundwork for a future when counterinsurgency will be a major industry . One question : This is happening across this country to everyday Americans too . That actually does seem to be the case . I see your reality check daily when I look out my window , dude . Need a reality check , go tell a cop to his face what you think of the police state . An ignoramus spews : This is happening across this country to everyday Americans too . Search engines are your friend . People need a story . This coalesces all of the points really well . You want to point to a story that needs covering , write to any of the TI staff ; I am sure they will welcome your great suggestions . His name is getting dragged out by conservative and rightwing mouth pieces as a possible FBI Director . His name should be equated to the DAPL disaster and the foul things that happened there . I got that part . Thank you for linking his name to the position . Thank you for answering the question that arose as I read the article as to why this leak at this time . It was a beautiful lie and we became gullible . Together with so many others in the spy-industrial complex , they need to lobby legislatures for draconian unconstitutional legislation , and intimidate away the best and brightest of the protesters , the people with peaceful ethics who care more about the environment than coming out on top . They need to start a process of selection much like what happened in Iraq , where ordinary troops give way to villains and villains give way to monsters . That is their duty to the money god , and the money god does not tolerate shirk or laxity . Environmentalists , not always inaccurately , can sometimes be presented as careerists or racketeers . And of course the whole thing is a chance for them to try to hype up some kind of competitive technology and ostensibly progressive ethics . They could do SO much better for themselves that way than by letting their underlings go out farming insurgencies . That is what the companies risk when start escalating the force and risk involved with these issues . Democracy becomes disrespectable , and there is always somebody on hand waiting to peddle something else . Still , there WERE bullets flying past and they could have killed ; we should not forget this . This is just excellent reporting by the intercept . terrorism is such a flexible word . Capitalism and corporations operate in direct opposition to this concept , and seek to coopt or remove any check or constraint on their power . Time to re-paint . Hardly a market free of government coercion . THAT by itself , acts as a constraint on the power of corporations . Start with Adam Smith . After Adam Smith , they could also try some parts of F.A. Hayek conservatives and libertarians prefer to ignore . No True Scotsman fallacy . If only Democrat financiers such as Warren Buffett had invested their hedge funds in the pipeline , instead of The Burlington and Northern railroad that burns fossil fuels in order to transport fossil fuels , then this whole debacle would never have happened . Your gratuitous remark about Democratic donor -LRB- financiers -RRB- Warren Buffett is a bit of a red herring here . If more people accepted that trains were safer , which they are not , people should be more willing to accept pipelines , which they are not . Oil is becoming as unsafe as nuclear waste . It destroys the environment . Past time to leave it in the ground . Go back to troll school . That is an apt description of the modern US military . It is a military tactic to be deployed against enemy military forces , not civilians . Using counterinsurgency tactics against the citizens of the US , is illegal , in the US . Well , in theory anyway . . . so use your best judgement . The Patriot Act and the NDAA were implemented to take care of the illegality . Shocking new video footage shows what appears to be a private security contractor wielding an AR-15 rifle , and members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe have since stated that the man attempted to enter one of the main encampments . Imagine Blackwater vs. TigerSwan , and , all the chaos they can cause within governmental agencies conferring with them . There are secure software packages out there that will provide ample intrusion protection , these packages involve encryption . Tor , protonmail , VPN , Tails , just to mention a few more options , plus a twenty-two character password generator . With net neutrality falling by the wayside , people have to find new internet platform levels for private communications , similar to Onion -LRB- dark web -RRB- . The idiots on both sides will rule the day . In my community if idiot spies were put here to observe us for our opinions one of our idiots might do something rude and you might not get a local jury of twelve to convict our own idiot . This for both sides is a dangerous game for any but the coolest heads with good knowledge of the mites and bounds of the law . This is the exception not the rule , when fertile ground for idiots is created there will be plenty to go round . We are in the midst of a massive disruption of ecology and a mass extinction of species . These toy soldiers may think they are having their day , but in fact they and their families will soon feel the force of ecology all around them . And that is caused by burning oil . Reality has a certain way of speaking last . If that . The Dakota Pipeline situation is perhaps an early look at a new revenue stream for these well connected entities that will continue regardless of the war-on-terror . surely will come a day of revolt on a mass scale . The police and military will ultimately be caught in the middle . The private contractors beholden to their own thirst for greed and power will serve the elite during the revolution to be sure . They outright guard them now and conduct counter-insurgency ops pre-revolution . I can see now who the troll is around here . You have no understanding of what went on . media , including The Intercept , would have to feature prominently the solution to all societal problems , which is the reign of the heart over the ego , if we are to achieve sustained relief on any social problem . This means all negativity is purged , and replaced with pure positive , i.e. zero harm in all activities . The time is now . There is no other way . Personal attacks like this show a complete lack of any legitimate position . That said , first and foremost you are wrong : there was trading and bartering thousands of years before industrial society or oil . So some of this will take hundreds or even thousands of years . But my priorities are not confused . The Earth comes first , for both moral and pragmatic reasons . War is a symptom of this , not a cause , as are the problems that you outlined . the order of these priorities is minor compared to the fact that I prioritize them over all other issues . I am very strongly and unequivocally opposed to war , and have spent countless hours in the streets demonstrating against wars , starting with the Vietnam war when I was in high school . should perhaps act to assist voting , or speak encouraging those who are of voting age to do so . You will have to explore the amazing frequency of spills that occur on pipelines . That hell you see in the photo includes about 8 new wells drilled per day , for years now . On the other , there is documentary evidence of the police and private security forces attacking unarmed protesters . Counter Surveillance experience is also desired however , actual surveillance experience is a MUST . They quite literally attacked law enforcement and destroyed private property and took over public land . This is all well documented . This was all funded and coordinated by sources outside of North Dakota and Standing Rock . Sorry , I have zero tolerance for the antics of the protesters , who by the way ignored the democratic process during the democratic approval process . He was frozen when it came to foreign policy , especially history . It was as though the cat had his tongue . And for that matter , he failed in any discussion of Indochina . He just said the word Indochina and that was it . knew , and he said nothing . But the chickens do have a way of coming home to roost . Trump sold our infrastructure for 20billion Saudis Public Investments Fund . Blackstone is headed by Schwarzman a long time friend of Trump who has an estate near the Florida retreat . So , now all our bridges , road , sidewalks , etc. will be used to collect tolls , etc. from us and the profits will go to the Saudis via Blackstone . am not so sure how you get from TigerSwan to Hillary . The Seth Rich murder by Hillary has been debunked . At the time of this article , private militias is the theme . Who knows what goes on behind the scenes . Certainly not myself . I do see mercenaries for hire are creeping into our homeland . Even Prince , head of Blackwater mercenary , is brother to De Vos has entered into this administration . contractors are our future . The super wealthy elites will use them for their own protection . Local police are becoming increasingly militarized . Dissent will become criminal . Demonstrations will be blocked by military tactics . until this opinion , I was generally willing to argue for the efficacy of the FISC -LRB- even while arguing the job could and should be devolved to district courts for more rigorous testing of the law -RRB- . But not now . Perhaps Hannity is simply gullible and stupid . two million people die from a lack of safe drinking water every year . planet does contain over a billion trillion litres of water . But very little of that is safe to drink . Of the fresh water that remains , over two thirds is locked away in ice caps and glaciers . comment . Love the analysis . They have forgotten who they work for , and it is our fault . We allowed this to happen , and now we have to stand up against it . Thank you for this , because this information would never find a place on state run propaganda networks . all this endless left-right warring , people need to rally around the one little tiny center we have , which is this tiny portfolio of what rights that we have inherited from brave ancestors and somehow managed to keep our hands on so far . They have Tackleberry syndrome . voted for Bernie -LRB- absentee -RRB- in the California Primary . after he sold out to the Ice Queen I was done with him . It comes with the territory . Their positions demand that in reality they are not loyal to their constituents . watched Bernie cave over and over . typical tactic of anti-american secret police state is the round up American demonstraters and threaten them . During these threats they try to recruit . A very simple case and the silence and suppression of the wallstreet whore media speaks volumes . They say the cover-up is worse . A reordering of economic activity is vital to creating a workable world free of the poison of the ultra rich . So much for freedom under capitalism . And look what a great job the capitalists have done as stewards of great wealth . Trash everywhere . Polluted air . Filthy water , dying corals . Just like Rome , America as it is , will disappear . What those indigenous people were fighting for e.g. . They were also his best work . He was right that capitalism sucks , but his solutions , while seemingly moral and correct , were not . much better solution than the government owning everything -LRB- communism -RRB- is worker-owned coops . all do many of those things , yes , because that it how the system is set up . we need to change the system as quickly as possible in order to avoid the ensuing wars , lost cities , and possible unlivable climate . I understand and share some of the concerns about Clinton you express . to say she and Trump are equally disastrous is just incredible . Literally , clinically insane . Even now , even at this very moment , the august and sagacious poobahs of US punditry discuss whether Steve Bannon , Mike Pence , or Jared Kushner should be more involved in advising and restraining Trump . very , very last thing Russia , the US , or any other nuclear nation wants is unpredictability . So do I. No computers or mobile phone or television. , that can not be produced without the oil left in the ground . and DOJ departments in the movements against AIM . American Indian Movement , back in the 1970s and 1980s . We must free Pelletier now . Thank you so much for this article . As I was leaving Standing Rock , I spoke to two white men , wearing masks , about a car with California license plates , that drove north , and then south , without looking out the window . I told the two young demonstrators I was concerned , that they were undercover . The one young man , had a dead expression in his eyes , instead of concern , and it reminded me of an undercover policeman at an ant-war demonstration in NYC , years ago , He had a dead expression , of boredom , in his eyes . I got in our car , and we drove north , to the airport . Agents shone searchlights on the tent villages at night and fired bullets into the tents at random , occasionally killing and maiming people . The steel-covered car was built in the CF&I plant in Pueblo , Colorado from the chassis of a large touring sedan . strike-related violence mounted , Colorado governor Elias M. Ammons called in the Colorado National Guard on October 28 . Guard Adjutant-General John Chase , who had served during the violent Cripple Creek strike 10 years earlier , imposed a harsh regime . On March 10 , 1914 , the body of a replacement worker was found on the railroad tracks near Forbes , Colorado . The National Guard said that the man had been murdered by the strikers . In retaliation , Chase ordered the Forbes tent colony destroyed . The attack was launched while the inhabitants were attending a funeral of infants who had died a few days earlier . strikers persevered until the spring of 1914 . By then , according to historian Anthony DeStefanis , the National Guard had largely broken the strike by helping the mine operators bring in non-union workers . The state had also run out money to maintain the Guard , and Governor Ammons decided to recall them . real truth of it is that we were given disasterous choice 1 versus disasterous choice 2 ; it was going to be tragic no matter whether if it was Trump elected or Clinton . course , no Progressive could ever vote for Trump , but knowing what I know about Hillary , I could NEVER have voted for her ; she was a stupid choice for a candidate . makes more sense right now is to build consensus for a rational relationship between We , The People , and the ultra-rich . People like YOU are the thieves . I suppose anything is possible . see an explicit quid pro quo rather than your specious Republican accusations of corruption . She was SoS for four years . We all have our priorities . great example of embedding the lie within a specious attack . never any reason to accept any premise offered by a provocateur . Even if you argue that accidents are inevitable then compared to road or rail or tanker transportation even these accidents are relatively small . I want to know is this . Private firms working for the Oligarchs who intend on crushing citizens , ignoring laws , ignoring rights to free speech , and creating actual laws to hinder constitutional rights need to be addressed . We are at a turning point . The way it looks right now , it appears to have already gone dictator , giving the corporations more power and rule over citizens here , mimicking other third world nations who are in utter corruption and chaos right now . course you are correct . has been reported to be in hiding since advertisers started leaving his program . obomo ramped up his attacks on Americans for the last 8 years leftist cheered him using the IRS against the Tea Party , militarizing the dept of the interior , BLM and distributing military equipment to local law inforcement . Obomo normalized a hostile occupation force for just these types of situations . fantasy that Trump and Clinton are the same is all in your mind . should at least acknowledge your own role in this political shitstorm that drowns decency with dishonesty and dumbshittery . trying to make sure they have potable water . atlas shrugged was a long , turgid fantasy that some idiots take seriously . Probably not . not just about instilling fear , but also inciting anger . feared for our lives . We were outnumbered . hmmm . That kind of figures in . CFR indoctrination , conditioning , molding . That is comedic genius . raid by U.S. commandos in the hamlet of al Adhlan , in the Yemeni province of Mareb on May 23 , also destroyed at least four homes . from five eyewitnesses in the village conflict with statements made by the Department of Defense and U.S. Central Command , which have not acknowledged that civilians were harmed . . Let us not massacre and maim these people further , citizens . We have done enough . mean , like that woman who told on Monica Lewinsky , or the goons who kept going after Hillary Clinton for wanting to have some private email . And yet , doing that is good practice for making a convincing argument . guess I did not see this coming to this extent so I am a fool . Maybe they are already here . tells me she has the hots for you . You should give her a call . She will be happy to hear from you . these protesters were trying to do amounts to a giant act of theft . They were bootleggers . Perhaps you never heard of MURDER , INC. . The lack of leads itself points to a likely CIA . gruber is an annoying troll . these people were really good they might have leaked the document themselves . About 3 years ago i worked for The Department of Health in Florida , you can look up the address 1105 E Kennedy Blvd. Bylaw you have to give a statement on accident . They literally went into the insurance companys system and tried to destroy my verbal claim of the accident and who was involved -LRB- multiple agencies -RRB- . I learned they were doing this many years ago and prepared and knew this would happen . Just more proof tampering with evidence . Should sound familiar to you as there are those on here who work with this site doing the EXACT same thing which was done in my fase . I lost my job of 20 years and will clear my name and the others who have come foward for years only to be laughed at , especially on this site by the very same people telling us to come forward . In order to tell a factual insane story which slowly some are waking up to you have to know the issues and present the evidence in a manner in which the deceived public would believe and realize we have been waiting for years and tired of the other idiots , who are telling the truth , but sound like idiots because they have no clue whats going on . Unfortunately , most people are complete idiots to begin with . Again the accidents and police report paper shown in some of the videos is real and you as a nobody can verify if this is BS or not . Sorry so long i wrote this very fast as a response , but go watch the movie called Spotlight or read up on it . What other things are right before our very eyes for YEARS only to be covered up and hidden , but all institutions of power who were supposed to protect the innocent were the very ones doing the hidious acts . ALL HIDDEN FOR DECADES until someone got off their lazy ass and did some real journalism . It treats everyone equally unequal compared to white male euro-americans -LRB- though there is a hierarchy of oppression -RRB- . This report leaves me believing that all is lost . The destruction of our society would be the final result . This stuff seems too obvious to be excused as sloppy surveillance . This was not lost on the Canadian government which had been fighting a losing battle against public protest of all manners including pipelines , in large part due to the reluctance of our police and courts to move against protesters . Further , this moved such suspects into the purview of the Canadian security and intelligence agencies which operate in secret and use disruption tactics on those that it targets . It all has been removed from the public eye and the courts by secrecy . One simple one is that other forms of air pollution are responsible for the depositions of whatever materials that are settling out . Scandinavian model is the solution . Denmark , Iceland are not Stalinist hellholes . Social democrats are not fascists . comment , thanks . I share an Intecept article , the graphics appear on fb . an aside , however , note that the private security contractors -LRB- Tigerswan , Silverton , etc. -RRB- that Kelcy Warren , CEO of ETP , hired in an attempt to disrupt the anti-pipeline protesters were also trying to undermine farmers who opposed the pipeline along its entire route . Their opposition was based on the threat to agicultural land posed by oil spills . are some interesting legal questions here , however . article is about mostly right-wing anti-government militias that were notorious for involvement in things like the Oklahoma City bombing in the 1990s . Thomas Jefferson questioned the problem with basing an economy on the profits derived from surplus . The Native American culture abhorred the practice of hoarding . There is a better way to foster a healthy human society that justly serves its members , other than one that resembles the functionality of the insect or animal kingdoms . society promotes an educational and propaganda system that keeps the empowered secure by the masses serving the few . And that canary is feet up . It has ceased to be . This is a late canary . Bereft of life , it rests in peace . I mean , I see them . Daily . Could be , but not sure . Then , the skies become sprayed . Back and forth . Large swaths of cross sectioning going on . As I watched through time , I noticed how those white lines turn fuzzy and wide . They feather out , actually . Eventually , they begin looking like actual clouds . If you never paid attention to what actual clouds LOOK LIKE , that is . so here is my more direct question : so like that day I noticed all this activity in the skies overhead , there was no other clouds in the area . No REAL clouds , anyway . No wonder I was -LRB- and am being -RRB- followed . Not that it would matter . The American Public seems fine with most of it . They could yank folks out of their homes and shoot them dead in the streets . Yeah . I know a few of those folks . matters . All of it . Everything leading up to it as well . Bought . Through fear , phony patriotism , greed , and viability . That have monied interests in that project . same tea party that put Paul Ryan & Stephen miller where they are have made it perfectly clear they care about an agenda of alt right extremism first & foremost . It was interesting to see the way they describe their jobs and services . A great number of these protesters were heavily armed and they had set up sniper positions directed at the federal agents at a road block in effect threatening the lives of law enforcement officers -LRB- if a police officer can use deadly force because they feel threatened by and shoot dead unarmed person then this would seem to be a case where the use of deadly force would be expected -RRB- . There are instances in the past where the NG open fired with machine guns on protesters and in some cases even brought in artillery to protests . Now we see local police being militarized so local law enforcement does not need the out side approval needed to call out the national guard and they can still face down citizen protests with over whelming force . The constitution presented to the states did not contain the bill of rights . The BoRs were force negotiated into the constitution by the representatives of the people in the legislatures of the states . The argument about whether or not the rich and power should rule was not the issue , the issue was how to protect the people against the R&P . The US military has spent the past decade training in counterinsurgency techniques . They are one faction within the Republican party who will not stand for this . I was in the unusual position of seeing a friend of mine become obsessed about chemtrails . She even convinced me and number of her other friends that they existed . She was considered an authority about them on the Internet . Unfortunately , we watched her more and more paranoid , including suspicious of friends . To try to help her I undertook a huge -LRB- for me -RRB- internet research project on chemtrails . During the course of it I discovered a bunch of her buttressing points that had garnered my belief were simply phoney , and my conclusion was that chemtrails did not exist . True Scotsman fallacy . you for this link and info . yes the local , state and federal authorities are no match for these hired bullies . They will play your local police chief like a fiddle , your sheriff and your city council too . Anyway Mona I noticed you mentioned McClatchy so I thought you might find this interesting . Now that is over a year old video from 2016 . We still are . An informed public can fight back . We just have to do it together . I am so angry after reading this article I can hardly think of anything else . Even knowing how our govt works today and in the past , I still can not believe the inhumanity , the greed , the incidents of ignoring our Constitution . We have a duty today to stop this attack on our constitution . It is our responsibility . think the investigative work by these journalists is superb . The story will hopefully encourage further study . wars in Southeast Asia and the Middle East , come home to roost . I pretty much agree . The above article is incredibly important , a stellar example of investigative journalism at its finest . I , too , thought of the Pinkertons ; the historical parallels are obvious . The Constitution is the foundation on which the country is built . The spirit of the Constitution is that the people should be protected from an overbearing government . The Constitution is being ripped to shreds by the FBI , DEA , NSA , military , and private contractors . We are worse than Stalinist Russia in some regards , because on the one hand the corporate media reported on these protests with no hint of an agenda and are complicit with the narrative supplied by these idiots . Those militias ended up killing innocent people . I cant comment on this without mentioning the use of firewood at the camps and that wood burned petro to get hauled there . But 37 other banks have directly financed DAPL . That was made possible by the Obama-Republican joint effort to lift restrictions on exporting U.S. oil & gas , passed in 2015 . u.s. goverment among other things used mercenaries , the F.B.I , C.I.A. , ARMORED PERSONEL CARRIERS AND TANKS , and promoted a conflict and armed two sides resulting in a civil war that killed hundreds of people INSIDE THE UNITED STATES . Instead of two Political Parties working together By , Of and FOR The People they are each working against each other . you . you , and please raise nine kinds of hell over this . everything into account i am reminded of any species of bird that do some really amazing nest building , a home to live . We need to mount a national effort to rid ourselves of these cowards with guns . There is no reason why any member of the public should pay any attention to any mercenary attempting to express authority over the populace . He should be shoved out of the way . He has no right whatsoever , to impede public expression of dissent . interested in seeing how these mercenaries responded to the veterans deployment . Anyone remotely paying attention , except republican conservatives , could see the playbook they were using . All these prople wanted to do was keep big business off their kand and out of their water and once again , white businees men stole from them in a most heinous way . I am still amazed the security company did not massacre men women snd children and blame it one the people killed . ASHAMED TO BE AN AMERICAN . white man is the greediest animal to ever set foot on the American continents . Find the protestors and kill them . Not all but many are Native Americans . months of horrifying disclosures of right-wing extremist empowerment across the globe , this , to me , is perhaps the most blood-curdling . I never imagined Americans would be treated like this , even native Americans who have long been singled out for special abuse by our governments . This clearly is the future of how any protesters opposing government-industry dictatorship will be treated . course the government used military-style counterterrorism measures at Standing Rock . Anyone who does not go along with corporate , uh , I mean government desires , is at risk ; and anyone who would dare publicly protest is a terrorist . more people accepted that trains were safer , which they are not , people should be more willing to accept pipelines , which they are not . Oil is becoming as unsafe as nuclear waste . It destroys the environment . I bet Trump nationalizes the many assorted militias to be paid brown-shirts . The militarization of police forces is bound to implode eventually , but perhaps this would present a way for concerned but heavily armed citizens , their being conservative-voting Christians purely incidental , to be deputized so they can feel like they are contributing . we have the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association pushing for law enforcement officers around the country to refrain from enforcing gun-control laws . Maybe in the name of the Earth Liberation Front . Or maybe not . Fitting for the muddied plot , their motivation was as unclear as their targets . Anna even provided the recipe for homemade explosives , drawn up by FBI bomb experts . This coalesces all of the points really well . A totally disgusting series of actions . These aholes TigerSwan need to have their asses shut down . We are awash with people who serve no useful social or economic function , completely cut off from the real economy and value creation . Reporting . Patriot Act and the NDAA were implemented to take care of the illegality . fact that a private security firm retained by a Fortune 500 oil and gas company coordinated its efforts with local , state , and federal law enforcement to undermine the protest movement has profoundly anti-democratic implications . We are a Constitutional Republic . That way the PERSON serving is no longer serving , and has power . is also why the push for a Con Con -LRB- Article 5 Convention -RRB- . Van Horne v. Dorrance , 2 Dall . Du Pont v. you say that the US Constitution means nothing , understand that the enemies of freedom have been working since the inception of our nation to destroy it . The appearance or semblance , without the substance , of legal right . It was written to establish a Federal Government and to place the boundaries by which that government would operate . 645 , 62 Stat . 696 ; Pub . 11 , 1968 , 82 Stat . 75 ; Pub . 4396 ; Pub . 1970 , 2109 , 2113 , 2147 ; Pub . Persons acting under color of law within the meaning of this statute include police officers , prisons guards and other law enforcement officials , as well as judges , care providers in public health facilities , and others who are acting as public officials . The reason for that is : The government of the United States is that set of actions by public officials that are consistent with the Constitution . Outside of its constitutional powers , the government of the United States has no legitimacy . It has no authority ; and , it really even has no existence . They are its disabilities ; what it does not have legal authority to do . It guarantees freedom of speech , freedom of press , freedom of religion . kind of reporting is why I read the Intercept . THAT by itself , acts as a constraint on the power of corporations . disclosure . Thank you both the whistleblower and the Intercept . Then the demand for counterinsurgency services will go through the roof . Investors should be patient , however . actually does seem to be the case . Reese is the founder and chairman of TigerSwan . His name is getting dragged out by conservative and rightwing mouth pieces as a possible FBI Director . Together with so many others in the spy-industrial complex , they need to lobby legislatures for draconian unconstitutional legislation , and intimidate away the best and brightest of the protesters , the people with peaceful ethics who care more about the environment than coming out on top . They need to start a process of selection much like what happened in Iraq , where ordinary troops give way to villains and villains give way to monsters . Environmentalists , not always inaccurately , can sometimes be presented as careerists or racketeers . And of course the whole thing is a chance for them to try to hype up some kind of competitive technology and ostensibly progressive ethics . That is what the companies risk when start escalating the force and risk involved with these issues . Democracy becomes disrespectable , and there is always somebody on hand waiting to peddle something else . counterinsurgency tactics against the citizens of the US , is illegal , in the US . need to raise capital to hire their own private security . Imagine Blackwater vs. TigerSwan , and , all the chaos they can cause within governmental agencies conferring with them . There are secure software packages out there that will provide ample intrusion protection , these packages involve encryption . The idiots on both sides will rule the day . In my community if idiot spies were put here to observe us for our opinions one of our idiots might do something rude and you might not get a local jury of twelve to convict our own idiot . This for both sides is a dangerous game for any but the coolest heads with good knowledge of the mites and bounds of the law . not forget that the climate is changing . toy soldiers may think they are having their day , but in fact they and their families will soon feel the force of ecology all around them . Brown is New York-based reporter , focused on environmental justice issues . Prior to joining The Intercept , she worked as an education reporter in Minnesota . Speri reports on justice , immigration , and civil rights . She has reported from Palestine , Haiti , El Salvador , Colombia , and across the United States . policing continues to be militarized and state legislatures around the country pass laws criminalizing protest , the fact that a private security firm retained by a Fortune 500 oil and gas company coordinated its efforts with local , state , and federal law enforcement to undermine the protest movement has profoundly anti-democratic implications . did not respond to a request for comment . In the internal situation reports , TigerSwan operatives comment frequently about their routine coordination and intelligence sharing with law enforcement . internal reports and the intelligence briefings shared with law enforcement name dozens of DAPL opponents . Some of those named are well-known activists , while others have minimal public affiliation with the water protector movement . The names of private individuals whose actions are not already in the public record , or whose authorization we did not obtain , have been redacted to protect their privacy . then did so , but the board denied the application on December 19 . did not respond to a request for comment . Also in attendance were representatives of the Joint Terrorism Task Force , Department of Homeland Security , Iowa Department of Emergency Services , Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Iowa Department of Wildlife . Topics covered included the current threat assessment of the pipeline , the layout of current security assets and persons of interest . relationship with public police agencies was not always harmonious . reports also reveal a widespread and sustained campaign of infiltration of protest camps and activist circles . Throughout the leaked documents , TigerSwan makes reference to its intelligence-gathering teams , which infiltrated protest camps and activist groups in various states . personnel , who were overseen by TigerSwan , attending protests in Iowa . On February 19 , TigerSwan makes explicit its plans to infiltrate a Chicago protest group . one of the most striking revelations of the documents is the level of hostility displayed by TigerSwan toward the water protectors . TigerSwan consistently describes the peaceful demonstrators using military and tactical language more appropriate for counterterrorism operations in an armed conflict zone . pays particular attention to protesters of Middle Eastern descent . El-Zabri , a Palestinian-American activist singled out in the reports , was shocked to hear his name mentioned in that context . ethnic and religious profiling of protesters was not unusual . In an interview , 63-year-old Tomlin , who covers the local school board for the Galesburg , Illinois , Register-Mail , said he had set out to travel the length of the pipeline and write a story about it as a freelancer . When he arrived at the camps in North Dakota , few people would talk openly with him . The public relations mission quickly became a priority for the firm , documents show . numerous occasions , TigerSwan agents stressed the need to change the public narrative established by protestors and to swing public support in favor of the pipeline .
