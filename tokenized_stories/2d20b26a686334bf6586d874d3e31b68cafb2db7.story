Studies have shown with alarming consistency that Indigenous women experience significantly higher levels of sexual violence than any other racial minority in the United States . As a Native woman and third-generation sexual violence survivor , I had experienced this firsthand , but the numbers were a revelation to me . According to the Centers for Disease Control , more than 80 percent of Indigenous women have experienced violence , and of those , more than 50 percent have experienced sexual violence . In 2016 , I found my feet on the ground in seemingly nowhere North Dakota fighting the Dakota Access Pipeline alongside thousands of Native and non-Native people from across the world . As anyone who witnessed the occupation of Standing Rock can attest , the immensity of the camps and sheer Indian-ness of its occupants demanded an immediate place in history . Over and over , I tallied aunties , grandmas , mamas , daughters , and big sisters like me , gnawing on the undeniable fact that Native women are 2.5 to 3.5 times more likely to experience sexual assault compared to all other races . It was devastating to stare out at the generations of life-givers knowing what we all carry in our blood memory . This caused the ratio of men to women in said communities to change drastically . On average the ratio is around 10 to one , and in some places it can be as high as 20 to one . When her mother tried to file an affidavit with law enforcement , she claims she was denied , though verbal street harassment is illegal in Iowa . Courtesy of Eryn Wise I have seen the continued desensitization of our collective psyche to sexual assault and harassment . 70 percent of violent victimizations experienced by Indigenous peoples are not committed by persons of the same race , according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics . Our youth are at critical risk for suicide due to the flagrant disregard for Indigenous sovereignty , and desperate need for cultural preservation , and land restoration . In my work with Seeding Sovereignty , a women-led organization honoring Indigenous sovereignty with a goal of building cross-cultural bridges , I aim to inspire young folks to lift their voices for those who are voiceless , and strive to ground them in traditional teachings based on the multigenerational environmental stewardship gifted to us by our ancestors . A catastrophic web has been woven between extractive industries and Native communities , and we are each called upon to observe issues of broader concern . It is evident , now more than ever , that extractive industries are having disproportionate adverse effects on indigenous peoples , particularly on the wellbeing of Native women . The continued desecration of unceded Indigenous territories and sacred resources resulting from extraction projects have contributed to disease , birth defects , reproductive health issues , and delayed early childhood development among community members . More attention needs to be given to Indigenous women living near points of extraction . This is the land we inherited from our ancestors . We are still here , intrepid and Indigenous ; and we are moving forward .
