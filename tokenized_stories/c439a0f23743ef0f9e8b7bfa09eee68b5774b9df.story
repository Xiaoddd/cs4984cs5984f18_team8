The City of Cape Town does not plan to disrupt the supply of water to residents in an effort to conserve water , an official said on Monday . Water-shedding could lead to air entering pipe systems . The city would instead try to restrict what potable water could be used for and through education and media engagement . The city introduced Level 3B water restrictions for the first time in January , which limit the use of potable water for gardening purposes . The city 's consumption stood at 801 million liters per day , 101 million liters above the target of 700 million liters per day . The city would consider lowering water pressure , but maintaining constant supply where it had the infrastructure to do so . Consumption patterns and dam levels over the coming weeks would determine whether this would be necessary . All rights reserved . Distributed by AllAfrica Global Media -LRB- allAfrica.com -RRB- .
