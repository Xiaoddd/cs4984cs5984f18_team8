But , according to Musk , who recently made news when he talked and tweeted about taking Tesla private , the investors controlling Saudi Arabia 's sovereign wealth fund have approached him multiple times since the beginning of last year .

In Dubai , that means giant man-made islands in the shape of palm trees erupted from the waters of the Gulf and new 10-lane roads and a monorail linking up once remote areas . Now , Dubai and Saudi Arabia are both working with Virgin Hyperloop One to make a different Musk-imagined transport technology a reality .
