DOT A broadening sheen of oil spread near several of the tankers , which had piled up across the track and earthen berm , some submerged in the water . Vander Stoep said that drinking water in Doon and the immediate area did n't seem to be in danger of contamination . The water towers also will be drained as a precaution , said Rock Valley public information officer Travis Olson . In the meantime , the city is getting its water from the nearby Rock Valley Rural Water system , which Olson said is not in danger of being contaminated by the spill . The city , with a population of nearly 3,400 , will stay on the rural water system until testing by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources confirms the safety of the city 's drinking water , Olson said . The railroad will focus on environmental recovery . Nearby homes evacuated Vander Stoep said the oil was being carried downstream into the Rock River a few hundred yards west of the derailment .
