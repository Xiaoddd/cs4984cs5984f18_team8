The US Army says alternative routes need to be considered for an oil pipeline that was to cross native lands and place water sources at risk . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is declaring victory after the United States Army announced Sunday -LRB- 04.12.2016 -RRB- that it will not allow construction to begin on a planned pipeline project through Native American lands .

The Dakota Access Pipeline was approved several months ago , with a plan to carry crude from the Bakken oil fields in western North Dakota to Southern Illinois . Environmentalists said the pipeline threatened water supplies Since summer , a large camp of protesters has grown at the reservation - it now numbers thousands of people .
