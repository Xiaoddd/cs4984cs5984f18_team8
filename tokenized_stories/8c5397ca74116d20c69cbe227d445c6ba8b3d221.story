The U.S. Capitol Building is lit at sunset in Washington , U.S. , December 20 , 2016 . Only five Democrats voted for it . Republicans say there is little accountability for regulations that apply to almost every aspect of American life because they are created by appointed officials and not elected representatives . As House Republicans push for reform - last week they passed bills requiring Congressional approval of major rules and giving Congress power to kill dozens of recently enacted ones - Democrats are fighting back . Democrats contend that slowing down rulemaking is intended to help big businesses escape oversight . The House is expected to vote on Thursday on changes to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , the major securities and derivatives regulators . Still , none of these bills may become law , as Democrats hold enough seats in the Senate to filibuster .
