Two weeks ago , four of us decided to drive to Standing Rock and deliver supplies to the water protectors and protestors of the Dakota Access Pipeline . During our time there , we learned a great deal , particularly on how to be the best ally we can be . Also , please develop contacts at the camp first to ensure you are getting the right supplies for the water protectors . What I can confirm is that many people brought their dogs and let them run around the camps . Showing up to Standing Rock in your festival garb only to participate in your own spiritual journey without respect to the systems the tribes have in place makes you a problem , not an ally . If you go to Standing Rock , Respect What the Tribes Have Established The protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline is founded in sacredness and spirituality . For example , at the camp we were at , Oceti Sakowin , it was requested that you do not take photos unless you have media credentials , and even then you can not photograph ceremonies . Also , at the same camp , it is encouraged for all to go to daily meetings to learn more about the Lakota values and how the camp operates . And support is definitely needed , but in a way that respects and emboldens the water protectors . In fact , you may be even more helpful .
