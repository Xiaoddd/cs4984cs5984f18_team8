I reasoned I might have felt more culturally confident , more capable at speaking Konkani . By not being wrapped in the comforting cocoon of an insular diasporic community , I had to figure out my own relationship with my personal and cultural history but also what Ghassan Hage terms , an ethical relationship with colonisation and living on colonised land . The parallels between Aotearoa and Canada of a colonial history supplemented by exploited migrant labour to meet settler ends mirrored the clearly unfair outcomes in measures of health , well-being and prosperity for indigenous peoples that I see in Aotearoa New Zealand as a health professional . Apologizing to former residential schools students in 1998 . There are round dances by the dollar stores . There are drums drowning out muzak in shopping malls . There are eagle feathers upstaging the fake Santas . And these roots will make us all stand stronger . As a population , we non-whites and women -LRB- in particular , non-white women -RRB- are living in a specific territory . We are part of its economy , subject to its laws , and members of its civil society . We are pasted over with labels that give us identities that are extraneous to us . And these labels originate in the ideology of the nation , in the Canadian state apparatus , in the media , in the education system , and in the commonsense world of common parlance . We ourselves use them . They are familiar , naturalized names : minorities , immigrants , newcomers , refugees , aliens , illegals , people of color , multicultural communities , and so on . The names keep proliferating , as though there were a seething reality , unmanageable and uncontainable in any one name . Privileged in some ways , disadvantaged in others , our futures are tightly imbricated in this indigenous struggle . At the asset sales March in Auckland in April 2012 .
