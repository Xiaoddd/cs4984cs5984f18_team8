Artists Stop in Cleveland to Paint Dakota Access Protest Mural By Josh Usmani click to enlarge Earlier in the week , a group of graffiti artists traveled from Washington , D.C. to Standing Rock . Along the way , they stopped in Detroit , Flint , Chicago , Minneapolis and Cleveland , creating murals in each city to communicate their message : Water is Life . The group 's first mural stop was in Cleveland on Nov. 30 . The artists contacted Graffiti HeArt just days before arriving . Graffiti HeArt immediately reached out to its many community partners , including Rafid Fadul , the owner of the Tenk building where Graffiti HeArt stores its murals and related art supplies . Fadul quickly responded , offering one of his properties to the project . There are many people in Cleveland interested in the DAPL situation and the media block and wondering how they can help those taking action in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux . The artists arrived at their destination a few days prior to the announcement of a major victory for protesters , as the Army Corps of Engineers announced it would not grant a permit to allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross beneath Lake Oahe in North Dakota .
