This comes less than two months after construction on DAPL was halted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers following months of widespread public outrage and protest -LRB- aka water protection -RRB- led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . Trump seemed to show no regard for the indigenous people who live near the site of the proposed pipeline who believe the pipeline poses a threat to their drinking water . Just earlier this week , 52,834 gallons of oil leaked onto tribal lands in Canada , only seven months after a larger leak , demonstrating just how real a threat this is to the people of Standing Rock and the 17 million Americans who live downstream . We need to act now to show U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that we are counting on them to stick to their recent promise to demand the exploration of alternative routes for DAPL and a complete Environmental Impact statement with full public input and analysis . CALL -LRB-202-RRB-Â 761-8700 and use the script provided below . AN YR January 26 , 2017 Next URGENT : call now to protect abortion access .
