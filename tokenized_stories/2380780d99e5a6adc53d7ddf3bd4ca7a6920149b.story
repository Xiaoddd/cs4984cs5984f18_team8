Officials refuse to extend the Wednesday eviction deadline as Indigenous protectors plea for help . Faced with an imminent evacuation deadline , Indigenous opponents of the Dakota Access pipeline are vowing to stand their ground despite threats of arrest and possible violence . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Tuesday refused to extend the Wednesday 2 pm GMT deadline for the few hundred remaining water protectors to vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp , claiming that the camp is at risk of flooding . Representatives have asked for an extension , saying they can clear out without the Corps ' help , but need more time . And now , give up our water , or go to jail . Forced removal is n't just in the history books . It 's happening tomorrow on treaty lands at Standing Rock . No one is allowed into camp now . Even the press . Only press are those already inside , & they might be arrested . Our spirits remain high . Indigenous peoples have not and will never be broken . Stay safe ; stay strong . You are loved and honored by countless others throughout the world . This does n't just effect Standing Rock , events that have been going on there for way to long are and will effect the whole world . It 's been said many times . THINGS WILL JUST KEEP GETTING WORSE . GOD HELP US I PRAY FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR ALL .
