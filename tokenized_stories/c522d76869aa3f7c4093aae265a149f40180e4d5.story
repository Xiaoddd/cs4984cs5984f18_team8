Leonard Peltier at Leavenworth . I guess I can start by saying see you later to all of those who have passed in the last year . We believe that if we speak their names it disrupts their journey . They may loose their way and their spirits wander forever . If too many call out to them , they will try to come back . But their spirits know we are thinking about them , so all I will say is safe journey and I hope to see you soon . I have earned about 4-5 years good time that no one seems to want to recognize . And when I was indicted the average time served on a life sentence before being given parole was 7 years . My first app was with Jimmy Carter . He denied it . Ronald Reagan promised President Mikhail Gorbachev that he would release me if the Soviet Union released a prisoner , but Reagan reneged . George H.W. Bush did nothing . The next app was with Bill Clinton . He left office without taking action even though the Pardon Attorney did an 11-month investigation -LRB- it usually takes 9 months -RRB- and we were told she had recommended clemency . George W. Bush denied that petition in 2009 . And in all of the applications for clemency , the FBI has interfered with an executive order . The doctor told me if it bursts , I can bleed to death . As President Obama completes the final year of his term , I hope that he will continue to fight to fulfill his promises , and further the progress his Administration has made towards working in partnership with First Peoples . It gives me hope that this President has worked hard to affirm the trust relationship with the Tribal Nations . With YOUR encouragement , I believe Obama will have the courage and conviction to commute my sentence and send me home to my family . Looking back on the 40 years of efforts on my behalf , I am overwhelmed and humbled . I would like to say thank you to all the supporters who have believed in me over the years . Some of you have been supporters since the beginning . You made sure I had books to read and commissary funds to buy what I may need to be as comfortable as one can be in this place . You made donations to the defense committee so we could continue fighting for my freedom , too . But thanks for the love you have shown me . Without it , I could never have made it this long . I believe that my incarceration , the constitutional violations in my case , and the government misconduct in prosecuting my case are issues far more important than just my life or freedom .
