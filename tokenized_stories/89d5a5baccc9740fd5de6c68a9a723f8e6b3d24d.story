David A. Graham Dec 22 , 2016 A senator holds his head after a vote to repeal H.B. 2 failed Wednesday . This is not one of those stories . Last week was a bruising one for North Carolina politics . After returning to Raleigh for a special session intended to pass disaster relief , the Republican leaders in the General Assembly used the occasion to ram through a series of measures to strip the incoming governor , a Democrat , of powers they had afforded the outgoing governor , a Republican . In February , the city of Charlotte passed an ordinance barring LGBT discrimination , including a provision that mandated that transgender people be allowed to use bathrooms corresponding with the sex with which they identify . The GOP-led General Assembly quickly called a special session in which it barred cities from passing LGBT nondiscrimination ordinances -LRB- or , for good measure , higher minimum wages -RRB- , and mandated that transgender people use bathrooms corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate in any public facilities . The law set off boycotts , protests , and acrimony , and is one reason Governor Pat McCrory , a Republican , lost his bid for reelection last month . It was a big gamble for the governor-elect : If he won , he would have his first major victory under his belt even before he was sworn in , slaying an unpopular law . But to do that , he had to rely on the same GOP leaders who had stealthily hatched a plan to strip Cooper of his gubernatorial powers the week before . Though Cooper had initially said the General Assembly would meet Tuesday , the special session was pushed back to Wednesday . Even before the meeting occurred , pessimism began to well up . There was trouble in Charlotte as well . First , the city council may have violated public-notice laws with its sudden meeting , which is one reason that it was not immediately apparent that rather than repeal the whole ordinance , the council had only repealed the bathroom provision . Members of the Durham city council also said they would quickly pass nondiscrimination bills as soon as H.B. 2 was repealed . Christmas is also a time to celebrate faith , but by Wednesday , the only faith on hand was bad , with Charlotte distrustful of the General Assembly , and the General Assembly distrustful of Charlotte . By the time the General Assembly gaveled into session in Raleigh , tempers were high and hopes were sinking . It took quite some time for anyone to introduce a bill to actually repeal H.B. 2 . A Republican legislator argued , apparently with a straight face , that the whole special session was unconstitutional , since they could just put the whole thing off until next month . Democrats were furious , saying the moratorium was a violation of the original deal , which was full repeal . Debate on the Senate floor devolved into ad-hominem attacks . After all , many GOP members of the legislature still think H.B. 2 was a good idea . But the senate soundly rejected the repeal part . That was the end of the road . Cooper now limps toward his governorship looking weaker after his big push fell apart . The state remains saddled with a law that is unpopular with voters , economically costly , and nationally embarrassing . The failed special session will likely poison the well in any repeal attempt going forward . There are still 10 days left , though , so there might be time for one more .
