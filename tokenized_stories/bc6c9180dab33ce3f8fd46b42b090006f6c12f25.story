As a published freelance photographer , he has documented activist groups actions in NYC since 2011 . The day of action protesting the Wells Fargo Pipeline Symposium is part of a global month of mobilization by water protectors at Sacred Stone Camp that calls on all customers to divest from the banks funding DAPL in order to pressure them to cancel loans for the pipeline . Despite the recent halt on Dakota Access Pipeline construction , on Tuesday , December 6th from 12 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. , New Yorkers concerned about the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and its violations of the indigenous rights , treaty provisions , and environmental sovereignty of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe will join together to reject the 15th Annual Wells Fargo Pipeline , MLP and Utility Symposium held at the Waldorf Astoria New York luxury hotel located in midtown Manhattan -LRB- 301 Park Ave -RRB- . New Yorkers will also be speaking to a broader message of defunding all extractive infrastructures , including projects that threaten their own communities . With Spectra already running through Ramapough Lunaape Nation land and the Pilgrim Pipeline seeking right of way , these investments hurt all of us . The return on industry investment in the massive buildout of fossil fuel infrastructure comes at the expense of the health and safety of millions of people in every stage of these projects . Through peaceful action , activists will hold these individuals , and Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan , accountable for funding the Dakota Access Pipeline . View my complete profile Simple theme .
