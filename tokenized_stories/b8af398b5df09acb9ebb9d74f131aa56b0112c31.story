The objections raised by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its allies to the Dakota Access Pipeline have captured the attention of indigenous activists and climate-change campaigners from across the country and around the world ; and the corporate interests that are seeking to complete the pipeline have made little secret of their frustration with the protests . Now state officials are telling members of the tribe that they must leave . The Army Corps of Engineers has announced plans to take steps on December 5 to close off access to the camp . Authorities have used mass arrests , rubber bullets , pepper spray , and water cannons to deter protests . They have also arrested journalists and documentary filmmakers seeking to report from the scene . Earlier this year , Gabbard broke with Democratic Party leaders to support the insurgent presidential campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders , another critic of the 1,170-mile Dakota Access Pipeline .
