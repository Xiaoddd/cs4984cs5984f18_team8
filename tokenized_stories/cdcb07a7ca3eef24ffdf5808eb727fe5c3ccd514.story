The couple are landowners on the pipeline route near Atkinson . Monday 's decision by the Nebraska Public Service Commission , which came on a 3-2 vote , adds another twist to a debate that has made headlines for nearly a decade . It would impact about 40 new landowners , many of them in Madison and Seward counties , who are n't along the preferred route and do n't have the original Keystone pipe cutting through their land already . TransCanada did n't immediately say whether it will pursue Keystone XL construction along the alternate route . The commission 's decision was met with stunned silence on the part of opponents and apparent confusion by TransCanada representatives . However , the mainline alternative route maximizes co-location with the original Keystone pipeline and is in the public interest , the commission wrote . The alternative route diverts from the preferred route in Antelope County , then cuts through Madison County on its way into Stanton County . Attorneys for pipeline opponents cautiously celebrated the rejection of the preferred route , promising to continue their fight but not revealing plans for their next step should TransCanada still desire to build . Commissioner Crystal Rhoades of Omaha , who voted against the pipeline , said approving the mainline alternative instead of merely weighing in on TransCanada 's preferred route raises due process questions , because many landowners along the alternate route were n't included in the commission proceedings . Neligh-area farmer Art Tanderup 's land would be impacted by either route . He said the mainline alternative still crosses fragile soils and the Ogallala Aquifer . Nebraska 's approval was one of the final necessary steps before TransCanada could begin turning dirt on the 1,179-mile project , which would move Canadian oil sands from Hardisty , Alberta , to the U.S. Gulf Coast . The Keystone XL appeared dead after former President Barack Obama stopped it in 2015 , but the project received a jump start from President Donald Trump earlier this year . We are tasked with weighing those impacts against the potential benefits . We share many of the concerns expressed regarding the soils in Keya Paha , Holt , Boyd , and Antelope Counties . The Major Oil Pipeline Siting Act , adopted by the Nebraska Legislature in 2011 , specifically prohibits the commission from considering pipeline safety , spills or leaks . Opponents have argued that the Keystone XL should at least run adjacent to the original Keystone pipeline through Nebraska . That route cuts through Cedar , Wayne , Stanton , Platte , Colfax , Butler , Seward , Saline and Jefferson counties . Commissioners dismissed the I-90 route for two reasons : deference to South Dakota 's decision and because it was n't part of TransCanada 's application and therefore outside the commission 's authority . The mainline alternative route was included in TransCanada 's application . And Meera Kothari , lead engineer for the Keystone XL , acknowledged at a hearing in August that the alternative route is viable . However , three commissioners issued separate written opinions : Rod Johnson , who concurred with the majority decision , and Mary Ridder and Crystal Rhoades , who dissented .
