The Dakota Access Pipeline , a not yet completed oil pipeline snaking through the Midwest , became a heated point in the national conversation last year when construction efforts reached the water supply for the Native Americans living around Standing Rock , North Dakota . The original construction plans had the pipeline coming so close to this water supply that , in the event of a spill , the waterways would be almost certainly impacted so as to make them unusable . In response to the construction plans , huge assemblies of Native Americans and other concerned citizens converged on the site near the local water supply that was being threatened by the proposed pipeline . The efforts against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline , and the subsequent victory , became a rallying cry for similar efforts against the advancement of the fossil fuel industry in other parts of the country as well , such as the Sabal Trail Pipeline controversy in Florida . The new president made it clear throughout the weeks and months before the inauguration that he did not prioritize protecting the safety of the local water supply over protecting the profits of the oil companies behind the Dakota Access Pipeline . Now , the fears that the Trump administration would overturn the victory for clean water in Standing Rock have become a reality .
