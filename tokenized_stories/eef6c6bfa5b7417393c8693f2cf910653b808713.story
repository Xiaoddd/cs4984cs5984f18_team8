When you do something well , it is overlooked . When you make a mistake , it is amplified . They were so little at the time . Chloe was 6 and Dravin 11 . I wanted them to experience this moment with me , because you were the first candidate in my lifetime that actually made me excited to vote . I felt like you were going to be a legendary president and I wanted my children to be part of that . As I walked into the voting booth , I was surprised at how emotional I became . Barack Obama was going to be my president . You faced opposition from all sides and dealt with a House that attempted to block everything you tried to do . Yet somehow you managed to stop Keystone XL and pass the Affordable Care Act , which for all of its flaws , was a major step forward for millions of Americans . I have not agreed with you on everything . I radically opposed TPP and I was extremely disappointed that you did not speak up for the Occupy Wall Street protesters . I read your book and loved your honesty , when you admitted that taking corporate money had negatively affected your presidency . So you can imagine how disappointed I was when you endorsed Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders . But I do not write you today to tell you about all the ways in which I agree or disagree with you . I know you get more than your fair share of critics and detractors . I know that all great leaders must make tough decisions and that people who are on the outside can not understand the intricacies of these hard choices . Even though my politics might fall far to the left of yours , I have defended you consistently and I believe that you are a good man . I even voted for you again in 2012 , because I still believed that you were our best shot at hope and change . I want to take this opportunity to thank you for caring and for doing your best . Heavy is the head that wears the crown and with great audacity , I ask of you a favor before you leave office , one last swipe of your pen to remind the great people of America that there is still hope , even in the darkest of times . The good guys really need a victory right now . By declaring Standing Rock a federal monument you will stop the senseless violence against our Indigenous sisters and brothers and secure your legacy as a president who stood for hope and change . I understand that corporations are powerful forces , but right now , you are even more powerful . This is about more than just legalities . This is much bigger . It became bigger the moment that attack dogs and rubber bullets were brought in to assault these peace-loving people . It became bigger when we watched the absolute brutality of our own government spraying freezing water on these good people . The winter will be long and difficult , but our numbers will grow . My wife and children have asked me not to go , but I can not , in good conscience stand by and allow innocent people to be treated with such aggression . I believe , with all my heart , that the pen is mightier than the sword , so I ask you to look inside yourself and put an end to this atrocity . I know you are a good man . I know that you are losing sleep thinking about this situation , along with a hundred others . You , Mr President , are our last hope . If you do not intervene then I fear that this will ultimately result in the deaths of many good people . Perhaps of equal import , is that we need to know that you hear us and that you are on our side , because in a few months someone will be sitting in your chair who is not on our side . The American People need to know that our voices matter . The American People need to know that our government still represents us , because the level of cynicism and despair is palpable right now , Mr President . I still believe that you are . Happy Holidays from my family to yours and thank you from the bottom of my heart for your service . Sincerely , Just One Voter Michael E Sparks is a father and a freelance writer . But more importantly , please send donations to Standing Rock to help the brave water protectors with provisions for the upcoming winter .

He started selling us out on day 1 and has continued to sell us out worse and worse . I will never forgive him .
