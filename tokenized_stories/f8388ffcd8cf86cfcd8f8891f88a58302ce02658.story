Citi has replaced HSBC and joined JP Morgan in the highest ranking issued by the Financial Stability Board -LRB- FSB -RRB- , an international alliance of central bankers , policy makers and regulators that sorts 30 major banks into five categories . The more systemically important the bank , the more capital it must hold to absorb losses during time of crisis . Citi and JP Morgan are in the fourth category . Barclays has also had its status cut by one category , from the third to the less risky second bracket . Citi is among three US banks which have been pushed up the rankings : the other two are Bank of America and Wells Fargo . The rising importance of Chinese banks is also illustrated as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has moved up one ranking . Tomas Kinmonth , a fixed income strategist at ABN Amro , said the changes reflected the revised business models of some of the banks . Deutsche was in the fourth category in 2012 . The FSB is chaired by Bank of England governor Mark Carney . Its role is to act a body coordinating policy towards the financial services sector around the world and monitor and assess vulnerabilities affecting the global financial system . The banks are unlikely to need to raise more capital as many of them ready hold enough to appease regulatory demands . A list of the globally systemic insurers was also published , which includes Prudential and Aviva . Please choose your username under which you would like all your comments to show up .
