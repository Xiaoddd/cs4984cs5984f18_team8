No Pay . By 2 p.m. Wednesday , all roads leading into the main Oceti Sakowin camp , named for the Seven Council Fires -LRB- or tribes -RRB- making up the Great Sioux Nation , will be closed and the last 200 or so people remaining on the historic treaty lands will be ordered to leave . Melaine Stoneman , a Sicangu Lakota woman from Rosebud , South Dakota , is helping organize the exodus of women and as many as 25 children younger than 10 from the camps . Area churches have been secured as shelters . On Sunday , Dennis Banks , co-founder of the American Indian Movement , arrived at the camps in solidarity with the last resisters . Banks spoke of his confidence that the protest could end without incident . The Standing Rock protest once attracted thousands of people and dozens of celebrities . But so far in its final hours , no signs of outside support have turned up , nor have reporters from major media outlets . In a last-minute video campaign led by a group calling itself the Women of Standing Rock , Cheyenne River Sioux environmentalist Joye Braun reached out to potential reinforcements . By contrast , many have heeded the call to back up law enforcement . A new roadblock has been set up about a mile from the main camp , just south across the reservation border , manned by agents from the Bureau of Indian Affairs . But for the community at the heart of the movement , the Standing Rock tribe , there is no call to keep the protesters in place . Patti Kelly , an older resident of Cannon Ball , led the districtwide resolution for all nonresidents to leave the reservation . What this will mean for campers who have moved onto the reservation remains unclear . Last week , the Bureau of Indian Affairs issued trespassing notices to those living in yurts and tents on tribal property known as the Lean Warrior Allotment . To allow such forces to remove people from the reservation would send a chilling message at a time when sovereign rights for tribes , under President Donald Trump , are perceived to be under attack . Banks said , referring to such a use of force on protesters . In the final hours , the fight at Standing Rock is becoming a weary one in the 500-year-long struggle of resistance .
