Nancy Goate of United Tribes for Christ Fellowship Talks about the DAPL , the current protests , and the doors Christ has opened to make a difference . DEBRIEFING ON THE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPE LINE -LRB- DAPL -RRB- A Violation of Human Rights The Dakota Access Pipe Line -LRB- DAPL -RRB- is a multi-billion dollar project that will shuttle millions of gallons of crude oil across America via thousands of miles of pipeline placed directly beneath our most vital waterways . The current protests by more than 100 Native American tribes and many others across the globe has garnered international attention despite a media blackout that has endured for months . The current DAPL situation has escalated to a critical and urgent status . As brutal winter months progress , law enforcement officials have taken to the use of water cannons , spraying hundreds of protestors in below freezing temperatures . Tear gas , grenades , and rubber bullets have been launched in a lethal manner by targeting people in the face , head , and even the groin . Critical injuries have been sustained by many , including blunt trauma , head trauma , maiming , and loss of life and limb . Peaceful protestors standing united in prayer have been apprehended by force and jailed in dog cages . Professional journalists who dare to provide coverage have been threatened with prison sentences up to 40 years , and medics -LRB- RN & physicians -RRB- treating the victims of this abuse have been shot at with water cannons , rubber bullets , and tear gas themselves . Emergency Medical Service -LRB- EMS -RRB- personnel have also been blocked en route to hospitals by law enforcement vehicles , whereby alternate routes have needed to be taken . This is happening in the United States of America . Today we are going to talk about this and how you can be an integral part of serving and protecting peaceful protestors against abusive law enforcement entities who are employing illegal tactics . This cruel , inhumane , and insufferable treatment , which is very well-documented by the private sector , must STOP . Law enforcement officials must cease and desist immediately , and they must be held accountable and brought to justice . These unarmed civilians have gathered peacefully in prayer , ritual song and dance , and encampment blocking the DAPL construction site along the Missouri River and other waterways , all which are upon treaty land . Aside from water , their burial grounds and sacred sites are also being threatened . Despite the illegal and inhumane tactics employed against them , the protestors are more resolute than ever and they are not standing down . They plan to endure through Winter , and every manner of help is needed for their well-being and survival . This is your opportunity to get involved through prayer , practical helps , provision of aid and supplies , volunteer work , and informative sharing . Be a voice . Please stand with us . VIEW PHYSICIAN STATEMENTS OF DAPL PROTESTS EP : Nancy , I want to thank you so much for doing this interview at the last minute prior to the holidays . I wanted to start out by talking about the DAPL . So , the Sioux youth of Standing Rock , North Dakota , ran two-thousand miles , all the way from North Dakota straight to Washington , D.C. . They ran to make the government aware , and the President aware , of what was going on and to get help . This started back in April , and at that point I know the public as a whole did not know this was going on . So they brought it to the forefront and now there are thousands of us that know , but there are also millions of people , in my estimation , who do not know what is happening . EP : Correct . NG : And so , when they started this , I know they were there to present a letter to the President and it was not taken . They shunned them . And so they came back to North Dakota and they decided to make a stand on their land , according to the 1851 Treaty land . This is Sioux land , and they made a stand there , because the fact of it is that it was supposed to have been routed into Bismarck , North Dakota . And so they moved it to the territories , the Native American territory , and that happens to be Standing Rock , North Dakota , which is the reservation for the Sioux people . There are major injuries there . I just read a report today where a woman who was at Standing Rock , was critically injured by the water cannons and rubber bullets and the different things they are putting out there . She may lose her arm . And she had no weapons on her . She had NO weapons on her . And she was just standing there protecting the water , telling them , the military police to leave . And I say military police is because they are in riot gear from head to toe . EP : They are the National Guard . The National Guard has actually been sent by the Federal Government to stop the protesting . And these are peaceful protests . They are setting up camps , and they are doing everything very peacefully . Yet still we see local , state , and federal government officials coming out and doing egregious things ; very inhumane treatment . Injustice has continued year after year after year , and there is no justice for Native American rights . But there are , there are thousands and thousands who have come to Standing Rock and have camped out . There are people who are settling in , in this harsh climate . They are seeing this through all the way to whatever happens . And so , they are not leaving , and there are more and more people coming . We had people there , I think from Hawaii ; people from Asia , the Chinese people were there . There are other people from Australia and they were indigenous groups . They consider themselves indigenous groups standing with the Native Americans at Standing Rock . THE CRITICAL INJURY OF SOPHIA WILANSKY Visit the following link for the story on Sophia Wilansky who was shot with a concussion grenade and subsequently suffered critical injuries that threatened her left arm and hand . She is currently under the care of Minneapolis surgeons at a local hospital , and has undergone extensive surgery . We are also gathering supplies for our own needs . It may be a week . It may be a month . We also have many people who are just donating because they know we are going , and so we have individual donations . But I believe , just like we have been led by the LORD to go , I believe we need to go without fear , with HIS strength because of who we know the LORD is , that we go in strength that we go in power . He went with no fear . He went without the covering of unproven things , and he trusted in the LORD completely . And he slew Goliath and was successful . The fear that was hovering over the people , I mean David was very successful in destroying that . EP : You made a statement regarding the Native American people , that the history has never stopped . And I love that you said that . I know that a lot of people from all over America and Canada are coming together . This is the greatest move of unity among Native people seen in the history of America . They are going to stay . They are going to see this through . NG : Right . EP : And it really shows us as American people , the resilience of the Native American spirit . NG : Mmm-hmmm . EP : And the valiant spirit God has put within them as a people . And yet we see these horrible acts of aggression . So , the plan , the hope , the prayer is that a successful stand will have been made . One of the largest in the world , actually . And this is a water source for all the American people . It affects everyone . So really , the Native people are not just fighting for their own water and their own land . Some were successful , and some were not . So this goes far beyond the people here , beyond the tribes , beyond the United States . It goes across the land . They understand it . And it does affect the international community . It absolutely does . What is so sad is that the media has completely blacklisted this event ; these protests that have gone on for months . We are now at a critical juncture , as you said , the winter months are here . And the Native American people and other protestors in that area are going to need supplies . And the numbers continue to grow . NG : The report came back from four young ladies . They said the LORD had sent them to go and to minister . They prayed and they went . Twenty years old to thirty-five or so . When they were there people just began to come and visit them . But as they did that people began to come and get with them and talk with them . They prayed with them , and then eventually , the word got out that they were there : that there were young Christian women in the camp . They were also able to go and minister in their Native hymnal songs , the Seminole and Creek language , and they sang it under the anointing because people in that camp began to cry . They fell to their knees ; they began to raise their hands , and then one of the girls , prayed a powerful prayer according to the other three young ladies . It was such a powerful prayer . People began to come to them . They prayed with several people . It just opened the door right there . NG : Yes , approximately a month . In December . EP : In December , okay . NG : As Christian people I believe we need to physically go and help volunteer whatever the need is there . We need to be able to help in whatever area . But we are definitely taking supplies . We have a business group who is going to be donating supplies . I hope that they do . They need sub-zero clothing , gloves , and hats . So we will be donating and volunteering . There will be at least five of us that will be staying , at least for a month . NG : There is definitely room . Maybe have services there ; have some type of place where they can come . People who are experiencing trauma ; that they can come and relax in a place where they can feel the peace of God and warm up . You know , whatever we can offer them . I mean , there are definitely dangers ahead for those who are going to join the protest . EP : Correct . NG : No , no . They come at their own risk . NG : Okay , this is harsh winter . So you need to bring with you some sub-zero clothing ; headgear ; gloves ; boots ; socks ; maybe if you have some ski-gear . So , it will be very cold . Bring food with you . Some soup . You need to bring plenty of blankets . We also need generators . So , things like that . But you need to look at yourself . Figure out just how well you can handle the cold , and come dressed appropriately . NG : Exactly . Exactly . But yes , when you come you have to realize this is going to be a primitive camping . So bring whatever you need to do primitive camping . You will not have access to running water . You will not have access to just heat anywhere . There are no shelters ; no houses ; not anything out there . The people that are staying are in tents . They built temporary shelter , but those are for the people staying for the long haul . Totally prepared for this type of weather . NG : Yes , if that happens then we will wait . We will wait just a little while longer , but I expect to have the supplies delivered to me by November 29th . So , as far as I know , that has not changed . I can get that online . But the supplies should come November 29th . EP : Okay , very good to know . EP : Okay . But we will share . EP : Well , Nancy , thank you so much for your time . And we are definitely with you in spirit and we will be keeping you in our prayers . And we will be praying for a successful trip and mission , and an excellent report when you get back .
