When you are in fact being funded by the investor that has majority control of one of the corporations installing the pipeline -LRB- who owns it -RRB- , the very obvious goal of cooperation and funding the opposition is attenuating it not to bite the hand that feeds . As for point 5 -RRB- of what to do -LRB- you 'll notice the inclusion of this point attenuates every other directive they offer , since it deflects the use of the support and funds -RRB- , they themselves are not even divesting in terms of where they obtain funding , as this DAPL investor is their donor . -LRB- Offspring may run Novo . Their directive is purely hyporcritical as they themselves would never do it , as they would n't probably exist without the money . AND TAKE NOTE , the directive is targeted purely at the BANKS involved and NOT THE INVESTORS . They 've deflected , successfully , any consideration of boycotting their funding source , by directing the parties who are responsible for launching the boycott . They 've succeeded in inserting this directive by collaborating with the Tribes financially , appearing as a good shepherd and assistant , and by doing so , DIRECT the direction of the protest away from their funder , who is invested in the DAPL directly more than 10 times than any of those banks , and also has majority control of the most egregious of those banks . - Note her instruction to defund all the banks is point 3 , conveniently and completely evading her sponsor , the actual investor who the pipeline is actually for . This is in fact essential to why the movement lost . The investors felt no repercussions whatsoever , because Tides was there to direct the boycott purely against the banks loaning credit . What is so reprehensible is how whether knowing or unknowing , she has capitalized on that identity utterly while simultaneously utterly betraying it . -LRB- Look at the photo caption .
