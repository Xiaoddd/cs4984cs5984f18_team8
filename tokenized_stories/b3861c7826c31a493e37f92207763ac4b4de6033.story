The 1,172-mile DAPL would connect the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to refineries in Illinois , shipping as much as 570,000 barrels of crude oil per day . The Bakken Shale holds an estimated 5 billion barrels of oil , and is producing approximately 900,000 barrels per day . These emissions , combined with combustion of Bakken oil , are major contributors to the global climate crisis that threatens the well-being of our environment , future generations , and the Earth . Energy Transfer Partners , the Texas company behind Dakota Access , and its affiliated entities including Sunoco Logistics , have a long history of violations of environmental laws including pending lawsuits by the states of New Jersey , Vermont , Pennsylvania , and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the City of Breau Bridge in Louisiana over MTBE contamination of groundwater , as well as citations for releases of hazardous materials from its pipelines and facilities in Ohio , Oklahoma , Louisiana , Missouri , Texas , Pennsylvania , and Hawaii .

In January , over 50,000 gallons of Bakken crude oil spilled into the Yellowstone River in Montana .
