The temperatures had dropped precipitously : it was about four degrees outside , and with wind chill felt like negative 20 . By 4 p.m. , gusting snow and a darkening sky were making it difficult to see more than a few hundred yards . Everyone was in survival mode : unloading firewood , pulling on extra layers , battening down tents against the wind . A woman on a loudspeaker announced that the portable toilets would soon disappear . But the woman on the loudspeaker saw it as a tactic to try to move the water protectors out . She asked for able-bodied veterans at the camp for help digging latrines and completing compostable toilets . This is the determined face of the people who have decided to stay at Standing Rock through the long , punishing North Dakota winter . Advertisement But several different tribal governments and organizations are represented at Oceti Sakowin and Sacred Stone Camp , just across the Missouri River . Not all of them have agreed to leave . She owns the land where Sacred Stone is located and has been a central organizer in the Standing Rock movement . We stay . We respect our elders but respect our Unci Maka the most and are here first and foremost to honor her . Please continue to pray for the water protectors and spread the word that we are still here and in need of your continued support . There have been substantial donations to camp funds , intended for this type of weather emergency , and meant to pay for things like snow plows , food and housing . After several hours of vigorous public shaming from Wood on Twitter , M&T agreed to release the additional funds . Those who remain will face wind chills that could drop down to negative 40 degrees this week . Advertisement People remaining at the camp were careful to cover every inch of exposed skin , wearing balaclavas and ski goggles to cover their faces . People without adequate cover for their faces emerged with chapped , heavily windburned skin . Advertisement A deer carcass in the snow at Oceti Sakowin .

Every small county highway leading to the camp is also icy and treacherous : on Wednesday morning , proceeding into the camp , I spotted 13 stranded cars on the side of the road . Even in the places where the highway was passable , incredibly strong wind gusts blew the snow across the road , limiting visibility at times to just a few feet in front of the car .

Advertisement On the whole , tipis and yurts at Oceti Sakowin were faring better than tents , many of which had collapsed in on themselves under layers of snow and ice . There is simply no understating how difficult and potentially deadly the conditions at Standing Rock will be this winter . You can donate supplies to Standing Rock water protectors here and here .
