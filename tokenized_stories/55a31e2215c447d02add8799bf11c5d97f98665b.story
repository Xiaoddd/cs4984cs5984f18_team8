Of course , Native Americans were already here . And Columbus , while remembered as a hero by many , was brutal to the native people . In his quest to find gold , he enslaved them , working thousands to death ; brutalized them ; and murdered them . The native population was nearly wiped out . By 1550 , there were five hundred . Native Americans in what is now the United States would continue to be killed by later settlers in enormous numbers , have their land stolen by the government , and see their rights trampled on . Poverty and employment In 2012 , one in four American Indians and Alaska Natives lived in poverty , compared to a national rate of 14.5 percent . For those who identify these groups as their only race , their poverty rate was just over 29 percent . Poverty rates are even higher on big Indian reservations : Among the top ten largest , rates range from 20.2 percent for individuals to as much as 53.5 percent . And extreme poverty on these reservations is , on average , four times as high as the national rate . Advertisement On top of these high poverty rates , Native Americans experience far higher unemployment rates . The unemployment situation right now is four times worse among the Native American population than it was for the entire country during the recession . The employment rate for the native population in its prime working ages was less than 65 percent between 2009 and 2011 , 13.4 points lower than for white workers . During the same time , the Native American unemployment rate averaged 14.6 percent , nearly 7 points higher than the 7.7 percent rate for white workers . Things have been bad for a while : Native Americans have suffered double-digit unemployment rates ever since 2008 , with a current rate around 11 percent , compared to a national rate under 6 percent . Education The achievement gap between students of color and white students has been steadily closing , but not for Native students . Native Americans , including American Indians and Alaska Natives , have seen their gaps widen . In 2011 , 18 percent of Native fourth graders were proficient or advanced in reading on the National Assessment of Education Progress , compared to 42 percent of white fourth grades , a gap that has stayed flat since 2005 . Just 17 percent of Native eighth graders scored at those levels in math , compared to 43 percent of white ones . Other racial groups saw improvements during that time that far outpaced Native students . Beyond middle school , less than 70 percent of Native students graduate high school in four years , compared to 83 percent of white students . Only a quarter score at a college-ready level on the ACT math and a third on reading , compared to half and two-thirds of white students , respectively . Just half of Native students enroll in college , compared to three-quarters of white students , and once there less than 40 percent of Native students will compete a four-year college degree in four years , compared to 62 percent of whites . But that aid has been cut . Health Life expectancy for American Indians and Alaska Natives is 4.2 years less than for the American population as a whole ; they die at 368 percent higher rate of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis and a 177 percent higher rate from diabetes . They also have an 82 percent higher rate of dying from assault or homicide and 65 percent higher rate of dying from suicide . Over 13 percent of Native Americans report being in fair or poor health , much higher than for other groups . Advertisement An important cause of these gaps is that they have less access to high-quality health care . More than a third of Native Americans lack health insurance , compared to the national rate of 17.2 percent . The Indian Health Service was funded at just 54 percent of what was needed in 1999 .
