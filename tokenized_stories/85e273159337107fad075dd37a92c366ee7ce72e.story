Today my dear younger brother Wa Ha walked on . He was with us here in Washington DC as we pray and work for clemency for our father Leonard Peltier . He was my little brother and I can not believe his is gone from us . His name was Wahacanka . His english name was Paul Shields-Peltier and he was born and raised on the Pine Ridge Oglala Lakota reservation . He had been sick for many months and was having dialysis for four hours a day three days a week and although his wife and family suggested him not to make this trip , he would not be turned back . In true Oglala way he said he wanted to go on this journey to help bring his father home . He adored his wife Emily Two Lance-Peltier and his five children -LRB- four daughters and one son -RRB- and his mother Audrey Shields , his sisters and brothers and other family members and the Oglala Oyate . He was a quiet man who was known for his soft good humor and kind spirit . He never missed an event or a ceremony for our father . He was never one to stand up and speak but always there to help and support . He lived the very hard life that is life on the Pine Ridge but in recent years he joined a company that was building environmentally sustainable housing for the people of the reservation and it was something he loved to do because it knew he was helping his people . He suffered a very damaging stroke while working and has been trying to recover since . Our dad had wished to donate one of his kidneys to Wa Ha but because of his imprisonment and his own failing health that was not possible . I will never forget my fathers words when he found out . I wish we could console him now as we try to console each other . We will let people know the details of his ceremonies as we find them out . Please keep him and his family in your prayers .
