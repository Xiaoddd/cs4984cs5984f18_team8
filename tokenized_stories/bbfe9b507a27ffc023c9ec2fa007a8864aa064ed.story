For its part , the U.S. government signed over 300 treaties with Native tribes and broke every single one of them . The U.S. stole sacred land and killed off nations -- not only the people , but their culture and livelihood . For the first time , the U.S. has allowed a United Nations fact-finding mission to determine the impact of the passage of the proposed Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People . The 12-day fact-finding mission was performed by James Anaya , a professor of human rights law and policy at the University of Arizona . This mission took Anaya all over Indian Country and up to Alaska to determine the experience of Natives in this country . He will be presenting his finding in September to U.N. Human Rights Council . A girl plays outside her home on an American Indian reservation ONE OF the headline-catching recommendations from Anaya was that the U.S. government return some stolen land to Native tribe as a way forward toward reconciliation . One specific piece of land recommended is Mount Rushmore , which is located in the Black Hills National Park in South Dakota -- historically sacred land for the Lakota -LRB- Sioux -RRB- . This land was stolen after gold was found in the Black Hills , in violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 . In 1980 , the Supreme Court decided that the seizure of the Black Hills from the Lakota was illegal and stated that the U.S. needed to compensate the Lakota for the land . The Lakota refused the money , instead demanding their land back . The findings of the UN mission are no surprise since the U.S. was founded on stolen land -- along with stolen labor . The U.S. continued to expand westward in an effort to find new markets and new resources . In 1871 , the U.S. discontinued the treaty process with Native tribes . From this point , the policy of the U.S. government was to assimilate Indians into white society . Young Indians were forced to go to boarding schools , where they had to cut their hair and were forbidden from speaking their native tongue . It was n't until the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 that Indians were given the right to vote , which makes them the last minority in this country to win the franchise . The same law allowed tribes to have democratically elected councils to govern their reservations . Though these councils were set up by the U.S. government , and often used by them , this was a step towards sovereignty . The 1970s saw a rise in American Indian struggle . This came in the form of the American Indian Movement -LRB- AIM -RRB- , which looked to bring the injustices endured by Native peoples to the forefront again . Actions such as the occupation of Alcatraz Island , the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Wounded Knee , the site of the Wounded Knee massacre in 1890 , brought the issue of Native rights back in the mainstream . As a result of this pressure , the U.S. government passed the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1980 . The act states : That henceforth it shall be the policy of the United States to protect and preserve for American Indians their inherent right of freedom to believe , express , and exercise the traditional religions of the American Indian , Eskimo , Aleut , and Native Hawaiians , including but not limited to access to sites , use and possession of sacred objects , and the freedom to worship through ceremonials and traditional rites . This act supposedly gave Native Americans access to sacred sites -- but that 's often at odds with the interests of the government when the sites are on line that is rich in natural resources . One example is uranium mining in the Navajo Nation in Arizona and New Mexico . The mining for uranium not only destroyed the land and the health of many Navajos , but it helped fuel the U.S. war machine . In 2010 , President Obama stated that the U.S. government supported the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People . To get an idea of the what the declaration conveys , Article 3 states : Indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination . By virtue of that right , they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic , social and cultural development . The reality is the administration has done very little to push for the rights of indigenous people . It passed the Tribal Law and Order Act , which further militarizes reservations with the addition of more police and judges . This seems more important to federal officials than addressing housing shortages and astronomical unemployment rates on reservations . The recommendations by the UN mission will put the U.S. government on the spot . Although it 's unlikely that the U.S. will be responsive to a UN recommendation , the results of this mission create an opening to bring indigenous issues back into the mainstream debate . The indigenous people of this country are still fighting the same fight as their brothers and sisters of the past . We need to stand up for their rights against a system that continues the exploitation of Native people and land .
