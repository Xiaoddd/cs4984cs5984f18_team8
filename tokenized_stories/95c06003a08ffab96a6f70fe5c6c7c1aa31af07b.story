One of the most popular vehicle monitoring solutions over the past decade has been a product known as the Tracking Key . Featured on popular television shows such as the Today Show , Fox News , Breaking Bad and more , Tracking Key made its niche by providing families and small businesses with a affordable car tracking solution that could record data every second without any service costs per month . As time progressed , GPS engineers continued to push the evolution of data logger technology , but the Tracking Key continued to hold its place in the market as the top selling passive tracker . Although the car tracker system continued to smash sales numbers every year the device did have one very unfortunate drawback : it was not compatible with Apple computers . Fast forward to today and the Tracking Key has been rereleased with a new online-based platform that not only makes the car tracker compatible with both PCs and Macs , but the new online software gives users a more user-friendly approach to tracking vehicles . Once that individual wants to review the stored tracking data all they need to do is simply retrieve the GPS unit and download the data via USB download . All Rights Reserved . All Rights Reserved .
