Again . Weird . Russia has betrayed that trust . Europe needs to start working on energy independence immediately . Making any further deals with Russia is unconscionable until adequate change in the country occurs . Bad for Europe to be so dependent on Russian gas & oil . It does look VERY bad that we have to question whether the leader of our country and his minions are committing treason for a foreign agent . This is only the latest in a long string of things he 's done that goes directly AGAINST Russia 's best interest . At some point you should probably look at what he 's actually DOING .
