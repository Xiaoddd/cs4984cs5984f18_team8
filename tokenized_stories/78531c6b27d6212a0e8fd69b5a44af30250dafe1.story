The equation was developed in conjunction with Professor Will Steffen , a climate change expert and researcher at the Australian National University , and was published in the journal The Anthropocene Review . The authors of the paper wrote that for the past 4.5 bn years astronomical and geophysical factors have been the dominating influences on the Earth system . The Earth system is defined by the researchers as the biosphere , including interactions and feedbacks with the atmosphere , hydrosphere , cryosphere and upper lithosphere . This represented a change to the climate that was 170 times faster than natural forces . It shows that while other forces operate over millions of years , we as humans are having an impact at the same strength as the many of these other forces , but in the timeframe of just a couple of centuries .
