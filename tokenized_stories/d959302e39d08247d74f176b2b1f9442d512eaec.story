Workers spray the beach where oil washed on shore after the Exxon Valdez oil spill . -LRB- photo : AP -RRB- Where We Drill , We Spill : Commemorating Exxon Valdez By Franz Matzner , Natural Resources Defense Council 24 March 17 wenty eight years ago today the world experienced a massive wake-up call on the hazards and harms of oil spills when the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open and poured oil into Alaskan waters . At the time , images of oil coated wildlife and a devastated ecosystem in one of the world 's most delicate , iconic and majestic environments drew global attention . Today , oil still lurks under the surface of Prince William Sound , impairing wildlife and human lives . Eleven years later , BP 's Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded , killing 11 workers and spreading millions of gallons of crude throughout the Gulf of Mexico . Gulf communities are still trying to recover from this devastating blow to local economies and human health . Years of legal challenge and delay by the oil industry meant those least able to absorb the blow to their way of life abandoned and foundering . In the aftermath of the BP disaster , a non-partisan , blue ribbon commission was established to provide recommendations to mitigate the risk of future events , providing hope to communities already exposed to oil drilling that finally their voices would be heard . Despite these consensus proposals , adequate safety reforms have never been formulated , let alone implemented and even the progress that has been made is at risk . Sea ice is making repairs impossible , underscoring again the unique challenges of oil and gas exploration in Alaska 's frozen and tumultuous waters . Wired reported in December that there are about 30,000 oil spills per year in U.S. waters , most of which are in the Gulf of Mexico . It 's being killed , literally , by a thousand cuts . Nor are spills the only concern . Ongoing operations produce other pollutants , including toxic metals and carcinogens , that are dumped into the ocean . A toxic mix of metals , fluids and other drilling bi-products harm marine ecosystems and are suspected in increasing mercury levels in some fish populations . To say nothing of the infrastructure development that can rip apart habitats and the industries that rely on them . Its high risk designation , granted to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement in 2016 , indicates that the agency charged with limiting offshore oil spills is not doing its job effectively . Just this week , in fact , the Government Accountability Office released a report expanding on its findings about the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement . And the House Oversight committee held a hearing on oil well safety , which focused on that report and further exposed the lack of meaningful safety measures as well as the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement 's significant lack of staffing and resources . Fortunately , at the close of the previous administration , bold actions were taken to preserve and protect large swaths of our Arctic and Atlantic oceans from future oil disasters . These decisions came in direct response to the broad and unwavering call from all corners of the country to stop the expansion of oil drilling into these public waters and recognized that the rapid growth of clean energy means there is simply no need to expose our still oil-free beaches , local economies and climate to the inherent harms of offshore drilling . This victory is something that should be built on . Yet the Trump administration 's oil cabinet and its allies in Congress have instead launched a systematic attack to do precisely the opposite , opening the door for these vital oceans owned by all American 's to be sold and exploited at the behest of select private oil companies . The very first piece of legislation signed by President Trump was a gift to Exxon and global despots , designed to make it easier for oil , gas and coal companies to bribe foreign governments without accountability . And to complete the package , legislation is being proposed in the House and Senate that would open the door to a radical expansion of offshore drilling . One proposal would overturn recently finalized drilling safety standards specifically designed to meet recommendations made by the Oil Spill Commission . Draft legislation being circulated by Rep. Bratt -LRB- R-VA -RRB- and another bill introduced by Sen. Cassidy -LRB- R-LA -RRB- would remove current permanent protections in the Arctic Ocean , along the Atlantic coast and in Alaska 's Bristol Bay , bar any future President from providing such protections and gut the underlying law that ensures public input into how public resources are utilized . Extreme by any measure , these legislative proposals should be rejected , even by those who do not oppose offshore drilling . It is simply unconscionable to discount the documented safety , environmental and health risks that come with offshore drilling and to put in place a system designed to exclude the coastal residents most in harm 's way , flout the science of climate change and flatly reject the basic principles of responsible management of our public lands and oceans . Fortunately , across the country millions of concerned citizens , communities , businesses and local residents are ready to stand strong against this attempt to rob future generations of our pristine beaches , healthy oceans and a stable climate . Urge your Members of Congress to oppose Big Oil 's plan to bring Big Spills back to our beaches . Ask them to instead cosponsor legislation to protect our oceans , communities and climate .

Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections : For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S. , particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election . We too were alarmed at the patterns we were , and still are , seeing . It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy , disciplined , and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before . It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time . We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century . The comments of our readers are the most vibrant , best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News . Accordingly , we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services . It is , however , important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in . Adapt and overcome . Any man who likes to grope women , will use the Planet the same way - as a garbage dump waiting to be used for his own personal gratification . He would n't be here if not for a woman . Womens bodies , like the Planet are sacred . They both bring forth life . These men bring forth death and destruction . Those who seek power in politics and business are too often as you describe - but , fortunately , not all are . We can try to appeal to those who can listen by following the advice of the author of the article above , Franz Matzner , in his last paragraph . I still ca n't understand why the christians ca n't recognize this Earth as God 's gift of life . Do they really believe as Jerry Falwell did that if we destroy this earth god will just give us another one . As a whole this makes all of us destined to destroy ourselves with our collective ignorance .
