Once again , my heartfelt thanks to all of you who helped launch this effort last year . Your belief in my work is deeply , deeply appreciated . Law enforcement is employing increasingly violent measures -- including high-pressure water hoses and dangerous projectiles and explosive devices -- on the largely peaceful demonstrations by hundreds of Native American tribes and their allies against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline project here , resulting in scores of injuries . The Army Corps of Engineers recently delivered an ultimatum to the Standing Rock tribe , indicating that the Oceti Sakowin Camp , a settlement of over 3,000 people , must be vacated or face eviction . Reports are coming in that more access roads to the camps are being blockaded . The local government has threatened to fine anyone delivering supplies to the camp . This is more than a police action . This is war . Help send Academy Award-nominated filmmaker James Spione back to the Water Protector camps at Cannon Ball , ND to witness , film and report on the Standing Rock protests as they continue to unfold , and to gather footage for a documentary about this historic direct action and its courageous participants . THE ETHICS OF GIVING I am well aware that people may have limited funds to donate to the many worthy causes out there . In this instance , the priority must be to support the material needs of the courageous people who are braving the North Dakota winter and confronting an increasingly militarized police force at Standing Rock . If you have any doubt and your funds are limited , please navigate to one of the organizations linked below to help the Water Protectors directly . This movie will be for them , and their children . For those of you who may not know me , here is the official version of what I do : James Spione has been an independent film director for over twenty years . His documentaries have been broadcast in the United States as well as internationally , and are available on multiple digital platforms worldwide including Netflix , iTunes , Amazon and Vudu . His work has screened at numerous prestigious international film festivals including Sundance , Tribeca , AFI , HotDocs , IDFA , Seattle , Camden , Boulder , Movies that Matter , Cleveland , Big Sky Documentary Festival , Ann Arbor , Starz Denver , Paris , London and Helsinki . This is an extraordinary historic moment . The rights of indigenous people to sovereignty and self-determination , the protection of sacred ancestral lands , the preservation of water as a critical resource , the threat that fossil fuel-based energy systems pose to the planetary ecosystem , and the increasing militarization of American police forces are all potent subjects , and it is amazing that they are all converging at this one historic point . And yet , incredibly , the mainstream U.S. media is all but ignoring this profoundly important story . I want to be there to help document the conflict as it unfolds , to get inside the hearts , minds and character of the women and men who are putting their lives on hold and their bodies on the line to make a stand for the cause of clean water and a livable planet for this and future generations . On a more personal level , I feel it is critical for me to be present not only to bear witness , but to put my own body in the service of my beliefs and values . Direct action is a formidable tool of protest and a way to confront systemic problems in a democracy . Translation : yes , I could be arrested . I am preparing for that possibility . MY CROWDFUNDING TRACK RECORD The films I have made over the past five years each began with people like you . My feature documentary about national security whistleblowers , SILENCED , was launched with critical startup funds from backers like you ; the film eventually was seen by millions around the world on broadcast and online platforms , and this year it was nominated for a News and Documentary Emmy Award . I have raised funds for these past projects via Kickstarter , but in this instance time is short . Believe it or not , completely independent directors like me must start pretty much from scratch with every new project . Each time out , I have to prove myself all over again , and the expense can be daunting . The advent of social media crowdfunding has become an enormously effective tool to create a truly democratic , citizen-funded journalism . Please donate whatever you can to this effort . A panel discussion with the directors , the subjects of the film and Native American activists will follow the screening . Once again , my heartfelt thanks to all of you who helped launch this effort last year . Your belief in my work is deeply , deeply appreciated . Just a quick note to share with you some of the beautiful , amazing faces of the Water Protectors who came to Washington DC this week to march on the White House . Like the other photos I have shared with you , these are actually screen stills from my video footage . Last month , I was able to make a third trip to Oceti Sakowin Camp -- this time , sadly , to document the camp 's final harrowing and emotional days . But the exuberant march in Washington , as well as the protests spreading to pipeline locations across the country , are clear evidence that the strong spirit of Standing Rock will live on . The editing of the film is coming along well . And I am now collaborating with two other directors -- one a well-known Oscar-nominated documentarian , the other a seasoned indigenous mediamaker -- on a larger collaborative project that will incorporate my film as one of three distinct parts , each helmed by a different director . Stay tuned more details are coming very soon ... Thank you all again , not just for your incredibly generous backing of this project -- but especially , for your continuing support of the brave people of Standing Rock . Thanks to all of you , I was able to make two inspiring trips to the Oceti Sakowin Camp in November and December last year . And , over the past month , I have been working hard with my editor to create a short documentary that will immerse audiences in the profoundly peaceful direct action , vibrant indigenous culture , and at times frightening conflict at this extraordinary historic event . While this film will stand on its own , I am also currently involved in discussions that could broaden this project into an exciting collaborative endeavor with a group of environmental and indigenous filmmakers .
