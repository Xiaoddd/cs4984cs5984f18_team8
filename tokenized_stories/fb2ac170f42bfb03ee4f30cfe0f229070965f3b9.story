Now the potential exists for greater suffering under the rule of a billionaire Cabinet that is far , far removed from average workers and renters and homeowners . New Evidence of an Overall Collapse Recent studies show America at or near the bottom among developed countries in disposable income poverty , income and wealth inequality , safety net provisions , employment , economic mobility , life expectancy , infant mortality , and the well-being of children . We 've run the table . The better part of America is equivalent to a third-world country . According to one careful study , they only have about half the chance that they had fifty years ago . Racist Gap-Widening Today just 100 individuals own as much wealth as the entire Black population of America . Even a middle-aged African-American with a graduate degree has only about the same odds of becoming a millionaire as a white person with a high school diploma . The common misperception is that Black youths turn to drugs at a disproportionate rate . Not true . Finding a Stable Job Is Becoming Impossible for Much of the US We keep hearing about the drop in the unemployment rate . But with nearly two out of every five American adults not even in the labor force , the unemployment rate is more like 30 percent . Two out of every five middle-class households -LRB- incomes between 80 and 125 percent of the median -RRB- have dropped to lower-class . According to Pew Research , median household expenses increased by about 25 percent between 1996 and 2014 . Income has n't budged . Young adults are living with parents to the greatest degree in the modern era , and now the parents themselves -LRB- people over 40 -RRB- are moving back in with THEIR aging parents . Less fortunate Americans are 15 pounds heavier than in the 1990s , dying from alcoholism at a record rate , and struggling with mental health problems for which treatment facilities have been continually cut , leaving many mentally ill people in jails rather than in psychiatric hospitals . Finally , most disturbingly , we 're living in an era of suicide in America , in parallel with our era of inequality . Suicide is at its highest level in 30 years . It 's especially high for veterans . War is traumatic and depressing , but so is a return to a deteriorating nation . Only if the blurred and battered American Dream turns into a progressive 2020 Vision . Only if Americans get beyond their irrational fear of the word ` social ' and begin to work together to dismantle the plutocracy that rules us . It may take the unrelenting stream of bad news to finally make that happen . Nobody Really Knows .
