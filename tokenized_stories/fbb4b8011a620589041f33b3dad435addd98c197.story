The Standing Rock Protestors Were Assaulted . The Bundy crew , which included dozens of other armed protestors , opposed what it considers unlawful ownership of federal lands . At first blush , the scenarios seem similar : a group of passionate activists commit civil disobedience in the hinterlands to protest issues that seem beyond their control . Upon moving camp , Standing Rock protestors opened themselves up to charges to trespassing , a crime that provided police with clear justification to disperse them . When the Bundys made their stand , news networks arrived immediately , beaming footage of Ammon Bundy and LaVoy Finicum fielding questions in camouflage jackets and cowboy hats . Many of the reports that have trickled out relied heavily on statements from North Dakota officials , who often portray the Native Americans as dangerous . Beyond the contrast in rhetoric , there are also discrepancies between how each group has been treated by authorities . For the first several weeks of the Malheur occupation , armed protestors could travel to and from the refuge for grocery runs . Ammon Bundy went to local towns for meetings and to negotiate with the FBI . At Standing Rock , Sheriff Kirchmeier quickly established a roadblock on the state highway just north of camp : anyone trying to enter the reservation was sent on a long detour over dirt roads . As of Thursday , more than 400 protestors have been arrested . But a video of the event shows that the first physical contact occurred when a guard tackled a protestor who had blocked the path of a bulldozer . Paradoxically , these unarmed protestors received much harsher treatment from law enforcement than the armed Patriots in Oregon . The Bundy group frequently made the point that , without guns , they would simply have been crushed by police , and this seems to be true . Racism among law enforcement agencies has been well documented : in the wake of police killings of African Americans in Ferguson and Baltimore , the Department of Justice found both departments mired in racial bias . The Malheur Occupiers Were Found Innocent . The Standing Rock Protestors Were Assaulted . Two impassioned mass protests : one led by white people with guns , the other by nonviolent Native Americans . They arrested 141 people who say the pipeline has destroyed sacred sites and in the event of a spill would contaminate drinking water on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . The Bundy crew , which included dozens of other armed protestors , opposed what it considers unlawful ownership of federal lands . Occupiers barricaded themselves inside federal buildings for six weeks , swaggering in front of news cameras with pistols strapped to their hips and rifles slung over their shoulders , before finally being evicted by law enforcement officials . At first blush , the scenarios seem similar : a group of passionate activists commit civil disobedience in the hinterlands to protest issues that seem beyond their control . The simplest evidence of the disparities between the protestors at Standing Rock and the ones at Malheur can be found by looking at how each group has been portrayed in the media and treated by law enforcement . The clashes with police occurred when protestors moved onto private property recently purchased from a rancher by Dakota Access , LLC , a subsidiary of Texas-based Energy Transfer , builder of the 1,172-mile oil pipeline from the Bakken to a refinery in Illinois . Upon moving camp , Standing Rock protestors opened themselves up to charges to trespassing , a crime that provided police with clear justification to disperse them . When the Bundys made their stand , news networks arrived immediately , beaming footage of Ammon Bundy and LaVoy Finicum fielding questions in camouflage jackets and cowboy hats . By contrast , Standing Rock protestors , who number in the thousands , have been largely ignored by national television news . Many of the reports that have trickled out relied heavily on statements from North Dakota officials , who often portray the Native Americans as dangerous . Although he did not provide evidence of the explosives , the claim found its way into the New York Times and Wall Street Journal . Beyond the contrast in rhetoric , there are also discrepancies between how each group has been treated by authorities . For the first several weeks of the Malheur occupation , armed protestors could travel to and from the refuge for grocery runs . Ammon Bundy went to local towns for meetings and to negotiate with the FBI . At Standing Rock , Sheriff Kirchmeier quickly established a roadblock on the state highway just north of camp : anyone trying to enter the reservation was sent on a long detour over dirt roads . As of Thursday , more than 400 protestors have been arrested . According to Sheriff Kirchmeier , those arrests were made in response to aggression from the protestors . Several participants and witnesses I interviewed confirmed that protestors on Dakota Access land fought with security officers . But a video of the event shows that the first physical contact occurred when a guard tackled a protestor who had blocked the path of a bulldozer . It also shows guards urging their dogs to attack protestors , six of whom were bitten . Paradoxically , these unarmed protestors received much harsher treatment from law enforcement than the armed Patriots in Oregon . The Bundy group frequently made the point that , without guns , they would simply have been crushed by police , and this seems to be true . Wanting to avoid a repeat of Waco or Ruby Ridge , federal agents took great pains to avoid a gun battle . Racism among law enforcement agencies has been well documented : in the wake of police killings of African Americans in Ferguson and Baltimore , the Department of Justice found both departments mired in racial bias . In 2013 in Phoenix , Arizona , Justice sued Sheriff Joe Arpaio for systematic infringement of the rights of Latinos . A 2012 study showed that statewide , people of color were arrested and jailed at disproportionate rates .
