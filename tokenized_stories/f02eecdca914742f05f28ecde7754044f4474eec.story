The Latin American pope , who has often strongly defended indigenous rights since his election in 2013 , made his comments on protection of native lands to representative of tribes attending the Indigenous Peoples Forum in Rome . Francis spoke two days after a U.S. federal judge denied a request by tribes to halt construction of the final link of the project that sparked months of protests by activists aimed at stopping the 1,170-mile line . The Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes have argued the project would prevent them from practicing religious ceremonies at a lake they say is surrounded by sacred ground . Thousands of tribe members , environmentalists and others set up camps last year on Army Corps land in the North Dakota plains as protests intensified . But last week , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers granted a final easement , after President Donald Trump issued an order to advance the project days after he took office in January . Francis , who wrote a major encyclical letter in 2015 on climate change and the environment , told the group that new technologies could be legitimate but had to respect the earth . place brings you exclusive land and property rights reportage produced by the Thomson Reuters Foundation .
