I thought that perhaps Perry , having been told that his report was inaccurate , decided not to use it . Turns out I was wrong . The utterly laughable segment really did air . The video I originally posted showed reporter Cal Perry recording multiple takes of a broadcast in which he talked about a spring buffalo hunt which would have Native Americans floating the carcasses down the Missouri River . JW Ad Error : JW Player adError event was fired . I confirmed this with North Dakota Indian Affairs Commissioner Scott Davis . They only time we harvest buffalo is during our pow wows or ceremonies . I asked Davis about floating the buffalo down the river . It was used on air on January 26 and was seen by some 1.2 million people according to this media clipping service . You can watch the clip that aired at the link . I guess not .
