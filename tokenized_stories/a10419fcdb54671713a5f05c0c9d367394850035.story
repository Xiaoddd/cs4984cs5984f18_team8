As the Washington Post reported , one official in particular stood out as important . This was all rather odd . And I joke about it a little bit . When he was reading those charges , she was guilty on every charge . And then he said , she was essentially OK . She was guilty on every charge . To the extent that reality still has any meaning , all of this is bonkers . Trump described details that appear to exist only in his mind .
