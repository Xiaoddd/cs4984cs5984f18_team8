Even veterans , who know better on both sides , often refuse to publicly concede the reality of how a project moves from pipe dream to production . The hard truth is that pipelines are always and only about politics . Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley shake hands during a meeting on Parliament Hill in 2016 . The first cross-Canada pipe , the project that gave birth to Trans-Canada Pipeline , helped bring down the Liberal government of Louis St. Laurent in 1957 . The infamous Pipeline Debate , ended nearly half a century of Liberal hegemony , and elected John Diefenbaker . The pipeline inquiry , led by Justice Tom Berger , became a multi-year political crusade in defence of First Nations rights , environmental concerns , and was eventually seen as an attack on the oil and gas sector itself . The beautiful full-colour photo laden reports of the Berger Inquiry sold in the thousands . Along the way we then had a series of more short-lived battles over Energy East , Northern Gateway and Keystone XL . Energy East fell victim to politics , most damagingly its poisonous reception by the government of Quebec . Northern Gateway died at the hands of enraged and empowered First Nations , and a series of governments unprepared to take the political risk of defending the transport of heavy oils through the pristine waters surrounding Haida Gwai . Then there is the doubling of the Trans Mountain pipeline . The suffering it has inflicted on politicians in two provinces and prime ministers in two successive governments is without precedent , even in our long painful pipeline history . This was , given our history , a completely predictable 11-hour impasse . The John Horgan government will need to find a face-saving way out , possibly in a spring election . But it is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who seems likely to be another , almost inevitable , pipeline victim today , like St. Laurent and his father before him . Article Continued Below In the ironies of political life , there is one solution that might have made this collision of interests avoidable . It is to have taken the oil across the Fraser River and through Washington State to an existing offtake port on the U.S. West Coast . This was the earlier planned route that almost killed the first pipeline to move oil from the Leduc oilfields to American markets . B.C. Tory and Liberal MPs at the time were appalled at the suggestion of a non-B.C . route , demanding that the federal government force Standard Oil and Bechtel to build the pipeline through their province . Such was their determination that the rerouting was made a condition of the enabling legislation that passed in March of 1951 . The name of the private legislation and its creation was : The Trans-Mountain Pipeline Act . Robin V. Sears , a principal at Earnscliffe Strategy Group , was an NDP strategist for 20 years .
