When built , the pipeline will stretch more than 1,100 miles from oil fields in North Dakota to a river port in Illinois . But according to the Standing Rock Sioux , these standard legal proceedings received a ruthless and unprecedented emendation on the ground over the weekend . As part of the ongoing trial , the legal team for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe submitted documents to the court last Friday that certified one of their main claims in the case : that the pipeline will pass through and likely destroy Native burial sites and sacred places . These documents provided some of the first evidence that state authorities had missed major archeological discoveries in the path of the pipeline . These newly discovered finds may no longer exist . The tribe and its legal team say that less than 24 hours after evidence of the new sacred sites were provided to the court , the Dakota Access company began construction on those same exact sites , perhaps destroying many of them forever . Dakota Access and the Army Corps of Engineers did not respond to a request for comment . The case is especially egregious because the Standing Rock Sioux were seeking an injunction to halt construction . Instead of waiting for a verdict from the court , Dakota Access went forward and destroyed many of the sites . Lawyers seek injunctions because they want to preserve the status quo during the trial . Altering the status quo while a trial is underway thwarts federal rule of law . One of several camps that have formed near Cannon Ball , North Dakota , as more protesters have arrived in the area . Climate activism also provides the tribe with a broad , nationwide coalition of support . But there is a risk in this widespread exposure : It allows Dakota Access to skirt over the underlying legal issues . The organization never mentioned that many of the protesters are from Native communities or nations . The land beneath the pipeline was accorded to Sioux peoples by the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868 . In that document , the tribe ceded much of the Laramie land , including the Black Hills of South Dakota , where many whites believed there to be gold . In the decades that followed , other land previously controlled by the Sioux was doled out by the federal government as homesteads to Native families ; when those farms failed , the government often repossessed the land . And in 1980 , the Supreme Court ruled that the Black Hills were taken unjustly , and it ordered the U.S. government to compensate the Sioux tribes fairly for them . But it is in partial recognition of the painful history of colonial land grabs that modern federal law accords certain rights to Native groups . Since 1992 , one of these rights could be described as the right to be consulted : Whenever a federal agency undertakes or approves a construction project , it must consult with local Native nations or tribes about whether sacred sites or places are nearby . It is also important to note that while an Indian tribe may not have visited a historic property in the recent past , its importance to the tribe or its significance as a historic property of religious and cultural significance may not have diminished for purposes of Section 106 . A local tribe is not supposed to be hustled in at the end for a rubber stamp , but included throughout the process as a collaborative body . The Army Corps of Engineers must approve and permit any interstate pipeline . The tribe alleges that not only was the permitting of Dakota Access rushed , but also that the tribe itself was not included as partners through the historical surveying process . Only near the end of the process , when approval seemed inevitable , did North Dakota state authorities approach the tribe with a couple areas of concern . They did not present plans for the pipeline at the beginning , as government-to-government negotiations should entail . Because the Army Corps failed to involve the tribe in its permitting , it could have violated the Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act . Jan Kasselman , an attorney with Earthjustice representing the Standing Rock Sioux tribe , speaks in front of D.C. district court on Tuesday . Last month , the White House ordered federal agencies to consider the environmental costs of greenhouse gases when they review a federal project under the National Environmental Policy Act -LRB- NEPA -RRB- . The Obama administration has been hinting that federal agencies should take climate change into consideration in plans like these since 2014 . If that argument were to hold , the case could set a broader precedent for the environmental risks inherent to any fossil-fuel infrastructure . That kind of ruling is six or 12 months off , though . And they are mourning the losses of last weekend . On Saturday , protestors and private security officers , armed with dogs , clashed near the site itself . A tribe spokesman told the AP that six people were bitten by the dogs , including a child . But more importantly , recently documented archeological findings were lost forever .
