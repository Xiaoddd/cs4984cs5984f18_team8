The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said on Sunday it rejected an application to allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to tunnel under Lake Oahe , a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River . They said they still expect the project to be completed , noting that the Army Corps said they had followed all required legal procedures in the permitting process . The mood among protesters has been upbeat since the rejection was announced on Sunday afternoon at the Oceti Sakowin camp in Cannon Ball , North Dakota . Activists were seen hugging and letting out war cries in response to the news . With the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump supportive of the project , activists were concerned a reversal could be coming . The pipeline is complete except for a 1-mile -LRB- 1.61 km -RRB- segment to run under Lake Oahe . That stretch required an easement from federal authorities . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it will analyze possible alternate routes , although any other route also is likely to cross the Missouri River . Some of those in a long line of traffic along Highway 1806 heading into the camp hollered and honked their horns after the news was announced . Craig Edward Morning , 30 , a carpenter from Stony Point , New York , said he will leave when the tribe says he should and the company agrees to stop building the line . He could direct authorities to approve the line , even if before he takes over from Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20 federal authorities will be studying alternative routes . North Dakota Congressman Kevin Cramer , a Republican , who has advised Trump on energy policy , said the decision ignores the rule of law . Tom Goldtooth , a Lakota from Minnesota , and a co-founder of Indigenous Environmental Network , said he expects Trump to try to reverse the decision . In November , ETP moved equipment to the edge of the Missouri River to prepare for drilling , and later asked a federal court to disregard the Army Corps , and declare that the company could finish the line . That ruling is still pending . Those spoken to after the decision said they had no plans to leave because they anticipate heated opposition from ETP and the incoming administration .
