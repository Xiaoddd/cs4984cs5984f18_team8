Lewis Beale 04.16.17 12:15 AM ET David Grann was already interested in writing a book about the serial murders of members of the Oklahoma-based Osage Indian tribe when he visited the Osage Nation Museum . On one wall was a panoramic photo of members of the tribe taken in 1924 , but there was a panel missing . Author of the 2009 bestseller The Lost City of Z , about the search for a vanished civilization in the Amazon -LRB- the film version debuted April 14 -RRB- , Grann tells an entirely different story in his latest work , one that has elements of the Wild West , classic gangster movies , the birth of the FBI , greed , and racism . However , it was racism that made these killings nonchalant , and allowed them to go on for years . What is amazing is how some of the killers did not equate killing a Native American with murder . This gave the unscrupulous the incentive to bump off Indians and take over their oil leases . Grann says he first heard about this forgotten episode when a historian mentioned the killings . So many of them have stories that have not been told , so many of them are chasing ghosts . What Grann discovered , in fact , was that despite FBI intervention , which eventually put Hale and another killer behind bars , many of the murders remain unsolved . Yet that did not stop the young J. Edgar Hoover from touting the convictions as a public relations coup for the Bureau . Grann is a New Yorker staff writer who hit it big with The Lost City of Z , which became a number one New York Times paperback bestseller and was translated into 20 languages . one wall was a panoramic photo of members of the tribe taken in 1924 , but there was a panel missing .
