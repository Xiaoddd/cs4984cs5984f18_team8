Tom Stromme Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save A federal grand jury has been convened pertaining to Sophia Wilansky , the 21-year-old New York woman who nearly lost her arm during a November pipeline protest , according to court documents obtained by the Tribune . Steve Martinez , 42 , of Colorado , was ordered to testify before the federal grand jury Wednesday , according to his Seattle-based attorney , Ralph Hurvitz . The subpoena required him to answer questions and provide physical evidence , including photos and digital memory cards . On Friday , Martinez filed a motion in the U.S. District Court of North Dakota to quash the subpoena . The motion was denied Wednesday . While Martinez did not testify , he is required to appear Feb. 1 under a new subpoena , according to Hurvitz . He will not have to provide physical evidence , because the prosecutor voluntarily gave up that requirement . In denying the motion to quash on Wednesday , U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland sided with the federal government , which argued Martinez should have to testify because he transported Wilansky from the protest to Prairie Knights Casino and called 911 for an ambulance . Assistant U.S. Attorney David Hagler wrote in his pleading that the severity of the injury led law enforcement to believe it was caused by an explosion . The woman 's father , Wayne Wilansky , has claimed the injury was caused by an alleged concussion grenade thrown by police . Police said they had no such weapons . Jackson Lofgren , president of the North Dakota Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers , said it 's uncommon to see this type of motion , because the prosecutors usually do not call non-law enforcement witnesses to a grand jury . Wilansky 's arm was severely injured during a standoff between protesters and police during the night of Nov. 20-21 at Backwater Bridge in Morton County . The incident began when protesters attempted to remove burned-out vehicles from the closed bridge . About 40 pipeline protesters and a handful of pro-law enforcement protesters demonstrated Wednesday afternoon in front of the federal courthouse in Bismarck in subzero temperatures . The building , including the post office , was shut down for about 2.5 hours . Lofgren said the prosecutor could still issue a search warrant to obtain the physical evidence Martinez is no longer required to bring with him .
