A Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City , U.S. January 10 , 2017 . Chief Executive Sloan - who took over after John Stumpf resigned in the wake of the scandal - said he was pleased with the progress the bank has made in customer remediation , as well as its ongoing review of sales practices across the company . The bank disclosed the new details as it posted its fifth straight decline in quarterly earnings on Friday , results that diverged from rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co -LRB- JPM.N -RRB- and Bank of America Corp -LRB- BAC.N -RRB- . Both posted significantly higher earnings on Friday on the back of higher interest rates and market gains since the U.S. election in November . He noted that , under the settlement , the bank is required to offer mediation to customers who feel they have not been made completely whole until September 2018 . It could not be determined whether the bank has reimbursement requirements under the other two settlements . A spokesman for Wells Fargo had no immediate response . Wells Fargo also said it is still analyzing whether additional unauthorized accounts were opened in 2009 and 2010 , which goes beyond its requirements under the settlement . The bank also said that more than 177,000 accounts that had potentially unauthorized credit cards opened , or unauthorized inquiries made , had credit score declines . It also forced the bank to change its compensation plan and scrap sales targets in order to emphasize customer service . The bank is still conducting other internal inquiries to determine who else may be responsible for the sales problems , and has said it will make amends in various ways , from compensating customers whose credit scores may have been harmed to welcoming back employees who may have been fired for the wrong reasons .
