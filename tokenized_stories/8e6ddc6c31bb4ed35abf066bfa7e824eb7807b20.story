Our power as workers increases when everyone acts in unison ; it expands exponentially when solidarity actions spread down the chain , crossing sectors , reaching new communities , and even spanning continents . Our goal is gaining a greater understanding of fossil fuel commodity chains as they presently exist and how we can better connect struggles along them locally and globally . We will provide maps of supply chains and flowcharts of the links between work sectors , and other necessary materials .

One of the forms in which the working class exists today is at the various nodal points along global supply chains . HISTORY OF THE PROJECT The project 's precursor was an informal group formed in San Francisco , California in the aftermath of the events of September 11 , 2001 . The original purpose was to research changes in the world political economy ; one subgroup studied Islamism and the changes in geopolitical inter-capitalist tensions ; the other subgroup researched and attempted to intervene in class struggle . In October 2012 we regrouped as the Global Supply Chains class when we helped co-found the Bay Area Public School . SCOPE OF THE PROJECT Capitalism relies on an integrated infrastructure of production clusters and transportation networks , comprised of ports , warehouses , rail lines , highways , information grids and investment vehicles in order to produce and circulate goods . The physical nodes are arrayed in clusters of factories , warehouses , logistics services , and retail , all tied together by maritime , rail , trucking , and telecom networks . These networks generate flows of commodities and information with ever-increasing speed , as the system strives for just-in-time production and inventory-less distribution for a unified global market . Our project demonstrates how these nodes , clusters , networks , corridors and flows are interconnected within an integrated system of production , distribution and consumption . In providing useful and accessible real time information about conflicts along global supply chains , we aim to facilitate class-based collective action that forges connections and solidarity among related struggles . Our ultimate vision is a world beyond capitalist production and supply chains . In our experience , the ideal outcome is further questions , rather than facile answers .
