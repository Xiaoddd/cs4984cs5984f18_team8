But Trump has questioned the science of climate change and campaigned on a promise to expand energy infrastructure and create jobs . Resurrection of Keystone and DAPL cements America 's climate antagonism Read more Trump signed five executive orders including one to revive the Keystone pipeline , which would span nearly 1,200 miles across six US states , shifting more than 800,000 barrels of petroleum daily from Canadian oil sands through Nebraska to refineries in the Gulf coast . A lot of jobs , 28,000 jobs . Studies have suggested that most of the jobs would not be permanent , however . A US state department study estimated the number of long-term jobs at 50 . The Standing Rock Sioux tribe , whose reservation is adjacent to the pipeline , staged protests that drew thousands of climate change activists to the rural area of Cannon Ball , North Dakota . Most of the pipeline was complete by last summer except for a small section under Lake Oahe , a reservoir that forms part of the river . The Sioux won a significant victory late last year when the US army corps of engineers declined to allow construction of the pipeline under the lake , saying alternative routes needed to be considered . On Tuesday , the Sioux said the pipeline risked contaminating tribal and American water supplies while disregarding treaty rights . How Keystone XL and Dakota Access went from opposition to resurrection Read more Energy Transfer Partners , the company that wants to build the pipeline , disputes the claim that it threatens the water supply and insists the pipeline will be safe . Obama cancelled the Keystone project in late 2015 after environmentalists campaigned against the project for more than seven years . Unfortunately , President Obama sat on this important project throughout his entire administration , even though his own state department said it had no measurable impact on climate . But environmentalists expressed disappointment and vowed to fight on . Eliminating the national interest determination process , used by both Republican and Democratic administrations for decades , cedes control of our borders to multinational corporations to jam through cross-border infrastructure projects . Democrats joined the criticism . Today , President Trump ignored the voices of millions and put the short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry ahead of the future of our planet . It was also reported on Tuesday that the Trump administration had instituted a media blackout at the Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- and barred staff from awarding any new contracts or grants . Spicer , the White House press secretary , denied any knowledge of the gag on the EPA . The president signed the orders with Vice-President Mike Pence , chief of staff Reince Priebus , chief strategist Steve Bannon and adviser Kellyanne Conway among those standing nearby . He also put his name to an order for the pipes themselves to be made in the US . So unless there is difficulty with that , because companies are going to have to sort of gear up . Much pipeline is bought from other countries . If we build it in the United States , build the pipelines , we want to build the pipe . OK . We will build our own pipeline , we will build our own pipes . In fact , Democratic senator Al Franken proposed an amendment to legislation forcing the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline in 2015 that would have required the project to use only domestic steel ; Republicans unanimously blocked the amendment from consideration . We have outstanding candidates and we will pick a truly great supreme court justice . It is a claim he had made before with no evidence . Meanwhile it has emerged that James Comey , the director of the FBI , will be keeping his job under Trump . A justice department memo lists him among officials remaining in their positions . FBI directors are appointed to 10-year terms intended to carry across presidential administrations , even when a new party takes over the White House . Comey is in his fourth year in the job . Trump criticised the FBI during the campaign for its decision not to recommend charges against his Democratic opponent , Hillary Clinton . But he also appeared to warmly greet Comey at a law enforcement gathering over the weekend . Senate committees approved Trump cabinet nominees Ben Carson for housing , Elaine Chao for transportation , Wilbur Ross for commerce and Nikki Haley for UN envoy .
