Skimm This ADIOS THE STORY Last week , Fidel Castro died at age 90 after battling health issues for years . REMIND ME ABOUT HIM . Castro came into power in the late 50s by kicking out the country 's former dictator , Fulgencio Batista . Hundreds of people connected to Batista were executed . And many Cubans fled to nearby Miami . He embarrassed President Kennedy with that little thing called the Bay of Pigs invasion . Meanwhile , the US and Cuba spent the last two years trying to normalize relations . Think : opening embassies , loosening travel limitations . But President-elect Trump may not be down with these changes . theSKIMM Castro was one of the most well-known leaders in the world . Like him or hate him , his death is a BFD for international politics . Now , all eyes are on Trump to see if US-Cuban relations will go from room temperature to icy again . That 's what Hillary Clinton 's campaign is saying . But the gov says there 's no evidence that Russia actually hacked votes on Election Day . President-elect Donald Trump won WI , MI , and PA by more than 100,000 votes combined , but Hillz won the national popular vote . Apparently the election was n't over , it still is n't over . South Korea 's President Park Geun-Hye knows the feeling . Over the weekend , more than a million protesters reportedly took to the streets in Seoul calling for Park to step down . It was the fifth straight week of protests . This all has to do with allegations that Park helped a close friend commit extortion and gave her access to confidential gov docs . The friend was arrested earlier this month and charged with things like fraud and coercion . And prosecutors say they 're looking into Park as a suspect in the crimes . Park denies the allegations . But that has n't helped make South Koreans feel any better about having her serve as prez . Her approval rating 's tanked . And now , opposition parties are trying to hold an impeachment vote if Park does n't say ` bye ' on her own . That 's what the Army Corps of Engineers is saying to Dakota Access Pipeline protesters in North Dakota . They have until Dec. 5 to pack their tents . The Dakota Access Pipeline is the project that 's supposed to carry hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude oil a day across four states . But a Native American tribe in North Dakota says it was n't properly consulted before the pipeline was approved , violating their sovereign rights . And that the proposed pipeline route would destroy sacred sites and contaminate their water supply . The tribe sued , which stopped construction in ND . Now , the pipeline has mostly been built except for the part near the reservation . Police have repeatedly used tactics like spraying tear gas and using water hoses against mostly unarmed protesters to try to get them to move . And now officials say protesters need to go somewhere else . Off . She was 82 .
