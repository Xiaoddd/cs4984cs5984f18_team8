The Standing Rock Sioux are inspiring the world with their resistance against the pipeline . facebook twitter google-plus envelope We all need safe food and clean water . By Jo Miles , Hugh MacMillan When the Army Corps of Engineers issued a permit for the 1,100-mile Dakota Access Pipeline in July , executives at the corporations behind the plan probably thought their path forward was clear . Thousands of people , mostly Native Americans , have converged at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota in an effort to stop the pipeline from being built . As we will detail , the Standing Rock Sioux are not just up against the oil and gas industry and the federal government , as daunting a challenge that alone would be . They are up against many of the most powerful financial and corporate interests on Wall Street , the profit-driven institutions that are bankrolling this pipeline plan and so many others like it throughout the country . The pipeline company disrupted the peaceful demonstration this weekend when its security firm unleashed violence on the activists , attacking them with dogs and pepper spray . These water protectors need your support . But behind the companies building the pipeline is a set of even more powerful Wall Street corporations that might give you flashbacks to the 2007 financial crisis . Beyond the Energy Transfer family of companies , many of the same banks have likewise given big credit lines to the other stakeholders in the pipeline -- Phillips 66 , Marathon and Enbridge . These banks expect to be paid back over the coming decades . By locking in widespread drilling and fracking in the false name of U.S. energy independence and security , the banks are increasing our disastrous dependence on fossil fuels . How Standing Rock Sioux are Fighting Back The focal point of the resistance is at a camp outside the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota . In August , youth from the tribe finished a 2,000-mile relay run to Washington , D.C. , to bring their message to the White House in their own show of opposition . The tribe is doing everything in their power to stop this pipeline . Dozens of protesters have already been arrested , and police have spread false rumors of violence from the peaceful protectors . In contrast , the activists stand against them with only their bodies , protecting their sacred and sovereign land and water by physically standing in the way of the construction . We all owe these activists our support . Communities all along the pipeline route have been carrying out their own protests , and Food & Water Watch has been working with the Bakken Pipeline Resistance Coalition to block the proposal since it was first announced in 2014 . The Problems with Pipelines Oil pipelines are inherently dangerous , and threaten our communities and environment with spills and explosions . The Dakota Access pipeline would pump about a half-million barrels of oil each day along 1,100 miles through the Dakotas and Iowa to Southern Illinois . There , the oil would be sent to the East Coast refineries and other markets by train , or down another 750 miles to the Gulf Coast through a second pipeline that Energy Transfer Partners is converting to carry oil . In building this infrastructure , Energy Transfer and its financial backers are banking on increased fracking in the United States in the coming decades . Over that time , communities will be left to deal with the spills , explosions , water pollution , air pollution , and climate impacts that ensue . Help Stop the Bakken Pipeline Pipelines are not the answer to our energy needs . This is why we need our elected officials to support the Standing Rock Sioux and other activists , and use his authority to revoke the federal permits and deny the Bakken pipeline . Urge your senators to deny the Bakken pipeline . Get the latest on your food and water with news , research and urgent actions .
