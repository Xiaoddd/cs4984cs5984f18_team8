Police at the edge of a Standing Rock protest encampment near Cannon Ball , North Dakota . Officers in North Dakota and South Dakota have pulled over and searched at least four veterans on their way to the camps at Standing Rock in recent days , charging two of them for medical cannabis . The charges against two veterans , who said they use medical cannabis to treat post-traumatic stress disorder , come days after a veterans service organization announced it would be returning to Standing Rock to provide support . News of the charges adds to growing concerns that law enforcement is aggressively monitoring , arresting and prosecuting people affiliated with the anti-pipeline movement . The Guardian recently reported that an FBI terrorism task force has attempted to contact at least three people tied to the demonstrations . Matthew Crane , one of five founding members of VeteransRespond , was pulled over last Friday night when he was arriving to Standing Rock with two other vets and a fourth passenger . The group got lost on a closed road , he said , and they were trying to find officers to get directions . The 33-year-old navy veteran said he has a disability stemming from his service and that the roughly one gram of medical marijuana he had on him came from Washington DC , where cannabis is legal . He lives in New York , where medical cannabis is also legal . On Thursday , police in Mobridge , South Dakota , arrested two individuals that officials claimed were VeteransRespond members . Sanderson , however , said they were not members , although one of them , Travis Biolette , is now loosely affiliated with the group , which is assisting him in his charges . A police search found hash oil , which is classified as a controlled substance in South Dakota . Biolette and his friend were taken to jail in Selby , South Dakota . In a phone interview Monday night , Biolette said he spent four nights in jail and was released earlier in the day . He said that police pulled him over for speeding about six miles above the limit and that when he revealed he was going to Standing Rock , the officer launched a search . He said the hash oil is his prescribed medication , which he uses for PTSD and major depressive disorder . Biolette , who is now getting support from VeteransRespond members who picked him up from jail , said police still have his vehicle with all of his possessions , including his cold-weather clothing . Nonetheless , he was still planning on Monday night to go to Standing Rock , which he also visited last year . VeteransRespond has said it intends to help Standing Rock leaders on camp with a range of responsibilities , including cleanup efforts , kitchen help and medical aid .

Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections : For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S. , particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election . We too were alarmed at the patterns we were , and still are , seeing . It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy , disciplined , and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before . It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time . We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century . The comments of our readers are the most vibrant , best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News . Accordingly , we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services . It is , however , important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in . Adapt and overcome . They will do the bidding of the real rich . It 's going to be real bloody , unfortunately . The genetic memories of genocide enacted on our First People Relatives , here on Mother Earth , have been awakened , and WE ARE RAW . I am supremely proud of our Standing Rock Relatives , and ALL who joined with them , to stand in prayer , both on-site and off , for the Greater Good of All . I find it extremely ironic that by doing so , their actions are being threatened by those who are blatantly breaking the first laws of our land : the right to assembly , the right to speak one 's Truth without fear of retribution , the right to pray according to one 's faith . But what is happening is that , by the oil and money mongers bulldozing their way through broken treaties and trails of blood , not only are we First Nations coming together , but so also are All Nations of the World . They know what they 're up against , and I think they are up to the job . They rounded up people planning to protest at the Republican Party Convention back in 2004 . Needless to say , surveillance and targeting are even more precise today . I 'm in no position to make this argument , but it looks like disbanding the protests after President Obama issued a temporary halt was a bad move .
