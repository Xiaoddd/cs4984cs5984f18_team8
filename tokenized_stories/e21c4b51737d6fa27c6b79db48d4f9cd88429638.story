The community had been under a boil water advisory for 22 years . Researchers ran various scenarios using those investments and found funding only covers between 50 and 70 per cent of the total investments needed . The prime minister made a firm commitment to end long-term drinking water advisories on reserve . Access to clean water is a fundamental right . The report also notes that while the government financially supports most systems on reserve , it does not support all systems . The report cautions that its estimates are sensitive to assumptions about population growth and other demographic factors , as well as a variety of capital investment options .
