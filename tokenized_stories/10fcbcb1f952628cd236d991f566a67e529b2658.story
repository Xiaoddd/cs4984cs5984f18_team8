The Secretary of the Army Corps of Engineers has told the Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault that the route for the Dakota Access pipeline has been denied near the reservation , but are studying alternate routes . For the first time in history native American , they heard our voices . However , as The Young Turks have been reporting over the past hour , even though this is a historic victory , we must all remain vigilant in continuing to oppose this pipeline entirely as well as promote wind and solar energies that are so needed at the moment . Additionally , it must be remembered that Donald Trump has money in this pipeline working out and so the pressure must remain when he becomes President in late January . This news comes on the day when over 2,000 military veterans have arrived at Standing Rock to help protect the water protectors . Included in the wave of veterans is Hawaii Democrat House Representative Tulsi Gabbard , who has long opposed the pipeline . Water is life . We can not live without it .
