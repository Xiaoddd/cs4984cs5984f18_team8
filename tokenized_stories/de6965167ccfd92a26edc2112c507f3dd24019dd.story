In prayer we are trying to do something or to get something done , either for ourselves or for someone else . The reason is revealed only a few lines further . What is to be given is the Holy Spirit . In other words , energy , ideas , and inspiration . But it is we who must do the acting . This brings us to the point of fact that there are essentially two types of prayer : vertical and horizontal . By vertical prayer , I mean that which is directed toward God or the Higher Self or toward someone in spirit . From this type of prayer we can only get inspiration , knowledge , understanding , and energy . Note carefully that the guidance we may get is in the form of ideas and inspiration . We do not actually get the kind of guidance that tells us exactly what to do and how to do it . That kind of guidance implies the making of choices , and that is our sole prerogative . Horizontal prayer is that directed toward our everyday life , either to heal or help ourselves or others , or to change the future . This type of prayer is accomplished by us , and its effectiveness is determined by our beliefs and by the amount of energy we put into it . We each create our own experience of reality , the circumstances we find ourselves in , and through prayer properly understood we can change those circumstances . But it is the individual who changes the circumstances , not God and not the High Self . From them we only get the tools ; they will not do the work for us . Please join in prayer for Standing Rock so that all involved get the guidance to resolve the situation in a peaceful , environmentally-conscious manner . account .
