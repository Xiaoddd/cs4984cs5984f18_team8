CCS investment has not received necessary backing in part because the US , Europe , and China are shifting the fuel mix away from coal and towards cost-competitive , often subsidized , alternative fuels , adds Zubets-Anderson However , coal plays an important role in grid reliability and fuel diversity , and these factors could move to the forefront of policy considerations if its environmental footprint becomes of less concern , says Moody 's , particularly if there was also a material change in price dynamics between coal and natural gas . Additionally , a number of entities , including the International Energy Agency -LRB- IEA -RRB- , consider CCS essential to achieving Paris Agreement goals and curbing global warming , because some coal-fired electricity generation will remain in the global fuel mix . Clean-coal technologies are particularly essential to ensuring environmental sustainability in Asia , where developing economies are poised to drive steady growth in global coal consumption for the next two decades , notes Zubets-Anderson . However , due to the lack of opportunities to use captured CO2 in the oil fields , CCS development has not gained momentum in the region .
