We do language , that is how civilizations heal . However , while Chance the Rapper sidestepped political talk , Paris Jackson jumped right into the arena when she came out to introduce a performance by The Weekend and Daft Punk . And that was just the first two presenting turns at the microphone tonight . No word if the former Celebrity Apprentice host will be checking out the Grammys , but we know the FCC will be watching in case the language crosses lines . If that does happen , in a political context or not , the federal agency will start dropping fines on the House of Moonves . Never shy to make a statement , political or otherwise , Kanye West is up for eight nominations this year as are Drake and Rihanna . Last year , the Grammys saw a Gaga tribute to the recently deceased David Bowie -LRB- who won five Grammys today for his final album Blackstar -RRB- , and tonight will see tributes to Prince and George Michael , both of whom passed away in 2016 .
