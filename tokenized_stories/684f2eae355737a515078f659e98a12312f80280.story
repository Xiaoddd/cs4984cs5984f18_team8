17 , 2017 11:55 AM EST Bill McKibben : Trudeau 's Pipeline Push Makes Him a Disaster for the Climate Donald Trump is so spectacularly horrible that it 's hard to look away -LRB- especially now that he 's discovered bombs -RRB- . But precisely because everyone 's staring gape-mouthed in his direction , other world leaders are able to get away with almost anything . Look one nation north , at Justin Trudeau . And he 's mastered so beautifully the politics of inclusion : compassionate to immigrants , insistent on including women at every level of government . Give him great credit where it 's deserved : in lots of ways he 's the anti-Trump , and it 's no wonder Canadians swooned when he took over . But when it comes to the defining issue of our day , climate change , he 's a brother to the old orange guy in DC . Not rhetorically . Trudeau says all the right things , over and over . He 's got no Scott Pruitts in his cabinet . Everyone who works for him says the right things . But those words are meaningless if you keep digging up more carbon and selling it to people to burn , and that 's exactly what Trudeau is doing . He 's hard at work pushing for new pipelines through Canada and the U.S. to carry yet more oil out of Alberta 's tar sands , which is one of the greatest climate disasters on the planet . That is to say Canada , which represents one-half of one percent of the planet 's population , is claiming the right to sell the oil that will use up a third of the earth 's remaining carbon budget . That is to say , Trump is a creep and a danger and unpleasant to look at , but at least he 's not a stunning hypocrite . Yes , 173bn barrels is indeed the estimate for recoverable oil in the tar sands . So let 's do some math . If Canada digs up that oil and sells it to people to burn , it will produce , according to the math whizzes at Oil Change International , 30 percent of the carbon necessary to take us past the 1.5 degree target that Canada helped set in Paris . Right . If Canada is busy shipping carbon all over the world , it does n't matter all that much if every Tim Horton 's stopped selling donuts and started peddling solar panels instead . Canada 's got company in this scam . Australia 's Malcolm Turnbull is supposed to be more sensitive than his predecessor , a Trump-like blowhard . Which is a fine thing to say , or would be , if your government was n't backing plans for the largest coal mine on earth . That single mine , in a country of 20 million , will produce 362 percent of the annual carbon emissions that everyone in the Philippines produces in the course of a year . It is , obviously , mathematically and morally absurd . And frackers wo n't even have to keep track of how much methane they 're spewing under his new guidelines . If you believe , as Trump apparently does , that global warming is a delusion , a hoax , a mirage , you might as well get out of the way . Trump 's insulting the planet , in other words . But at least he 's not pretending otherwise . The scorecard shows that 140 House members voted against chemical safeguards every time , while 149 members consistently voted for chemical safety protections . However , the action fund praised the lawmakers that bucked their party to vote for chemical safety , including Reps. voted for funding chemical reviews and against a farm bill that included pesticide safety loopholes . Florida Reps. A Preview of the People , Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule , two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Updated and reissued every five years , these guidelines are the nation 's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations . supply . These nominees will be well-known in their fields , and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers , academics and practitioners . part of the process is happening in real time . what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors . Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff , and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally . Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries . And here 's the first place you 'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition : rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected , USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first , soliciting public comments in the process . In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts , it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance . And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious . After the committee is announced in early 2019 , it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report . all appearances , the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs . though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable , plant-based diets have been all but stymied , there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle . Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance , including the meat industry , dairy industry , and sugar-sweetened beverage associations , as well as formula companies , which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers . -LRB- This may be happening in real-time , too . Exposure can be caused by contact , ingestion or inhalation . Short-term health effects can range from skin irritation and numbness to fever and headaches . Long-term exposure can lead to cancer , liver failure and sperm damage . is traditionally called blue-green algae is actually a class of microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria . Cyanobacteria can be toxic and can also produce various types of cyanotoxins that have different hazards . With their small , developing bodies , children are especially endangered by algae exposure . was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption . But it probably wo n't be the last , especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year . Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets . If you believe your pet may have been exposed , be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy , seizures , diarrhea or vomiting . And as climate change gets worse , the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks , creating a toxic feedback loop . The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish . Communities that struggle with regular , serious toxic algae outbreaks , like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie , can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation . The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth . The women were all non-smokers , had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies . Macrophages , which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body , protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles , such as bacteria and pollution particles . The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants . That 's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA 's Office of Inspector General -LRB- OIG -RRB- , the agency 's internal watchdog . EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement , and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was required to respond to the April 2017 petition within 90 days , but nearly 17 months have passed with no finding . more than 97,000 giraffes remain in the wild , and the species is gravely imperiled by habitat loss , civil unrest , hunting for meat and the international trade in bone carvings , skins and trophies . U.S. provides a large market for giraffe parts . for their six-foot-long necks , distinctive patterning and long eyelashes , giraffes have captured the human imagination for centuries . But so , under this definition , are multi-thousand-acre corporate entities using automated machinery to grow genetically engineered corn . Size of the farm is not a factor ; neither is the style of agriculture . A family farm may not even have a family that owns or works the land . issue with such a broad definition of family farming is primarily in the discourse . Aid is divvied up by revenue among family farmers , with additional programs going to some specialized farmers , like young or beginning farmers , organic farmers , and sustainable farmers . Canadians can legally buy and consume cannabis starting this Oct. 17 .
