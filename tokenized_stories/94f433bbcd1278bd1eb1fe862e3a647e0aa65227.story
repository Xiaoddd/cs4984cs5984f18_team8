As I watched the horizon , hordes of righteous , beaming souls started a police-escorted procession and then moved across the bridge and into downtown . The demo ended with spectacular speeches by a range of First Nations displaying a singular commitment to defeat Kinder Morgan 's plan to massively expand its Trans Mountain Pipeline , which runs from Alberta to Burnaby , B.C. Immersion in the energy of the crowd was enough to raise a cynic 's sense of resignation as the world inexorably moves down a dangerous climate path facilitated by Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau . Mounting news of climate mayhem includes , for instance , the disappearance of winter in the Arctic . The words of the late poet Leonard Cohen had become a refuge for me , like many others over the last weeks : everybody knows the dice are loaded and the fight is fixed . We all have this broken feeling that their dog just died , that the politicians are talking to their pockets ; that the boat is leaking , the captain lied , and the deal is rotten . Now , it 's just anger . The ambivalence of the deepening pessimism of our future on the one side , and simultaneously heightened optimism in the fleeting collective high with friends and comrades in the march has now dissolved . Now , with the Kinder Morgan decision , it 's just anger . This is the problem with a climate movement aligning with political power , rather than with social justice . As president , Trump would dump the Paris climate agreement . But what gets lost in the demonizing of Trump and Harper is a critical memory and understanding of the threat to the environment from their political rivals , Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau . We should have all been clear that his pursuit of the national carbon tax is only cover for the continued exploitation of coal , gas and oil . The Onset of Abrupt Climate Change Scientists have argued for over 100 years that the radiative effects of increasing carbon dioxide would eventually push delicate ecosystems past historical boundaries and into zones that were dangerous to human life and delicate ecological equilibriums . Today , scientists monitor the onset of abrupt climate change in real time . Those who fear a Trump presidency or Trudeau duplicity is disaster do not understand that we are already well into the disaster . Trump is just a little more extreme symptom of a much larger and more intransigent problem that most citizenry are willing to accept . The Climate Movement Vancouver Needs After the fleeting exuberance of the day of the demo , I could n't help wonder what kind of climate movement is being built in the multiple B.C. struggles against Kinder Morgan , PacificNorthwest LNG , Site C , the reopening of Mount Polley , to name a few . To achieve any overall success , these multiple challenges require a coordinated effort by a strategic environmental movement , organized by region , industry , sector . It needs to develop a tactical focus and organizational structure that is informed by some understanding of what links all these threats together . These false solutions to climate crisis included carbon markets and meagre market disincentives such as carbon pricing and tax schemes ; nothing that would threaten continued economic growth and the power of the one per cent over the interests of people and the planet . The corporate control over climate solutions have meant that over the last 22 annual United Nations climate meetings , global emissions have almost doubled and the threat of climate crisis has become increasingly catastrophic . Trudeau will go on doing what he has been elected to do : ensuring Canada 's place in the juggernaut of globalized capitalism with its growth and profit imperatives . The time for small measures is over and the need for drastic action is at our doorstep . The reality of the threat of catastrophic climate change requires the movement to keep fighting on all fronts . But it also requires the addition of an important element .
