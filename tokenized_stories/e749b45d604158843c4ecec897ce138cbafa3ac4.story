What began as a spontaneous protest by members of the Standing Rock Sioux against the Dakota Access Pipeline cutting through sacred sites and burrowing under their only source of fresh water became in quick order a broad indigenous declaration of sovereignty , a national focus of the fight against causes of global climate change , and , following the November election , an increasingly ragged and disorganized statement of resistance , one largely taken over by white activists , against the incoming administration . The encampment closed last week . The atmosphere of sad futility , reinforced by pictures of burning tents and piles of trash in lanes of mud , is heavier for the inevitability connected to it . In mid-September the overwhelming feeling at the Seven Fires camp was of dedication and goodwill among all there , a powerful sense of purpose drawn intimately from Native American spiritual practice . One felt , even as a witness , part of an enormous ceremony , one of regular public prayer and thanksgiving , something that transcended the visible horizon and everyday concerns . None of this , of course , happened . A series of drive-by celebrity appearances , welcomed by organizers , brought more public attention than greater appreciation of what Native People were attempting there . Unfortunately , the image of the elderly , portly Rev. Jesse Jackson propped on one of the camp ponies for a quick October photo-op spoke more about a tiresome variety of political theater than any Truth to Power . What once had operated in a spirit of non-violence , accord , and respect , especially for Native elders , devolved to competing agendas and personal fiat . Native participation dropped dramatically as white people , accused by Indian organizers in late November of treating the camp as another Burning Man party , arrived in growing numbers . This came a week after the Standing Rock tribal council , by unanimous vote , asked the militant Red Warriors camp , an Indigenous group , to leave after a violent clash with law enforcement . The Standing Rock tribe had supplied sustaining support even as outside donations poured in . Portable sanitary facilities had been cleared daily at tribal expense , that is until they froze in subzero conditions -LRB- one doubts they were replaced by any effective winter alternative -RRB- . Meanwhile police roadblocks , and a central bridge damaged in the worst violence in late October , had the added effect of cutting off easy access from Bismarck to the tribal casino . While a council vote in mid-October had nominally allowed the camp to move onto the reservation , it was pointedly not unanimous and , anyway , the camp was too big to relocate , reaching an estimated peak of a nearly unimaginable 10,000 people . An orientation class became necessary for newcomers ; mainly to explain aspects of Native American culture many felt were being disrespected . That these events also coincided with a direction by the Obama administration for the Army Corps to begin an environmental impact statement was seen as a great victory , though the outcome of the election a month later quickly put paid to that . Any desire of continued resistance had to overcome the inertia of what remained : ill will among groups of protestors , a constant feeling of surveillance and siege , dwindling tribal support , harsh winter conditions , and the coming spring flood . In early December , the Standing Rock council asked all non-Sioux protestors to leave , which was followed in late January by a request for all to go . The fight , the council observed , is now in the courts . The Army Corps announced that an eviction notice given in early December would be enforced February 23 . By then most on site finally complied , setting fire to tents and buildings before leaving , as disposal crews began hauling tons of trash from what is now another prairie ghost town . One wonders if those who stayed to be arrested , however fine their intentions , had anywhere else to go . It would be wrong to judge the success or failure of the Standing Rock protest only on the outcome of the Dakota pipeline project , or the final condition of the Seven Fires camp . As a matter of inter-tribal accord for the indigenous people of North and South America , it may be of lasting importance . It was also an historic opportunity for native people to express on a personal level a regained sense of autonomy and pride , a reengagement with practices dormant for 150 years . As a political event with great spiritual significance , the effect of the great Seven Council Fires camp could be a lasting pan-Indian movement , one mainly invisible to outsiders . Some wrapped in righteous anger and self-regard will have learned absolutely nothing , both extremes of the divide looking forward to the next barricade to build up or knock down . We learned that the pull away from engaged first principles towards opportunistic theater is as strong as ever . Others realized the extent to which state authority will go to protect private interests . Promised reimbursements by the State of North Dakota , totaling millions , to these distant jurisdictions are still pending . As impromptu and lightly organized as the Standing Rock protest was , it exposed a parallel , and less understandable , dysfunction in the economic and civic planning behind the Dakota pipeline in the first place . For one thing , current oil prices make the pipeline barely profitable ; the same goes with coal . Long-range market forces are turning energy extraction into a losing proposition for the American West . The North Dakota government was ill prepared and over-reactive , apparently moved at the start from fear and anger more than maintaining any sense of public well being . Morton County opened itself up to hundreds of police misconduct suits that can only jam an already burdened court system . It would not be surprising if all but the most serious felony criminal charges connected to the protests are soon dropped . The long emergency at Standing Rock has unfolded in the midst of a broader crisis in the West , one with all the marks of a culture collapse resembling the one that overwhelmed native communities 140 years ago . Some will challenge this notion . A declining extraction economy , recapitulating the disappearance of the buffalo herds , may be less a cause of the collapse than a symptom of a greater cultural lack , a narrowness of empathy , imagination , and spirit , in the ruling order .
