ING is the first bank to offload DAPL debt . In a meeting on 10 February , ING shared its willingness to either continue trying to positively influence the course of the project , or to distance itself by selling its stake in the loan . In the meeting we indicated we would appreciate ING selling its loan in the project , after which ING continued its sale process . ING has now signed an agreement to sell the loan . ING had previously sold all shares it had in the DAPL parent companies . Protests against the routing of DAPL have continued . Investors opposed to DAPL issued a statement to the banking syndicate on 16 February that the pipeline will escalate conflict and unrest as well as potentially contaminate the water supply for the Tribe and 17 million Americans downstream of the project . The remaining banks included in the DAPL syndicate besides Citibank and Wells Fargo are Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ , Bayern , BBVA , BNP Paribas , Credit Agricole , ICBC , Intesa Sanpaolo , Mizuho Bank , Natixis , Societe Generale , SMBC , DNB , SunTrust Bank and TD Securities . International and national support for the Tribe have mounted continued pressure for other banks to pullout of DAPL . The City of Seattle cut ties with Wells Fargo and Bill de Blasio , the mayor of New York , has pledged support for a boycott . This is an official site of standingrock.org .
