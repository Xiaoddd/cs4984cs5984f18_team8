We will deliver the below letter , with the list of supportive current and retired educators , at the next PSERS board meeting on December 7 , 2016 . These are the same companies responsible for some of the worst environmental disasters of the last century and for violating indigenous rights in North Dakota . 2016 is expected to eclipse 2015 as the hottest year on record . At the same time oil and gas pipelines , fracking wells , and refineries increase asthma rates for our kids and pollute our communities . New evidence shows that oil and gas companies , particularly Exxon , have known for years that burning fossil fuels negatively impact climate and human health . And yet they keep drilling . One of them , Energy Transfer Partners , has been cited for brutal treatment of Standing Rock Sioux members protecting sacred burial grounds and local water supplies from the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline . In Pennsylvania , Energy Transfer Partners and other companies are involved in massive pipeline build-outs to move gas to shipping ports . Sunoco Logistics , which just announced a plan to merge with Energy Transfer Partners , is involved in several fossil fuel projects that are hurting Pennsylvania families . PSERS has a fiduciary responsibility to invest prudently and maximize returns to ensure a healthy pension system . -LRB- 4 -RRB- Every day , as educators we shape the future by inspiring children to be responsible citizens .
