Look at all of these disenrollments after the Casinos opened . Obviously it is about money and power on the part of the Tribal Leaders . The hurtful words and gestures by our own relatives who have been part of our lives for ever and we used to sit , laugh , drink , and eat together and now they flip us off , threaten us on the road , drive by our homes and yell or shoot their guns , all so that the Tribal Leader can continue to steal from the people and banish rightful members . These loyal followers are fools , because when their leaders go down , they will tumble along with them . It is so shameful how they act , and I know their ancestors are highly disappointed in them .

If it was the Escondido Gangs , I am sure that Theresa Nieto and her husband know some of them , that 's where they were raised and went to school . So the Gangbangers are their Homeys .

If that is true , then Dion had a hand in his own brother 's -LRB- Bruce -RRB- murder . That would be horrible , just horrible , I hope and pray that it is not true about Dion , but I do feel Robert is responsible for all of it , because of his lack of good leadership , and the evil he perpetuates .

Next level disenrollment - Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria Next Level Disenrollment Culprits such as Chairman Greg Sarris are few among California 's sovereign nations tribal leadership . Thousands of California Indians have been violated by those few . Chairman Sarris acted with malice and forethought . When questioned by the 9th Circuit Court , under oath , Chairman Sarris testified he made a mistake . Subsequent to being ousted from my duly elected Office of Tribal Secretary I complained and received a 5 year disciplinary sanction . I served more than eight -LRB- 8 -RRB- years on that 5 year sentence . The BIA -LRB- Bureau of Indian Affairs -RRB- is not a judiciary and are not equipped to act like a judiciary for Tribes without a constitutional accountability avenue . As sovereign nations , accountability is on us , not the federal government . There will always be culprits . While Sarris can talk circles , he ca n't write his way out without fully manning up that he acted with malice and self-thought AND yes he did make a mistake - he messed with the wrong woman . No tribal member is safe . Lezlie Grigone Tribal Elder September 16 , 2017 at 5:33 PM Anonymous said ... September 26 , 2017 at 6:41 AM Anonymous said ...

They do n't make it to the Spirit World . Nature composts them . They have to remain below in total emptiness , total darkness , and no one to hear their screams . That place is real and that is where their choices take them . November 19 , 2017 at 3:30 PM Lezlie Grigone said ... 2018 . Sarrisland & the Ides of March : Motion to the Court of Public Opinion My fate is in the hands of the General Council on April 14 , 2018 . I have been extremely provoked for fifteen -LRB- 15 -RRB- years of Sarris 's unconscionable vendetta and abuses . Tribal members fear they or their family member will be targeted as evidenced by my daughter was threatened which is why I chose to take my case to the Court of Public Opinion in the first place . Without -LRB- ICRA -RRB- Indian Civil Rights Act protections , tribal members are not safe . The Bureau of Indian Affairs -LRB- BIA -RRB- is not a judiciary and are not equipped to handle these matters . 2012 From the first letter to the Court of Public Opinion When will I stop being cheated . When questioned by the 9th Circuit Court , the Chairman said he made a mistake . The Chairman is highly educated , knew what he was doing , acted with malice and forethought but he testified he made a mistake so let 's go with that . As far as mistakes go this was a dozy , it caught the attention of the 9th Circuit Court . The Chairman never apologized to me ; as a matter of fact subsequent to being ousted from my duly elected Office of Tribal Secretary I complained and received a 3 to 5 year disciplinary sanction . I have already served more than eight -LRB- 8 -RRB- years on this sentence . 2013 Formal Gross Malfeasance charges filed . No hearings scheduled . Chairman Sarris does not get to cheat and hurt tribal members for years on end , not even by mistake . At a minimum he is guilty of gross malfeasance for his failure to take responsibility for his mistake long before now . I was exiled , kicked out , what we pride ourselves on not doing Chairman Sarris did to me . Chairman Sarris 's actions have been vile towards me . I know other tribal members fear it could happen to them . I know his offenses are abhorrent to other sovereign people . I know Sarris is a threat to our communities . March 15 , 2018 at 7:35 AM Lezlie Grigone said ... 2014 PUBLIC NOTICE - conduct unbecoming a public employee Chairman Sarris established a ` two strikes rule ' . If a tribal member telephones the tribe and is angry 2 times , they can be kicked out and denied services . Sarris ethics woes : Motion to the Court of Public Opinion Taxpayer supported academias are watching you . The chairman is also Professor Greg Sarris of Sonoma State University and holds a position of great honor , prestige and must be of upstanding character . He has a moral clause and can not be the case study for circumventing responsibility , for surreptitiously avoiding accountability , for cheating . California State Legislators are watching you . They are at a loss on how to deal with tyrants like Sarris . Turns out , we missed a beat ; we are a people , people have disputes , there is no place or way to resolve disputes ; no place to do right by ourselves . Tribes across California , 500 Nations are watching you ; many a Constitution bound entity . Our Constitutions are not secret documents . Tribal members are watching you . Look in your mirror , you chose to be a leader Fall 2015 . One in the spring and one in the fall , 2 letters a year is not harassment . I was relieved as I found him to be a massively annoying long-talker . He harassed me telephonically . He would call my answering service repeatedly leaving long long messages , it was his regime you were required to listen to his voice for hours . There are no legal advisors to assist one in the Sarrisland court . No hearing is ever scheduled on charges lodged against Sarris . Sarris is a master talker , mesmerizing to some , he could not outtalk the 9th circuit court . ... was center because of his absolute certainty that he was right . He was a master of dialectic , could be very subtle and intelligent in diagnosing a social problem , could be , even in the same sentence stupidly dogmatic . As time went on he became steadily more heavy minded . Yet the odd thing was that people continued to revolve around him , people much subtler than he , even when they knew he was talking nonsense . It was terrifying that this could be true ... - This was written more than 50 years ago . Sarris is intelligent . 30 years ago he wrote a story that was somewhat successful , he showed promise ... Sarris chose to teach and used his gift of gab to propel himself to a tenured position . March 15 , 2018 at 7:37 AM Lezlie Grigone said ... Hubris fell to his knees holding his head as if struck by an enormous galactic ego-piercing THWACK . He saw what he had done . H u b r i s s a w w h a t h e h a d d o n e . He rose from his knees , Hubris choose to FULLY man-up , he choose to use his intelligence and voice to promote and establish Constitutional accountability and a remedy path for all California Indians . Hubris chose a legacy that was long honored and remembered . Why why why -LRB- smart , fat and talks back -RRB- His ego was threatened . Of the 7 deadly sins Sarris has succumbed to Pride . Obviously , I had issues with gluttony . I repulsed him . I was ousted at the next meeting ; by mistake , unless Sarris is a perjurer also July 2016 . Threat received noting one letter a year questioning Sarris is harassment . Dear Tribal Council and Tribal Members , I am aware a tribal member may go to the office to review top secret classified contracts and financials . He is a master talker but not that good , that was our money . March 15 , 2018 at 7:38 AM Lezlie Grigone said ... Fall 2017 . Please pray for Lorelle Ross and Gene Buvelot to give them the support , insight and strength of character to stand make and second a motion I not be kicked out again . Awesome Inc. theme .
