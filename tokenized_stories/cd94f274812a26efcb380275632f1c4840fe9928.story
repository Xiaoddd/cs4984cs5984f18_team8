Texas Pipeline Spills 600,000 Gallons of Oil One Week Before DAPL Is Approved By Steve Horn On Jan. 30 , 600,000 gallons -LRB- 14,285 barrels -RRB- of oil spewed out of Enbridge 's Seaway Pipeline in Blue Ridge , Texas , the second spill since the pipeline opened for business in mid-2016 . Enbridge is an equity co-owner of the Dakota Access Pipeline , which received its final permit needed from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Feb. 7 to construct the pipeline across the Missouri River and construction has resumed . Just Spewing Brittany Clayton , who works at a nearby gas station in Blue Ridge , which is 50 miles from Dallas , Texas , was close to the scene of the spill when it occurred . It was like a big cloud . The fire marshal said , ` This is like a danger zone . I was totally freaked out . Government Reaction According to KDFW , the Texas Department of Transportation -LRB- TxDOT -RRB- and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- intend to do water and environmental testing in the coming days . TxDOT referred DeSmog to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality -LRB- TCEQ -RRB- for details on the spill , cleanup and related issues . We have reached out to TCEQ and will update the article as details come in and have also filed open records requests to learn more about the spill . Chris Havey , Lieutenant Sheriff for the Collin County Sheriff 's Office , confirmed with DeSmog that a spill investigation is ongoing under the umbrella of the EPA and the Texas Railroad Commission , which is the state 's oil and gas regulatory agency . Neither the EPA Region 6 Office nor the Texas Railroad Commission responded to a request for comment . EPA , though , has been ordered not to speak to media by President Donald Trump 's White House until the agency has a new administrator , likely nominee Scott Pruitt and senior-level staff in place . As momentum and tensions alike mount surrounding oil and gas pipeline projects around the country , this oil spill is a reminder of the risks and consequences that come with them . The scorecard shows that 140 House members voted against chemical safeguards every time , while 149 members consistently voted for chemical safety protections . However , the action fund praised the lawmakers that bucked their party to vote for chemical safety , including Reps. voted for funding chemical reviews and against a farm bill that included pesticide safety loopholes . Florida Reps. A Preview of the People , Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule , two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Updated and reissued every five years , these guidelines are the nation 's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations . supply . These nominees will be well-known in their fields , and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers , academics and practitioners . part of the process is happening in real time . what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors . Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff , and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally . Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries . And here 's the first place you 'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition : rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected , USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first , soliciting public comments in the process . In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts , it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance . And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious . After the committee is announced in early 2019 , it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report . all appearances , the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs . though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable , plant-based diets have been all but stymied , there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle . Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance , including the meat industry , dairy industry , and sugar-sweetened beverage associations , as well as formula companies , which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers . -LRB- This may be happening in real-time , too . Exposure can be caused by contact , ingestion or inhalation . Short-term health effects can range from skin irritation and numbness to fever and headaches . Long-term exposure can lead to cancer , liver failure and sperm damage . is traditionally called blue-green algae is actually a class of microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria . Cyanobacteria can be toxic and can also produce various types of cyanotoxins that have different hazards . With their small , developing bodies , children are especially endangered by algae exposure . was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption . But it probably wo n't be the last , especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year . Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets . If you believe your pet may have been exposed , be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy , seizures , diarrhea or vomiting . And as climate change gets worse , the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks , creating a toxic feedback loop . The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish . Communities that struggle with regular , serious toxic algae outbreaks , like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie , can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation . The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth . The women were all non-smokers , had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies . Macrophages , which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body , protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles , such as bacteria and pollution particles . The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants . That 's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA 's Office of Inspector General -LRB- OIG -RRB- , the agency 's internal watchdog . EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement , and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was required to respond to the April 2017 petition within 90 days , but nearly 17 months have passed with no finding . more than 97,000 giraffes remain in the wild , and the species is gravely imperiled by habitat loss , civil unrest , hunting for meat and the international trade in bone carvings , skins and trophies . U.S. provides a large market for giraffe parts . for their six-foot-long necks , distinctive patterning and long eyelashes , giraffes have captured the human imagination for centuries . But so , under this definition , are multi-thousand-acre corporate entities using automated machinery to grow genetically engineered corn . Size of the farm is not a factor ; neither is the style of agriculture . A family farm may not even have a family that owns or works the land . issue with such a broad definition of family farming is primarily in the discourse . Aid is divvied up by revenue among family farmers , with additional programs going to some specialized farmers , like young or beginning farmers , organic farmers , and sustainable farmers .
