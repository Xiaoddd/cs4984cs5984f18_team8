The pipeline will transport nearly 500,000 barrels of crude oil per day from the Bakken Oil Fields in North Dakota . The entire project was completed , except for the Lake Oahe segment , during 2016 . The Lake Oahe portion has been in the middle of much controversy , even bringing about worldwide protests due in part to resistance from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in the region . Earlier this year , the Army Corps of Engineers , with prompting from the White House administration , gave permission for the construction to be completed . Macoupin County has 36.04 miles of pipeline , mostly traversing through the northern three quarters of the county . The pipeline will end at a terminal in Marion County . The entire length of the pipeline is 1,172 miles . Dakota Access Pipeline maintains their project is the safest mode of transportation for the North Dakota oil . The Bakken Oil Fields is part of the 200,000 square mile Bakken Formation primarily in North Dakota . It has been noted that the use of fracking has made the oil more accessible . Independent reports vary , but it was estimated in 2013 by the Unites States Geological Survey there were 7.4 billion barrels of oil available in that region . Dakota Access Pipeline is owned and operated through Energy Transfer Partners LP . They made national headlines last month when two different natural gas pipeline construction sites had a major leak of drilling fluids over Ohio wetlands . She says any additional work along the line is likely to be construction crews completing additional restoration activities .
