The newly-expanded museum consists of four interlocking cubes of stone , steel and glass , a gleaming architectural statement poking out of the otherwise drab Capitol grounds . North Dakota is in the uncommon position of facing a labor shortage , spurring a state-run campaign to attract workers , paid for in part by Hess Corp. . The oil industry is the top contributor to Gov. Jack Dalrymple , according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics , and gave money in all but 10 of the 75 legislative races held in 2012 . Any talk about clamping down on the pace of drilling has been quickly snuffed out . You know what happens to lottery winners ... you read about them three years later . As recently as 2009 , there were just 451 oil field spills statewide , but last year there were at least 1,782 . Just a fraction result in punishment : authorities issued 15 fines for spills in 2013 , mostly for incidents from previous years . State officials caution that aggressive regulation would slow development and jeopardize , well , everything . They also highlight a handful of recently adopted rules , part of an effort to adjust an antiquated regulatory system to the modern technologies and massive scale of the oil industry . The Industrial Commission , which oversees drilling , recently announced a set of rules to limit flaring , the practice of burning natural gas at the well site . The rules should start reducing the amount of gas drillers waste , but they are based on a set of proposals that regulators solicited from the oil companies themselves . You read about them three years later . Don Morrison , executive director of the Dakota Resource Council , has fought on behalf of landowners to mitigate impacts of oil drilling on farmland in the state . Towns here have not tried to ban the practice , as they have in Colorado , Pennsylvania and even Texas . Big Oil , Bad Air Fracking the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas . Backers noted that the proposal did not ban drilling anywhere , but would merely solicit public input to help mitigate impacts . But opponents of the proposal attacked . In March , the commission did pretty much exactly that , approving a comment process only for public lands , covering about 600,000 acres , or half the original area . After the vote , Stenehjem mentioned that he had recently seen the movie Gravity , in which the main character spends most of the film stranded in space , alone . Morrison is thin and bald , with black rimmed glasses and a neatly trimmed white mustache , and he has a tendency to giggle when he gets excited . There was absolutely no room for anyone in the middle , none . Morrison was speaking from his office on the basement floor of a small brick building on the western edge of Bismarck , above the Missouri River . Art Link , a Democrat , pushed through a set of extraction taxes and tough reclamation laws to cover coal production . Morrison , who was working for the lieutenant governor at the time , said there was robust debate about how best to exploit the resources , but that nothing of the sort was tolerated in recent years . ` load ' , initialize -RRB- ; Source : North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources A political force Since the drilling boom began about five years ago , oil and gas companies have grown into the most potent force in state politics . Each district has two representatives and one senator , and the three candidates from each party often run together , effectively as one slate . A retiring GOP senator left an open seat . Armstrong did not respond to messages left at his office and on his cell phone . But the biggest money by far went into the 2012 gubernatorial race . By contrast , environmental groups gave nothing to state candidates in 2012 , according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics . A portable flare burns off natural gas produced by an oil well near Watford City , ND . The oil can be trucked to market , but energy companies have flared nearly a third of the gas they 've produced because they lack the pipelines and processing plants to capture it . A damn good relationship In North Dakota , the gubernatorial contributions raise a particular concern for some not just because of their scale , but because the governor chairs the three-member Industrial Commission , which makes the ultimate decision on all regulatory matters . The commission eventually approved the application -LRB- Democrats fought unsuccessfully to have a grand jury examine the case -RRB- . He did not respond to a question asking about the potential for conflicts of interest in accepting contributions from companies with applications before the Industrial Commission but said the ConocoPhillips approval helped protect a state park . A review of any of the major regulatory questions before the legislature last session , however , suggests that state government tended to be more responsive to the appeals by the oil industry than by landowners out west who wanted stricter regulation . Last session , a constituent convinced Sen. Bill Bowman , a Republican representing the oil fields region , to introduce a bill increasing the minimum distance allowed between wells and homes , from 500 feet to 1,000 for sites with multiple wells , and 750 feet for single wells . At the committee hearing , four landowners came to testify in favor of the bill , saying it would help reduce risks to their health from flares and other equipment that emit hazardous pollutants , and would protect them in the event of an accident . The director of the state Grain Growers Association spoke in favor , and , in a House hearing on a parallel bill days later , so did a representative of the North Dakota Farmers Union and several other landowners , who presented a petition with 415 signatures . Lynn D. Helms , the director of the Department of Mineral Resources , the agency under the Industrial Commission that actually carries out regulation , testified neutrally but said there was no science to support increasing the distance and that doing so could lead to less orderly development . The Senate bill died after the hearing , and the House version survived only after landowners , in a last-ditch effort to achieve what they could , introduced an amendment that essentially gutted the bill : it left the minimum distance the same , but said that for wells within 1,000 feet of a home , if a landowner requests , regulators may require oil companies put flares or other equipment on the far side of the well , rather than between the well and a home . The governor later signed the amended version . Lobbyists turned out in droves , several lawmakers said . Oil and pipeline companies hired 27 lobbyists that session , compared to 23 for conservationist groups . In an interview , Ness said his industry does not always get its way , but has provided thousands of jobs and helped revive the state . But for the farmers and ranchers who testified , the Bowman bill was just another defeat . Brenda Jorgenson , a Dakota Resource Council member who lives near White Earth , on the northeastern edge of the drilling , was among them . Trucks and natural gas flares have become the new defining features of the landscape in western North Dakota . In what was once a quiet agricultural region , trucks now clog the roads . Last session , Wardner , a Republican , backed a bill that would have cut the 11.5 percent oil tax by two points , something the industry has been pushing for years . Wardner said the tax cut was intended to encourage the industry to stick around . The state hiked the oil tax by 6.5 percentage points , to its current rate , at the start of that boom in 1980 , and Wardner and others cite the move as reason to cut it now . The recent tax cut push began in 2011 , when former Gov. Ed Schafer , a Republican , toured the state holding town hall style meetings calling for the change . In an interview , Schafer said he was not involved in fundraising for the group , but that it drew on wide support from the oil industry and other companies and individuals . Oil and gas companies have given tens of millions of dollars in charitable contributions in the state over the past few years , focusing in particular on education . In June , the Petroleum Council hosted its annual Teacher Education Program , four days of classes and tours for primary and secondary school teachers . John Roper , a Hess spokesman , noted that his company has been working in North Dakota since the 1950s . But it has bought a mood , he said , in which none of his colleagues are willing to rock the boat . He also led the local chamber of commerce for eight years until 2006 , where they would celebrate if they added two or three jobs in town . Sixteen thousand and dying . State House Minority Leader Kenton Onstad , a Democrat , says intensive oil drilling is wreaking havok on western North Dakota 's infrastructure . Almost immediately , trucks begin to dominate the traffic . Warehouses line the road , labeled with the logos of oil field giants like National Oilwell Varco and Marathon Petroleum . Wells appear . Some of the most intensive drilling activity is centered around New Town , which sits within the boundaries of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation and also in the district of state Rep. Kenton Onstad , the Democratic House minority leader . Down another road , he pointed out a well that he said had been drilled in a flood zone , just a couple of hundred feet from a creek that ran directly into Lake Sakakawea , a dammed stretch of the Missouri River that provides drinking water and irrigation to much of the state . A Department of Mineral Resources field inspector had approved the site even though it was in a protected area , within which any industrial development that could contaminate the water is restricted , a fact the inspector could have discovered by checking a publicly available map on the state Health Department website . After county officials alerted the department of the mistake , Oasis stopped hauling waste to the site and eventually closed the pit . Helms , the chief regulator , met with town leaders and told them it was an oversight , local media reported . In an emailed response to questions , Department of Mineral Resources spokeswoman Alison Ritter said the pit was originally approved for another location but was moved after an inspector found shallow groundwater at the first site . Ritter said it was a mistake that field staff did not have access to the mapping data , one they have since corrected . Many of the struggles seem minor . Gary Satterthwaite , a 70-year-old retired rancher , lives about 12 miles north of New Town , where he owns some 3,500 acres , which he now rents out . Even though it covered just a portion of the field , the well effectively took the whole area out of production , he said . Satterthwaite owns a share in a family trust that controls the oil underneath his land , and so he receives royalties from the well . But he feels like the drilling is taking from him his farm and his livelihood . He asked the company to move the well a few hundred feet , he said , with no luck . Many residents also complain that regulators are reluctant to issue fines . Last year Mineral Resources issued eight fines and the Health Department issued 38 , though all but 10 of those were part of a larger agreement on air emissions with the industry and not for individual incidents . That is a significant jump from 2009 , before the boom began . That year , the Health Department issued just one oil field fine and the Department of Mineral Resources issued three . But over the same period , the rate of drilling has more than quadrupled , with 2,254 wells drilled last year . Regulators say they have ramped up enforcement to keep pace with the drilling , but critics argue that the baseline was already unacceptably low , noting that fewer than 1 percent of spills result in fines . When regulators do issue fines , companies often negotiate them down to a fraction of the original amount . In August of last year , Continental Resources was fracking a well when an accident allowed oil , gas and fluids to spew out of the ground for three days , according to a Department of Mineral Resources complaint issued in October . In December , the parties took the case before an administrative law judge . On March 14 , the department and Continental reached an agreement saying that the violations were unintentional . Helms said these agreements allow the department to settle cases quickly and ensure that companies do not repeat violations . In the vast majority of cases , he said , verbal or written notices are enough to get a company to clean a spill or fix a problem on its own , and no fine is necessary . Over the same period , the number of wells in operation has increased by roughly 150 percent , to 10,892 . The increase has allowed the department to hire eight new staff , a 5 percent increase , two fewer than the department requested . State Sen. Connie Triplett pointed to a recent case in which the Public Service Commission , which has jurisdiction over pipelines and is made up of three elected commissioners , decided not to fine Hiland Operating , a pipeline company chaired by Harold Hamm , after discovering it had been operating a pipeline in the state for two years without a permit . In their rush to extract oil , energy companies in North Dakota have burned off nearly a third of all the gas their wells have produced in recent years . The photograph , taken at night , showed what looked like a sprawling megalopolis glowing in western North Dakota . The lights were flares of natural gas , many of which burn for months or years . But while oil can be trucked away from a well site , gas requires pipelines and processing plants , and North Dakota has few of either . Flares also emit noxious pollutants including benzene , a known carcinogen . Ritter said comparing North Dakota to other states is unfair . For one thing , drillers in North Dakota were looking for oil , not gas , and Texas has many gas fields and , therefore , a large infrastructure prepared to handle extra gas from oil wells . The waste has caused increasing consternation among many people in North Dakota and across the country , though , including Robert Harms , who at first seems like an unlikely candidate for agitator . Harms brings a complex mix of interests to the debate . He had previously worked with companies that wanted to install generators or other equipment at well sites to use the flared gas . He still represents oil field service firms , including some pipeline companies . His family comes from the heart of the oil fields and they own minerals . But where the Environmental Defense Fund sees an environmental problem , Harms sees bad economic policy . When Sen. Tim Mathern , a Democrat , introduced a bill to remove the ability for companies to get a waiver from the one-year limit on flaring , Harms and the Dakota Resource Council spoke in favor . Ron Ness , of the Petroleum Council , followed , and told a Senate committee about the difficulties his members faced . Early estimates of the volume of gas proved too low , he said , and while energy companies have been investing billions of dollars in new pipelines , gaining easements and building the infrastructure takes time . He urged the committee instead to consider incentives to encourage capturing the gas . The next day , the committee voted the bill down . As it turned out , a bill was working its way through the legislature that would do just what Ness had suggested . The House had passed a measure that offered tax cuts for companies finding alternative methods of capturing the gas . When it reached the same Senate committee , Harms convinced lawmakers to adopt an amendment that shortened the allowable time to flare without paying taxes and royalties to six months . But when the two chambers met in a conference committee to work out details , two representatives stood firm against the amendment . Eventually , the senators yielded and the amendment failed . I represent people in it . Even among friends , though , patience is wearing thin on flaring . The towering flames of gas can burn as loud as jet engines . Some residents who live near flares have complained of headaches , nausea and other symptoms . I used to go cross-country skiing , horseback riding . A couple of years back , the health department realized that the models the oil companies had been using to estimate emissions from well drilling and operation had been too low . As a result , thousands of wells had been emitting toxic pollutants like benzene and toluene for years , potentially at levels above the allowable limits . The state worked with oil companies to revamp their models , and has reached consent agreements with 32 companies since the beginning of 2013 . The monitors measure ambient air quality and likely would not reflect more localized problems caused by flares , they say . Perhaps . But in July , the Industrial Commission announced that it would institute targets for reducing flaring , and would require that companies curtail their oil production if they are not hitting those targets . Companies also must now submit plans for capturing the gas when they apply to drill a well , another recommendation from the industry . The rule has met mixed reviews . Notably , the targets are percentage-based , meaning the total volume of flared gas may not drop as quickly as the figures suggest , since production continues to increase . Grossman said the rule is a good start , but that North Dakota still has a long way to go to catch up with other oil and gas producing states . The federal Bureau of Land Management is also developing rules for wells on federal lands . Early one morning over eggs at the county courthouse cafe , Kalil described a state of constant churning chaos , where drillers do what they want and regulators are unresponsive at best . Kalil said the state failed the people in the oil fields by allowing the drilling to proceed faster than the region could cope with it , a sentiment shared by many here . And there lies the rub . Because mineral rights can be sold separately from the land above them , many here do not own the oil below their farms . In some cases , mineral owners live hundreds of miles away in other states . Then one day an oil company plopped a well right next to it . Kalil speaks in low , understated tones , belying any agitation . I thought this was paradise . I counted myself so lucky to have been born here . Everything I wanted in life was here .
