Monkeywrenching Security Zines Read . Distribute . Fallen Warriors Obituaries to fallen warriors . Journal . The action comes at a time when the State is attempting to pass an anti-protest bill that would further criminalize anti-pipeline organizing in Louisiana . The Bayou Bridge pipeline , the tail end of the Dakota Access pipeline , which threatens land , water , and livelihoods of millions of residents , plants , and animals in Louisiana , has been the ongoing target of a grassroots resistance campaign . On the morning of April 5th , the group launched a blockade of a key supply yard . The lock-down lasted for several hours and blocked the entrance of a site that stores the equipment which Energy Transfer Partners needs to carry out construction on wetlands . It was during this action that Cherri Foytlin was targeted and arrested while live streaming . Police then arrested another water protector who was on the scene . All four people have been released , but their legal battle will continue . If we allow the Bayou Bridge pipeline to threaten our food and culture , we will have to question why we are willing to deprive our kids of what has sustained us . Destroying our supply of crawfish is one of them . I thought our governor would have stopped this havoc by now . Cherri was simply livestreaming at the time of her arrest , and was clearly targeted -LRB- along with three other water protectors -RRB- by the police for her role in ongoing organizing against the pipeline . As with similar proposed laws targeting Black Lives Matter protesters for blocking freeways , this bill attempts to make things that are already crimes even harsher . The bill is similar to a model created by the right-wing American Legislative Exchange Council . In the face of this growing repression , support , funds , and solidarity is needed now more than ever . Follow the battle against the Bayou Bridge pipeline here and here . Journal Collective .
