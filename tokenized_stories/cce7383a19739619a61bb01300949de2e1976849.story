On March 27 , 2017 , IEN and NCRA had filed suit in Federal District Court in Great Falls , Montana challenging the Presidential Permit issued by President Trump allowing construction and operation of the Keystone XL Pipeline . At the direction of President Trump , the U.S. Department of State had issued a Presidential Permit to TransCanada Keystone Pipeline , L.P. on March 23 , 2017 . The proposed Keystone XL Pipeline would transport up to 830,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Alberta , Canada and the Bakken Shale Formation in Montana over 875 miles to existing pipeline facilities near Steele City , Nebraska , from which the oil would be delivered to Cushing , Oklahoma , and the Gulf Coast region . The Keystone XL Pipeline would pose grave risks to the environment , including the climate , water resources , and wildlife , and to human health and safety . Established in 1990 , IEN was formed by grassroots Indigenous peoples and individuals to address environmental and economic justice issues both in North America and throughout the planet . We have already lost most of the glaciers in our great Glacier National Park , and sea levels are rising throughout the globe . The dirty tar sands crude oil that KXL would transport requires far more energy to process than other sources of petroleum , and its extraction has already destroyed hundreds of square miles of boreal forests and wetlands in Alberta . NCRA is an association of conservation leaders from the western and northern United States and Canada which has advocated for decades on behalf of rivers and watersheds in jeopardy throughout North America . Its President , Frank Egger , has been fighting to save salmon and other endangered fishes in the Pacific Northwest for five decades . KXL poses an unacceptable risk to the Missouri River , Yellowstone and Cheyenne rivers and their fish and wildlife . No oil pipeline is safe . The Court will now proceed to address the other violations of NEPA and the Endangered Species Act that our lawsuit raises . We believe that the courts will apply and enforce the law fairly and fully , and protect our irreplaceable lands and waters and the Native American community that depends on them from the risky and unneeded KXL Pipeline . Additional documents pertaining to the litigation can be obtained from the Volker Law Offices .
