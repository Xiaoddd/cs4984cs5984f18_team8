Dothan police were called to the shelter when Robert Earl Lawrence refused to show his driver license to the shelter 's staff on Dec. 30 , 2014 , according to the lawsuit , filed by the dead man 's estate . Summerlin then deployed his stun gun on Lawrence . Officer Adrian Woodruff arrived to help , drew her weapon and shot Lawrence in the abdomen , according to the suit . Lawrence later died of the gunshot wound . Dothan 's city attorney declined to comment Tuesday , and lawyers who filed the lawsuit did n't immediately respond to requests for comment . Police have said that Lawrence , 30 , became disorderly after being told he could n't leave the dog at the shelter without showing identification . The so-called sovereign citizen movement includes many who believe they 're immune to most state and federal laws , including paying taxes and getting driver 's licenses . In a news release shortly after the shooting , Dothan police said Lawrence was repeatedly told to calm down , and was then told he was being placed under arrest . A physical altercation then took place , and he was shot , police said at the time . Lawrence had committed no crimes , and was n't under any obligation to show his license , the lawsuit said . In July , prosecutors said that a grand jury declined to indict the officer and that no charges would be filed . That video has never been made public . Unlike many high-profile police shootings across the country in recent years , the lawsuit makes no allegations involving the race of anyone involved . Lawrence was white , according to court records . Police have n't specified the races of the officers .
