Yessenia Funes May 10 , 2017 3:22 PM EDT Native Americans and their supporters rally in front of the Trump International Hotel April 27 , 2017 , in Washington , D.C. , to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline , the Keystone XL Pipeline and others they say damage the environment . The surge pump is connected to a tank that is used to store crude oil during regular operation of the line and it physically pushes oil through the line . The pipeline is not yet operational . Pipeline infrastructure expert Richard B. Kuprewicz told The Watertown Public Opinion that a leak this early may signal that the developer rushed through the construction process . ETP attributed the leak to a malfunction during the line fill process , which involves filling the 1,172-mile long pipeline with crude oil before beginning its operations . But Granado did not mention what caused the malfunction or if ETP will launch an internal investigation to find out . Granado told The Watertown Public Opinion the pipeline should be in service by June 1 as the company wraps up this line fill process . Since the beginning , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has been clear about its concerns regarding what a spill could do to local drinking water and sacred sites . The conversation has always been about when the pipeline leaks , not if . InsideClimate News reported today that ETP has no oil spill response plan for the portion of the pipeline with which opponents were most concerned : the place where the pipeline crosses the Missouri River . News of this spill comes on the heels of an ETP violation in Ohio .
