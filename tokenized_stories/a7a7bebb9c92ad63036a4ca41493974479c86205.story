The pipeline , which inspired months of protest and heavy-handed tactics from police in North Dakota , was delayed in December but fast-tracked when President Trump took office . It is expected to be operational within a month . In March , independent news organization MuckRock filed a Freedom of Information Act request to gain access to the environmental assessment the Corps had conducted to determine the effects an oil spill could have on Lake Oahe . MuckRock published the letter Tuesday . Rather than censoring certain parts of the report , the government chose to withhold the entire document . In citing vague dangers to the public , the Army Corps of Engineers is employing a common argument used by government agencies to justify withholding information from the public . Further , Morisy and MuckRock claim the Corps was skirting accountability and treating the outlet unfairly even before they issued their denial letter . The pipeline is scheduled to be operational as soon as next month , which is all the more concerning considering the numerous oil spills that have continued to occur in recent months . One of those spills came from a pipeline owned by Energy Transfer Partners , the same company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline .
