In 2016 , a total of 135 police officers were killed in the US , a five-year high , according to a report from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund .

No mention was made by Mr Trump of the hundreds of people who die at the hands of law enforcement every year . The executive orders were signed during Black History Month .
