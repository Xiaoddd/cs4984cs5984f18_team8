November 26 , 2016 By Blake Nicholson and Amy Forliti Associated Press Bismarck , N.D. Representatives from the Army Corps of Engineers did n't immediately return messages Friday seeking comment and verification of the letter . Five hopeful signs global energy is getting cleaner It says anyone on land north of the river after Dec. 5 will be trespassing and may be prosecuted . It also says anyone who stays on the land does so at his or her own risk . The letter , from Army Corps of Engineers Col. John Henderson , says the closure is necessary to protect the general public from violent confrontations between protesters and authorities and to protect demonstrators from illness , injury or death during North Dakota 's harsh winter months . It also says that the area does not have necessary first responder services or facilities to protect people during the winter . A free speech zone will be set up south of the river .

Some of the protests have resulted in violent confrontations and hundreds of arrests . A clash earlier this week near the main protest camp left a police officer and several protesters injured , including Sophia Wilansky , who suffered a serious arm injury and is in satisfactory condition in a Minneapolis hospital .

Bismarck City Administrator Keith Hunke said Friday the boycott is disappointing given that the city 's businesses are n't involved in the dispute . He said no businesses have reported an impact from boycotts and protest activity in the area is inconvenient , but has n't cut into business 's bottom lines . Police said protesters gathered for a prayer at Kirkwood Mall , and some refused to leave the entrance to a Target store when ordered .
