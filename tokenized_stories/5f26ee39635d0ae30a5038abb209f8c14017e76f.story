He has been filing dispatches on Facebook during the past few days to report his observations from the protests . He was there on the night of November 20 when police turned water cannons on the protesters in sub-freezing temperatures , and he witnessed a young woman protester whose arm was almost severed by a concussion grenade . A group went to the bridge north of us to move burned trucks off the road . At least two people were struck with rubber bullets . Others are being sprayed with water in the freezing weather . A helicopter with spotlights is flying overhead . And a plane with no lights is buzzing the camp . Word is that it is blocking cell phone signals . Please pray for everyone here , through the night and into the morning . Call your TV stations and networks . The group had gone to the bridge to remove the trucks barricading the bridge . Many Standing Rock people have to go a half hour out of their way to work or to the hospital because of the barricade . The police promised to remove it 3 weeks ago . The demonstrators were peaceful . We have seen the beanbags and rubber projectiles fired . None of the protesters set fires . -LRB- Update : there were bonfires nearby to help warm people who had been sprayed . By midnight , over 200 people were treated for injuries . The media have been repeating misinformation . Shame the media into covering this and uncovering what happened last night . Friends , I am far from a wild-eyed radical . This is very uncomfortable for me . I truly appreciate your responses . And the people here are greatly encouraged that you are spreading the word . I know many honorable , talented , and professional police officers . But that is not what I saw last night or today . So the route was moved . The people who are now objecting apparently do not have the same influence . The pipeline has been assisted by the use of eminent domain . This is what the government uses to clear the way for roads and other public projects . It should not be used for corporations . This is something that liberals and conservatives should be able to agree on . Farmers and other landowners now have a partial sense of what has happened to native people for the last several hundred years . When powerful people want access or the natural resources on their lands , they take them . The land where the pipeline is to cross under the Missouri is only a mile north of the reservation . If there is a spill it would be catastrophic for the people and the environment nearby . The company building the pipeline and the company that is to operate it have the worst safety records in the industry . I keep hearing that there are professional protestors at Standing Rock . I am still waiting on my check . To be clear , there are some people here who are experienced organizers . Their experience helps keep the demonstrations safer . The Elders of the gathered tribes make all the decisions . I know it may seem like a barrage to your senses , but as native peoples it becomes par for the course . If you want to support the work of the protesters who are opposed to the Dakota Access Pipeline , you can donate here or donate to the Sacred Stone Legal Defense fund . At All .
