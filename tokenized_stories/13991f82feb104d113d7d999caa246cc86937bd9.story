Donald Trump 's pick to head DOJ , Jeff Sessions . The help was made possible by a bill signed into law by President Bill Clinton about 20 years ago , which created an interstate agreement for emergency management . The agreement helped bring law enforcement agents to North Dakota to the site of protests by the Standing Rock Sioux against the Dakota Access Pipeline . The protests at Standing Rock , and the Black Lives Matter protests in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray , represent some of the only times the compact has been invoked outside of a natural disaster .

We too were alarmed at the patterns we were , and still are , seeing . It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy , disciplined , and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before . It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time . We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century . The comments of our readers are the most vibrant , best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News . Accordingly , we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services . It is , however , important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in . Adapt and overcome . The American Spring will start when there are thousands of really , really pissed off people at the Capital -LRB- with 2x2s and baseball bats -RRB- all at the same time raising some serious hell against the Lunatics , and idiots absolutely nothing is ever , ever going to happen to these totally bought and paid for by the richest 400 families in the world that are becoming more and more powerful with each passing rigged election thanks to the stupid people . So , scream , yell , chant , stomp your feet , threaten to hold your breath , and beat your drums so the media can show it on the evening news , while all of those who can actually do anything about it are home counting their donation money and laughing all the way to the bank . Yes there is still hope for the America we used to know , but I agree it is fading fast . The protestors are trespassing on private property , committing arson , throwing rocks -LRB- one cop in hospital already -RRB- , and probably trying to set off an IED -LRB- evidence has been recovered but it needs to be tied via DNA testing to the young lady who was hospitalized when the explosion went off prematurely -RRB- . While I have a lot of sympathy for the Sioux who are living on the worst reservations in the country and who are pariahs in local communities , I have no sympathy for arsonists and trespassers and rock throwers and bombers . You would be much happier with the Faux-natics . Stay turned for December 4th to 7th . It could be a game changer if enough vets show up . Heads off with our hopes , prayers and support . ETP is being merged with Sunoco -LRB- SXL -RRB- . The merger deal is complicated and may not benefit shareholders in ETP . My point is that the world of giant pipelines is complex , and is driven by forces far removed from the parcels of property where the oil will flow . It is in the world of big business and finance . The US Army Corps of Engineers is issuing permits incrementally , for very small parts of the total pipeline . For example , a river crossing gets its own permit . In this , the Corps is showing a bias in favor of the corporations . There are limits to the number of acres that are allowed to be damaged under one permit . By splitting the project into tiny units the Corps allows the project to proceed . The total damage for the hundreds-of-mil es-long pipeline might exceed the limit . This is where Obama could step in . He could ask the Corps of Engineers to review the permitting of the pipeline . He could save face and let the Corps take the heat . Certainly their own small departments can not handle by any stretch of the imagination the costs of their officers being called up like military units . Remembering that there is such a thing as bribing a police officer , or in this case entire units . Hmmmm ... . Inquiring minds want to know . I think it is likely that the builders and financiers of the pipeline are covering some or all of the extra costs . As you say , it would be interesting to follow the money .
