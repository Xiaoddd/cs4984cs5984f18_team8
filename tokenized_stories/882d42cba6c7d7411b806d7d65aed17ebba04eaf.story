By Rev. John Floberg on Mar 13 , 2017 at 4:57 p.m. Over a week ago , I sent a letter to Gov. Doug Burgum . In it , I cited that Highway 1806 needed to reopen as it caused undue hardship on the people of Cannon Ball . Today , I learned the reason for the public highway not being reopened is that the Dakota Access Pipeline construction crew is using it as a parking lot for their equipment . They purchased the Cannon Ball Ranch and were given an extraordinary variance from state law for a corporation to own agricultural land in North Dakota . That company is using a state highway and blocking the free flow of traffic from a town that ranks among the poorest in the United States . This is morally unjustifiable . I have been told that their work has caused mud and debris to be brought onto the highway that has also made the route impassable . All the while the governor 's office has been citing the Oceti Sakowin Camp as being the place that needed to be cleaned up . It turns out that the Dakota Access Pipeline has been causing damage to this public highway that needs repair . It is time to start getting to a place where true reconciliation can begin . That route is in the governor 's court . We have much work to do . Floberg is an Episcopal priest on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation .
