In a wide-ranging interview with National Observer , Adnan Amin , the director general of the International Renewable Energy Agency -LRB- IRENA -RRB- , said that development of major fossil fuel projects such as pipelines will ultimately harm the operators since renewable power is becoming more attractive to consumers and businesses . IRENA is an intergovernmental organization founded in 2009 . The United States is an active member of IRENA , but Amin said he was still waiting for Canada to make a decision about joining the agency after a few conversations with federal Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr . Amin , who has been described as the planet 's ambassador for renewable energy , was interviewed Thursday at a downtown Vancouver hotel where he was attending a ` Renewable Cities ' conference hosted by Simon Fraser University 's Centre for Dialogue . While Amin questioned the logic in building new pipelines , he said he understood that there were other factors at play in Canada . The Bull Creek Wind Project began operating in December 2015 in the Alberta municipal district of Provost . Photo courtesy of BluEarth Renewables Inc. . Amin also praised Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson and other municipal leaders who are implementing aggressive policies to reduce or eliminate carbon pollution from transportation and buildings . Earlier this week , Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna also introduced details of the government 's proposal to make polluters pay for carbon emissions . While noting the Trudeau government is promoting clean energy , Amin underlined findings in a recent IRENA report that Canada lags behind many other countries when it comes to action encouraging renewable energy . In the interview , Amin also said that the U.S. has a vibrant market for renewables , and that he believed U.S. President Donald Trump 's administration would support the industry because of the strong business case for clean energy . When you look around the world , you see a number of countries that have more ambitious renewable energy targets in place -LRB- and they -RRB- have policy frameworks that are much more enabling and have clear energy policy type of structures that are incentivizing different types of approaches to renewables . Under the Obama administration , they had an energy policy which was technology neutral , but which was open to everything . So there was no real sense of direction about whether they were incentivizing a low carbon energy future and how they were going to do it . There was legislation around it , but there was no clear policy framework . Some of the more iconic investments in wind and solar generation were in the United States . Adnan Amin , the director of the International Renewable Energy Agency , gestures as he speaks to National Observer about clean energy on May 18 in Vancouver . Photo by Zack Embree , courtesy of SFU Centre for Dialogue Some people in Canada have criticized the current government here for saying the right things about renewable energy without backing it up with concrete policies . I think you have to understand that in a country that has achieved a level of prosperity from hydrocarbons , the transition to a low carbon future has some important economic repercussions . How that is executed is really the issue and how you make a transition from a set of inherited decisions concerning investment in infrastructure in hydrocarbons to a more clean energy focus is going to be a very difficult transition . But governments have to deal with real things like jobs , investment and economic growth . So having said that , I still think that the messaging coming out of the government is positive for low carbon energy . I think what we really need to understand much more are what are the concrete pathways through which that can be achieved . We believe that the renewable energy part of the energy mix is not highlighted as much as it should be . Canada is very fortunate to have very low cost , very efficient hydro -LRB- electric -RRB- system . Hydro can be the backbone of the clean energy system for the future . Your electricity is already very clean . Because moving to a renewable energy future means moving to a future where electricity becomes the dominant form of energy and that we are innovative in what the modes of transmission and utilization of that clean energy is going to be . One of recommendations from the federal government 's National Energy Board modernization panel last week was to improve federal expertise on the transmission of electricity as pipelines become less important . Absolutely . He always had the position that his primary responsibility was to provide power to poor people in India and to Indian consumers and industry and that he needed to find the cheapest alternative to do that . And if coal was cheap , he was going to use it . That puts solar PV competitive with coal . A Solar farm and wind turbine produces energy in the Saerbeck Bioenergy Park in Germany on July 4 , 2016 . Absolutely . That was driven by the fact that the tax credits for renewables were extended for five years by the previous administration . Somebody was telling me recently that they were listening to -LRB- Trump administration Energy Secretary -RRB- Rick Perry talking about energy and he kept talking about what great things they had done with wind energy in Texas . So I think that the U.S. at the base is very rational in economic terms , when they make investments . The first message is , being in Vancouver , which has taken such a leadership role under Mayor -LRB- Gregory -RRB- Robertson on the clean energy transition is that urban and regional actors are becoming more and more important in determining the direction of the energy transition . So when cities like Vancouver or much bigger cities than Vancouver , start to incentivize investments in clean energy , start to demand the procurement of renewable energy in their operations , start to create regulated frameworks for mobility that becomes cleaner for electric transportation , for energy efficiency in buildings , that starts to send messages to the market . And I think those are delivering messages to the market , that , once they accumulate , become real drivers of investment and the direction of the energy transition ... And Canada is not that different from others . Although Canada has not been so active in the international space in the last years , the fact is the issues that you are dealing with are very similar to issues that many other countries are dealing with . But I sense enthusiasm and energy for sustainability in Canada which is very encouraging . He gave me some encouraging signals . Investigative journalism has never been more important . Subscribe Share this article . Perhaps this might be a good thing for The National Observer to look into and make public . It may make the govt . and the public more amenable to investment in renewables . Be prepared to be shocked . Canada , which has the lowest absolute amount of subsidies , comes out 3rd in the rate in which they 're being eliminated . There 's still a long way to go .
