Photograph : United States House of Representatives Committee on Science , Space , and Technology A powerful US congressional committee has alleged that Russia financed major environmental organizations and used social media to support opponents of the Dakota Access pipeline , fracking and fossil fuels . Drawing on data provided by Twitter , Facebook and Instagram , the committee also contended that Russian agents have exploited US social media platforms to upend domestic energy markets and suppress the use of fossil fuels such as natural gas . It asserted , for instance , that between 2015 and 2017 , more than 9,000 Russian-backed posts or tweets regarding US energy policy circulated across the three major social media platforms . On average over a three-year period , this amounted to fewer than three Russian-backed energy-related posts on each of Facebook , Twitter and Instagram per day . The committee offered several examples of alleged Russian trolls spreading memes that are critical of US fossil fuel producers and pipeline projects , including the Dakota Access pipeline . Another post cited in the report . Smith requested that the treasury department investigate the matter . The League of Conservation Voters denounced the allegation that Russian-backed agents have funded it . Its claims hinge on guilt by association and focus on a private foundation called Sea Change that donated millions of dollars to environmental organizations like the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters at the beginning of the decade . It then describes financial links between Sea Change and a Bermuda-based corporation that in turn has ties to a law firm whose employees are associated with Russian oligarchs and energy interests . The congressional committee did not respond to multiple requests for comment . In its study the committee noted that alleged Russian trolls also promoted pro-fossil-fuel and pro-industry social media content as part of a broader effort to foment discontent .
