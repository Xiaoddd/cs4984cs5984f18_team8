It 's happening right now in North Dakota , in the shadows of Standing Rock , to those who are protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline through sacred lands and important water sources . On Monday evening , in the parking lot of a Ramada Inn in Bismarck , N.D. , two white men in masks violently confronted a car driven by men from Standing Rock . As the men attempted to leave , they soon realized that multiple vehicles had deliberately blocked them in . Trapped , the masked men threatened to assault them then viciously bragged about sexually assaulting their wives . Partly because of the Facebook Live video filmed by one of the passengers in the car , the Bismarck Police Department just arrested one person , 33-year-old Jesse McLain , who was involved in the incident . While police have not said if McLain was one of the drivers , or planned it out , he was allegedly one of the two masked men yelling . The two vehicles on the scene , a 2014 Chevy Silverado and a 2006 Chevy cargo van , are presently registered to two other Bismarck residents , and the license plates were exposed for bystanders to film . Jesse D. McLain , 33 , was charged with two counts of terrorizing after he allegedly was part of a confrontation in which two masked men harassed protestors of the Dakota Access pipeline outside a Ramada Inn Monday in Bismarck , North Dakota . -LRB- Bismarck Police Department -RRB- Thursday night , similar behavior continued . Three indigenous people driving near the reservation were confronted , harassed , and dangerously chased by a large pickup truck and masked men in snowmobiles . They also filmed it on Facebook Live . On multiple occasions the white men in the pickup truck and snowmobiles attempted to cut them off , and the chase at times neared 100 mph on dangerously icy and snow covered roads . In each instance , the indigenous men were overwhelmingly courteous , peaceful and patient while the white men were the lone aggressors . Anyone with the most basic knowledge of the civil rights movement or the history of the KKK is familiar with these types of confrontations . Masked white men have , for over 100 years , targeted and terrorized people of color using eerily similar methods . He is a descendant of Chief Matthew King , Noble Redman .

Jo-Ellen Darcy , The Army 's Assistant Secretary for Civil Works , said in a statement that she intends on exploring an alternate route for the pipeline crossing . Vehicles would regularly be boxed in to make escaping difficult . Freedom Riders James Chaney , Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were confronted , kidnapped , and killed on such a dark Mississippi roadway in the summer of 1964 . What shocks our collective conscience is that we wrongly thought that our nation had evolved or grown past such behavior , but violent and bigoted confrontations continue to grip the United States . These indigenous men who were confronted Thursday could 've easily crashed and died as a result of that dangerous confrontation , and their names would 've become etched in stone like the martyrs of racial violence from another era .
