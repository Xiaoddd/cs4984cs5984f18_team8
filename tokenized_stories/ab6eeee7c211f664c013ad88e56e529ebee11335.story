Detail from a map of Cherokee territory over time . The green line designates their territory at the point of their forced removal . Red towns were Cherokee towns . Via University of Texas Libraries . This story is recommended by Longreads contributing editor Dana Snitzky . Though it would take weeks before reports reached Atlanta , in the days after the attack on Crow a nighttime ritual began to unfold , as each evening at dusk groups of white men gathered at the crossroads of the county . When darkness fell , the night riders set out with one goal : to stoke the terror created by the lynching of Edwards and use it to drive black people out of Forsyth County for good . In the first decade of the twentieth century , the days when all white men had been legally empowered to pursue and arrest fugitive slaves were only fifty years in the past , and the fathers and grandfathers of many locals would have been part of such posses in the days of slavery . Instead , it was to the homes of cotton pickers , sharecroppers , and small landowners that the night riders went first , and it was these most vulnerable families who fled in the first waves of the exodus . Since journalists only started writing about the expulsions once the wagon trains of refugees grew too large and too numerous to ignore , it is hard to say precisely what took place on those first nights of the terror . This building is the central club-house of a community of Negroes . Entertainments , suppers , and lectures are held ... . Considerable sums of money are collected and expended here , employment is found for the idle , strangers are introduced , news is disseminated and charity distributed . At the same time this social , intellectual , and economic centre is a religious centre of great power . Depravity , Sin , Redemption , Heaven , Hell , and Damnation are preached twice a Sunday after the crops are laid by . Buy the book The erasure of such places from the map of Forsyth was complete . Faint traces of other black churches are tucked away in handwritten ledgers at the state archives at Morrow ; in the collections at the University of Georgia in Athens ; even in the basement of the Forsyth courthouse , where a cardboard box atop a metal filing cabinet still holds deeds for the land on which black residents once founded Mt. All that can be said for certain is that , again and again in the fall of 1912 , white men sloshed gasoline and kerosene onto the benches and wooden floors of such rooms , then backed out into the dark , tossing lit matches as they went . All over the county , beneath the ground on which black churches stood , the soil is rich with ashes . Meanwhile , Ellen Grice was alive and well out in Big Creek , no doubt busy with the work of running a household and a small farm with her husband , John , and keeping a low profile after all the trouble her allegations had stirred up . Mae Crow lay in her bed in Oscarville , watched and prayed over by her parents , Bud and Azzie , but still very much alive . For many locals , Mae became an object of fascination during her sickness , and at least two men were so desperate to get a glimpse of the beautiful , bedridden girl that they made a drunken pilgrimage . Hill and his friend , Crow said , wanted to see what the negroes had done ... They hung around awhile , and before we knew it , they had gone to the back of the house ... then pushed open the door and climbed up and were in the room where our precious daughter lay . At some point during the second week of her coma , Dr. George Brice told Bud and Azzie that their daughter had contracted pneumonia . And so , as they listened to the crack of gunshots and smelled the smoke of distant fires , George and Mattie Jordan feared for their black neighbors . Via Wikimedia Commons . Pa told this man to go back to his farm so the two of them could defend it against anyone that tried to take it from him ... . When black residents like Garrett and Josie Cook woke to the sound of a rock smashing through a window or the jangle of bridles outside their door , the order to leave was usually delivered by men whose voices they had heard many times before : employers and landowners for whom they had plowed and picked cotton ; merchants with whom they had traded ; and white neighbors they had lived and worked with for years . Joel Whitt , a local white man who was twenty-three in 1912 , said that in the beginning , the night riders used gunfire and torches , just as Ruth Jordan remembered . By late October , if you made such a thing and placed it outside the cabin of some last , proud black farmer , by sunup he and his whole family would be gone . The only trouble is that in the America of 1912 , there was no such thing as the KKK . For more than forty years after those original prosecutions , there was no Ku Klux Klan as we now know it .

As Birth of a Nation took the country by storm , life began to imitate art , and when it opened at the Fox Theater in Atlanta in 1915 , the streets around the movie house filled with men dressed up in sheets and pointy hoods , many riding horses draped in white cloth , like the heroes of the film . Once inside , moviegoers were mesmerized by a story of chaste white women being stalked by savage black rapists . My people fill the streets . The land now known as Forsyth County , Georgia , was once home to Cherokee people , who had lived there for centuries when James Oglethorpe and the first Georgia colonists arrived from England in 1733 . As whites settlers pushed farther and farther west during the late eighteenth century , the line separating native land from United States territory was redrawn again and again , as one treaty after another was broken . By the early nineteenth century , the native people of Georgia were confined to an area in the northwest corner of the state known as the Cherokee Territory , which included present-day Forsyth . Hollywood may have filled white imaginations with visions of Indians living in tepees and hunting with bows and arrows , but by the late 1820s many Cherokee people in the Georgia foothills had lived alongside their white neighbors for years and were part of a racially diverse and increasingly integrated frontier community . When gold was discovered at Dahlonega in 1828 , however , it created a renewed push into the Cherokee Territory . It seemed within a few days as if the whole world must have heard of it , for men came from every state ... . They came afoot , on horseback and in wagons , acting more like crazy men than anything else . Even as they tried to tolerate all these encroachments into the Territory , the Cherokee were disenfranchised in the courts , and they had no legal recourse even when whites stole from them in broad daylight . The Cherokees go in pursuit of their property , but all that they can effect is , to see their cattle snugly kept in the lots of these robbers . We are an abused people . After the U.S. Congress passed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 , Georgia officials began planning for the future of the Cherokee Territory , anticipating a day when government troops would force all native people west of the Mississippi . Via Wikimedia Commons . In theory , those who drew land lots were allowed to take possession only if the property was unoccupied , but in reality , countless whites interpreted their winning tickets as a license to drive off Cherokee residents , including many who owned prosperous farms . In May of 1833 , the editors of the Phoenix told how an industrious Indian had by his steady habits improved his premises to be of considerable value , when it was drawn by one of the lottery gamblers in Georgia . The fortunate drawer ... The Cherokee are doomed to suffer . In the wake of New Echota , starting in the spring of 1838 , the Cherokee people of north Georgia were rounded up by state militiamen and confined in makeshift pens , where they waited to start the forced march west . One of the largest Cherokee removal forts , Fort Campbell , was located in present-day Forsyth . The guardsmen were notoriously cruel . Among them were many men who had come to north Georgia in search of gold and many who expected to personally profit from the removal of the Cherokee . Charlie Harris grew up hearing tales of how his grandfather had once driven Cherokee families from their homes at gunpoint . I saw them loaded like cattle or sheep into six hundred and forty-five wagons and started toward the West . This is the real origin story of Forsyth . So whenever someone first suggested that blacks in the county should not only be punished for the murder of Mae Crow but driven out of the county forever , the white people of Forsyth knew in their bones that such a thing was possible . After all , many families owed their land and their livelihoods to exactly such a racial cleansing in the 1830s . With permission of the publisher , W. W. Norton & Company , Inc. .
