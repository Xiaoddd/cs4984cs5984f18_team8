The Seaway pipeline near the tiny North Texas town of Blue Ridge spewed about 600,000 gallons of crude into the air after a subcontractor ruptured it . Local news KXII News 12 in Sherman reports that the Blue Ridge spill was caused by a subcontractor who hit the pipeline with a tractor during a road widening construction project . Video of the spill shows a geyser spouting oil from the pipe several feet into the air and landing on U.S. Highway 121 , causing local law enforcement to shut down the road . Of course , local officials have claimed minimal environmental impact in the spill and zero impact to the local drinking water . Enterprise is based in Houston , Texas . Enbridge is based in Canada . What was not widely reported at the time was the fact that the Seaway pipeline had experienced a leak at a hub in Cushing , Oklahoma , just three months earlier in late October . KOCO News 5 in Oklahoma states that the spill in Cushing released less than 50,000 gallons of oil and was quickly contained . Fox 4 News reports that although a man identified as an employee of Enterprise barred people from crossing the highway to the Blue Ridge spill , Plano-based environmental activist Jesse Puente was able to cross over and examine the pipeline spill , where he found pools of oil mixed with water . The Trump administration approved the Dakota Access pipeline just days after the Blue Ridge accident , angering the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and environmental activists known as water protectors . According to a study by Auburn University , if an oil pipeline bursts , it can create a serious health hazard for those who live near it . Crude oil , which is the type of oil spilled near Blue Ridge , contains more than 1,000 chemicals hazardous to humans , such as the carcinogen benzene . It is this reason that the Standing Rock Sioux have fought against the DAPL since last spring . While the Blue Ridge pipeline trails along a major highway in Texas , the DAPL is set to go under Lake Oahe , which provides water to Standing Rock and to millions of people down river . If the DAPL bursts beneath Lake Oahe , the oil and the chemicals in it could leach into the water , rendering it undrinkable . Two months ago , another oil pipeline 150 miles from Standing Rock burst , spilling oil and chemicals into the water , according to a piece in the Inquisitr . Although the Blue Ridge Seaway pipeline accident is far from Standing Rock , it is just one in a series of thousands of pipeline incidents in the last 20 years .
