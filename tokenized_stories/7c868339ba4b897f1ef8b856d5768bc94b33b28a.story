Both Native and non-Native protesters are putting themselves on the line to try to stop construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- , and the stakes are high . Because of the violence of police , one young woman may lose her arm , and another could be blinded for life , and that 's only so far . Law enforcement is picking up on reports that have circulated among some leftists on social media . But the complaints are overblown , based on my own experience , having traveled to Standing Rock twice to stand in solidarity . There has been an influx of tens of thousands of people to Standing Rock over the past several months , and especially during the Thanksgiving holiday period at the end of November . Those who come to Standing Rock are n't unwelcome intruders -- they are responding directly to calls from the water protectors to mobilize support . Police crack down on peaceful water protectors with rubber bullets and pepper spray -LRB- Red Warrior Camp -RRB- The influx has created new logistical problems for the encampments , which should be expected when thousands of people arrive anywhere . The Oceti Sakowin have responded by organizing daily orientation meetings that introduce newcomers , Native and non-Native alike , to Lakota culture and protocols . We can expect that there will be a learning curve for people meeting each other for the first time in solidarity , and that some will be unable or unwilling to abide . But we are talking about a very small subset of people who have acted disrespectfully , violating the prohibitions against drugs , alcohol or weapons in a prayer camp . They , in fact , face the consequences now of being ignored by tribal leaders and water protectors who will not allow their actions to be a distraction from the struggle . Last month , some 500 clergy came to the camp , and on December 4 , more than 2,000 military veterans are self-deploying . There is far too much work to be done . This story is actually insulting in its suggestion that sovereign Native Nations are n't capable of democratic organization or leadership , or are so fragile in the face of cultural differences that they can be overwhelmed by a small group of people belonging to an even smaller subculture . ONE REASON why the police are suddenly concerned about the welfare of the camps when they 're threatened by hippies is because they hope to set water protectors and supporters against each other . Mostly , the Morton County sheriffs , the National Guard and private security forces working for Energy Transfer Partners have been content to employ brute force : dogs , rubber bullets , water cannons in sub-zero conditions , concussion grenades and more used against peaceful protectors . The level of human rights violations committed by the state of North Dakota on behalf of a private corporation is appalling . It has attracted the attention of groups like Amnesty International and the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues , which sent teams to witness and report on abuses . Consider Sophia Wilansky , a 21-year-old from New York City who was acting as a medic when her arm was blown to pieces by a direct hit from a concussion grenade on the night police attacked at Backwater Bridge . Or Vanessa Dundon , who on the same night was hit in the face with a rubber bullet and may be blind for the rest of her life as a result . The idea that the police are there to protect protesters or uphold the rights of Native American people is farcical -- yet it has picked up momentum , particularly in the local media . Water protectors are frequently described by North Dakota news outlets as violent rioters impeding the progress of jobs and energy self-sufficiency . Some local residents and officials have gone so far as to start labeling protesters as terrorists -- as if being armed with drums and prayers comes anywhere near the militarized equipment deployed against them by the state of North Dakota . To millions across the country , these depictions are obviously racist and rooted in centuries-old colonial stereotypes about restless and backward savages . The net effect will be to impede solidarity . It is beneficial to the state of North Dakota to have potential supporters guilted out of providing solidarity when the Oceti Sakowin are directly asking people for just that . This is especially with the looming threat of eviction and evacuation from Gov. Jack Dalrymple in the middle of a North Dakota blizzard . They have never been on our side , and have never spoken in anything but their own interests . Solidarity is what strengthens our struggle and what will win the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline .
