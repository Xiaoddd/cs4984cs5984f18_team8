Experts weigh in on possible outcomes of Dakota Access Pipeline protest By Archie Ingersoll on Dec 3 , 2016 at 3:11 p.m. Equally hard to predict is what will happen now as both sides appear as entrenched as ever . Concerned the pipeline will encroach on sacred sites and taint drinking water on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation , protesters are hunkering down for a North Dakota winter . Looking in from the outside are academics who study protest movements and have been following the conflict in Morton County enough to offer some informed speculation on how the drawn-out , deadlocked situation may play out . Many observers have compared the Dakota Access protest to the 1973 standoff at Wounded Knee on South Dakota 's Pine Ridge Reservation . But Dana Fisher , a sociology professor at the University of Maryland , said the protest at Standing Rock reminds her of the Occupy Wall Street encampment of 2011 that spread from New York to other cities . Like Occupy , the Dakota Access protest is n't just a one-day event . Though unlike the Occupy movement , which did not achieve its lofty goal of eliminating social and financial inequality , the protest near Standing Rock has a specific aim : blocking the pipeline 's proposed crossing under the Missouri River . With such a tangible , conceivable goal , Fisher said , the protest will likely keep growing as it resonates among indigenous people and environmentalists . President Barack Obama said last month the Corps was looking at ways to reroute the pipeline . But whether his administration will act on the issue before he leaves office in January remains to be seen . On Thursday , Dec. 1 , President-elect Donald Trump said for the first time that he supports the completion of the pipeline . Still , the effect Trump could have on the project 's future is unclear , said Gail Small , a Native American Studies professor at Montana State University . Small said transfers of presidential power take time , including the process of installing Trump 's appointees to lead federal agencies like the Corps . And she noted that a president 's power is constrained by such agencies , which have broad discretion in making decisions about easements and the like . Gov. Jack Dalrymple , a pipeline proponent , has urged the Corps to issue the easement . The governor 's spokesman , Jeff Zent , said he does not think it 's feasible to reroute the pipeline , which is finished in North Dakota except for the river crossing . Aside from rerouting the pipeline or building it as planned , some say a third possibility is abandoning the project altogether . Mark Trahant , a University of North Dakota professor who blogs about native issues at TrahantReports.com , said he thinks Obama could still sign an executive order that says proper consultation with the Sioux regarding the pipeline did not occur . Such a decision would create a delay of about six months , enough time for the price of oil to drop to a point where the project does n't make economic sense , Trahant said . The report came from the Cleveland-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis , a group aimed at reducing dependence on nonrenewable energy . The report said Energy Transfer will miss its Jan. 1 deadline to complete the pipeline , which would allow oil producers and shippers to renegotiate their contracts with the company and seek concessions , weakening the project 's financial footing . In rebuttal , Energy Transfer spokeswoman Vicki Granado said Jan. 1 is not a contractual date ; rather it was the company 's original date for the pipeline to be in service . Granado said the actual contractual date for finishing the pipeline is confidential . ` Talk to people ' The governor and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have made calls for protesters to vacate Corps-managed land where camping is not permitted . The governor issued his order Monday , Nov. 28 , due to the dangers of harsh winter weather . Fisher said the smartest thing officials can do at this point is just leave the camp alone . North Dakota and Corps officials have said they do n't plan to forcibly remove campers from the site . But the Corps has said people who stay may be prosecuted for trespassing . Trahant said he believes the potential for violence continues to be an issue , and he fears the situation could spiral out of control . Burgum declined to comment for this story , and Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault did not respond to interview requests . Granado said Energy Transfer expects ultimately to receive the easement and after that it would take 90 to 120 days to install the pipeline 95 to 115 feet beneath the riverbed . She added that construction is nearly complete in the other three states . Just as confident is Braun , a community organizer for the Indigenous Environmental Network and a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe . On Thursday , as people were sledding , building snowmen and having snowball fights in the protest camp , Braun spoke of the unprecedented nature of the protest that 's brought so many tribes together for a common purpose .
