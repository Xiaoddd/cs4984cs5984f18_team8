See Example -LRB- s -RRB- EXAMPLES Collected via e-mail , March 2015 Wal-Mart and MOST large companies , take out life insurance on theirt employees , without their knowing . A common practice , unknown by the average consumer . Millions of current and former workers at hundreds of large companies are thus worth a great deal to their employers dead , as well as alive , yielding billions of dollars in tax breaks over the years , as well as a steady stream of tax-free death benefits . Nestle USA has policies covering 18,000 workers , Pitney Bowes Inc. has policies covering 23,000 , and Procter & Gamble Co. has 15,000 covered workers , spokespeople for these companies confirm . The coverage is called broad-based insurance , or corporate-owned life insurance , usually shortened to COLI . For years , companies could insure only key personnel deemed essential to the business . However , executive compensation was only one use for such insurance policies that was cited by the companies interviewed about COLI payouts ; insurance funds were applied in a number of ways to company expenses of varying descriptions . Winn-Dixie purchased EOLI policies on approximately 36,000 employees and systematically borrowed against the cash value of the policies to fund the premiums . The income tax savings to Winn-Dixie from deducting the interest payments and related fees were projected to be substantially in excess of potential benefit to Winn-Dixie from maintaining the EOLI program . Winn-Dixie was not alone in maintaining EOLI policies on a broad base of employees . While Congress and the I.R.S. continued to challenge the deductibility of interest and fees incurred in connection with EOLI policies , the public was becoming increasingly concerned with the ghoulish nature of employers profiting from the death of their employees . On October 23 , 2003 , Spencer Tillman , a former NFL football player who became a sports analyst for CBS , testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance regarding the insurance policy that Camelot Music maintained on the life of his brother , Felipe . Felipe was a low-level employee of Camelot Music who had not worked for Camelot Music for many years prior to his death . That documentary featured interviews with the family of a woman who once worked as a cake decorator for Walmart and died of asthma complications while in her twenties . Her family maintained that they did not receive any portion of the insurance proceeds paid out to Walmart after her death : That segment was one of the most powerful scenes in the film , and its details were among the most memorable . However , Moore clarified that Walmart had long discontinued the practice of obtaining life insurance policies on rank and file employees years earlier following a larger lawsuit initiated by families of deceased employees insured by that giant retail chain . WalMart is contending in an appeal that it was entitled to rely on its expert insurance brokers to warn the company of the inherent dangers of buying COLI policies . WalMart has asked the high court to revive its bad-faith and breach-of-duty claims against its insurers , which the Delaware Chancery Court had dismissed . And although the proceeds of such policies previously paid out after the deaths of low-level employees on occasion funded executive salaries , their primary purpose was not to generate corporate profits based upon higher worker mortality rates . has long been engaged in the battle against misinformation , an effort we could not sustain without the support of our readers .
