The Bush family had history in Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion . Claiming thousands of Iraqi troops were threatening Saudi Arabia , and thus U.S. oil interests , Bush Sr. made the case for U.S. military action . Bush ultimately opted not to invade Iraq , instead deploying troops to Kuwait to expel Iraqi soldiers , a move that drew praise from then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney . In fact , the CIA provided tactical aid to Hussein knowing he was using chemical weapons . More recently , it was revealed that this relationship was much deeper than previously known . Indeed , the U.S. government empowered Hussein before they moved to oust him under the false pretenses of weapons of mass destruction . Incidentally , Nixon also said this week that he knew immediately upon interrogating Hussein that there were no weapons of mass destruction . Clinton had signed the Iraq Liberation Act by the end of the year , officially adopting a policy of regime change in Iraq and paving the way for the subsequent administration to tear into the country . Nixon has long been a critic of the Iraq War and has revealed many of his experiences in his recent book , Debriefing the President : The Interrogation of Saddam Hussein .
