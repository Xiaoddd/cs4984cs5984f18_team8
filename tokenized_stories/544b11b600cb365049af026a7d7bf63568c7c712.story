Two protesters rappel from the rafters with a banner against the Dakota Access Pipeline during a game Sunday between the Minnesota Vikings and the Chicago Bears at U.S. Bank Stadium .

A group of Minnesota activists claimed responsibility for the stunt . Nina Roberson , a spokeswoman for the group , said the action came at the end of a month 's worth of planning intended to put pressure on the Minneapolis-based bank to fully divest from Energy Transfer Partners , the Dallas-based company funding construction of the pipeline . As the game was played below , Mayo and Holiday allegedly used ropes and harnesses to remain dangling above the crowd until about 3 p.m. , the statements said . A U.S. Bank spokesman declined to comment . I 'm over in the section now where the protesters are repelling . A third person who police said was involved in the incident was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor obstruction . A statement identified her as Carolyn Feldman , 27 .
