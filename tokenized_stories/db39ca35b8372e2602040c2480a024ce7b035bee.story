On March 27 , the water protectors ' plea took its greatest hit yet when news broke that the Dakota Access Pipeline will be in service soon , and is currently filled with oil . The fight against DAPL has rallied Native rights activists , environmentalists and more , but it appears that this specific battle is on its last legs . Federal court filings obtained by reporters revealed that Energy Transfer Partners , the company behind the controversial pipeline , is preparing for full operation of the pipeline . In the filing , Energy Transfer Partners revealed the status of the pipeline : Oil has been placed in the Dakota Access Pipeline underneath Lake Oahe . Dakota Access is currently commissioning the full pipeline and is preparing to place the pipeline into service . Although the filing states that ETP is preparing the pipeline for operation , it does n't specify when exactly it will be fully operational . Many were joyous in Dec. 2016 when the Army Corps of Engineers blocked the pipeline , but shortly after his inauguration , President Donald Trump signed an order in favor of approving the final permits for the pipeline . A few weeks after Trump 's DAPL order , the water protectors were evicted from the Oceti Sakowin camp on the Standing Rock Sioux reservation , and they ceremonially burned their camp in protest . Despite the executive back-and-forth about the pipeline and their many setbacks , Native activists are keeping the fight alive . Despite being denied an injunction to halt the pipeline on religious grounds in early March , the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe are continuing to raise money for their legal challenge to the pipeline . On their crowdfunding page , the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe denoted two distinct legal strategies they 're deploying to fight the pipeline : one based on religious freedom laws -LRB- which were denied in their most recent request -RRB- and one based on treaty and environmental challenges . With a decidedly oil-friendly administration in Washington , there 's no hope of another presidential injunction to stop the oil from flowing under Lake Oahe . But the Native people leading the fight against the pipeline do n't seem to be backing down anytime soon . months of protest , one presidential blockage , and a subsequent presidential reversal , the Dakota Access Pipeline and the fight against it have made news for much of the last year . The fight against DAPL has rallied Native rights activists , environmentalists and more , but it appears that this specific battle is on its last legs . the filing states that ETP is preparing the pipeline for operation , it does n't specify when exactly it will be fully operational . But the Native people leading the fight against the pipeline do n't seem to be backing down anytime soon .
