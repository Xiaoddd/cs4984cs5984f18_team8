This was a benefit show to support the standing rock protestors . This event was held at 123 Pleasant St Morgantown WV , December 11 , 2016 . The pipeline was projected to run from the Bakken oil fields in western North Dakota to southern Illinois , crossing beneath the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers , as well as under part of Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation . In April , Standing Rock Sioux elder LaDonna Brave Bull Allard established a camp as a center for cultural preservation and spiritual resistance to the pipeline ; over the summer the camp grew to thousands of people . Much of the pipeline has been completed as of late 2016 , so the Missouri crossing has been an increasingly controversial topic . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted a limited review of the route and found no significant impact . In March and April 2016 the Environmental Protection Agency , the Department of Interior , and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation asked the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a formal Environmental Impact Assessment and issue an Environmental Impact Statement . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed suit against the Corps of Engineers in July , but the motion was denied in September 2016 . On September 3 construction workers bulldozed a section of land the tribe had identified as sacred ground in an amendment to the federal injunction a day earlier . When protesters entered the area , security workers used attack dogs , which bit at least six of the protesters and one horse . The incident was filmed and viewed by several million people on YouTube and other social media . In late November many new participants joined the protest ; fluctuating numbers of protesters remained in the thousands . The weather worsened , with snowfall and temperatures dropping well below freezing . Police use of water cannons on protesters drew significant media attention . An environmental impact assessment will also be conducted by the Army Corps . Many protesters continue camping on the site , not considering the matter closed The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is facing a very tough winter and I know too many amazing people around town that would have something to offer to help these water protectors that are fighting for our water and for a better planet .
