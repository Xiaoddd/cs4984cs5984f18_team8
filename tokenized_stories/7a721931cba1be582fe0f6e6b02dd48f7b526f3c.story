From civil disobedience to coordinated efforts to shut down pipelines carrying tar sands oil to the United States , environmental activists are standing in the way of delivering energy that could help the rest of the world , said Russ Girling , president and CEO of TransCanada Corporation , the developer of the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline . The heads of three major North America pipeline companies convened Wednesday evening at the annual CERAWeek energy conference to discuss the trials and tribulations of building pipelines in an era in which the public has been awakened to the impacts of fossil fuel extraction and consumption . Opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline project , whose route ran near the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation , became a focal point of opposition for Native Americans across the country . Both are members of the Catholic Worker movement , founded by famed peace and justice activist Dorothy Day . That quickly changed as Energy Transfer Partners gained the support of state law enforcement in North Dakota and police agencies across the country that traveled to Standing Rock camp to violently suppress the protests against the pipeline . The company also used intimidation tactics against opponents . As the protests at Standing Rock grew , the company sent in private security contractors who used pepper spray and attack dogs on pipeline opponents . Energy Transfer Partners hired TigerSwan , a private security firm , to oversee protection of the pipeline project . As a U.S. military contractor , TigerSwan turned its military-style counterterrorism tactics against Dakota Access protesters . The company later paid TigerSwan for information that was used to file a conspiracy against environmental groups . TigerSwan did this by infiltrating the protest camps and activist circles and gathering information via fake social media pages . After climate crackdown , TransCanada scraps major tar sands pipeline Blame -LRB- or thank -RRB- Canada 's regulatory board . During the CERAWeek panel discussion , Warren admitted that his company monitors social media . Sunoco Pipeline is owned by Energy Transfer Partners . In January , Pennsylvania regulators also ordered Sunoco Pipeline to suspend construction of its Mariner East 2 pipeline system . The massive cross-state project has been plagued by drilling spills and water contamination . Prior to joining Kinder Morgan , Kean served as chief of staff to Ken Lay , the disgraced founder of Enron Corp. who was found guilty of breaking several laws , including 10 counts of securities fraud , that contributed to the downfall of the company . Once that happens , we need to abide by it and honor it . Prior to this decade , the energy industry was unaccustomed to public involvement in a regulatory process that they viewed as a domain it could control . Then came the crackdown . Girling also emphasized that the pipeline industry must support regulators at the federal and state levels . The pipeline industry views the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as a friendly agency , given its history of rubber-stamping energy infrastructure projects . But Girling was pleased to see that climate and anti-pipeline activists are getting convicted .
