Norm MacQueen would seem to fit the profile of a property owner comfortable with an oil and gas pipeline running through his land . A retired oil refinery employee , MacQueen worked amid risky conditions for more than 20 years , as a pipe fitter and a welder . Eminent domain is often used by governments to gain right-of-way for projects such as highways or government buildings . But state and federal regulators who authorize pipeline projects also typically grant the private companies that are building them the right to use eminent domain to secure needed right-of-way . MacQueen , who voted for President Donald Trump , says he has no problem with the need for pipelines . Trump wooed rural voters by pledging to be attentive to their concerns , but one of his first acts as president was to expedite the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines , both of which have employed eminent domain to secure needed land . And the White House is squarely on the side of pipelines . Unions and industry groups have provided the White House with their favored proposals , which include pipeline projects in Pennsylvania , Virginia , North Carolina and other states , according to documents obtained by McClatchy . Tens of thousands of landowners could soon find themselves in the paths of new pipelines . As of 2016 , more than 34,000 miles of new oil and gas pipelines were in the planning stages , according to Pipeline and Gas Journal , an industry trade publication . Many are being spurred by the rich deposits of gas in the Marcellus shale region of West Virginia , Pennsylvania and Ohio . Lawmakers in some states are pushing back . Georgia and South Carolina recently passed laws banning private companies from using eminent domain for oil pipelines . GOP politicians face a particular conundrum with pipeline proposals . But Republicans are also big supporters of energy interests . In Pennsylvania , Texas , the Dakotas and many other states , the fracking industry and pipelines are seen as major job creators , supported by business groups and construction unions . But the passage of the Georgia and South Carolina laws , he said , shows that a bipartisan coalition is emerging on the issue , making unlikely allies out of environmentalists and tea party activists . EDITORS : END OPTIONAL TRIM Utilities and other pipeline developers gained the ability to use eminent domain during World War II , when oil and natural gas was needed to support the war effort and postwar industrialization . The authorization remained after the war ended . One of the earliest big interstate gas pipelines was financed by a group of wealthy Texans in 1949 . The Transco pipeline now stretches from the Gulf of Mexico to New York and is owned by Williams Cos. , an Oklahoma-based energy company . More than 15,000 miles of oil and gas pipelines crisscross the United States . Mishaps are rare , they argue . Yet when a pipeline leaks or breaks , the results can be catastrophic . In 2010 , eight people died when a Pacific Gas & Electric natural gas pipeline exploded in San Bruno , California . Last year , a man was seriously burned when a gas pipeline owned by a Texas company exploded in Salem Township , Pennsylvania , about 30 miles east of Pittsburgh . Rural landowners often cite such accidents when asked about their pipeline resistance . Sure , they tell us it is safe . Marvin Winstead , owner of a North Carolina farm that a gas pipeline is slated to cross Like many of his neighbors , Winstead has been approached by land agents employed by Dominion , which is partnering with Duke Energy on the 600-mile Atlantic Coast Pipeline . So far , Winstead has refused to sign an easement agreement and is preparing for legal proceedings . Along with safety concerns , she fears the easement could reduce the value of her property in Kenly , North Carolina , which includes her house and a 30-acre family farm . EDITORS : BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM Not all landowners are resisting use of their land for pipelines . The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is expected to cross the farms and yards of some 2,900 property owners in Virginia and North Carolina . Over the last two years , nearly two-thirds of them have signed easement agreements , said Aaron Ruby , a spokesman for Dominion Resources . To highlight some satisfied landowners , the Virginia-based company has produced videos of them . Ruby said there were two primary drivers of the project : abundant gas production in the Marcellus shale , but also regulatory demands that electric utilities retire their coal-fired power plants . The Atlantic Coast Pipeline will allow Dominion and Duke Energy to close several of these plants and replace them with cleaner gas-fired generation stations , he said . Some 80 percent will be used by utilities for electricity generation and the rest will go to natural gas utilities , to supply homes and businesses . Aside from compensating landowners for the use of their property and construction disruptions , Dominion has made 300 adjustments to its planned route , Ruby said . Eminent domain is always an absolute last resort . One of the most controversial is the Mariner East 2 , which would add two pipelines along the route of the Mariner East 1 pipeline in the southern part of the state . Sunoco briefly started idling the refinery in 2011 . It also knew there was a demand for these liquids in Europe , particularly among plastics manufacturers and gasoline refiners . So the company re-engineered its pipeline to run west to east , and started transferring natural gas liquids to Marcus Hook , where they were being loaded into ships heading to Europe . In Marcus Hook , town leaders are celebrating the project and the jobs it has created . But along the pipeline route , numerous landowners were surprised to learn that a different kind of product was running through their property . Many are just becoming aware that the company is planning to build two new pipelines along that same route , to ship more natural gas liquids overseas . EDITORS : BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM At a recent meeting in Chester County , Pennsylvania , along the pipeline route , more than 100 residents gathered to discuss safety concerns . Several speakers noted that the Mariner East 1 pipeline had been built in the 1930s , when the area had far fewer people . Now there will be two new pipelines , carrying explosive liquids , running within 50 feet of homes and a retirement community , and within a few hundred feet of schools . EDITORS : BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM Sunoco declined requests for a direct interview and would respond only to emailed questions . EDITORS : END OPTIONAL TRIM Although Sunoco says it works to monitor leaks and avoid accidents , Norm MacQueen is dubious . In April of 2015 , MacQueen noticed a strange smell wafting through his yard in Edgmont Township , Pennsylvania , where a Sunoco refined-products pipeline is buried . MacQueen contacted Sunoco , and an hour or so later a crew arrived and confirmed the leak . They then brought in extra crews , made a temporary repair to the pipeline and later installed monitoring wells . A year later , Sunoco dispatched a land agent to inform MacQueen about the two new pipelines the company plans to build through his land . Not wanting to go to court , MacQueen and his wife eventually agreed to sign . He said he was far from comfortable with the outcome . The explosion , which burned one person , caused flames to shoot above nearby treetops in the largely rural Salem Township , about 30 miles east of Pittsburgh , and prompted authorities to evacuate businesses nearby . An investigation later cited pipeline corrosion for causing the blast .

The pipeline , a joint venture between Dominion Resources and Duke Energy , is planned to carry natural gas from West Virginia through Virginia into North Carolina . Winstead refuses to sign an easement agreement with the pipeline developers , and he expects that they will use eminent domain to secure land through his farm .

In April 2015 , MacQueen said , he smelled hydrocarbons in his front yard , near where a Sunoco pipeline runs along the street . MacQueen called Sunoco , which sent out crews that confirmed the leak and made temporary repairs . The company also installed monitoring wells , seen in the background , to check the extent of contamination on his land .
