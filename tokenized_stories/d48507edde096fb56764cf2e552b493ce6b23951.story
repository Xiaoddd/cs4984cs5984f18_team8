Last weekend , thousands of Veterans traveled from all over the country to stand with the people of Standing Rock against what many viewed as brutal and heavy-handed tactics by the government in violation of the 1st Amendment . Veterans have been at the camp since it was first created , but after a fellow named Wes Clark , Jr. made a Facebook event with a date to attend , we figured it would be worth returning earlier than planned . We traveled to Standing Rock to stand with the people , however , most if not all of us had no idea that the gathering was staged for an entirely different purpose : the Wes Clark Jr. . Show . We knew something was up when Clark appeared for the first time at a muster at Sitting Bull College . There he talked at length about himself , how hard his travels were , he apologized for his appearance and lack of showering , then finished by asking an edler Sioux woman to be his grandma before giving her the key to his Los Angeles home . We knew something was up when every scheduled meeting at Oceti Sakowin camp was cancelled , no directions were ever given , no comm was ever established , and Veterans were left hanging to adapt and overcome their situations -LRB- which they did naturally with ease , as real leaders emerged -RRB- . Veterans who traveled to Standing Rock have much to be proud about , because they boldly and courageously protected their fellow citizens against an out-of-control federal government . They stood up for the Constitution . And they did so without acknowledgement , without fanfare , and without ceremony . Meanwhile , Wes Clark made the entire weekend about Wes Clark . He is an embarrasment to all things genuine and honest . He is a scam artist . He is a tool . That is why we are calling him out . Give Standing Rock Veterans a round of applause . From a quick cheer to a standing ovation , clap to show how much you enjoyed this story . 16 7 BlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Standing Rock Veterans 16 Never miss a story from Standing Rock Veterans , when you sign up for Medium . knew something was up when Clark appeared for the first time at a muster at Sitting Bull College .
