A contractor had accidentally punctured the line during normal maintenance . Around 5 p.m. the families were cleared to return to their homes with a promise from Magellan they would be reimbursed for any costs they incurred during their evacuation . Spills like the one in Texas dominate the news whenever they happen , so pipelines often appear much more accident-prone than they are . Although mistakes are inexcusable , news reports have never mentioned how almost all the oil transported that day moved without incident . Lobbying groups for oil and gas routinely laud their safety records : 99.999 percent of oil is transported safely through pipelines . In 2013 , the Association of Oil Pipelines reported that 8.3 billion barrels of crude oil were moved via pipeline . By contrast , pipelines result in 1.7 fatalities per year . These differences are simple to explain . Unlike highways , pipelines and rail are far away from people . When there are pipeline accidents , there are less likely to be casualties . Not only are pipelines less likely to harm others , they also help limit the environmental impact of spills . The average percentage of liquids recovered from pipeline spills from 1992 to 2011 was 40 percent . Because oil is a valuable commodity , spills are expensive and companies want to avoid them just as much as the most ardent environmentalists . The profit motive encourages companies to keep their operations safe and environmentally sound . No one was harmed and , even though people were evacuated from their homes , they safely returned later the same day . The company is also compensating those affected . Rightfully so .

Red or blue , oversight of dangerous environmental issues like oil spills is likely to be one of the few agreed-upon roles for government . In fact , many of the responders on the scene of the spill were government officials . Government can help monitor and prevent these problems and provide recourse for those harmed in the event those responsible are less than forthright and proactive when individuals are hurt . Legal rules for transporting oil should ensure those harmed have powerful avenues for recourse and must mandate companies maintain safe and clean operations .
