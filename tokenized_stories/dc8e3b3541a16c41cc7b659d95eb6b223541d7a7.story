They are outraged over the Dakota Pipeline , and further outraged over the treatment of the people trying to stop it . Wes Clark Jr. is the man behind the three-day deployment of U.S. military veterans to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . The standoff between the protesters and the law continues to escalate , resulting in horrific injuries to protesters . He is also a former Army officer who is openly and thoroughly disgusted with the violence being inflicted upon his fellow Americans . And to Clark , it seems obvious that veterans should continue their service to their country by stepping up and stepping in . The two hope to draw scores of veterans , along with fire fighters , ex-law enforcement officers , and others to Standing Rock for their deployment . And , considering their background , there is no reason to doubt them . Deployment To Standing Rock Was A Last Resort Phyllis Young , a Sioux Tribal elder , is the one who got Clark initially involved . Young , who grew up on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation , believes the future resides in the fight . And we have to help keep it in balance for as long as we can . I am a mother and a grandmother . Yet , much of what he attempted never panned out . He attempted to assemble a legal team for the Standing Rock Reservation inhabitants . But none of it went anywhere . Veterans who have spent their lives putting themselves in danger for their love of country , to protect their own . And this battle would be no different . Clark did explain that the plan is to maintain a non-violent presence . The funds will be used solely to help volunteers with transportation costs , and bailing volunteers out of jail , when needed . The following morning they will join members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe , including Young , for a traditional healing ceremony . With an eye toward the media , old military uniforms will be donned so that if the veterans are brutalized by the police , they are brutalized not as ordinary citizens , but as people who once served the government they are protesting against . Bagpipes will play , and traditional Sioux war songs will be sung . The music will continue as everyone marches together to the banks of the Missouri , on the other side of which a line of guards in riot gear will be standing ready with rifles , mace , batons , and dogs . The ultimate goal , the two veterans say , is to make it to the drilling pad and surround it . But with body armor and gas masks , as well as a cadre of trained veterans , this attempt may be harder to stop . Wood and Clark are willing to go to whatever lengths it may take . To them , this is nothing less than war . All rights are reserved . , Reverb Press . All rights reserved unless otherwise noted .
