Chief target populations included Romani , Sinti , ethnic Poles , Soviet POWs , disabled Germans , and Jews from across Europe . Nazi physicians and their assistants forced prisoners into participating ; they did not willingly volunteer and no consent was given for the procedures . Typically , the experiments resulted in death , trauma , disfigurement or permanent disability , and as such are considered examples of medical torture . Aribert Heim conducted similar medical experiments at Mauthausen . After the war , these crimes were tried at what became known as the Doctors ' Trial , and revulsion at the abuses perpetrated led to the development of the Nuremberg Code of medical ethics . The Nazi physicians in the Doctors ' Trial argued that military necessity justified their torturous experiments , and compared their victims to collateral damage from Allied bombings . But this defense , which was in any case rejected by the Tribunal , can not apply to the twin experiments of Josef Mengele , which were performed on children and had no connection to military necessity . The central leader of the experiments was Josef Mengele , who from 1943 to 1944 performed experiments on nearly 1,500 sets of imprisoned twins at Auschwitz . Often times , one twin would be forced to undergo experimentation , while the other was kept as a control . If the experimentation reached the point of death , the second twin would be brought in to be killed at the same time . Sections of bones , muscles , and nerves were removed from the subjects without use of anesthesia . Both operations involved one of her legs and although she never describes having any knowledge as to what exactly the procedure was , she explains that both times she was in extreme pain and developed a fever post surgery . Yet she was given little to no care . Prisoners were also experimented on by having their bone marrow injected with bacteria to study the effectiveness of new drugs being developed for use in the battle fields . The subject is wearing an experimental Luftwaffe garment In 1941 , the Luftwaffe conducted experiments with the intent of discovering means to prevent and treat hypothermia . Beginning in August 1942 , at the Dachau camp , prisoners were forced to sit in tanks of freezing water for up to 3 hours . After subjects were frozen , they then underwent different methods for rewarming . Many experiments were conducted on captured Russian troops ; the Nazis wondered whether their genetics gave them superior resistance to cold . The principal locales were Dachau and Auschwitz . In a letter from September 10 , 1942 , Rascher describes an experiment on intense cooling performed in Dachau where people were dressed in fighter pilot uniforms and submerged in freezing water . Malaria experiments From about February 1942 to about April 1945 , experiments were conducted at the Dachau concentration camp in order to investigate immunization for treatment of malaria . Healthy inmates were infected by mosquitoes or by injections of extracts of the mucous glands of female mosquitoes . Epidemic jaundice From June 1943 till January 1945 at the concentration camps , Sachsenhausen and Natzweiler , experimentation with epidemic jaundice was conducted . The test subjects were injected with the disease in order to discover new inoculations for the condition . These tests were conducted for the benefit of the German Armed Forces . Mustard gas experiments At various times between September 1939 and April 1945 , many experiments were conducted at Sachsenhausen , Natzweiler , and other camps to investigate the most effective treatment of wounds caused by mustard gas . Test subjects were deliberately exposed to mustard gas and other vesicants -LRB- e.g. Lewisite -RRB- which inflicted severe chemical burns . They were later executed . Circulation of blood was interrupted by tying off blood vessels at both ends of the wound to create a condition similar to that of a battlefield wound . Infection was aggravated by forcing wood shavings and ground glass into the wounds . The infection was treated with sulfonamide and other drugs to determine their effectiveness . Sea water experiments From about July 1944 to about September 1944 , experiments were conducted at the Dachau concentration camp to study various methods of making sea water drinkable . A Holocaust survivor named Joseph Tschofenig wrote a statement on these seawater experiments at Dachau . Tschofenig explained how while working at the medical experimentation stations he gained insight into some of the experiments that were performed on prisoners , namely those where they were forced to drink salt water . Tschofenig also described how victims of the experiments had trouble eating and would desperately seek out any source of water including old floor rags . Tschofenig was responsible for using the X-ray machine in the infirmary and describes how even though he had insight into what was going on he was powerless to stop it . Sterilization and fertility experiments The Law for the Prevention of Genetically Defective Progeny was passed on 14 July 1933 , which legalized the involuntary sterilization of persons with diseases claimed to be hereditary : weak-mindedness , schizophrenia , alcohol abuse , insanity , blindness , deafness , and physical deformities . The purpose of these experiments was to develop a method of sterilization which would be suitable for sterilizing millions of people with a minimum of time and effort . These experiments were conducted by means of X-ray , surgery and various drugs . Thousands of victims were sterilized . Therefore , radiation treatment became the favored choice of sterilization . Specific amounts of exposure to radiation destroyed a person 's ability to produce ova or sperm , sometimes administered through deception . M.D. William E. Seidelman , a professor from the University of Toronto , in collaboration with Dr. Howard Israel of Columbia University published a report on an investigation on the Medical experimentation performed in Austria under the Nazi Regime . In that report he mentions a Doctor Hermann Stieve , who used the war to experiment on live humans . Dr. Stieve specifically focused on the reproductive system of women . He would tell women their execution date in advance , and he would evaluate how their psychological distress would affect their menstruation cycles . After they were murdered , he would dissect and examine their reproductive organs . Experiments with poison Somewhere between December 1943 and October 1944 , experiments were conducted at Buchenwald to investigate the effect of various poisons . The poisons were secretly administered to experimental subjects in their food . The victims died as a result of the poison or were killed immediately in order to permit autopsies . Incendiary bomb experiments From around November 1943 to around January 1944 , experiments were conducted at Buchenwald to test the effect of various pharmaceutical preparations on phosphorus burns . High altitude experiments Further information : Hubertus Strughold In early 1942 , prisoners at Dachau concentration camp were used by Sigmund Rascher in experiments to aid German pilots who had to eject at high altitudes . In a letter from April 5 , 1942 between Dr. Sigmund Rascher and Heinrich Himmler , Rascher explains the results of a low-pressure experiment that was performed on people at Dachau Concentration camp in which the victim was suffocated while Rascher and another unnamed doctor took note of his reactions . The person was described as 37 years old and in good health before being murdered . Rascher described the victim 's actions as he began to lose oxygen and timed the changes in behavior . The 37 year old began to wiggle his head at 4 minutes , a minute later Rascher observed that he was suffering from cramps before falling unconscious . He describes how the victim then lay unconscious , breathing only 3 times per minute , until he stopped breathing 30 minutes after being deprived of oxygen . The victim then turned blue and began foaming at the mouth . Blood coagulation experiments Sigmund Rascher experimented with the effects of Polygal , a substance made from beet and apple pectin , which aided blood clotting . He predicted that the preventive use of Polygal tablets would reduce bleeding from gunshot wounds sustained during combat or during surgery . Subjects were given a Polygal tablet , and shot through the neck or chest , or their limbs amputated without anaesthesia . On 19 August 1947 , the doctors captured by Allied forces were put on trial in USA vs. Karl Brandt et al. , commonly known as the Doctors ' Trial . The issue of informed consent had previously been controversial in German medicine in 1900 , when Dr. Albert Neisser infected patients -LRB- mainly prostitutes -RRB- with syphilis without their consent . Despite Neisser 's support from most of the academic community , public opinion , led by psychiatrist Albert Moll , was against Neisser . In response , Drs. Some object on an ethical basis , and others have rejected Nazi research purely on scientific grounds , pointing out methodological inconsistencies .
