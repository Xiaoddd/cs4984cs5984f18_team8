More than 370 ratified treaties have helped the U.S. expand its territory and led to many broken promises made to American Indians . A rare exhibit of such treaties at the Smithsonian 's National Museum of the American Indian in Washington , D.C. , looks back at this history .

The deal secured an ally for the young U.S. government after the Revolutionary War and returned more than a million acres to the Haudenosaunee . But their territory has been cut down over the years . More than two centuries later , the U.S. has kept one promise . Every year , those goods from the U.S. government include bolts of cloth to distribute to tribal citizens . Haudenosaunee leaders have said that cloth is more important than money , because it 's a way to remind the U.S. of the treaty terms , large and small . For now , the documents not on display are kept at the National Archives , where one almost-forgotten treaty is stored underground . California lawmakers pressured the U.S. Senate not to ratify the treaties , which promised reservation land to the Native American nations . There was one reason the lawmakers did n't want the treaties , according to the exhibit 's curator Suzan Shown Harjo of the Cheyenne and Hodulgee Muscogee Indian nations . And if it 's not silver , it 's copper . Enlarge this image A museum visitor views wampum belts , fans and other diplomatic tools used during the treaty-making process . While many treaties resulted in tragedies , Harjo says she hopes museum visitors will take away the full span of this diplomatic history . But it did n't begin there . Anyone who wants a strong grounding in American history , Harjo adds , needs to understand the history of these treaties . No one was dragging any land behind them when they came here .
