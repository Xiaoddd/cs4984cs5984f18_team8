Jacqueline Patterson is the director of the NAACP Environmental and Climate Justice Program . She says she recognized environmental injustice decades ago while working in Jamaica , where Shell Oil contaminated community water supplies . Then later , while volunteering in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina , she saw another side of the inequity in climate disaster response . This is the kind of conversation I hope people are having all over the country and , indeed , the planet . Bill McKibben : Tell a bit of your story . And one of the communities I was working with , they had their water supply contaminated by Shell Oil . And they just wanted to fund a few ventilated pit latrines and give some money to the school . From there I connected with NAACP . The first couple of months I was doing these intro-to-climate-justice workshops at these regional trainings the NAACP has . But many people had little framework for hearing it . Climate was so hard to fit into what NAACP usually did . More people anyway . So many people have so many different capacities , knowledge , skills . Put yourself in service to the leadership of those on the front line . So join your local NAACP chapter . If you could help map out some of the groups , help them understand the connection between fracking and seismic activity . If you can look at the Florida situation and look at the increase in sinkholes , help people understand that sea level rise is affecting the limestone and making sinkholes more likely . He has severe asthma . Another one shows him looking out the window and watching kids go to school . I talk about the connection between the very facility that is driving climate change and the increased concentration of pollutants that come from climate change . Or they might be drinking it from their water supply . I want people to see all those levels of risk kids have from these impacts . And I overlay that with the fact that when you have this many problems , including living next to a toxic facility , on average your property values are 15 percent lower . And then I show an image of a child standing on a milk crate being fingerprinted . And then the same entities that fight against the regulations to help the air are the same entities pushing forward punitive criminal justice measures , and privatizing our prisons , and so on . People see that through the lens of an actual child , how all those systems come into play . How they come into play against his chance to be a thriving adult . Patterson : Well , climate change might be big enough to help us start reimagining things . Usually by the time I finish describing the problem side of my presentations , most people are properly depressed , but when I get on the transformation side , I start to talk about how these systems are predicated on exploitation of natural resources and of human resources . Or humans , period . And how climate change is really a byproduct of this systematic world of winners and losers . And then we talk about the ways we really need to flip this on its head . We talk about how when we have a system based on capitalism , by definition it means there are winners and losers . And communities of color , women , and so on are on the losing end . System by system , we talk about it . As we are taking back our democracy by overturning Citizens United and getting money out of politics and so on , we also have to be the change we want to see in the world , even before our political system catches up . So , the things that the Institute for Local Self-Reliance does around helping us develop recycling systems , our own energy systems , our own food systems . How we shift power away from the Monsantos , the Exxons . We have to do it all at the same time . Patterson : There are a lot of sensitivities around even using the term . People have lost their lives for not being able to pay for electricity . Ideally , their bills would go down . They need to feel that they have a choice , a choice that feels like it enables them to provide a similar level of support to their families and doing work that is fulfilling to them . Because the whole town is built on that coal . Patterson : Well , I think a willingness to work together . They had to eat together and shovel together , while trusting that they were all working toward these common aims . They had to work through any roadblocks , literally and figuratively .
