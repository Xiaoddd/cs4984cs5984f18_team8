Now comes the fallout of all that information hoarding : A California-based security researcher says Republican-linked election databases were inadvertently exposed to the entire internet , sans password , potentially violating the privacy of almost every single registered voter in the United States . The data trove was apparently made public by accident by one of the data-mining companies that compiled it . The leak was discovered by Chris Vickery , an analyst at the U.S. cybersecurity firm UpGuard , who last year discovered an enormous breach of Mexican voter data and in 2015 a 300 GB leak of records of 191 million voters . The data , which was stored in a publicly accessible cloud server owned by Republican data firm Deep Root Analytics , included 1.1 terabytes of entirely unsecured personal information compiled by DRA and at least two other contractors , TargetPoint Consulting , Inc. and Data Trust . Two of the firms linked to the database , Deep Root Analytics and Target Point , were among three firms hired by the RNC to do most of its data modeling and voter scoring in 2016 , according to a December Ad Age story , with a mandate to shore up unconvinced Trump-leaning voters , sway weak Hillary Clinton supporters , and capture undecided voters . What UpGuard appears to have discovered , sitting on an Amazon cloud storage drive with no password or username required for access by anyone on the internet , was terabytes of the data used to map the voter proclivities and demographics key to finding voters in those buckets .
