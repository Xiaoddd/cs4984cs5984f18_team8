The National Indian Gaming Commission -LRB- NIGC -RRB- is a United States independent federal regulatory agency within the Department of the Interior . The commission is the only federal agency focused solely on the regulation of gambling , though it has many counterpart state and tribal regulatory agencies . The U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior also have responsibilities related to gaming and Indian gaming , respectively . The commission is an independent regulatory agency , but works closely with the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior on matters of game classification and Indian lands questions . Thus , its independence has some practical limits related to cooperation with Executive Branch agencies . The chair is appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate . The Secretary of the Interior appoints the other two commissioners . Under the act , at least two of the three commissioners must be enrolled members of a federally recognized Indian tribe , and no more than two members may be of the same political party . The first chairman of the NIGC was Tony Hope . President Barack Obama appointed the first woman to chair the commission , Tracie L. Stevens , a member of the Tulalip Tribes of Washington . Chaudhuri is a member of the Muscogee -LRB- Creek -RRB- Nation . The commission also has a general counsel , who supervises the legal staff and advises the commission on its work . The first general counsel was Michael Cox . The second general counsel was Barry W. Brandon . The third was Kevin K. Washburn , who later served as Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs at the Department of the Interior . The fourth general counsel was Lawrence Roberts , who left the commission to become a deputy assistant secretary at the Department of the Interior . The act provides a regulatory framework to shield Indian gaming from corruption , and to ensure that the games offered are fair and honest and that tribes are the primary beneficiaries of gaming operations . The act created the commission to protect tribal gaming as a means of generating revenue for tribal communities . IGRA placed the commission within the Department of the Interior -LRB- DOI -RRB- , but also provided it with independent federal regulatory authority . The commission monitors tribal gaming activity , inspects gaming premises , conducts background investigations and audits of Class II gaming operations -LRB- and Class III gaming operations , upon request or as provided by applicable law , such as tribal gaming ordinances and tribal-state compacts -RRB- . The commission also provides technical assistance and training to tribal gaming commissions and operations and , when appropriate , undertakes enforcement actions . The commission maintains its headquarters in Washington , D.C. , and has seven regional offices and two satellite offices . The commission is divided into four separate divisions . Approximately half of the commission staff is assigned to headquarters in Washington , D.C. , with the remaining staff assigned to regional offices located in Portland , Oregon ; Sacramento , California ; Phoenix , Arizona ; St. Paul , Minnesota ; Tulsa , Oklahoma ; Washington , D.C. ; and Oklahoma City , Oklahoma ; and satellite offices in Rapid City , South Dakota and Temecula , California . The field offices are vital to carrying out the statutory responsibilities of the commission . By having auditors and compliance officers close to tribal gaming facilities , the commission seeks to facilitate compliance with the act and better relationships with tribal leaders , officials and regulatory personnel . In addition to auditing and investigative activities , the field staff provides technical assistance and training to promote a better understanding of gaming controls within the regulated industry , and to enhance cooperation and compliance to ensure the integrity of gaming operations .
