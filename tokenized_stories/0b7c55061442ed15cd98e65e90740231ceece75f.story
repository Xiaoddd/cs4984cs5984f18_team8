The Sabal Trail Pipeline is a project of Duke Energy , NextEra Energy , and Spectra Energy . AIM , the target of ongoing protests in the Hudson Valley -LRB- NY -RRB- and elsewhere , would run from central New Jersey to ports in the Boston , MA area , passing within a few hundred feet of Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant on the Hudson River . The Sabal Trail project is touted by Spectra to be crucial to aiding economic development along its route , and fueling gas-fired power generators in the Southeast United States . Environmentalists , however , view the project quite differently . Such development plans rarely come without a cost to communities , and to the environment . A Unique Geology Reflecting its geological origins as part of a shallow ancient ocean , the southeastern United States is underlain by porous limestone bedrock , known as karst . Water running through the karst bedrock flows not only through small pores , but often through extensive underground caves . When under under pressure , water can bubble up to the surface in a multitude of freshwater springs throughout the region . Recognizing these risks , opponents of the Sabal Trail pipeline frequently cite the inherent danger of pipelines bending and rupturing should the ground beneath them give way , leading to potentially dangerous gas leakages or explosions . One piece of recent research from the University of Georgia maps the prevalence of sinkholes in Doughterty County , GA , one of the many counties the Sabal Trail pipeline would pass through . Karst geology , documented sinkholes , and springs near the route of the pipeline are also shown . The double-arrows in the upper right corner of the map will launch a full-screen view of the map , including a map legend . Two months later , however , in mid-December , the EPA suddenly reversed its position . Currently , the construction is proceeding . Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -LRB- FERC -RRB- has granted eminent domain to industry to build the project through seized private property . Although all federal permits for the pipeline construction are in place , a joint lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club , the Gulf Restoration Network , and Flint Riverkeeper has challenged that permitting process . Sabal Trail gas pipeline noise pollution at the Santa Fe River -LRB- Nov. 25 , 2016 -RRB- . Water Protectors As winter descends on the northern Plains , thousands of indigenous people representing hundreds of tribes , as well as non-Native allies , have gathered in camps near the Sioux Standing Rock Reservation to pray and protest the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- , which would drill an oil pipeline through sacred Native lands and under the Missouri River . Hundreds of arrests of peaceful protesters have been made there in recent months , many resulting in serious injuries to the protesters as water cannons , rubber bullets , concussion grenades , and attack dogs have been used in efforts to intimidate the activists . Coordination among First Nations groups against other fossil fuel infrastructure is happening elsewhere , too . For example , in September 2016 , at least fifty US and Canadian aboriginal groups signed a treaty , saying they will work together to fight proposals that would bring crude oil from the Alberta tar sands via pipeline , tanker , and rail . The protests against the Sabal Trail Project are similarly themed to those at Standing Rock , but have not resulted in violence towards protesters thus far . Along the Suwanee River in Florida , peaceful protesters have assembled at the Sacred Waters encampment and , on November 12 , 2016 , faced off with authorities in an effort to stop pipeline drilling under the Santa Fe River between Branford and Fort White , Florida . No arrests were made on that day . Still other protests about the potential environmental risks posed by the Sabal Trail have taken place recently in both Orlando and Live Oak , Florida . Even in the phases of construction , environmentalists in Georgia discovered that the Sabal Trail pipeline had started leaking drilling mud from a pilot hole into the Withlacooche River in late October , and continued to ooze turbid mud for at least three weeks . Bev says : December 11 , 2016 at 8:33 am We as users of water must gather together to save our lives . And gas is lighter than air . If , God forbid , there is a leak , gas flows UP not down into the aquifer layer . No chance for contamination . Michelle Maguire says : February 12 , 2017 at 10:17 am Florida terrain is fragile . It is not like other parts of the US . The fact that it is in an area of sink holes makes it very disturbing . Denise Shirey says : March 21 , 2017 at 10:53 pm John , this area is really fragile . The land is swiss cheese . Obviously the environmental implications are different . If you do not like a company , boycott . We just keep raping the earth & there will be a point of no healing which will be our own demise . Greed is the root of all evil . I feel concern for my children & my grandchildren . We need to stand strong in our beliefs & keep our voices heard . John Galt says : January 9 , 2017 at 11:29 am So . . Renewables . Solar panels , made largely in China , and creating toxic waste dumps that you can not begin to regulate.Wind turbines using magnets made from rare earth materials , mined in China , and which kill bats , raptors and migratory birds . If not , than you are a hypocrite , no better than the fools in Hollywood who pontificate on the evils of fossil fuels while gadding about in private jets . You have to change your lifestyle to do it but it can be done . Overpopulation is fueling all these environmental ills . I have refrained from bringing children into this troubled situation . If enough others would follow suit , we could depopulate to a proper balance with the rest of the web of life . Yet the insane overpopulation continues . I have made four attempts to organize a community in the country , where we could live a very clean , healthy , and easy life , while preserving Nature , yet others would not join me . When karst is under pressure , water can bubble to the surface . FracTracker Alliance is a 501 -LRB- c -RRB- 3 non-profit organization registered in the United States .
