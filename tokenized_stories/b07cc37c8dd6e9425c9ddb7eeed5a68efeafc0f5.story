But miners are n't universally opposed to federal regulations . Just two days earlier , a retired Kentucky miner suffering from black lung disease appeared at an EPA hearing in Colorado and , in opposition to industry representatives , called for more government oversight . New federal rules in effect Friday mark the first time in 45 years that federal officials have updated labor rules to prevent black lung disease , which is caused by inhaling toxic coal dust and silica in mines . By the time the rules are fully in effect in 2016 , workers should be exposed to 25 percent less coal dust , saving lives . Companies also must sample throughout workers ' 10 - to twelve-hour shifts , take samples in more locations in the mine , and provide more medical screenings . The answer lies in the industry 's aggressive opposition to reform : Whenever coal faces new regulations , the industry insists that its role as a job creator should take priority over pollution control . Just this week , pro-coal interests made this point in hearings on EPA climate regulations for carbon emissions . The rules are better late than never . Over four decades , more than 76,000 miners have died directly or indirectly from black lung . Those rates have risen in recent years in central Appalachia , most alarmingly among young workers . There are a number of reasons for this increase : Longer shifts and more effective mining equipment that creates more dust . But regulations could have helped in both cases . Before , mine supervisors did not have to monitor levels throughout a worker 's shift . In 1998 , the coal industry fought off a proposed coal dust update by filing a court appeal . Reporter Ken Ward attributed the delay to coal lobby pressure and Republican interference . Both the National Mining Association and Murray Energy have filed separate lawsuits against MSHA .

In-depth investigations conducted by the Center for Public Integrity found the industry often colluded with doctors and deployed teams of lawyers against workers claiming black lung benefits , in order to downplay the number of cases . After the investigation , the Labor Department discovered that more than 1,000 miners may have been wrongfully denied their medical benefits . Rebecca Leber is a reporter at Mother Jones .
