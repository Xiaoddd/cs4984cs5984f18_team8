In places like the United States , where extraction efforts increasingly rely on unconventional techniques like fracking , that EROEI has fallen to 10 or 11 to 1 or lower . What this means is that a global energy return on investment inflection point between oil and solar was likely reached at some time during the present year . -LRB- Rising solar cell conversion efficiencies , expanding production bases , and better supply chains are helping to drive solar energy return on energy invested higher . How much energy you get back for each unit invested has often been seen as a viability factor for modern civilization . And returns higher than 5 to 1 were often thought of as essential for the maintenance and progression of present high standards of living in advanced societies . However , in the past , alternatives like wind and solar were at first criticized for perceived low rates of energy return . In the end , it appears that these criticisms have turned up false . The higher energy returns for solar come as module efficiency , supply chain efficiency , and production and installation efficiency are all on the rise . And as solar is a technology-based energy source , we can expect these returns to continue to increase as production bases widen and as innovation drives modules to continue to improve their ability to collect power from the sun . For oil , the story is quite a bit more grim . China , the U.S. and India all likely saw record rates of solar adoption . Falling prices have helped to push the surge even as energy policies within many countries remain favorable to solar . In the Middle East and South America , new solar purchase agreements continued to break records for lowest cost . In Abu Dhabi , one solar project moved ahead with a 2.42 cent per kwh price tag . In Chile , a separate project broke ground at 2.91 cents per kwh . These prices are considerably lower than new oil or gas plants and are a primary driver for rising rates of adoption . -LRB- Under Democratic President Barack Obama , solar energy expanded at a very rapid clip . Reactive policies coming from the Trump Administration may put a wet blanket over this rate of solar growth . In any case , given the amazing benefits provided by solar power , efforts made to slow this transition by Trump and others in his administration should be seen as a protectionist , nonsensical , and amoral top-down defense of the harmful fossil fuel industry . Higher energy return on investment ratios for solar is one of the primary drivers enabling such low overall power prices . Which one wins out depends on the level of our response . To open up the frame a bit and let people know that we have this option . But we should be pretty clear that this backsliding by Republicans in the US is more a move back toward gilded age political systems which were probably at least as corrupt as those we are looking at now . That said , it might be that the action by legislature in North Carolina is completely without precedent . Krugman is right in that institutions that do not resist can not save us . At the very least , they can lay the groundwork for a counter-force . But I honestly think that Krugman is more depressed than need be . I would have hoped that you had learned by now not to fall into that particular logical fallacy pit-trap . Thank you for the hat tip , much appreciated . Of course , Australia has some rather aggressive whites in the water . For some reason they seem to get a higher incidence of attacks there . I seem to remember that I was taught that the most likely cause of the sudden drop in temperatures was a slow down of ocean currents caused by the melting of the vast Laurentide Ice Sheet . Although the Greenland ice sheets are not as huge , I wonder if history will repeat itself in the future . And what will happen to the Southern Ocean currents and Southern Hemisphere climate when the East Antarctic ice sheet starts breaking up big time , which seems more likely in the latest reports . Depending on rate of ice loss , this can wag the global climate system in the atmosphere . But to be very clear , as this happens , the oceans are gaining heat more rapidly . If you hit enough melt to equal 2-3 feet per decade of sea level rise , it can basically counter the radiative forcing in the atmosphere as the ocean gains heat more rapidly . But that is an insane clip . Another science article that states that we can influence that now -LRB- today -RRB- . Should be Abu Dhabi -LRB- I had the good fortune to live in that great Emirate for fifteen years -RRB- . Fix in . This is one idea from a few months ago . One solution is to convert it into hydrogen through water electrolysis . Clean hydrogen can then be stored away for future use to produce electricity on demand , or even as a fuel . But this is where things get complicated . Even though different hydrogen-production technologies have given us promising results in the lab , they are still too unstable or expensive and need to be further developed to use on a commercial and large scale . The approach taken by EPFL and CSEM researchers is to combine components that have already proven effective in industry in order to develop a robust and effective system . Their prototype is made up of three interconnected , new-generation , crystalline silicon solar cells attached to an electrolysis system that does not rely on rare metals . In terms of performance , this is a world record for silicon solar cells and for hydrogen production without using rare metals . It also offers a high level of stability . Enough to power a fuel cell car over 10,000 km every year The method , which surpasses previous efforts in terms of stability , performance , lifespan and cost efficiency , is published in the Journal of The Electrochemical Society . And this means that just three of these cells , interconnected , can already generate an almost ideal voltage for electrolysis to occur . The electrochemical part of the process requires a catalyst made from nickel , which is widely available . A stable and economically viable method The new system is unique when it comes to cost , performance and lifespan . It is a well-known and robust technology whose lifespan exceeds 25 years . I hope it clears up any misconceptions about my alternative viewpoints you might have had to my first reply . 2 . Wind has various mechanical storage options -LRB- flywheel based etc -RRB- . 3 . Batteries which are dropping in cost along with wind and solar . Higher likelihood for breakthroughs as this links in to the electrical vehicle chain . Battery storage appears to be more and more widely used due to falling costs . In addition , a number of renewable providers are using pumped water storage as well . These appear to be the more practical options . A final option is molten salt thermal storage . But that tends to be mated more with thermal solar . Compressed air has had various interests involved as well . This can be accomplished far more cheaply with sensible heat storage -LRB- the molten salt you mentioned is one example -RRB- than with chemical storage in batteries . Even cheaper than molten salt is high temperature pebble bed storage , which has been experimented with in Germany -LRB- Julich -RRB- , but has never made it into any commercial systems . Add hydro as dispatchable service and various others and you tend to lower your storage requirements . The chemical batteries are getting cheaper all the time and large systems like you describe have the potential to further reduce costs for integrated grids . In any case , we are much further out from behind the 8 ball on renewable energy costs overall than we were even 4 years ago . An EV has a huge battery that could run a home for days , for example , and after market EV batteries for resale as storage devices are still likely to retain 80 percent of their charge . One of many new technologies that could work out . Much appreciated . It seems like a simple yet very useful storage innovation . Texas has done a significant build-out of new transmission , that is projected to pay for itself -LRB- through reduced fuel costs -RRB- in 7-10 years . In many cases due to time delay in the lines you can effectively use the grid like a battery . It takes slick management . But it can be done . And we have already seen some of this as a response to bad policy in Nevada . Zero point six percent of the current fossil fuel based system seems pretty acceptable to me . It all seems pretty tolerable , especially compared to fossil fuels , unless more information has been generated since 2006 , the year the above paper was written . Issues of efficiency and economics are separate issues . Methane in natural gas also impacts the hydroxyl radical . There are several green choices even though a lot of propaganda says otherwise . Solar is better in the sense that the grid can be avoided when the panels are on the roof of a home or business . Would just like to add that the grid does provide for various renewable energy optimizations . And that larger grids can be leveraged to manage intermittency . We can than Tesla and direct current for that . The reason is that higher voltage is used to transmit electricity for longer distances . Nowhere near the inefficiency created by burning fossil fuels , when half or more of the energy is wasted . And while the science may take time to officially verify that certain events are a result of anthropogenic forcing , you are not restrained in the same way , which I find to be incredibly useful . One example I immediately recall is the article in late June regarding the jet stream crossing the equator . Well , as the science later confirmed , this was a very big deal and Robert was right to point it out in a post . Here we are again . Robert has recently written a post about Foehn winds bringing melting to Antarctica , and shortly after we have a National Geographic article about scientists in Antarctica witnessing that very thing . I should point out this melting is not in reference to the melt ponds Robert pointed out in his post , but I still found the article to be eerily prescient . The overall effect was of an apparent high amplitude planetary wave pattern that reached into high latitudes in both hemispheres while also crossing the equator . But such a high latitudinal transition linking with a trans-equatorial air flow , as we saw during June looked a bit odd to me . Now , of course , as we saw , this became highly controversial . I have written about similar patterns during last winter which some studies have associated with a flip in the upper level equatorial wind patterns . But the high amplitude wave west of South America does look a bit large and odd . I want to be careful not to accidentally feed into any misinformation memes and these gray areas can be rife with them . Given the current media environment , only very low ambiguity and high risk events will make the final cut . Investigation revealed a likely foehn wind event . We all keep each other sharp . What I see as one potential result is that Francis appears to be much better regarded in the science . And this makes me smile . Here in the UK there are a few . and I have put some savings into one called Abundance Generation . They invest in commercial type solar , small wind turbines and some biomass projects . 350.org started the global divestment campaign and it keeps making headway . The site I linked to above is a 350.org project , which you probably already knew . Not only do we see how the animals have been impacted , but traditional hunters are losing a key food source . But even worse is a likely issue of northern fisheries loss for places like Greenland , Iceland , Norway , Russia and Canada . Some of these fisheries are the most productive in the world . But with warming , these fish will lose many of their food sources . Once the glaciers start going down and we add more ocean stratification to the mix , the blow to ocean health becomes pretty extraordinary . In so many ways , climate change is bad news for the Arctic . We need to be very clear that we should be working against these changes . To embrace them would be to step faster and faster into a much harsher world . Fearing deletion , academic researchers are backing up U.S. data . Insiders are considering jobs outside government . I like this hotline idea . And I hope that it provides legal advice in the event of harrassment and abuse . In addition , I honestly think agencies should hire a lawyer , an investigative journalist , and a private investigator or have one of each on call for both internal and external abuses . Scientists from the University of Southampton in the UK showed that due to warming temperatures ice is breaking earlier each spring , based on a 14-year period between 2000 and 2013 . Nevertheless , several solar cooling technologies are making their way to market . While off-the-shelf systems for most are still years away , a handful of businesses have already opted for purpose-designed solar cooling systems , which experts hope will convince others to follow their lead . Fix in . And many others had the same habit . As a result , latest posters tended to fill up the list and it ended up being a less helpful notification than I originally intended . That way , there would be more variety in the side-bar . The log-in is for administrators and writers . I wonder how much of that post 2009 bounce was due to the failure of Copenhagen COP15 . Shows all the more how important COP 21 was . Trajectory is more important than generating policy perfection . After the last few weeks of climate depression , this is the best news . Obama is really delivering in his final days . I can think of a number of states that would do well to follow this example . Sort of like Afghanistan stopping its citizens from using opium so it could all be sold to the West in another addiction . Well done . I wonder if the data reflect only oil or oil plus gas . A growing emphasis on gas production , and there are large volumes of it , and much more to come , might change the efficiency comparisons . I worked on Das Island , offshore to Abu Dhabi , but my interests were in concrete in a natural gas liquefaction plant , not hydrocarbons per se . Pipelines on the floor of the Arabian Gulf are like spaghetti . As far as I have been able to determine , this has not yet been achieved . Example : steel was first made using biochar as a source of carbon . But this will not scale to industrial levels of output , for obvious reasons . Therefore , we need to be able to make steel without coal . Or , figure out how to build durable infrastructure without industrial quantities of steel . In any case , steel manufacturing is a vanishingly small portion of overall fossil fuel based carbon emissions . And as the energy chain becomes more renewable , that small portion continues to shrink . When fields are exploited , individual wells follow an exponentially declining production curve . More wells are drilled , until a plateau is reached , and then fewer wells are drilled . Adding all the individual exponentially declining curves and the trapezoidal curve together -LRB- or multiplying them together -RRB- what you get is an overall production curve that peaks and then declines . I wonder if it is possible to be more profitable just by collecting oil from the peak part of the production curve . I worry about the probably massive leakage from Russian natural gas operations adding methane to the atmosphere . Russia may still believe that it will be an overall climate winner benefiting from higher temperatures , too . This whole thing is just terrible . If solar energy can save us from this bad dream , I hope it does so . Perhaps their customers could persuade them to use their natural gas to generate electricity , deep inject the CO2 , and just export the electricity via , for example , high voltage DC power lines . Boycotts of Russian gas and oil might get their attention , or stipulations from their customers that the natural gas be produced without massive leakage , along with international inspections to verify this . Some mechanism to put a price on Russian carbon emissions and then apply that to the prices they get for their gas and oil might persuade them , du n no . I need to look into Russian solar options . They do have a lot of land and a small percentage of it is desert , I think , along the southern border . account . Notify me of new posts via email . This site uses Akismet to reduce spam .
