A group of 10 legal organizations , including the American Civil Liberties Union -LRB- ACLU -RRB- , and lawyers from both states filed an official petition to the the court on Wednesday . There have been mass arrests of DAPL protesters since August , when thousands of protesters set up camps on the Standing Rock reservation . Some people were arrested more than once . Demonstrators are adamant that the vast majority of them were peaceful , fighting for sacred land and safe water . But they will soon appear in court with insufficient legal representation . Petitioners said that 79 attorneys are bogged down with 265 cases . Advertisement As arrests were made , a group called the Water Protector Legal Collective made up of lawyers and volunteers from North Dakota and other parts of the country worked diligently to track down protesters and provide jail and legal support short of actual court representation . Few attorneys licensed in North Dakota have offered to help . Only one , Chad Nodland , is working closely with the collective . While the pipeline is currently on hold , Water Protectors fear conviction .
