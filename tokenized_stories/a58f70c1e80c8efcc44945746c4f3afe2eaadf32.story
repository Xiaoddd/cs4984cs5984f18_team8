The United States Army Corps of Engineers on Tuesday said in a court filing it intends to grant an easement needed to complete the hotly disputed Dakota Access pipeline . The Corps also said it would terminate its plans to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement . This comes after President Donald Trump last month signed a presidential memo that asked the Army to expedite that process and move forward the project . The move is almost certain to spark a legal battle and could lead to clashes at camps near Cannon Ball , North Dakota , where hundreds of protesters are still camped out in opposition to the project . Members of the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes , as well as environmentalists from around the country , have fought the pipeline project on the grounds that it crosses beneath a lake that provides drinking water to Native Americans . They say the route beneath Lake Oahe puts the water source in jeopardy and would destroy sacred land . United States Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy said the best path forward was to explore alternative routes for the pipeline through an environmental review . Dakota Access pipeline route , source : Energy Transfer Partners The Standing Rock Sioux vowed to sue if the Corps suspends the environmental review that Darcy announced . The response from opposition groups on Tuesday was swift . Robert Speer , acting secretary of the Army , on Tuesday said a sufficient amount of available data supported granting the easement request . As a result , the Army would terminate its notice of intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement . The numbers have dwindled to about 300 in recent weeks due to severe winter weather . The Army 's decision comes at a time when consensus among the Sioux and protesters appears to be fraying . Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II last month asked protesters to return home . They say they need to clean up campsites that lie in the floodplain ahead of anticipated high waters in the coming weeks . But in recent days , one camp founder , Ladonna Bravebull Allard , has publicly criticized Archambault . She claims tribal council members , working with the Corps and other tribal and governmnet agencies , attempted to evict her from her private property , where the Sacred Stone camp is located . A number of clashes have broken out between protesters and authorities in recent weeks . The Morton County Sheriff 's Department arrested 76 protesters last week after they set up a new camp on private property . Last month , the department used sponge rubber bullets and other riot control equipment to disperse a group of activists that threw projectiles at officers as authorities prevented them from reaching a pipeline work site . A veterans group called Veterans Stand is making preparations to return to Standing Rock to support the Sioux and protesters . In December , about 4,000 veterans traveled there .
