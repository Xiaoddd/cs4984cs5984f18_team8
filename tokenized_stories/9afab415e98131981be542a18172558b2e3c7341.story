Peaceful assembly is the presence of individuals in a public forum as an expression of opinion . Thus , when , where and how we make our presence known to others is fundamental to the expression of assembly . 2016 was chock-full of protests of every kind around the globe . But we need look no further than the fields of North Dakota for a living example of why freedom of peaceful assembly is regarded as an inalienable human right , and of the obstacles and threats faced by its practitioners , in this case , water protectors . Standing Rock showed us the long odds faced by those who peaceably assemble . It began with ominous walls of armored police and military vehicles . Our social media feeds filled with photos of dogs sicced on peaceful protesters , and of traumatic injuries from rubber bullets , tear gas and the like . New and shocking abuses of power included turning firehoses on a crowd in subfreezing temperatures . The Standing Rock Sioux and their allies held themselves to high standards of peaceful action and prayer and did not provoke law enforcement . They were attacked because they amplified their voices by taking space with a long-term encampment , an increasingly popular mode of assembly in the 21st century . Violence is not the only indignity and human rights violation faced by protesters . Other , more guileful threats awaited them . Take the letter written by Col. John Henderson of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to tribal chairman David Archambault the day after Thanksgiving . The ultimatums from authorities to shut down the camps for reasons of safety and security rang hollow . I hastily wrote a letter to Col. Henderson , and in a few days , over 2,500 people co-signed it . I informed him that not only did the state -LRB- and , yes , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers -RRB- have an obligation to protect the peaceful assembly from intervention ; it was also his duty to provide material support to promote its expression . 2016 has shown us many examples of the worst abuses faced by peaceful assemblies . Media blackouts have strangled demonstrations in China , Ethiopia and Baton Rouge . Outright protest bans smothered the voices of the otherwise voiceless in Zimbabwe and Egypt . Torture , exile , indefinite imprisonment and murder have taken place in many corners of the world including Bahrain and Kazakhstan . The stories are chilling . Yet the year ended with some unexpected successes . Again , in America , we might look to Standing Rock for clues . First , the water protectors have committed themselves to nonviolence to a degree that would make Martin Luther King Jr. proud . By maintaining peace and prayer , they create a foil for all those armored tanks and sound weapons looming over them , confirming them as targets for oppression and bolstering their legitimacy with the broader public . Second , they maintained control of the time , place and manner of their assembly . The Standing Rock Sioux pledged to hold assembly until they are certain the Dakota Access Pipeline will not be built . While past the peak of 11,000 people , the camps stand strong , braving the harsh North Dakota winter . Last , an unaffiliated group sympathetic to their cause joined the fight . In early December , thousands of war veterans came together from around the country to form a human shield around the water protectors . While the message of the water protectors had already been spreading , the message itself changed when it was no longer the specific concern of a specific minority . The mass mobilization of an entirely different subset of the population broadened the concern as an American one , not an Indian one . A 2013 paper by the Initiative for Policy Dialogue determined that 37 percent of protests achieved their social or economic aims . The 21st century is an era of uncertainty . To regain control of civil society , people will have to employ the entire democratic toolbox . We must continue to look to positive examples and successes like Standing Rock for clues to create a prosperous future . Because of the looming administration change in Washington , the rerouting of the pipeline at Standing Rock may be a temporary victory . But the water protectors stand their ground in the biting cold and may continue to do so well past Jan. 20 .
