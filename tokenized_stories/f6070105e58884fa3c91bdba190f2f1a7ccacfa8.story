They braved chilly rain and wintery winds to assemble in support of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe 's legal battle with the builders of the Dakota Access Pipeline . Some carried fistfuls of burning sage that perfumed the air for blocks , others carried flags and signs . Despite the cold , many marchers arrived decked out in vivid regalia , marching side-by-side with activists who 'd showed up with umbrellas and sweatshirts . The Native Nations Rise march capped off a week of indigenous awareness activities in the nation 's capital organized by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , the Indigenous Environmental Network , and the Native Organizers Alliance . This same week , the legal fight to block the Dakota Access pipeline was dealt a blow when a judge denied the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe 's request for an injunction . Those gathered at the march insist that the fight is not over . Starting in front of the offices of the US Army Corps of Engineers , which recently gave a green light to the pipeline , the march paused at the Trump International Hotel , and ended just north of the White House , where chairmen from Yakama Nation and Standing Rock Sioux asked those gathered for unity in raising the voices of indigenous people everywhere . The rain got heavier , and the waiting crowd killed time with drumming and prayer songs . Someone passed out granola bars and fruit . Jody Gaskin , an Ojibwe member , arrived in Washington DC from Sault Ste. Marie , Michigan , on Thursday , and slept in the tipis set up on the national monument . Gaskin said he had been at Standing Rock camp in November and December . Nicholas Budimir and his step-daughter , Gabriel , turned up at the march after noticing the tipis set up at the National Monument grounds . The two were visiting from Grand Rapids , Michigan , to see the National Museum of African American History and Culture . When the group arrived at the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue , a tipi was quickly erected in front of the barricades that were posted in front of the building . Women danced in a circle around the construction , then someone brought out a cardboard cutout that looked like the president . The effigy was hit with sticks . The tipi got dismantled , and the march continued down Pennsylvania Avenue . About half a dozen people helped carry it . Richards said she was there at the march representing The Opportunity Agenda , a social justice communications firm . He noted that several minority groups in the US were beginning to feel marginalized the way Native people have felt for years . Archambault called on the crowd to band together in speaking up for indigenous rights . Submit it here .
