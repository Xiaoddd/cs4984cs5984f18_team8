For no amount of coddling or appeasement of control freaks bent upon subverting and destroying everything that they survey to achieve absolute power and wealth will bring about lasting positive changes that will stop the environmental disaster and absolute tyranny these amoral deviants are intent upon bringing about in their hierarchically organized gulag . That we are incapacitated by morals and decency and unable to reach the heights of ` enlightened ' anti-democratic , anti-environmental , and anti-human thought processes . Gladly , most of us in the general population are not sociopaths with an unquenchable urge to destroy anything that gets in our way . What these monsters see through their soulless eyes are animals easily hitched to their system of infinite pillage . We believe there is a better way to organize our world than between those who have everything and those who have nothing . Comrades , we all know we are on the right side of history , that this current incarnation of capitalist feudalism that uses the majority as labors-slaves and destroys our planet just to enrich a tiny-sliver of self-anointed robber barons is a degenerate and destabilized society that is rapidly failing . Instead of blindly following the edicts coming down from our corporate masters and their lobbyist run governments and condoning the workplace autocracy that leaves us penniless and voiceless we need to fight like free warriors never willing to sell out on our principles . Or maybe you feel more comfortable in an on the ground front-line protest or confrontation with the powerful elitists - like at the Sacred Stone Camp of the water protectors fighting against the Dakota Access Pipeline . However you wish to contribute your time , energy , and intellectual creativity is greatly appreciated for all of us in this vast planetary community are making a difference in transforming our current exploitation riddled society into an egalitarian internationalist community of empowered workers and citizens .
