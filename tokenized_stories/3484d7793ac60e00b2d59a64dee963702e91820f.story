Oil from Statoil shale projects in North Dakota is set to flow through the pipeline if it gets built . DNB , which already has seen its reputation tarnished over everything from the fees it charges to its involvement with tax havens , now faces many questions over its decision to help finance the controversial pipeline project that threatens the Sioux nation . The Dakota Access Pipeline Project is itself owned by eight oil and energy companies including Sunoco Logistics , Phillips 66 and Energy Transfer . The Sioux and many others have held massive demonstrations against the project that police have tried to put down . Several indigenous Sami people from Norway have traveled to the US to take part in the pipeline protests . The Oil Fund has stressed that it has no direct interest stakes in the pipeline project , rather in the companies owning the project . She thinks DNB is heading into an ethical crisis over the pipeline project . DNB spokesman Even Westerveld said the bank understood that such projects can spark concern . Westerveld claimed it is more environmentally friendly to transport oil by pipelines instead of railroads or tanker trucks . He said DNB has been in touch with its borrowers over the past six weeks and posed many questions about the social and environmental aspects of the pipeline .
