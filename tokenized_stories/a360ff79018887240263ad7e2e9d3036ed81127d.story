Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made the announcement at the start of a previously unscheduled media briefing at the White House . It should gravely worry all Americans , including intelligence professionals , about the cost of speaking out . My principles are worth far more than clearances . This action is part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to suppress freedom of speech & punish critics . It should gravely worry all Americans , including intelligence professionals , about the cost of speaking out . My principles are worth far more than clearances . I will not relent . Yet the threat by Trump , even if largely symbolic , spoke to his willingness to use the powers of the presidency to punish his critics . The maneuver drew immediate criticism in both parties , though congressional Republicans are unlikely to challenge the president .

Seems like you will never understand what it means to be president , nor what it takes to be a good , decent , & honest person . National security experts and government veterans from both parties have been among the most vociferous Trump critics , with the Republicans among them forming the backbone of the so-called Never Trump movement . The Republican-controlled Congress is unlikely to rebuke Trump for the action , though members from both parties had warned Trump against it . 1:50 p.m. : This article was updated with additional reporting and reactions from Brennan , Hayden and Schake .
