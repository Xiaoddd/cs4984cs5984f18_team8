Please try again later . Love for all people , all living things , Mother Earth herself , and concern for future generations . I felt what this world needs at this time , Unity beyond race , concern for one another , and togetherness . I felt peace and calm . Then when the police came I felt the opposite , I felt lies , setups , and oppression , but I 'm trying not to dwell on the negative . My only wishes with this video is that it helps in some way . Was n't sure how to help so I just started filming lol . When I was at camp I got the feeling that this is the beginning of something new , something that excited me and woke me up , learning a new way to fight injustice , something bigger then what I thought it was , and its beautiful . The energy , courage , and unity I felt at camp is inspirational . If anyone seeing this goes to Standing Rock , I would encourage you to be humble , sit by the microphone where they talk and feed , and listen to the leadership teach good things . Its a beautiful happening , do n't go to lead , go to help ... Peace love and prayers to all including the police , sheriff , gov , and ETP , maybe they will have a change of heart .
