The danger may look different than the threat of an oil pipeline snaking through the land and contaminating the water supply . But the negative effects of the persistent lack of access to reproductive health care , to safe maternal care , and to contraception for Native women are just as real . In October 2016 , the first baby was born at one of the unified collection of camps set up by Native people with the common goal of protecting the water from the Dakota Access Pipeline . The news was shared online by a group of Indigenous midwives who were at the camp . Zintkala Mahpiya Wi Blackowl gave birth to a baby girl while at the Standing Rock camp . According to Indian Country Today , the decision to have her baby at the water protector camps where people were actively opposing the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- was a conscious one : Having babies is my act of resistance ; our reproductive rights as Native women have been taken away from us in so many ways . At one time , we were forcibly sterilized ; assimilation has come down really hard on us . In a blog post for Our Bodies Ourselves , Kathryn Krase explains more , In many Native American cultures children are important for tribal survival . Native women have suffered a history of horrific discrimination at the hands of white people , especially when it comes to their reproductive health and rights , including forced sterilization . The weight of trauma carried in the bodies of Native women , passed down through generations , is heavy . And it continues . High rates of poverty and adolescent pregnancy contribute to an environment that does not support their bodily autonomy . For these reasons , access to reproductive health care , including contraception and abortion services , is critical . Unfortunately , IHS is chronically underfunded . American Indians and Alaska Natives who rely solely on IHS for care often lack access to needed care , including preventive care and early treatment of chronic diseases , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation . Access to over-the-counter contraception has been a struggle . In 2013 , two years after emergency contraception became available over-the-counter to most women in the United States and relentless advocacy on the part of reproductive justice organizations , IHS finally mandated its own facilities to provide access to Plan B. Geographic isolation also contributes to challenges in accessing care . The Hyde Amendment , a federal regulation which bars the government from using funds to pay for abortion care except in cases of rape , incest , or if the health of the mother is in danger , means Native American women who depend on IHS for their health care face many barriers to accessing safe and legal abortion care . It is only since Native cultures were colonized by white people that traditional healing practices , particularly those led by women for women , become marginalized . The women and men at Standing Rock put their lives on the line to protect the water and the land from further destruction by a white culture determined , it seems , to wipe out indigenous ways , beliefs , and lives . They succeeded in this hard-fought battle to keep a piece of the earth safe , for now . Find out what the battles are and how you can support them , because they are doing it for all of us , for all future generations , for all the babies to come . This news is inspiring .
