MK3 grenade From Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Illustration of an MK3A2 grenade The MK3 offensive hand grenade is a cylindrical concussion grenade designed to produce casualties during close combat while minimizing danger to friendly personnel exposed in the open owing to minimal fragmentation . There is a secondary fragmentation hazard though from rocks , gravel , wood splinters , glass , etc. . The grenade is also used for concussion effects in enclosed areas , for blasting , or for demolition tasks . The shock waves -LRB- overpressure -RRB- produced by this grenade when used in enclosed areas are greater than those produced by the fragmentation grenade . It is , therefore , very effective against enemy soldiers located in bunkers , buildings , and fortified areas . The first version was created in March , 1918 . It was designed to be used during trench assaults to knock out bunkers and clear trenches without producing fragmentation that could injure the user or friendly forces nearby . There are three variants : the basic MK3 , the MK3A1 , and the MK3A2 . They differ in their construction and the type of fuse used . They were designated Mk III -LRB- Roman numbers -RRB- prior to 2 April 1945 . The top has a raised fuze well that was threaded for a fuze assembly . It used the reliable Mk.II fuze , which used a Mills-bomb style striker but with a straight lever . It was replaced by the MK3A1 . It can be identified by its black body with yellow markings . The top had a threaded fuze well in the center . It originally used the M6A1 fuse , which had a four to five second delay . It was upgraded to the M6A2 , and then the M6A3 fuze sometime in the early 1940s and the M6A4D fuze in 1944 . It differs from the MK3 in having a fuze well that is flush with the surface of the top cap . The grenades weighed 0.69 lbs . The MK3 , like all TNT-filled grenades and bombs , were shipped without their fuzes as a safety measure . They were packed in cardboard storage tubes in crates of 24 or 50 . Fuzes were shipped separately in boxes containing 25 fuzes . The top had a fuze well directly threaded in its center . It originally used the M6A4D fuze , which had a four to five second delay . It contained an 8 oz . TNT charge . It can be identified by its cylinder , which is in two halves and is secured in the middle with a wide black band . The grenades weighed 0.96 lbs . They came packed in storage tubes in crates of 30 grenades . Weapons of the Navy SEALs , Berkley Publishing Group , New York -LRB- 2004 -RRB- .
