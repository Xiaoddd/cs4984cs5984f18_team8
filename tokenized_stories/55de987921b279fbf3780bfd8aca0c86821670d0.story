Thirty miles south of Bismarck , where eroded buttes rise from grassland and corn fields , the Oceti Sakowin camp appears along the winding girth of the Missouri River . Here , a story of protection , protest and cultural conflict unfolds against the desolate prairie . At the juncture of the Missouri River and Fort Yates , along the northeastern edge of the Lakota Sioux Standing Rock Reservation , the project slowly churns its way toward a hotly disputed patch of land . Several hundred yards north of the camp , a lone bridge has come to define the front line of this conflict . A concrete barrier topped with barbed wire and decorated with vulgar graffiti exemplifies the air of tension . SPONSORED The stand-off has given way to violence and threats of violence , here and well beyond the borders of the Standing Rock Reservation . While law enforcement and the water protectors engage in a guarded choreography , fear strikes in the vulnerable hamlets that dot the plains . Across the prairie , the pipeline dispute has resurrected age-old enmity between the native peoples and those they perceive to have permanently occupied the territory of native birthright . Normally , by mid-November the ground here would be frozen with knee-deep drifts of Midwest snow . Today , however , the temperature will rise into the mid-60s with almost balmy comfort . His authority is confirmed by the company he keeps with the core leaders of the action . Ken is an imposing figure . Versed in the complex history of Sioux land disputes , Ken explains the intricacies of treaties , land grabsand the exceptions within exceptions that have chipped away at the territory of the Sioux Nation for over 150 years . At best , the state of ownership and land rights is nothing short of confused . The aroma of wood fires and beef stewing in cast iron kettles fills the air . The setting sun casts a shadowy skyline of tents , tepees and converted buses , all gathered to push back at the slow , oncoming creep of the pipeline . The camp ebbs and flows in population , retaining about 6,000 inhabitants , and pushing hundreds of yards to the swampy tributaries flowing into the Missouri . In the process , the excavation will cut through burial grounds . Distrust of the project has intensified over allegations that non-Indian archaeologists from the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Office have been exclusively charged with identifying native graves . On these two issues , there is an odd chorus of consensus bridging what is otherwise a de facto apartheid in this small corner of the world . On and off the reservation , the welfare of the Missouri River provokes ready conversation . Her youthful face softens as her distrust of me thaws . Look at this . On the other hand , the irony of their sensitivity to a distasteful prank , and the simultaneous indifference to the impact on Native American burial grounds , is inescapable . Here , the contempt for Native Americans is palpable and ubiquitous . As much as there is division between races , there is also dissent within . Working on a theme of forgiveness , love and peace , the group prayed for a cleansing of what they claim are the hatred and offenses of both sides of the conflict that occurred in the preceding weeks . Those actions led to the arrest and detention of Lakota Sioux who continued to languish in the Morton County Correctional Center in Mandan . In silence , the demonstrators encircled the jail and courthouse and pleaded for the release of their brethren . It was a display of the diverse beliefs and tactics emerging from the reservation ; the hawks and the doves form a division so easily overlooked on the erroneous assumption of a monolithic Lakota Sioux culture and a unified stance in the face of adversity . It is a clean and orderly establishment constructed as a lodge , and decorated with taxidermied wildlife . The place is awash in camos and blaze orange as hunters gather for lunch . I take a seat alongside a regular who eyes me with suspicion . Lori , the barmaid , senses my apprehension and relaxes the atmosphere with some easy talk . I oblige and the conversation soon deepens . Before long , she voices concern about threats to local farmers , the killing of livestock and a plethora of fires and vandalism alleged to have been perpetrated by Indians . According to Lori , the acts are the product of a native reawakening of land rights and a history of intrusion . These and other conversations reveal that , while there is agreement as to issues between those on and off the reservation , opinions are very much in cadence with peer allegiances and along the cultural divide . The dialogue of race is different here . In contrast to the low rumble of urban settings , race-based hatred in rural North Dakota is immediately explosive . The conversations with non-Indians are rife with animus toward Indians and outsiders . Likewise , the indigenous population , on and off the reservation , offers little more warmth . The culture is understandably steeped in historic distrust . Back at the camp , three young people bide their time waiting for a march to the front lines . Today , the Standing Rock Youth Council will take an offering to those manning the SWAT vehicles . They are steadfast in support of the water protection action . Today , they will push to the front lines in peaceful offering to the men bearing arms and armor just beyond the barbed wire . I am confronted by the stoicism of two visiting tribal members from Michigan , and of Maria , a young woman affiliated with several North Dakota tribes . Maria is correct . While tear gas and rubber bullets have been unleashed in the course of the DAPL conflict , the people of Standing Rock show no interest in having their actions seen as being at war with the outside world . I find myself having to fight my way through throngs of posers and protesters to get to the core Native American water protectors who are truly sincere in their actions . Likewise , within the Indian community , as in any community , I discover a great variance of identity and adherence to the mores of Indian culture . I jokingly assure that they will be portrayed in the most stereotypical manner possible . They get the humor . We all get it ; the revelation of the Native American as a diverse culture with all of the beauty , humor , internal conflict and struggle for identity as any other . Tension builds as the time to march draws near . Dozens of water protectors assemble across the bridge from the barricade . Members of the SWAT team can be seen readying themselves in the distance . The bridge is disputed territory . Leaders from the Youth Council cradle a sacred pipe and carry an offering of the life-giving water that is threatened by the DAPL . In silence , dozens march on toward the front line . Within yards of the barricade , the council motions for all marchers to be seated . People pray . Some look woefully onward , expecting plumes of tear gas . Cameras click away over the crowd . Among this throng , a young woman carries an infant wrapped in a thick wool blanket . The group is completely vulnerable . I glance over the edge of the bridge and quickly calculate a two-story drop to the freezing water of unknown depth . If things went as they have before , pandemonium could break out with any incoming projectiles . The leaders of the Youth Council disappear behind the burned-out trucks . A number of heavily armored police and military appear from behind the barricade to take stock of the crowd . They peer from behind dark goggles beneath Kevlar helmets , adorned in heavy flak vests , with weapons slung at the ready . The moments linger . Finally , the Youth Council members emerge . They slowly walk to the crowd and command that everyone rise and move forward . In unified mass movement , the marchers close another 10 yards toward the barricade and the tension heightens . The council leaders sternly motion directions and , again , everyone is seated . A murmur spreads across the crowd . His words are slow and punctuated with the tension of the moment . After a long pause , a Lakota woman seated before me raises a rattle in the air and shakes it with a cry of approval . One by one , hands rise and a cheer of praise breaks the quiet . In modest triumph , the marchers make their way back across the bridge in humble silence and with a renewed hope . In the distance , the machines churn on .
