Tseleil-Waututh tribal member Ed Thomas , left and Rueben George on a skiff in Burrard Inlet next to the Kinder Morgan tank farm talking about oil spills and increased tanker traffic if the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion is built . Expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline in Canada , which would triple the amount of oil transported from the Alberta tar-sands fields to a Vancouver-area port , faces opposition on both sides of the border , and multiple lawsuits . Spur line connects to Washington refineries . Source : Kinder Morgan Inc. . Approval is not a slam dunk , said Gurpal Dosanjh , a refining analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence in New York . About the DAPL protest The Trump administration has advanced the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipeline projects . And here 's what we 're reading related to the controversy . March 28 : What the completed Dakota Access pipeline means for key players . Feb. 22 : Preparing to leave , Standing Rock protesters ceremonially burn camp . Feb. 1 : Hundreds rally as the Seattle City Council considers divesting from Wells Fargo because of its role as a Dakota Access Pipeline lender . The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says it will push back . Even it if is approved , Kinder Morgan could have a long slog ahead . The project is opposed by the mayors of Vancouver , Victoria and Burnaby , as well as many First Nations , and already faces multiple lawsuits . Major environmental groups , including Greenpeace Canada , Sierra Club BC and Raincoast Conservation , also oppose the project . The company notes that pipelines are safer and cheaper than shipping oil by rail . In Canada , the pipeline has the support of the federal government . That has Canada all the hungrier to move oil to other export markets on the Pacific Rim , Klassen said . Concerns about spills and stoking global warming by increased use of fossil fuels have native nations and environmental groups on both sides of the border fighting the project . They are drafting momentum from the recent defeat by Washington tribes of a major coal-export terminal at Cherry Point , and the fierce resistance led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota that has bedeviled the Dakota Access oil pipeline . Cam Fenton , Canada communications Manager for 350.org , an environmental group focused on climate change , says his organization is preparing for large-scale mass civil disobedience . In Longview , Millennium Bulk Terminals has proposed the largest coal-export facility anywhere in North America . In Vancouver , Tesoro-Savage has proposed an oil-by-rail transfer facility with the capacity to move an average of 360,000 barrels of oil every day . The Westway oil-by-rail expansion in Grays Harbor , home to key bird habitat on the Pacific flyway , and a treaty-protected tribal fisheries , is opposed by environmentalists and the Quinault Indian Nation . Oil to both the Tesoro-Savage and the Westway terminals would be transported in rail cars , which have been involved in accidents and spills , most recently in Mosier , Ore. . Kinder Morgan wants to begin construction on Trans Mountain in 2017 and finish by 2019 . We have committed shippers with long-term contracts for 15 to 20 years for space on that pipeline . Visitors to Cates Park look across Burrard Inlet to the Kinder Morgan tank farm . Cates Park was once a summer village site of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation . There have been 82 reported spills since 1961 at pump stations and terminals along the pipeline . The diluted bitumen and other products that would be shipped in the expansion is the same as Kinder Morgan ships from its pipeline today , and would be shipped in the same Aframax tankers that take delivery from the existing pipeline . Beyond the soft handshake and diplomatic demeanor of tribal elders in the homeland of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation , where the pipeline terminates in the east end of the Burrard Inlet in North Vancouver , B.C. , lies a steely resistance . Amy George , in her 70s , helped lead a demonstration of thousands in Vancouver last week against the expansion . What unites this tribal nation with tribes and communities across the border in Washington is concern for the shared ecosystem . Tsleil-Waututh hereditary Chief Sla-holt -LRB- Ernest George Sr. -RRB- , 76 , thinks the Burrard Inlet in North Vancouver , B.C. , has already seen too much industrial development . Under the Trans Mountain project , the dock would be expanded from one berth to three . The number of tanks holding the oil would more than double , and those would hold more than triple the amount of oil . Impacts from the expansion would be experienced far beyond the inlet . The project would bring an additional 350 tankers carrying oil a year to the Salish Sea , marine waters shared by British Columbia and Washington state . Spills could be damaging either from fuel-oil transfers to tankers , or from the diluted bitumen the tankers carry , the department warned in a September 2016 , letter to the Canadian government . The Salish Sea is particularly vulnerable to a big uptick in tanker traffic because of its swift currents , sharp turns required for big ships and rich marine resources . The assessment by the Tsleil-Waututh Nation found their people would bear the brunt of the impacts at the end of the pipeline . Hereditary Chief Sla-holt -LRB- Ernest George Sr. -RRB- , 76 , reminds a visitor his people have been here some 13,000 years , or , as they say here , since time out of mind . He and his neighbors think this stretch of water has already seen too much industrial development . Ed Thomas , 64 , says efforts to clean up the inlet have just recently enabled the band to hold its first clam harvest in 30 years . Elk are coming back to the woods . So are cougar and bear , and the salmon in nearby Indian Creek . View Comments No personal attacks or insults , no hate speech , no profanity .
