On Wednesday , the Santa Monica City Council voted to sever ties with Wells Fargo because the financial services company helps fund the controversial Dakota Access pipeline . Many of the speakers had been to the much-publicized protests in North Dakota , where they objected to the project because they say it stretches onto sacred native land and creates water and other environmental safety issues . According to local news site Santa Monica Next , the council voted 5-0 to support the divestiture measure , although two council members were not present for the vote . Santa Monica joined cities such as Seattle and Davis , Calif. , which also have voted to pull investments from Wells Fargo due to its ties to the North Dakota oil pipeline . In addition , Santa Monica has passed local measures on a wide range of progressive issues in the face of Trump administration moves . For instance , one day after the divestiture vote , the Santa Monica City Council approved drafting legislation to protect residents from having to give sensitive information to employers and landlords .
