That so many veterans mobilized in less than two weeks to rural North Dakota speaks to the power they may have on public opinion , because of their status as having put their lives on the line for their country , veterans and academics said . Many veterans who went to Cannon Ball , North Dakota , to join the months-long protests by Native Americans and environmentalists against the 1,172-mile Dakota Access Pipeline , said they were already looking for their next issue to support . Law enforcement tactics , particularly the use of water cannons , against the protesters had been considered extreme by some . Veterans said in interviews they felt galvanized to act as a human shield , providing a respite for those who had been at the protest camp for months . The pipeline owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP , is routed adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux 's reservation . The veterans at Standing Rock were led by former Marine Michael Wood Jr and Army veteran Wes Clark Jr , son of retired U.S. general Wesley Clark , former commander of NATO . But the saga will not end there . Republican President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants the pipeline built ; his team said he would review the decision when he takes office . Even though the fight is not over in North Dakota , some see this as a way forward on other issues . Flint -LRB- Michigan -RRB- has a water crisis . Clark 's group , called Veterans Stand With Standing Rock -LRB- VSSR -RRB- , asked for 2,000 volunteers but said twice as many arrived . Comments on the VSSR Facebook page criticized Clark for a lack of planning and for not having contingencies in place for North Dakota 's harsh winters . As a blizzard blew in on Monday , many hunkered down at the main protest camp . Hundreds more slept in the pavilion of the Prairie Knights Casino in Fort Yates , roughly 10 miles away on the Standing Rock reservation . Asking forgiveness As part of their journey to North Dakota , many veterans asked forgiveness in two ceremonies for what they considered crimes and mistreatment of Native Americans by the U.S. government and military over the past 150 years . One ceremony took place Monday on Backwater Bridge near the camp , the site of two heated confrontations with law enforcement earlier this fall . Thousands of veterans and tribal members prayed , emoting war cries on the bridge 's southern cusp . One veteran , wearing a flak jacket and a Veterans for Peace flag , yelled to the crowd from atop a horse . Some veterans said they planned to remain in North Dakota , unwilling to trust that Energy Transfer Partners would abide by the federal government 's decision . Most had left by Wednesday , however , said Heather O'Malley , a U.S. Army veteran who monitored news for the group . She said it was unclear if they would return to the area in January if needed . Clark and others said this was a way for veterans to address other efforts around the country .
