Listen to the PBS NewsHour podcast . Leave a respectful comment . The Sioux have filed a lawsuit in hopes of rerouting the pipeline , which they argue would damage sacred sites and their main water supply . The proposed route runs less than a mile from their reservation boundary . The Sioux published the audio file last month after Kelcy Warren , CEO of Energy Transfer Partners , the corporation behind the pipeline , made the remarks in a Wall Street Journal interview . The meeting , between representatives from the Standing Rock Sioux and Chuck Frey , vice president of Energy Transfer Partners , was held two years before the tribe filed its federal lawsuit to stop the pipeline . Frey said that the company worked to avoid tribal areas when drawing up the pipeline and asked tribal officials for maps of sacred areas and burial grounds , which were not publicly available . Standing Rock Sioux leaders have said they had difficulty meeting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to discuss their concerns , according to The Bismarck Tribune . However , a U.S. District judge ruled in September 2015 that the agency did make attempts to consult the tribe multiple times without response . According to North Dakota Public Service Commission Chairwoman Julie Fedorchak , the tribe did not attend three 2015 public hearings to express their concerns . A surge of celebrities and environmental activists have traveled to North Dakota in recent months to protest the 1,172-mile pipeline that is nearly complete . The Army Corps issued a letter last month ordering protesters to leave by December 5 . The Standing Rock Sioux have said they do not plan to leave and will continue fighting the project .
