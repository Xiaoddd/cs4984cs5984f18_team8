The location has been designated the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site and is administered by the National Park Service . Immigrants flooded across Cheyenne and Arapaho lands . A delegation of Cheyenne , Kiowa , and Arapaho chiefs in Denver , Colorado on September 28 , 1864 . Most bands of the Cheyenne , including the Dog Soldiers , a militaristic band of Cheyenne and Lakota that had originated in the late 1830s , were angry at the chiefs who had signed the treaty . They continued to live and hunt in the bison-rich lands of eastern Colorado and western Kansas , and became increasingly belligerent over the tide of white migration across their lands . Cheyenne who opposed the treaty said it had been signed by a small minority of the chiefs without the consent or approval of the rest of the tribe , that the signatories had not understood what they signed , and that they had been bribed to sign by a large distribution of gifts . The beginning of the American Civil War , in 1861 , led to the organization of military forces in Colorado Territory . In March 1862 , the Colorado volunteers defeated a Confederate Army from Texas in the Battle of Glorieta Pass , New Mexico by destroying their supply wagons , forcing them to retreat . The Confederates returned to Texas , and the First Regiment of Colorado Volunteers returned to Colorado Territory . They were then mounted as a home guard under the command of Colonel John Chivington . Chivington and Colorado territorial governor John Evans adopted a hard line against Indians , whom settlers accused of stealing livestock . On May 16 , 1864 , a detachment under Lieutenant George S. Eayre crossed into Kansas and encountered Cheyenne in their summer buffalo-hunting camp at Big Bushes , near the Smoky Hill River . ... Kill and scalp all , big and little ; nits make lice . Chivington was a Methodist preacher , freemason , and opponent of slavery . Some of the identifications of Natives are uncertain . Front row , kneeling , left to right : Major Edward W.

The Dog Soldiers , who had been responsible for many of the attacks and raids on whites , were not part of this encampment . Most tribal warriors stood their ground , refusing to leave their home under the guise of a threat , leaving only about 75 men , plus all the women and children in the village . The men who remained were mostly too old or too young to hunt . Meanwhile , Chivington and 425 men of the 3rd Colorado Cavalry rode to Fort Lyon arriving on November 28 , 1864 . Once at the Fort , Chivington took command of 250 men of the 1st Colorado Cavalry and maybe as many as 12 men of the 1st Regiment New Mexico Volunteer Infantry then set out for Black Kettle 's encampment . The following morning , Chivington gave the order to attack . However , the rest of Chivington 's men immediately attacked the village . Ignoring the U.S. flag and a white flag that was run up shortly after the attack began , they murdered as many of the Indians as they could . A soldier came up to her with a drawn sabre . She raised her arm to protect herself ; he struck , breaking her arm . She rolled over , and raised her other arm ; he struck , breaking that , and then left her with out killing her . I saw one squaw cut open , with an unborn child lying by her side . The Indians had gone ahead , and this little child was behind , following after them . The little fellow was perfectly naked , travelling in the sand . I saw one man get off his horse at a distance of about seventy-five yards and draw up his rifle and fire . He missed the child . Another man came up and said , ` let me try the son of a b - . He got down off his horse , kneeled down , and fired at the little child , but he missed him . A third man came up , and made a similar remark , and fired , and the little fellow dropped . The body of White Antelope , lying solitarily in the creek bed , was a prime target . His men shot down squaws , and blew the brains out of little innocent children . I tell you what , I do n't like a hostile red skin any more than you do . And when they are hostile , I 've fought 'em , hard as any man . But I never yet drew a bead on a squaw or papoose , and I despise the man who would . Some of the natives cut horses from the camp 's herd and fled up Sand Creek or to a nearby Cheyenne camp on the headwaters of the Smoky Hill River . Others , including trader George Bent , fled upstream and dug holes in the sand beneath the banks of the stream . George Bent , the son of the American William Bent and a Cheyenne mother , who was in the village when the attack came and was wounded by the soldiers , gave two different accounts of the natives ' loss . Before Chivington and his men left the area , they plundered the teepees and took the horses . After the smoke cleared , Chivington 's men came back and killed many of the wounded . They also scalped many of the dead , regardless of whether they were women , children or infants . They also publicly displayed these battle trophies in Denver 's Apollo Theater and area saloons . The Sand Creek Massacre resulted in a heavy loss of life , mostly among Cheyenne and Arapaho women and children . Hardest hit by the massacre were the Wutapai , Black Kettle 's band . Perhaps half of the Hevhaitaniu were lost , including the chiefs Yellow Wolf and Big Man . The Oivimana , led by War Bonnet , lost about half their number . There were heavy losses to the Hisiometanio -LRB- Ridge Men -RRB- under White Antelope . Chief One Eye was also killed , along with many of his band . The Suhtai clan and the Heviqxnipahis clan under chief Sand Hill experienced relatively few losses . After hiding all day above the camp , in holes dug beneath the bank of Sand Creek , the survivors there , many of whom were wounded , moved up the stream and spent the night on the prairie . Trips were made to the site of the camp but very few survivors were found there . After a cold night without shelter , the survivors set out toward the Cheyenne camp on the headwaters of the Smoky Hill River . They soon met up with other survivors who had escaped with part of the horse herd , some returning from the Smoky Hill camp where they had fled during the attack . The massacre disrupted the traditional Cheyenne power structure , because of the deaths of eight members of the Council of Forty-Four . The net effect of the murders and ensuing weakening of the peace faction exacerbated the developing social and political rift . Traditional council chiefs , mature men who sought consensus and looked to the future of their people , and their followers , were opposed by the younger and more militaristic Dog Soldiers . Beginning in the 1830s , the Dog Soldiers had evolved from a Cheyenne military society of that name into a separate band of Cheyenne and Lakota warriors . They took as their territory the area around the headwaters of the Republican and Smoky Hill rivers in southern Nebraska , northern Kansas , and the northeastern Colorado Territory . The events at Sand Creek dealt a fatal blow to the traditional Cheyenne clan system and the authority of its Council of Chiefs . They sought revenge on settlers throughout the Platte valley , including an 1865 attack on what became Fort Caspar , Wyoming . Following the massacre , the survivors reached the camps of the Cheyenne on the Smokey Hill and Republican rivers . The war pipe was smoked and passed from camp to camp among the Sioux , Cheyenne and Arapaho warriors in the area . In January 1865 , they planned and carried out an attack with 1,000 warriors on the stage station and fort , then called Camp Rankin , at present-day Julesburg , Colorado . This was followed by numerous raids along the South Platte both east and west of Julesburg , and a second raid on the town of Julesburg in early February . The associated bands captured much loot and killed many white settlers , including men , women and children . Initially , the Sand Creek engagement was reported as a victory against a brave and numerous foe . Within weeks , however , witnesses and survivors began telling stories of a possible massacre . Wearing the uniform of the United States , which should be the emblem of justice and humanity ; holding the important position of commander of a military district , and therefore having the honor of the government to that extent in his keeping , he deliberately planned and executed a foul and dastardly massacre which would have disgraced the veriest savage among those who were the victims of his cruelty . Having full knowledge of their friendly character , having himself been instrumental to some extent in placing them in their position of fancied security , he took advantage of their in-apprehension and defenceless condition to gratify the worst passions that ever cursed the heart of man . Whatever influence this may have had upon Colonel Chivington , the truth is that he surprised and murdered , in cold blood , the unsuspecting men , women , and children on Sand creek , who had every reason to believe they were under the protection of the United States authorities , and then returned to Denver and boasted of the brave deed he and the men under his command had performed . In conclusion , your committee are of the opinion that for the purpose of vindicating the cause of justice and upholding the honor of the nation , prompt and energetic measures should be at once taken to remove from office those who have thus disgraced the government by whom they are employed , and to punish , as their crimes deserve , those who have been guilty of these brutal and cowardly acts . Statements taken by Major Edward W. Wynkoop and his adjutant substantiated the later accounts of survivors . These statements were filed with his reports and can be found in the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion , copies of which were submitted as evidence in the Joint Committee of the Conduct of the War and in separate hearings conducted by the military in Denver . I heard one man say that he had cut a woman 's private parts out and had them for exhibition on a stick . During these investigations , numerous witnesses came forward with damning testimony , almost all of which was corroborated by other witnesses . One witness , Captain Silas Soule , who had ordered the men under his command not to fire their weapons , was murdered in Denver just weeks after offering his testimony . However , despite the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the Wars ' recommendation , no charges were brought against those who committed the massacre . Chivington was beyond the reach of army justice because he 'd already resigned his commission . The closest thing to a punishment he suffered was the effective end of his political aspirations . In his autobiographical Memories of a Lifetime in the Pike 's Peak Region , Irving Howbert , an 18-year-old cavalryman who was later one of the founders of Colorado Springs , defended Chivington , having claimed instead that the Indian women and children were not attacked , though a few who did not leave the camp were killed once the fighting began . He insisted that the number of warriors in the village was equal to the force of the Colorado cavalry . Chivington , claimed Howbert , was retaliating for Indian attacks on wagon trains and settlements in Colorado and for the torture and the killings of citizens during the preceding three years . It promised the Indians free access to the lands south of the Arkansas River , excluded them from the Arkansas River north to the Platte River , and promised land and cash reparations to the surviving descendants of Sand Creek victims . Later government actions further reduced the size of the reservations . It traces them to their supposed wintering on the Wind River Indian Reservation near Riverton in central Wyoming , where the Arapaho remain today . The trail passes through Cheyenne , Laramie , Casper , and Riverton en route to Ethete in Fremont County on the reservation . In recent years , Arapaho youth have taken to running the length of the trail as endurance tests to bring healing to their nation . Alexa Roberts , superintendent of the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site , has said that the trail represents a living portion of the history of the two tribes . An exhibit about Sand Creek , titled Collision : The Sand Creek Massacre 1860s-Today , opened in 2012 with the new History Colorado Center in Denver . The exhibit immediately drew criticism from members of the Northern Cheyenne tribe . On December 3 , 2014 , Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper formally apologized to descendants of Sand Creek massacre victims gathered in Denver to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the event . ... On behalf of the State of Colorado , I want to apologize . Flight -LRB- 2007 -RRB- by Sherman Alexie depicts a fictionalized version of the event . Archaeological Institute of America .
