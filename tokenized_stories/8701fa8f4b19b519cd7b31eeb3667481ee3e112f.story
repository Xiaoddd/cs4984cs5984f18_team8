Remember Me Magazine Standing Rock : the story of a heroic resistance November 19 , 2016 Environment & Ecology For nearly seven months , indigenous water protectors have been leading a heroic resistance to block the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . The Standing Rock occupation is a movement based on presence . In taking space and time away from Energy Transfer Partners , from the Army Corps of Engineers , from Morton County , from North Dakota , from the United States of America , Standing Rock has come to embody the largest show of resistance in the United States since at least the Ferguson riots of 2014 . A New History The now sprawling encampment of thousands , capturing the attention of millions around the world , had a fairly modest beginning . The Sacred Stone Camp was set up on April 1 by youth of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation as a prayerful vigil to watch for the beginning of construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . The tribe had already been involved in a lawsuit to prevent construction of the pipeline for close to two years . This initial camp is located on the reservation itself , close to the intersection of the Missouri and Cannonball Rivers . The Army Corps of Engineers later altered the route of the river itself in the 1940s , flooding a portion of the reservation , destroying the whirlpool and the sacred stone with them . Throughout the spring and summer , the Sacred Stone Camp served both a site of constant prayer and as launching pad for a series of symbolic actions aimed at preventing the beginning of construction . Many came to Standing Rock with their extended families directly from their annual Sundance ceremonies , so had already been camping out for up to a month before arriving . At this time , the Standing Rock tribe and the Oceti Sakowin also called on other native nations and non-native allies to join the encampment in solidarity . As supporters began flooding into Sacred Stone , the Rosebud Camp was started nearby , also on the reservation but right off of Highway 1806 . It is located off reservation , officially on Army Corps of Engineers land , and thus is an illegal occupation and a direct action in itself . This encampment has become a direct challenge to the numerous treaty violations that have limited the sovereignty of the Lakota people solely to their federally managed reservations . At this point , direct actions became an almost daily occurrence , as water protectors would march the short distance from the Oceti Sakowin Camp to active construction sites and disrupt them . This summer witnessed a number of historic events . The Crows , as well as other indigenous nations who had been historic enemies of the Lakota , arrived in procession to offer peace and join together to fight the pipeline . Soon , close to 300 federally recognized tribes had sent delegations and formally declared solidarity . It was at this point that mounting tensions came to a head , thrusting Standing Rock into the national media spotlight . DAPL began hiring a private security firm to stand guard over the construction sites and prevent disruption . As the long-standing lawsuit finally neared a court decision , the Standing Rock tribe filed documentation of archeological sites , including ancestral burial grounds , that existed along the proposed pipeline route . The next day , September 3 , construction workers bulldozed an ancient burial ground described in those court documents . A group of women tore down the fence surrounding the construction site , and hundreds rushed in to block the bulldozers . As the construction workers retreated , the water protectors were confronted by a private security force . In the ensuing stand-off , water protectors were pepper sprayed , punched , tackled , and bitten by attack dogs . With the images that began to circulate , so eerily reminiscent of both the 1960s Civil Rights Movement as well as the 19th Century Indian Wars , all eyes were now on Standing Rock . In the week that followed , the governor of North Dakota declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard , who began manning a militarized checkpoint on the highway from state capital Bismarck to Standing Rock . A judge finally made a decision on the years-old lawsuit , ruling against an injunction on construction . Hours later , several branches of the Federal Government , including the Army Corps of Engineers , released a statement asking for a temporary , voluntary injunction on construction within 40 miles of the river . A smaller Front Line Camp , known as Sacred Ground Camp , was established along both sides of Highway 1806 at the site of this recent clash , monitoring the construction crews and keeping vigil over the exposed burial sites which would be disturbed by the pipeline . To maintain momentum , the camp has continually innovated their tactics . With construction now taking place much further away from the camp , they began to stage lockdown actions at these now remote locations . Due to their distance , the secrecy involved in planning , and the particular skill set required , these actions were such that only a small , specialized segment of the camp could participate in them . After one resulted in a mass arrest , they quickly lost favor , and there was a lull in action for nearly a fortnight . From late September to late October , these caravan blockades became a nearly daily occurrence . DAPL workers would leave the construction as soon as , if not before , protesters arrived . These protests revolved around ceremonies and prayers involving the planting of sacred corn or willow trees . They were tightly organized affairs , formally led by tribal elders , but with the full participation of the young and the old , men and women alike . The youth would be the first to arrive on the scene and would sometimes damage and spray paint construction equipment , before the elders arrived to command ceremony . As police began to respond in a more militarized way , and mass arrests began to happen again , the caravans began to simply drive slowly by construction sites , causing the workers to leave but without the risk of arrest . Citing the Fort Laramie treaties , the Oceti Sakowin declared eminent domain and occupied a stretch of the pipeline route . The Frontline Camp , located on what was officially DAPL property , was transformed from a small outpost to an encampment of hundreds . Barricades were put up on Highway 1806 , and for nearly a week the eviction of the Frontline Camp seemed imminent . As tensions mounted , water protectors agreed to take down their barricades , but continued to maintain a check point along the highway . In a show of force , they arrived with armed vehicles , an LRAD sound cannon and riot gear . Others locked themselves to a truck . Barricades were erected and set aflame on Highways 1806 and 134 . As the camp was eventually raided , new barricades were set up at the intersection of the two highways and on a bridge further south . In the midst of the chaos , construction equipment and several police vehicles were torched . In the weeks since , dramatic standoffs between water protectors and riot police deploying tear gas and rubber bullets have occurred regularly , as construction moves closer and closer to the river . With the occupation and its surrounding movement , these histories can be opened up to contemporary scrutiny and , more importantly , contestation . The struggles over the sovereignty of this land plays out in one way in the jurisdictional disputes , where you can see various departments of county and state police , the National Guard and private security companies called in to defend the so-called public and private properties being dug up to construct the DAPL . In late-September , Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II even took the issue to Geneva to address the United Nations Human Rights Council about the abuses and violations taking place on treaty lands . These efforts and counter-responses are indicative of the complex nexus of local , state , federal , private and international forces and zones that indigenous peoples have found themselves in when arguing for and defending their sovereignty . While the movement at Standing Rock draws on its own particular lineage and experience of struggle , it shares many of the signposts of recent global uprisings . Infrastructural development has often become both the object and site of struggle ; the encampment and the blockade become primary among an arsenal of possible tactics and responses . The antagonists tend to be defined by being largely superfluous to the needs of capital , but who remain dependent on the market for their own reproduction . The encampment and blockade then create a rupture within the normalized experience of day-to-day life , and the experience of being within the camp becomes a laboratory to experiment with new forms of living together . They were able to present a coherent world within and against the world they opposed . This allowed for traditions of struggle to be passed down through generations , and created a certain moral obligation to participate . It also provided a coherent vision for another kind of life and a world beyond capitalism . The history of the past half-century is the story of the dismantling of the possibility of these worlds . The strength of the Standing Rock Occupation is its ability to simultaneously remember and create its own potential as a community-in-struggle . It is the continued bonds of the Oceti Sakowin and the potency of their worldview that creates the foundation for what we now know as Standing Rock to exist at all , and it this that allows for the consistency , duration and persistence that has kept the occupation going for seven months . The politics demonstrated within the occupation of Standing Rock are not based around decisions but rather commitments . In representative liberal society , decisions are made by few , affect many , and their legitimacy comes with the tacit expectation that their results will be accepted and enacted . Commitments , however , need to be made by everyone . A movement like Standing Rock , centered around duration , depends on the commitment of all those present , across days , weeks , months . This in itself guarantees its communal form : the movement exists as long as those commitments exist , which rely on the spirit of the encampments themselves to bind people together . Unlike a political mobilization , wherein people are simply called upon to act together , in Standing Rock the participants have to live together as well . And not just for some days or even weeks , but now coming on seven months . Those Gathered You can see three categories among the inhabitants of the Standing Rock occupation . At its core are those from the Oceti Sakowin , which includes those directly from what is now the Standing Rock Indian Reservation , as well as the nearby reservations which once made up the Great Sioux Nation , including Cheyenne River , Pine Ridge , Rosebud , Crow Creek , Lower Brule , etc. . For them the specificity of the land itself , its hills , caves , valleys , and rivers are of primary importance , and each carry a specific historical and contemporary meaning and purpose . The Standing Rock occupation , it is said , is the first council-wide gathering of the Oceti Sakowin since the Sioux Wars more than a hundred years ago . A second category of participation and solidarity are the indigenous peoples of Turtle Island , or North America , who have sent delegations and representatives from all over the continent , in what is the largest gathering of native tribes and peoples since colonization . This display of material solidarity and commitment is a focal point of the occupation , with the main boulevard lined with hundreds of flags of tribal nations who have visited . Flags are used throughout the encampments to demarcate space , and give visual representation and tribute to those who are embodying the fabric of this new community . This could develop an ongoing consistency and momentum in its own right , beyond the occupation and this particular pipeline . A third level of participation would be all of the non-native solidarity activists who have traveled to Standing Rock to offer their support . These have typically been those inspired by an opposition to the pipeline out of a concern for the environment , and could include New Agers and hippies to independent media activists to anarchists . More broadly , people have been showing up to Standing Rock from places ranging from the Amazon , the Arctic and Palestine . It has been said that Standing Rock is the largest-ever gathering of native and non-native peoples together for a common cause , which is also one of the factors attributed to the success and longevity of the movement , prioritizing an openness to encounter and solidarity . Mapping the Site Spread out along Highway 1806 are the four separate camps that make up the occupation : Sacred Stone , Rosebud , Oceti Sakowin and Sacred Ground . Oceti Sakowin , the main camp and by far the largest , approximates a small town with a grid of dirt roads , neighborhoods and rudimentary infrastructure . The main thoroughfare leading into the camp from the highway is lined with the flags of the close to three hundred tribal nations that have arrived to show solidarity . At the heart of the camp is its sacred fire , host to a constant procession of ceremonies , dances , performances , speeches and speak-outs , and a massive communal kitchen offering daily meals . The camp now hosts an elementary school , a pirate radio station , an independent media center , a solar-powered station for charging phones and equipment , a voluntary security force organized by the American Indian Movement , a first aid station , tents offering massages , herbal medicine and herbal teas , a lacrosse field , several dozen tents distributing food , camping gear , and clothes , and dozens of portapotties , dumpsters and water tanks . There are around a dozen sweat lodges through the camp , and half a dozen horse stables . There is a horse-based messenger system , and at one point there was a race track set-up . There is a natural birth doula group at the camp that has facilitated at least one birth so far . There is also a minor fleet of motorboats and canoes . The Oceti Sakowin Camp itself is composed of dozens of constituent camps that might constitute a tribal , familial or affinity-based delegation , each built around a communal fire and kitchen . These camps-within-the-camp are autonomous and self-reproducing , and the encampments themselves have come to re-create the bare essences of human settlement . The lines are blurred between them making up a home or a village within the larger encampment : one could read the tents as individual rooms and the campfire a common area in what is essentially a unitary home ; or that the tents themselves are homes , and the campfire becoming a small village square . It has its own fence surrounding it , with its own security , fire pit , supply tents , communal kitchen , daily meals , dining and meeting areas in large army tents , a library , screen-printing lab , sewing machines , and a scout-tent monitoring and mapping the construction . Adjacent to Red Warrior is a Haudenosaunee mini-camp , for Six Nations Confederacy peoples from so-called Quebec , Ontario and New York , with their own fire , meals , supplies , etc. . Nearby is also a Two Spirits Camp . Such mini-camps proliferate throughout Oceti Sakowin and Standing Rock , speaking to the multiplicity within the movement . It is not at all uncommon to see , for example , a mini-camp anchored by a matriarch in her sixties , often with direct experience from the American Indian Movement of the 1970s . This generation , those born in the late 1960s and 70s , are often respected leaders within the movement , while their children , nieces and nephews in their twenties are the active warriors or volunteers on the front-lines of the protests . Then their young children or grandchildren might be seen playing and running around the camps , or now attending the school that was started for those who moved to the camps full-time with their children . This alone would be four generations , and of course within each of these camps are extended families and relations present , tiospaye in Lakota , who often refer to one another respectfully and intimately as sister , cousin , aunt or grandmother . These familial connections are rooted within a broader individual and social understanding of self within a structure of a clan , community and nation . This is to say that within the culture of the Standing Rock Occupation there are sets of relations and obligations outside of the flattening logic of citizenship , which has come to mean an empty equality of individuals lacking broader ties , responsibilities or shared histories . This could be yourself , three generations before and three generations forward . So each decision or action taken by yourself , your tiospaye , or nation should be measured as to how it would relate not just yourself or the present , as in liberal society , but for each of these generations . The Lakota have also spoken often of a prophecy of a black snake , wherein a great snake will come and bring with it incomprehensible destruction . In recent years this was interpreted as the proposed Keystone Pipeline , which was also slated to be built through Oceti Sakowin territory , before a large movement led to Obama rejecting the final phase of its construction in November 2015 . Since then the prophecy has been taken to speak to any number of existing and proposed pipelines , and in August Iyuskin American Horse of Standing Rock wrote in The Guardian : Our elders have told us that if the zuzeca sape , the black snake , comes across our land , our world will end . We are protectors . We are peacefully defending our land and our ways of life . We are standing together in prayer , and fighting for what is right . We are making history here . We invite you to stand with us in defiance of the black snake . Vic Camp , an Oglala Lakota from Pine Ridge and one of the leaders of the protests , explained the difference between living in a tipi and living in a private residence . This makes Standing Rock both prefigurative of a new mode of being , as well as hearkening back to a traditional form-of-life the Lakota maintained living with and among extended families in roving , expanded settlements of tipis prior to colonization . A similar idea was articulated by American Indian Movement co-founder Clyde Bellecourt one night at the main fire of Oceti Sakowin Camp , where he said that being in the camp itself was not simply a gathering of activists and protesters , but was a mode of prayer , and prayer itself was a mode of being . One of the guides for those receiving media accreditation to take photos at Standing Rock is not to film any ceremonies taking place , but this conception of prayer itself challenges the notion that such a thing is so clearly identifiable or recognizable , as any gesture , gathering , conversation could be invoked with such purpose and intentionality as to become imperceptible . As of this writing , construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota is nearly complete , the exception being that which is slated to go under the Missouri River . The encampments and standoffs remain , as the Army Corps of Engineers and President Obama delay both intervention or approval for construction .
