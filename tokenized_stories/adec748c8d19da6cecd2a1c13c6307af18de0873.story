Several dozen demonstrators , the last holdouts from a mass protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline , faced off against riot police on Wednesday as they defied a deadline to end their months-long occupation of an encampment on federal land . State officials said about 10 arrests were made throughout the day . Protesters , mostly Native Americans and environmental activists , have spent months rallying against plans to route the pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation , saying it poses a threat to water resources and sacred tribal sites .

As freezing rain and snow fell , some demonstrators ceremonially burned tents and other structures at the camp in what they said was a tradition before leaving a dwelling place . Others vowed to stay put . About 20 police vehicles waited up the road and a few dozen protesters remained in other parts of the camp , a Reuters witness said . Chase Iron Eyes , a Standing Rock Sioux member , said the arrest of protesters would not dampen their determination . Protesters and law enforcement have clashed multiple times , and hundreds of people have been arrested since demonstrations at the encampment began in August .

Most have drifted since away , as tribal leaders called for a voluntary evacuation of the camp during the harsh winter while they challenged pipeline plans in court . Roughly 300 demonstrators had remained until this week . Law enforcement officials urged people to leave the camp ahead of the deadline , citing hazards posed by spring floods . State authorities agreed to a request by camp leaders that only Native American cleanup crews be used . One activist , HolyElk Lafferty , said she had asked that cleanup not begin until after the camp was cleared . A judge denied a request earlier this month by two tribes seeking to halt pipeline construction . The pipeline will be complete and ready for oil between March 6 and April 1 , according to court documents filed Tuesday . Please read our Commenting Policy first .
