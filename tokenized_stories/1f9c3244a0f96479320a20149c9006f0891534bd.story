Originally meant to be built near Bismarck and travel through North Dakota , South Dakota , Iowa , and Illinois carrying upwards of 570,000 barrels of crude oil a day , the plans were changed when residents protested in fear that a pipeline break might contaminate their municipal water . A pipeline broke in Alabama early this month , killing one person and injuring half a dozen others , and nearby in my own home state of Pennsylvania , 55,000 gallons of gasoline poured into the Susquehanna River after a storm ruptured the line , contaminating water supplies . The Dakota Access Pipeline is planned to cross beneath the Missouri River , threatening drinking water , farmland , and the eco-system at-large . The government , in turn , has largely ignored requests to halt the pipeline , presumably in favor of corporate interests . Our democracy was created as a government for the people , not for corporations . Not only that , but they are blatantly disregarding governmental orders to halt construction of the pipeline until the conflict can be resolved . These protests are not new . In fact , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe have been fighting the pipeline for two years . In 2014 , the tribe attempted to go through the judicial system to prevent the pipeline from being built on their land , but plans for construction moved forward . In April , the Sacred Stone camp was created as a base for protests . The protests have gotten bigger ever since , as DAPL began constructing without proper permits and with disregard to the sacred sites of the Native American tribes . These protests invoke the rights upon which our country was founded ; however , law enforcement in opposition to the protests have become more militarize and increasingly violent . Police have written numbers on the arms of arrestees before holding them in dog kennels in events that are horrifically similar to those during WWII . In October , tribal security apprehended a DAPL worker brandishing an AR-15 looking to incite violence and cause riots . One weekend night , DAPL workers set fire to grassland near the Oceti Sakowin camp . There is video evidence thanks to the courageous water protectors who have been live-streaming the protests on Facebook Live and other social media from the beginning . These videos continuously show unprovoked militarized police in full riot gear becoming increasingly violent against unarmed men , women , children , and elderly who protest in song and prayer . The blockade was originally agreed upon by police , and in a negotiating meeting , it was conceded that it could be removed . However , these water protectors were met with resistance followed by violence . But still they remained resolute and brave , three-hundred water protectors cycling through to the front lines in solidarity . There is no respect for the Native American land . Because we can not stand for this . This is not just a Native American issue . This is what is happening in our country right now , and if we were to allow it , it would set a dangerous precedent for corporations that already yield too much power . This is why we must stand together . For our future , and for future generations . This statement was later redacted and clarified by the Army Corps of Engineers , who stated that there were no plans for a forcible removal , but that those who remained at the camp would be ticketed and denied medical services . What their intentions are and how they will follow through remains to be seen . More detailed information can be found here . Those of us standing with Standing Rock remain grateful to these veterans who continue to defend our freedoms .

Back then , I knew how to live joyfully . distinctly remember sitting on the pink carpeted floor of my childhood bedroom when I was somewhere around twelve years old , cutting out quotes and stories from a magazine about angels , taking the time to absorb the wisdom contained within the passages . I believed in angels then . Buddhists have a beautifully simple concept for this : As within , so without . so long I believed I was meant to suffer . so long I believed I had to experience lack . so long I believed that life was about survival with only small glimpses of joy , mingled with fleeting instances of love . not really . Not with ease . summer has been easier . For years I was pissed at God , so I denied this . also been the most fulfilling . Because I can see how the changes within me are creating changes without me . what we hold onto . People always say this , but I never gave it much thought . Hard work , dedication -- that 's what leads you somewhere . But we did it -- each and every one of us . We persevered and made it here . I know so many of us are probably sighing with relief . 2017 had its challenges , to be certain . even with all these challenges and changes , there were blessings . I made and met so many dear friends this past year -- friends I know without a doubt belong in my soul circle . Old friendships were nurtured , sparking something stronger as new bonds were formed . Family ties were strengthened . despite the hard work and the dedication and the dreaming , I never would have imagined all of this , that I could begin to feel so alive again . It 's been a wild one , but I would n't have it any other way . thing I used to love -- that I felt so much a part of -- I now dreaded , and it broke my heart . I spent more time outside . I walked my dogs . I cut my lawn . I raked my leaves . when I passed forests and fields , instead of seeing something beautiful and magnificent , something that connected me , all I saw was pain . All I saw was illness . my body , its nervous system damaged as it is , ramped that up so that it felt like I was in constant threat . It taunted me . got around that by visiting the beach with my best friend every year . Every spring , we 'd drive to the closest beach and spend a few hours on the sand . Sometimes talking . Sometimes not . I still missed the grass beneath my feet . I still missed the sunshine breaking through the leaves in the canopies in the forests . But slowly , slowly , I 'm working on my physical and spiritual recovery . Slowly , slowly , I 'm starting to see nature as healing again and not this constant threat , something I have to survive , as I 've survived all these years . Anything above that has me feeling flushed and a little bit out of sorts . In this instance , I had a high temperature of 100.8 , which kept me in bed for a few days . the course of the week , I gradually began to feel better again , though I still had a lingering -LRB- albeit lowered -RRB- fever , some fatigue , and a ton of pain . That night , I went out to a late dinner with two of my best friends , one of whom was in town visiting with her boyfriend . We ate a great meal , told stories , and laughed until our stomachs hurt . Then my friend and her boyfriend came back to the house where we hung out and laughed some more . woke up Sunday morning feeling a little funny , but I chalked it up to just being tired and went about my morning routine of taking care of the dogs before heading back to sleep for a while . But then , as the morning lingered on , I found myself growing increasingly worse . got dressed . I did the dishes . I did a load of laundry . But then the pain I was feeling in my abdomen began to grow sharper , and the palpitations in my heart began to grow faster , and I felt the flush rising in my body . I live with brain fog , but this was different . This felt like the world was slowing down , like nothing outside of myself was real , and it was taking all of my effort just to move , like I was wading through quicksand . Everything is a bit of a blur . I remember sitting down in the kitchen . I remember hearing my friend coming in and out of the house and me not wanting him to see me so sick and vulnerable . Nearly six years have passed since I first was diagnosed and began treatment , and I thought the worst of it was behind me . I thought episodes like this were behind me . I never thought I would ever experience something like this again . I remember screaming to myself . In my mind , I could imagine myself doing cartwheels and running , but when we were waiting to be seen in the Emergency Room , my mom had to help me go to the bathroom because at that point , I could barely move . I exchanged glances with my parents . so , with me worried about my brain misfiring , and my mom worried about my heart feeling like it was being squeezed and racing too fast , and the doctor concerned with my abdominal pain , they took vials of blood and an EKG and x-ray , and a CT scan . I prayed for it . parents took me home , fed me some soup , and put me to bed . But this experience has also left its mark . Back when I was first diagnosed , a few months into treatment , we were introduced by my doctor and spent that awful summer sending texts filled with messages of comfort and understanding back and forth between us . She helped me through it then . I felt alone again on Sunday . At least , not like I should , and certainly not like I want to . I remember when JFK , Jr. died . I remember Columbine . I know I poured over every new piece of information like I did those years before . I know because I know myself . I was about to turn eighteen . Time was important back then . Schedules were to be kept , rules to be obeyed . Back then , the news was just a series of soundbites , pieces of gossip to share and make us feel like we were connected to the outside when , in reality , we were tucked in our small , safe pocket of the world . I want to say that we filed into the classroom in relative silence , that my teacher had rolled the TV cart to the front of the room , that we watched the towers fall together . I know I watched the footage , saw the pictures in the newspapers , read the stories , heeded the warnings . You discover that your longings are universal longings , that you 're not lonely and isolated from anyone . But sometimes it has to be enough just to know that there is breath in your lungs and a beating in your heart . I needed to write this story , knowing that the number of Lyme-specific cases keep growing exponentially , knowing that there are so many others , like me , who feel alone in their suffering , abandoned by the medical community , and who are struggling to just be heard . My dreams . My reason for being here . A different story . Because this community is made up of thousands upon thousands of people suffering every day . I did n't expect to make the decision when I did . And it did . I gave my employer a month , and then I said goodbye . While I signed up to supplement my income through a temp agency , I waited to take on any assignments , learning -LRB- the hard way -RRB- that I needed to take the time to separate myself from my last job and whatever work I was going into next . I was so stressed and burned out , caught on the verge of a relapse , that I did n't think I could manage taking care of myself , let alone a new job . As the weeks passed , I felt my soul expand . I was healthy . I was happy . I was doing everything I loved and becoming more me because of it . And it certainly does n't let you get better when you 're ill . We do the job . Which is why I felt so conflicted between genuinely liking -LRB- most of -RRB- the work and the people I was with and feeling a desperate sense of self-preservation and a knowledge that I never belonged there , anyway . That inner conflict led to a sense of selfishness -- other people make sacrifices , other people feel stress and do jobs that are n't fulfilling . I knew I would be taken care of , and I was . I found new sources of income in clients and the bookstore , and I found my way back to health and to myself . For months , just the thought of being in remission fueled me forward -- motivating me further along in my dreams than ever before . I knew what I was working for , and I finally had the energy to get there . I thought , I finally have my life on track as I pursue these dreams . I could mow the lawn or clean my house . I could do the dishes or cook dinner . I could write or visit with my family . I can never do both . There 's no way around it . I know that I got through it before ; I know that I have to do it again . Call it a conscious emergence . I felt disconnected , more confused by my faith than calmed by it . As soon as I was confirmed , and therefore considered old enough to make that decision , I stepped away from the church for good . I wanted the rest of the puzzle . I wanted the big picture . I taped my favorites to my mirror and meticulously glued the rest into a quotes journal . Later , when I was a year or two older and watching daytime television while home sick from school , I discovered Sylvia Browne on the Montel Williams show . I wanted a name for it . I wanted to find myself , to figure out where I belonged . At least , not in any one religion , and certainly not one I could name . Some call it God . Others call it the Supreme Being . Whatever its name , its source is love . Those words resonated with me like nothing else . Honest . Religion was too confining for me , too structured . I began to wonder . It was only in needing to care for him that saved me from myself . Admittedly emotion-based and reflective , my writing has always been a form of expression and self-discovery . Where I never knew where I belonged , suddenly I had a place in the world , and I could feel the connections that tied us all together . I knew what could be . I was pulled towards learning as much as I could about metaphysics and spiritual healing , QHHT specifically . Someday soon , I may be brave enough to share it in full here in this space . Instead , today is about taking that next step on my own personal , spiritual path . It needs real humility and at the same time , an absolute belief in one 's own essential freedom . It is an act of faith . At the last moments , like all great acts , it is pure risk . This is true for me as a human being and as a writer . Dear Heaven , how hard it is to let go - to step into the blue . It 's not an easy feat to write a book , nevermind write one in its entirety in only 30 days . I know my limitations going into it , and while I set the same goal in the beginning of November as every other NaNoWriMo writer , I knew the likelihood of walking away at the end of the month with a completed draft of my next book was slim to none . So , bit by bit , I stopped being so hard on myself . I allowed myself the time to immerse myself in the research . I gave myself permission to take my time and let it grow on its own . That 's who you are . The only thing the mind hears all day is clanging bells and noise and argument , and all it wants is quietude . The only place the mind will ever find peace is inside the silence of the heart . I want to write about how happy I am to have finally launched my business and what it means to be pursuing a passion in guiding writers as they , in turn , pursue their own dreams of sharing their stories . Being in-tune with myself has made me feel connected to the world , and my writing has always been an extension of that . Fear is a crippling , worthless emotion that discourages and transforms you into a lesser version of yourself , and it has no place in the life I want for myself . I knew her family , I knew her friends , I knew her house and street and town because they were my own . I must have been playing outside at the time because all I remember is the grumble of wheels rolling over pavement as they pulled the red wooden wagon closer to my driveway . Though the three of us had all been close , she and I were inseparable . A best friend , I thought I had learned , was a best friend . At ten years old , all I knew was that she was spending less and less time with me and more and more time with the neighbor girl that bordered her own backyard . An understanding , a lesson learned . Forgotten . How far do you want to be from home . For the first time in your young adult life , you feel the weight of time clinging to you . A wink from one of your favorite professors , a nod of encouragement from another . Your name . A handshake . A diploma . As you see your dad snapping pictures and look to the stands to find your family , as you hug friends and pose for pictures , a feeling not-altogether new bubbles up inside of you and makes your eyes shine with emotion . Pride . Gratitude . Purpose . On the plush red bench that wrapped around the length of the cafe , other weary travelers tried to cover themselves up with blankets or coats . I was sleeping on a bench in a cafe in the Charles De Gaulle airport with half a dozen other strangers .

I know my limitations going into it , and while I set the same goal in the beginning of November as every other NaNoWriMo writer , I knew the likelihood of walking away at the end of the month with a completed draft of my next book was slim to none . So , bit by bit , I stopped being so hard on myself . I allowed myself the time to immerse myself in the research . I gave myself permission to take my time and let it grow on its own . That 's who you are . The only thing the mind hears all day is clanging bells and noise and argument , and all it wants is quietude . The only place the mind will ever find peace is inside the silence of the heart . I want to write about how happy I am to have finally launched my business and what it means to be pursuing a passion in guiding writers as they , in turn , pursue their own dreams of sharing their stories . Being in-tune with myself has made me feel connected to the world , and my writing has always been an extension of that . Fear is a crippling , worthless emotion that discourages and transforms you into a lesser version of yourself , and it has no place in the life I want for myself . Originally meant to be built near Bismarck and travel through North Dakota , South Dakota , Iowa , and Illinois carrying upwards of 570,000 barrels of crude oil a day , the plans were changed when residents protested in fear that a pipeline break might contaminate their municipal water . The government , in turn , has largely ignored requests to halt the pipeline , presumably in favor of corporate interests . Our democracy was created as a government for the people , not for corporations . Not only that , but they are blatantly disregarding governmental orders to halt construction of the pipeline until the conflict can be resolved . These protests are not new . In fact , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe have been fighting the pipeline for two years . In 2014 , the tribe attempted to go through the judicial system to prevent the pipeline from being built on their land , but plans for construction moved forward . In April , the Sacred Stone camp was created as a base for protests . Police have written numbers on the arms of arrestees before holding them in dog kennels in events that are horrifically similar to those during WWII . In October , tribal security apprehended a DAPL worker brandishing an AR-15 looking to incite violence and cause riots . There is video evidence thanks to the courageous water protectors who have been live-streaming the protests on Facebook Live and other social media from the beginning . The blockade was originally agreed upon by police , and in a negotiating meeting , it was conceded that it could be removed . But still they remained resolute and brave , three-hundred water protectors cycling through to the front lines in solidarity . The mass media has barely covered this atrocity , and what they did print , they got wrong . There is no respect for the Native American land . Because we can not stand for this . This is not just a Native American issue . This is what is happening in our country right now , and if we were to allow it , it would set a dangerous precedent for corporations that already yield too much power . This is why we must stand together . This statement was later redacted and clarified by the Army Corps of Engineers , who stated that there were no plans for a forcible removal , but that those who remained at the camp would be ticketed and denied medical services . What their intentions are and how they will follow through remains to be seen . Those of us standing with Standing Rock remain grateful to these veterans who continue to defend our freedoms . Awareness is vital . Watch and share the videos and accurate information to help spread the word . With the cold winter looming , water protectors are in need of supplies . Many water protectors have set up Amazon wishlists for things that are needed . Please make sure you fully vet GoFundMe donation campaigns before donating to one , particularly individuals . The government works for the people , and what better way to ensure that right of democracy than making your voice heard to the people who can politically create change . Voice your opposition to the pipeline by calling your representative .

Transfer Partners , the corporation behind the pipeline , is using all of their resources and investments from banks such as Wells Fargo , CitiBank , and Bank of America to push the pipeline forward .
