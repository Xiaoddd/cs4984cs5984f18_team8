Virginia Politics Federal judges in Va. revoke permit for pipeline , saying impact on national forest not fully reviewed Protester Emily Satterwhite locked herself to construction equipment last month in an attempt to block work on the Mountain Valley Pipeline . Environmentalists called the decision a major blow against the 303-mile Mountain Valley Pipeline , which is being built from West Virginia though the rugged terrain of far Southwest Virginia . It will pass through 3.6 miles of the Jefferson National Forest along the West Virginia line in Giles County , tunneling under the Appalachian Trail . Spokeswoman Natalie Cox noted that the ruling left the door open for the federal agencies to redo their permits . The ruling did not appear to affect pipeline work outside the boundaries of the Jefferson National Forest . The judges ordered the agencies to reconsider the permits using proper procedure . The Mountain Valley Pipeline is the smaller of two natural gas projects underway in Virginia . The other , the Atlantic Coast Pipeline , is twice as long and passes through the center of the state , but not through the Jefferson National Forest . Work has been underway on both pipelines since early this year , with trees being cleared along the routes . Earlier this week , the same three-judge panel handed a defeat to pipeline opponents by refusing to disallow the use of eminent domain for the companies to take property along the Mountain Valley Pipeline route . Another court decision earlier this year temporarily halted some work on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline . But several environmental groups said the permits decision could have broader impact . But opponents said Friday they hope the federal court decision will cause a more robust state review of water quality issues raised by pipeline construction . Comments The story must be told .
