It was a stunning display of how wealth allows someone to maintain their arrogance even as he spews little but faulty logic and easily disputable lies . PBS host William Brangham began by asking about concerns that pipeline leaks could contaminate the Sioux 's water supply . The CEO kept returning to the supposedly leak-proof quality of the pipe he was using . When Brangham pointed out that DAPL was originally planned to go through the capital city of Bismarck , North Dakota , but was rerouted because of citizens ' concern of possible leaks damaging the water supply , Warren blamed the decision -- a clear case of environmental racism -- on the Army Corps of Engineers . He cited 200 oil leaks in the last six years , more than any other company , according to Reuters . But there was no concessions in Warren 's response to a question about the pipeline damaging sacred tribal sites . The interview concluded with a question about what would happen once Donald Trump took office . On the November 15 national day of action , around 500 people in Austin gathered for an evening protest at the Texas State Capitol builidng . The demonstration , organized by Austin Environmental Justice , included a range of Texans committed not only to the DAPL movement , but to a fight against the ongoing onslaught against indigenous tribes and natural treasures in Texas by ETP . As speakers pointed out , the route of fracked oil will not end with the pipeline in Illinois . The oil will be loaded onto trucks and travel through multiple ETP pipelines in several states to the Texas coastal refineries , where the air will be polluted and people will be sick . Three export facilities for oil will be built on Padre Island , the last unspoiled beach in the area . Residents in Corpus Christi and other areas in coastal Texas are subject to constant boil-water alerts . After the rally at the Capitol , protesters marched through the dark streets and took over Congress Avenue , carrying banners and signs through the night streets of downtown Austin , stopping briefly at a Wells Fargo and Chase bank , both investors in ETP . Two weeks earlier , a large group protested Kelcy Warren 's conflict of interest in a vote planned for November 3 at a meeting at Texas Parks and Wildlife Headquarters in Austin . No doubt stunned by the intensity of emotions expressed against him in at the meeting , Warren agreed to a meeting with Pete Hefflin of the Society of Native Nations at a later date to discuss desecration of indigenous historical , cultural , burial and sacred sites . The meeting was later cancelled because Warren would only meet in a one-on-one secretive closed-door meeting . There have also been protests against the ecological threat of more oil extraction in West Texas . The company has plans to drill 3,000 wells in the area , and pipelines will be needed . On Sunday , November 20 , protestors against the ETP planned Trans-Pecos and Commanche -LRB- there they go again -RRB- Pipelines in West Texas gathered in the small artist town of Marfa , most famous for the filming of 1956 Texas epic film Giant . Under eminent domain , the lands of ranchers , farmers and Native Americans can be taken and destroyed by oil and gas interests such as ETP for short-term profit until every drop of oil and gas is extracted and unique natural areas such as Balmorhea and Big Bend have been destroyed . Lights from flares and oil rigs in the Permian Basin oil boom are already endangering the dark skies essential to research at the McDonald Observatory in the Davis Mountains of West Texas . Unless we are able to stop then , billionaires will make more billions , while areas sacred to all people will be destroyed .
