Buy Photo From left , Miriam Kashia , Ann Christenson , Georgiane Perret , Aaron Silander , Mary Beth Versgrove pose for a photo along the Iowa River at Lower City Park on Friday , April 14 , 2017 . The site , Kashia said , was about a third of the size of a football field bordered by a chain-link fence . Inside , crews were using boring equipment and other machinery to drill underneath the river . There also were several security guards who were joined by local and state police . Christenson said she and her husband made their way under the fence while other demonstrators lifted it and other protesters climbed the fence . Eventually , the fence was knocked down and several other protesters made their way onto the work site . Perret , 72 , said the goal was to halt the work the crews were doing , but they kept working even after protesters made their way onto the site . Perret , who had been arrested two weeks earlier at a Sept. 17 protest for blocking a service road to the site , said she spent the night of Oct. 1 in jail . She pleaded guilty to the Oct. 1 arrest but has pleaded not guilty to the prior arrest . The hearings now are scheduled for May 22 in Keokuk . The five women will be represented by Iowa City attorney Rockne Cole . Cole said one of the main focuses of the May 22 hearing will be to seek to combine the five cases into one trial . The concerns of his clients are more far-reaching than trespassing , he said , and their hope is to call into question what threats the pipeline poses to nearby communities . Versgrove , 64 , said she and other members of the group have been traveling around the state participating in several protests , marches and public hearings . She said she had been to public hearings in the Keokuk area and talked with residents about their shared concerns . Silander , 67 , said another goal of seeing the cases through to trial is keeping the discussion around the Dakota Access Pipeline despite its completion . Boddicker said a majority of the demonstrators arrested on Oct. 1 pleaded guilty immediately . Their content is produced independently from our newsrooms .
