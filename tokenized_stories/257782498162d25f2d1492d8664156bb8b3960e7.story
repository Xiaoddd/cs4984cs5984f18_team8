Amidst Massive Protests , Army Corps Blocks Dakota Pipeline 0 Comment 04 Dec 2016 Posted by Claire Bernish Loading ... In a complete reversal of the expected , early reports say the Army Corps of Engineers has now denied the easement which would allow Energy Transfer Partners to drill and route the Dakota Access Pipeline under the Missouri River . Instead , the Corps will be undertaking an environmental impact statement to look at possible alternate routes . We wholeheartedly support the decision of the administration and commend with the utmost gratitude the courage it took on the part of President Obama , the Army Corps , the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior to take steps to correct the course of history and to do the right thing . Baldeagle explained the Secretary of the Army gave the decision to Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II earlier today . In fact , on the ground near Cannon Ball , North Dakota , a somewhat subdued mood reigned , as many suspected the Army Corps might simply be acting to defuse an increasingly tense , violent , and controversial situation . Whether or not the refusal to grant the necessary easement will result in effective changes satisfactory to the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes and their supporters will have to be seen in coming days .
