Owl and Poppies , Greeting Card , Eco Friendly Owl and Poppies , Greeting Card , Eco Friendly View all 81 reviews 7 of 81 reviews About Local artist turned wanderer I am a 3rd generation artist and nature child . I travel and wander to stay happy . Nevertheless , photography is the medium that I am most dedicated to . Although I do not limit myself to the subjects I photograph , I enjoy capturing images of animals and nature the most , along with documenting my travel adventures . As long as I can remember , I have had a deep connection with the natural world . When I create a piece of art , the process is both frustrating and therapeutic . At the beginning of a project I have an idea of what I want to express , but it takes a lot of thought and time to create a physical image from what I see in my mind . Once I have the basic layout , the process becomes a way of releasing emotion whether it is excitement , bliss , anger , or anxiety . I emphasize color , pattern , and shape when creating a piece . When the project is finished , I feel a profound sense of fulfillment ; it is like a high without a drug . I use art as a way of healing . Carrying a camera , especially around animals , is like a prescription for me . Taking photographs makes me feel safe and normal in a changing and fast-paced society . In the future , I plan on continuing my global travels along with creating art about social issues , Lyme disease , and dreams . In my shop , you will find handmade art cards and prints .
