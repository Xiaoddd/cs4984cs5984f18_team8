The Cheyenne River Sioux last month made a similar request . Judge James Boasberg last summer ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to further study the pipeline 's impact on tribal interests . The tribes say they 're being left out of the process . The route of the pipeline would pass under the Missouri River , which flows into Lake Oahe - the lake is the primary water source for more than 10,000 Sioux , and they are concerned the pipeline could potentially affect that . Corps attorneys in their most recent status report filed with the court say they 've had difficulties getting needed information from the tribes .

Kiwis were among those who protested the pipeline in 2016 , as security forces fired rubber bullets and tear gas at them .

Diane Moody wants the Employment Court to declare her son Shane Chamberlain is n't capable of employing her . She said she was reluctant to go to court , but she had no choice because it was the only way to change the system so that she and other families caring for their adult disabled children could be paid fairly . Diane Moody , 76 , cares for her profoundly intellectually disabled son in their home , and she 's paid for 21 hours a week at the minimum wage through the Ministry of Health 's Funded Family Care scheme . Under that arrangement her 51-year-old son , who has the mental age of a two-year-old , is deemed to be her employer . To illustrate her son 's lack of comprehension , she said when she raised the prospect of a court case , he asked her what was for dinner . Shane 's advocate , Jane Carrigan said the lack of action since the Court of Appeal case had forced their hand . And nothing in all of our dialogue with the Crown and the Ministry has given us any confidence that anything is going to change . The Employment Court action does n't yet name the Ministry of Health as a party , but Ms Carrigan said that would probably happen when the case began . She said if the ministry was found to be the employer there would be ramifications as family carers were currently paid the minimum wage , rather than the equal pay rate . Mrs Moody first took the case to the Employment Relations Authority , which has referred it up to the Employment Court for a decision . The Authority said the case had implications for the 354 families who were currently receiving funded family care , as well as the other funding arrangements the ministry had for people caring for the severely disabled . It suggested trade unions might want to be involved in the case on the wider policy and employment issues . PSA assistant secretary Kerry Davies said the disabled person who was supposedly the employer had no control over the pay rates , hours or conditions , which were set by the Ministry of Health . Mrs Moody said she would like to see the Health Minister David Clark get involved directly . He 's very welcome to come to my home . He 's not likely to because he never replies to anybody . A date is yet to be set for the hearing . Diane Moody , 76 , cares for her son Shane Chamberlain full-time .
