Block Kavanaugh 's nomination . The problem was that so much was going on in my life that my emotional turmoil constantly prevented me from diving too deep into politics , social awareness , etc. . There was a turning point , though , when I watched a video of Ferguson , Missouri , where the police were driving in tank-like trucks and shooting gas cans at the protesters . This concept that the era of mass incarceration and the war on drugs have created the new version of a law I was taught we defeated , has struck my heart in a way that I really struggle to find the words for . I grew up learning about Jim Crow and how we over-came that nonsense , meanwhile , in the span of my life time , 1995 to present , we have implemented the new form of this nonsense . I talk about this a lot , at least once a day almost , because it is such a major issue being involved in politics , knowing that so many people have lost their right to vote . Today , I was talking with my father about this subject , specifically about how the militarization of the police is a part of The New Jim Crow . Before I get into this , you should know a bit about my father . This means that when you were old enough to work , you got a job . From the earliest age my father had more responsibility than even I do now . After seeing 3 brothers and his father join , he decided that the job security was too good to pass up , and eventually went on to be the youngest to ever make Sergeant , youngest ever Lieutenant , and turned down Captain , but still would have been the youngest . We both did research on this subject and here is everything we found . When the NDAA was passed in 1990 , section 1208 authorized the transfer of military surplus to local police departments due to the reduction in force -LRB- RIF -RRB- of the current military . It also ensured that the final disposition of the equipment was open to the public . The most commonly obtained item from the 1033 program is ammunition . This is what the buying of politicians is , this is what corruption looks like .
