So a kind stranger spoke up for them . The internet is closed . The pipeline would bulldoze sacred sites at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation near Cannon Ball , North Dakota . Even so , the battle to reroute or simply suspend the pipeline is far from over . Nighttime temperatures plummeted even further , but the protestors stayed . They told us that about the Keystone XL and they are telling us that now about Dakota Access , that it is a done deal . Lawsuits against pipelines are underway around the country . Here , two experienced Sierra Club attorneys explain the basics anyone interested in pipeline issues should know . He is now a key attorney working to prevent DAPL . Many people wonder how it can be legal for a pipeline company to seize private property by invoking eminent domain . Public use is the key here . Generally , property owners control their property . That is eminent domain . Of course , it is controversial . Courts have decided to allow the use of eminent domain for power lines , sidewalks , roads , parks , schools and highways , where there is a clear use by the public and communities adjacent to the project . Typically , the pipeline company first seeks to purchase an easement from the landowner , allowing the company to use the property to run their pipeline , while the owner still owns the land and pays taxes on it . If the owner refuses to sell that easement , then the company will sue the landowner and invoke eminent domain to seize the property , often paying below market value . Today , cross-state pipelines can travel thousands of miles , and almost inevitably they will cross private property . Many of these new pipeline projects transport oil or gas destined for the coasts , and from there for export abroad . For instance , with the Keystone XL Pipeline , crude oil was to be piped through the middle of the country down to the Gulf Coast for export to Asian markets . Farmers and ranchers in states like Nebraska and the Dakotas were going to lose their land to a foreign corporation and there was really no demonstrated public need or use . Pipelines are regulated differently , depending on what will be flowing through them . For instance , the Natural Gas Act assigns oversight of gas pipelines to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -LRB- FERC -RRB- , leaving the states relatively little authority over these projects . On the other hand , there is no comparable federal statute governing oil pipelines , meaning the states play a larger role regulating use of eminent domain . Now states are starting to recognize that pipeline companies may try to use eminent domain solely for private gain , and that does not meet the constitutional requirements . There have been several state court rulings recently denying pipeline companies eminent domain power . Landowners brought a lawsuit in Iowa , and Sierra Club has done so as well . Those lawsuits are being consolidated , and there will be a court hearing on December 15 . And though the majority of pipeline leak detection systems are touted as state of the art , the vast majority of the ruptures for both oil and gas are reported by the public . The emergency detection systems are actually weak . Hayes : It was an incredible decision that the Army Corps made after finally listening to the tribe and their allies . The Army Corps did not deny the final easement process . They agreed to an environmental impact assessment and to look at alternative routes . Before pipelines go into the ground to transport gas across state lines , they need certificates from FERC . There is no equivalent for oil pipelines . One agency looks only at water crossings , another looks only at public land crossings , yet another looks only at federally protected species . No public official fully evaluates these massive projects , not at the federal level , nor at the state level . Big monopoly power companies across the country have been buying up pipeline companies because there are tremendous profits to be made . Many of these projects are not necessary . FERC has only denied one gas pipeline in recent memory -LRB- there is no official count -RRB- . But by federal law , FERC is not supposed to allow construction to proceed until the agency fully understands the implications of these projects , which cut across land and water and sensitive ecosystems . People are rightly concerned when pipelines come to their community , because wherever pipelines extend , deadly accidents and explosions have followed . That is stunning . It allows massively destructive projects to go forward based on poorly supported industry assertions . The scale of the pipeline build-out is overwhelming . I work across the East Coast , and Pennsylvania stands out as a place where the pipeline industry is trying to literally quadruple the number of pipelines in that state . The entire fracked-gas infrastructure is huge , with the pipelines , the wells , the power plants . I understand that there are monopoly issues emerging with some of the pipelines . Csank : Yes , we are now seeing serious conflicts of interest concerns raised around gas pipelines and the big monopoly power companies that are backing them . Big monopoly power companies across the country have captive customer bases , and in recent years these companies have been pouring billions of dollars into mergers and acquisitions . They have been buying up pipeline companies because there are tremendous profits to be made . But if they are building the pipelines and buying the gas , essentially shaking hands with themselves at the expense of the ratepayer , there is a conflict of interest . Connect to others and organize . Csank : Connect to others and organize . A lot of Nebraska landowners organized to successfully challenge Keystone XL . Numerous pipelines have been rejected recently . Those include the St. Clair River Pipeline in Michigan ; the Constitution Pipeline from Pennsylvania to New York ; the Northeast Energy Direct Pipeline , which would have crossed several northeastern states ; the Takoma methanol terminal in Washington ; and others . -LRB- See this blog by Lena Moffitt , Director of the Sierra Club 's Dirty Fuels campaign , for more information -RRB- . If enough landowners say no , it can help decrease the likelihood the project will go forward . There are resources available online so you can know your rights . One is here and another here . Csank : As soon as you know a pipeline is headed in your direction , seek legal advice . Build a coalition . Find other landowners who are at risk , and share information . Form collective power . Reach out to other stakeholders , whoever they may be . That could include local businesses , elected officials , environmental and community organizers , waterkeepers and riverkeepers , the local Sierra Club office . Coordinate your efforts . That can be really powerful . Communities Tod Perry Homeless man speaks out after being mocked for shaving on a train .
