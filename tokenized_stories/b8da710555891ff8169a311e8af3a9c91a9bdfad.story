It has been frequently reported that the pipeline , which skirts just north of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation , crosses the Missouri River just upstream from where the tribe draws its drinking water from the Missouri River . If all goes according to plans currently in place , the Fort Yates intake which has been so frequently cited by those opposed to the Dakota Access Pipeline will be shut down by the end of the year . I spoke with Dave Rosencranz , the Dakotas Area manger for the Federal Bureau of Reclamation , and he told me that currently the Standing Rock community is being served by two Missouri River water intakes but that the Fort Yates intake , which is nearest the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing , is slated to be shut down . He told me the Mobridge intake and treatment plant are already operating and serving a part of the Standing Rock community , but will hopefully soon be serving all of it . Back in 2002 serious drought conditions lowered water levels in the Missouri River system to the point where the Fort Yates intake had problems . He said that the Mobridge intake was much deeper than the one Fort Yates and would be more resilient during droughts . Thompson said the Dakota Access Pipeline and the controversy surrounding has not at any time been a factor in this project .
