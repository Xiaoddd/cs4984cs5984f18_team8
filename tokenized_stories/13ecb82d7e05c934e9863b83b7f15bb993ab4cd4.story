Farmer Steve Jensen stated that he smelled the crude oil a few days before his combines were covered in it . It was four times the size of a pipeline that burst in March of 2013 that forced the evacuation of more than 20 homes in Arkansas . Luckily for the general population of North Dakota , however , the pipeline is in a remote corner in the northwest The nearest home is half a mile away , and there have been no water contamination reports . No animals or people have been injured in the spill . Tesoro Logistics released a statement that the affected portion of the pipeline has been shut down . The company is investigating possible causes . Wayde Schafer , a North Dakota spokesman for The Sierra Club , said the spill is an example of the lack of oversight in a state that has exploded with oil development in recent years . Unfortunately for the farmer , his field will be unable to be used now for multiple years . We gather the news and films as we search the web and present them to our viewers .
