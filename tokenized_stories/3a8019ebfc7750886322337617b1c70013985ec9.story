Our prime minister holds forth the fight against climate change as a rationale for the Trans Mountain pipeline and massively increased exports of unprocessed bitumen . The tangled logic is thus : 1 -RRB- a pipeline to tidewater is necessary to win support for a national carbon tax and 2 -RRB- this pipeline will fuel prosperity by accessing export markets hungry for Alberta bitumen . No pipeline is required . There are , of course , political practicalities at play , however there are zero legal or constitutional impediments to Ottawa taxing this planet-threatening pollutant immediately , as Norway did 27 years ago .

The devil as always is in the details , and most importantly how those details play out in the real world . A recent study showed that methane leaks from thousands of well sites in northeast B.C. were 250 per cent higher than estimated by the B.C. government . Methane is 30 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas and these hitherto unknown emissions represent the equivalent of two million extra cars on the road . Hardly . A conservation group partnering with researchers from a Nova Scotia university spent weeks driving remote bush roads sampling well sites for methane leakage misreported by industry and apparently ignored by western regulators . Their findings in turn led to another peer-reviewed study from Carleton University that replicated the troubling results in Alberta using airborne sampling instruments over a 2,500 square kilometre area near Red Deer . If they were , Alberta could collect more public revenue from taxing wasted methane than the province currently collects in bitumen royalties . Pause to re-read that sentence if necessary . Total industry reported methane emissions amounts to some 30 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually . Recent research reveals that number may actually be up to 45 million . Therein lies the credibility problem facing both Trudeau and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley . Federal Environment Commissioner Julie Gelfand and auditors general of nine provinces just co-authored a study showing how every single plan has failed to meet carbon reduction targets . The Rio commitment in 1992 and Kyoto in 2005 have both come and gone . The auditors general were blunt . Another recent assessment from the United Nations is similarly skeptical . Canada is certainly not the only global laggard . A recent report from the UN shows measured levels of atmospheric carbon have never been higher and are rising at a record pace . We know that , as climate change intensifies , the ability of the land and oceans to mop up our carbon emissions will weaken . High-level policy plus long political timelines so far equals very little . Tangible short-term actions would instead hold governments accountable during their elected mandates . Mere inaction would be bad enough . It is far worse when vague climate goals are used to justify ever-increasing carbon extraction .
