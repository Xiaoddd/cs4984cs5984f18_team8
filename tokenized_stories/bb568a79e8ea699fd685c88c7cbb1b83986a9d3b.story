In a letter sent Wednesday , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prohibited Texas-based Rover Pipeline from any new drilling activities until the company complies with new measures and receives authorization . The federal order came as the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and Rover Pipeline officials continue to square off over a series of environmental violations that have piled up since construction on the natural gas distribution project began in February . In all , 18 incidents have been reported in 11 Ohio counties over the past eight weeks , including mud spills from drilling , stormwater pollution and open burning . The Ohio EPA says at least eight incidents violated state law , and many of the rest are under review . Rover Pipeline uses horizontal drilling to install pipelines below waterways , wetlands , culturally sensitive areas , congested neighborhoods and roads to minimize surface disturbance , a spokeswoman said Tuesday in an emailed statement . The federal commission will allow some non-drilling activity to advance . To avoid boreholes from collapsing and prolonging environmental impacts , drilling projects already underway also can continue . In the letter , the federal commission also ordered Rover Pipeline to double the number of environmental inspectors to ensure compliance along the entire pipeline route . Additionally , the commission instructed the company to immediately hire an independent third-party contractor to further analyze all drilling activity at the site where millions of gallons of mud spilled into a wetland near Tuscarawas River in Stark County . Energy Transfer said in an email statement that it is working with the commission and the Ohio EPA to resolve the matter . In an emailed statement Tuesday , Daniel said cleanup efforts were nearly finished and that the company still planned to begin operating the pipeline this year . Even before construction , the pipeline project faced a string of hiccups . The project raced to clear trees before the federally protected Indiana brown bats began roosting and also drew backlash for demolishing a Leesville house that was under consideration for the National Register of Historic Places . As the state agency pursues its enforcement case with the company , state inspectors will continue to assist with monitoring , response and cleanup . she said . Of particular concern is an April spill that blanketed 6.5 acres of a protected wetland adjacent to the Tuscarawas River in northeast Ohio with several million gallons of bentonite . The Ohio EPA disagrees . Ohio already has lost more than 90 percent of its wetlands . Miller has lived in her Sherrodsville home in Carroll County for 18 years . The past three have been a battle to keep the Rover Pipeline from running through her property , she said . Since February , bulldozers and cranes operate on three sides of her property starting at 6:30 a.m. Miller said she and her husband plan to abandon the dream home they spent years building .
