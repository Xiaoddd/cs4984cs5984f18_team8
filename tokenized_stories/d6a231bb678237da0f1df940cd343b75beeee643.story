Jay-Z 's Battle for Clean Water By MARTIN BASHIR Nov. 27 , 2006 0 Shares Email Star 0 Shares Email Not content just to live the life of an ultra-wealthy rap mogul , Jay-Z started searching for something that would allow him to give back to the world . After doing some research he learned that the lack of clean water is a global crisis that blights the lives of millions of people every day . The United Nations estimates that more than 1 billion people do not have access to clean drinking water and more than 2.6 billion live without proper sanitation . In order to see these problems firsthand , Jay-Z approached MTV and invited a crew to follow him during visits to Angola and South Africa . But he wanted to do more than entertain and meet and greet fans . The documentary follows Jay-Z during two visits to Angola , then Durban , South Africa . In the town of Luanda , Angola , he followed 14-year-old Bela , who must fetch and carry 40 pounds of water , twice a day . When he offered to help share the burden and carry the water on a one-half-mile trek , he was taken aback by the sheer strength that was required . It 's not like walking on perfectly paved Fifth Avenue . You 're walking on rocks and it 's a dirt road and the water is moving . I could n't walk to the end of the block holding it . But if he found trekking for clean water a challenge , nothing had prepared him for his next experience in Luanda : the absence of any proper sanitation . Bela and her fellow students must walk across an open sewer on their way to school every day . It runs down the middle of the town 's main road . Not a Playground And as the camera shot widens it reveals market traders selling food on the side of the same road and boys playing basketball -- literally -- in the sewer . At times it 's boiling . And those flies are flying from the water to the meat , to the vegetables , back in the excrement . And back over . The entire sequence clearly has an impact on Jay-Z and is in stark contrast to his lifestyle as one of the world 's most successful rappers . Now almost 37 , Jay-Z admits that it has taken time for him to appreciate the value of his riches . In the next eight months he 's a millionaire . It 's shocking . It 's really shocking . But he also recognizes that his experiences in the ` hood are nothing when compared with the lives of those like Bela . You do n't have to play out in open sewage . 0 Shares Email Star Comments Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you . The show says otherwise .
