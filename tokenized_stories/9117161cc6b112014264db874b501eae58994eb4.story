Law enforcement officials , private security firms and the North Dakota National Guard have used unjustified force to deal with opponents of the Dakota Access pipeline , according to Maina Kiai , the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association . Protesters say they have faced rubber bullets , teargas , mace , compression grenades and bean-bag rounds while expressing concerns over environmental impact and trying to protect burial grounds and other sacred sites of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . The authorities have an obligation to actively protect that right . The Special Rapporteur acknowledged reports that some protests had turned violent , but emphasized that the response had to be strictly proportionate and not affect peaceful protesters . Construction of the pipeline has continued despite a call in September by the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples , Victoria Tauli-Corpuz , and other experts for it to be halted . The 1,172-mile -LRB- 1,890 km -RRB- pipeline , designed to carry crude oil to a refinery near Chicago , is being built by Energy Transfer and the US Army Corps of Engineers . Protesters say several sacred sites of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe have already been bulldozed , and construction work is nearing the Missouri River , which is held sacred . In addition , protesters believe the project poses a significant threat to the quality of the drinking water . He is appointed in his personal capacity as an independent expert by the UN Human Rights Council . As a Special Rapporteur , Mr. Kiai is part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council . They are independent from any government or organization and serve in their individual capacity .
