These types of motorists usually include teen drivers because of their relative lack of experience behind-the-wheel and tendencies to be risk-takers , and people who commute frequently over long distances . Although it makes sense that the less experience a person has operating an automobile , and the more you do drive can statistically increase the likelihood of a motorist becoming involved in an accident , both groups of people have no physical handicaps that would reduce reaction time or result in the person being a potential danger on the public roads . However , elderly drivers often times do have physical limitations in eye-sight , reaction time and overall motor skills , something that could be a recipe for disaster for both the elderly driver and the other motorists sharing the roadways . This is way some people are proposing that the Department of Motor Vehicles require elderly drivers to take written , behind-the-wheel and eyesight tests more frequently than the average motorists in an effort to show they still have the abilities to operate a vehicle safely . GPS Tracking Systems : Giving Elderly Drivers A Choice It is important to recognize that all older or senior drivers are not bad drivers , however it is also important to note that elderly drivers do not usually have the same physical abilities as teen drivers or average drivers . The only thing that some people are calling for is a law that results in a increase in the frequency of testing for elderly drivers to make certain that a senior still has the tools necessary to operate a motor vehicle . The Department of Motor Vehicles -LRB- DMV -RRB- could place seniors into three different categories : 1 -RRB- Driver who meets all safe driving standards to operate a vehicle safely 2 -RRB- Driver meets some safe driving standards to operate a vehicle safely , and therefore should be monitored for 30-60 days via GPS tracking technology to ensure they have the skills to operate a vehicle safely 3 -RRB- Driver does not meet safe driving standards and should have license suspended Drivers who would be required to have a GPS vehicle tracker system installed to their automobile would then be monitored by the DMV to check that safe driving speeds are being adhered too , and that the senior driving is not operating a vehicle more frequently than they should be . The data from the GPS tracking device would be reviewed by the DMV where it would be determined whether the senior either be issued a valid driver 's license or have driving privileges suspended . Many families are now using elderly tracking systems to oversee driving behaviors and habits of senior family members to enhance personal safety . All Rights Reserved . All Rights Reserved .
