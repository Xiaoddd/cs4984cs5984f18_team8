Energy and Environment U.S. blocks major pipeline after 18 leaks and a 2 million gallon spill of drilling mud By Steven Mufson Steven Mufson Reporter covering energy and other financial matters Email Bio Follow May 10 , 2017 A video shows drilling mud discharged into a wetland area along the Tuscarawas River south of the town of Navarre . The affected area is 1,000 feet long and 500 feet wide . -LRB- Ohio EPA -RRB- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has curtailed work on a natural-gas pipeline in Ohio after the owner , Energy Transfer Partners , reported 18 leaks and spilled more than 2 million gallons of drilling materials . The pipeline regulator blocked Energy Transfer Partners , which also built the controversial Dakota Access pipeline , from starting horizontal drilling in eight areas where drilling has not yet begun . In other areas , where the company has already begun horizontal drilling , the FERC said drilling could continue . The FERC also ordered the company to double the number of environmental inspectors and to preserve documents the commission wants to examine as it investigates the spills . A video provided by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency showed drilling mud a foot or two deep . Energy Transfer Partners has asserted that the spills of nontoxic drilling mud , used to cool and lubricate drilling equipment , were inadvertent and had been predicted in its permit application to build the Rover gas pipeline . The horizontal drilling is done to place pipelines well below ground to minimize the chances of contamination of rivers or wetlands . It is just one of many pipelines whose fate lies in the hands of the FERC , a technocratic and relatively obscure agency . The five-member commission has lacked a quorum since early February , putting new permits on hold . That has placed an obstacle in the path of the White House . The Trump administration late Monday nominated two new members for the commission , potentially clearing the way for controversial , multibillion-dollar pipeline and natural-gas export projects like Rover , which was one of the last permits issued in February . The White House picked Neil Chatterjee , energy policy adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -LRB- R-Ky . -RRB- , and Robert F. Powelson , a member of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission since 2008 . The nominees , who must be confirmed by the Senate , would probably tilt the balance of the commission toward approving gas projects . The Jordan Cove project was the only major LNG project the FERC has rejected . And the commission does not have jurisdiction over oil pipelines . Nonetheless , leading Republicans and oil and gas industry groups have applauded the nominations . Height Securities said in a note to investors Tuesday that it would take about six weeks or more for the two nominees to be confirmed . That could change once there is a new chairman . Height Securities said that the White House is expected to name Kevin McIntyre , co-head of the energy practice of the Cleveland-based law firm Jones Day , to serve as FERC chairman , further cementing the position of industry supporters . Height said that the list of pipelines delayed by the lack of a FERC quorum includes the Nexus crossing Ohio , PennEast serving Pennsylvania and New Jersey , and Mountain Valley , serving West Virginia and Virginia . A native of Lexington , Ky. , Chatterjee has played a role in the passage of major energy , highway and farm legislation . Before working for McConnell , he worked in government relations for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and as an aide to then-House Republican Conference Chairwoman Deborah Pryce of Ohio . Powelson was first nominated to the Pennsylvania PUC by Gov. Edward G. Rendell -LRB- D -RRB- and appointed chairman by Gov. Tom Corbett -LRB- R -RRB- in 2011 . Powelson serves as the president of National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners . Since joining The Washington Post in 1989 , he has covered economic policy , China , U.S. diplomacy , energy and the White House . Earlier he worked for The Wall Street Journal in New York , London and Johannesburg . Follow The story must be told . Your subscription supports journalism that matters .
