McKenna is trying to champion a ` reasonable ' political middle ground between ` protestors ' on the one hand and industry on the other , advocating that the environment and economy go hand in hand . This was on full display in her recent interview with CBC 's Sunday Edition . The Kinder Morgan pipeline -LRB- read : economy -RRB- is to go hand in hand with the national climate plan -LRB- read : environment -RRB- . It 's a bit of a shell game , really . That may not sound alarming at first , but let 's unpack it . This means the tar sands would be 30 per cent of the allowance -LRB- or carbon budget -RRB- of climate pollution for the entire country , for every sector . From the climate pollution of other industries , to driving cars and trucks to the agriculture sector -- everything . To put this in perspective , our 2030 target is reducing climate pollution by to 517 MT. This was explained by McKenna as due to anticipated emissions from the oil and gas industry and demographic growth . I agree with Keith that , given there is unlikely to be dramatic changes in demographics over the last two years , this is primarily due to the oil and gas sector . The tar sands are a driving force of Canada oil and gas sector and the fastest growing source of climate pollution . Pipeline approvals that facilitate expansion are absolutely an important factor here . The federal plan also relies on 53 MT of climate pollution reductions outside of Canada , in California , as part of the Western Climate Initiative that BC , Ontario and Quebec are part of . Frankly , I feel far from reassured when considering the history of promises versus climate action on the part of successive federal Liberal and Conservative governments . Suggesting that new oil pipelines can help pay for the transition off of fossil fuels -LRB- a statement made by McKenna , Carr and Trudeau -RRB- is akin to an all poutine diet to lose weight . This should be common sense . This is where international efforts on climate change fall short , including the Paris climate agreement . This has allowed oil exporters like Canada off the hook . The significant pollution associated with combusting the oil from the tar sands becomes the importer 's responsibility , for example . Canada extracts far more oil than it burns , around twice as much . At the front lines of opposition to the approval of the Kinder Morgan pipeline are Indigenous nations and leaders asserting their fundamental rights to protect their land and water with growing grassroots resistance and before the Federal Court of Appeals . There are very legitimate concerns around the threat of a large diluted bitumen spill in waterways or the Burrard Inlet . There are criticisms of the unfair and insufficient process that approved the pipeline under the National Energy Board that persist despite the interim measures brought in by the federal Liberals . While the Kinder Morgan pipeline 's contribution to climate change is certainly not the only reason the project is being fought , it remains a critical one . Thankfully those involved in opposition are seeing past the political maneuvering and are recognizing that a pipeline with a typical lifespan of at least 40 years is inconsistent with meaningful climate action . rabble is reader-supported journalism . fossil fuels Climate Change tarsands kinder morgan pipeline Catherine McKenna Thank you for reading this story ...
