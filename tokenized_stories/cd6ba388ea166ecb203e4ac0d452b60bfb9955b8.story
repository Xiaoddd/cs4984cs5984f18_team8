The tribes submitted a joint status report on Wednesday that hailed the decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to deny an easement for the final portion of the Dakota Access Pipeline . Without the easement , the wealthy backers of the project ca n't drill under the Missouri River at Lake Oahe in North Dakota . But with Dakota Access insisting on a legal right to finish the costly project , the tribes remain vigilant . In hopes of finishing the project , Dakota Access filed a cross-claim on November 15 and a motion to expedite on November 15 . The firm -- citing losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars due to delays in construction -- asked a federal judge to resolve the matter as early as January . But even though Judge James E. Boasberg never formally agreed to move forward with the cross-claim , Dakota Access went ahead and filed a motion for summary judgment -- essentially a move to secure the easement -- on Monday . In a 35-page memorandum , the firm 's well-connected attorneys offered to present arguments on the matter this Friday , during a hearing that had been already scheduled before all of the latest developments . It 's not clear how Boasberg will proceed , given all the new information . But since he never agreed to the aggressive scheduled proposed by Dakota Access , which included a request for another hearing on January 3 , 2017 , he may be willing to wait on the tribes . The Army Corps has already said it opposes any efforts to expedite the cross-claim . Still , Boasberg is likely to have plenty of questions about all of the latest developments . After the Obama administration stepped into the fray on September 9 by announcing that the easement was still being reviewed , he used a previously-scheduled hearing on September 16 to force an apology out of the Department of Justice for its handling of the case . It took about 20 minutes of repeated questions from Boasberg for the apology to come out . The process is likely to take months , meaning it will stretch into the administration of Republican president-elect Donald Trump . With that in mind , the tribes are willing to put the lawsuit on hold until the work is complete , they wrote in their status update . Depending on the outcome of the process , they could end up dismissing the case or amending their separate complaints . Any efforts to delay or put the lawsuit on hold are bound to draw fierce opposition from Dakota Access . On the same day authorities in North Dakota engaged in a violent assault on pipeline resisters , the firm asserted a right to drill at Lake Oahe without a written easement . A few days after that , a top executive said the 1,172-mile project , which travels through four states , was all but complete except for the portion at Lake Oahe . What they left out of their joint statement was that they were warned about the dangers of proceeding without the easement . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed the lawsuit in July . The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe was allowed to intervene as a plaintiff in August . The defendant is the Army Corps of Engineers . Dakota Access was granted permission to intervene as a defendant .
