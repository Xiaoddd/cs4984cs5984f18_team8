The Arctic Resilience Report found that the effects of Arctic warming could be felt as far away as the Indian Ocean , in a stark warning that changes in the region could cause uncontrollable climate change at a global level . Sea ice is at the lowest extent ever recorded for the time of year . Arctic sea ice extent graph Climate tipping points occur when a natural system , such as the polar ice cap , undergoes sudden or overwhelming change that has a profound effect on surrounding ecosystems , often irreversible . The research , compiled by 11 organisations including the Arctic Council and six universities , comes at a critical time , not only because of the current Arctic temperature rises but in political terms . Aides to the US president-elect , Donald Trump , this week unveiled plans to remove the budget for climate change science currently used by Nasa and other US federal agencies for projects such as examining Arctic changes , and to spend it instead on space exploration . We need more research to understand them . For instance , when sea ice shrinks it leaves areas of dark ocean that absorb more heat than the reflective ice , which in turn causes further shrinkage , and so on in a spiral . It has long been known to play a key part of the global climate system , but the difficulty and expense of close monitoring have meant that scientists have only in recent years been able to make detailed assessments .

They took evidence from a variety of settlements in the region , finding many signs of stark changes already under way .
