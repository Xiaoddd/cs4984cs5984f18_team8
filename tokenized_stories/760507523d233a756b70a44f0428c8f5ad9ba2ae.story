Let them know you support H.R. 4518 , the Bears Ears National Monument Expansion Act , and S. 2354 , the ANTIQUITIES Act of 2018 . These bills would restore and expand the boundaries of Bears Ears National Monument to the full boundary originally proposed by the five Tribes in 2015 . The Hopi , Navajo , Ute , Ute Mountain Ute , and Zuni Tribal Governments are working together to defend Bears Ears National Monument . Thanks so much for taking the interest to stay informed about the effort to protect Bears Ears .
