Ten people , from all the friends who had expressed interest and all the people who had been there and were feeling a call to go back in the final days of Oceti Oyate : the frontline NO DAPL encampment . To everyone who contributed , from the bottom of my heart , thank you . Every single dollar went towards helping clean-up in those final , epic and challenging days of Oceti Oyate . I knew a lot of the water protectors who returned to camp to help in the final days . Still , there were not enough hands . There were not nearly enough hands . People were evacuating and situating their own camps in new locations . Then there was the Cheyenne River or Four Teepees camp located just down the road on 1806 which was the only camp on safely leased property , with a population cap of 75 . We entered in a sacred way , and I got to know Robert White Mountain , as we made ties together for a beautifully hot , full , and long sweat that lasted past midnight . The prayer was powerful , intense , and strong . The weather , which had every structure iced into the ground , took a turn for the much warmer after certain geo-engineering . On my first day I helped the folks at Red Lightening free the dome from ice , and pull off the cover , a beautifully cinematic moment that took a crew of 6 eight hours to produce , and a team of 30 to actually pull off in the final moments . All day as I hacked into the ice I noticed planes flying above us , a chris-cross of chemtrails over the sky . Soon the temperature rose by 20 degrees , and the entire camp became mud . It was a good thing I rented the truck because it was one of the few working vehicles in the final days . And during our endless journeys back and forth across the mud lake , even it got stuck three times . It was used as a tow truck , it was used to evacuate a yurt to South Dakota , it was used to move wood burning stoves , and teepees , and food and gear to higher ground and out of camp . To be frank , most of the white allies seemed to have themselves pretty situated . Many of the indigenous families who had been there for months had less resources available to help with the evacuation . Also , collectively , folks did not know where to turn our attention . Much useful energy was diverted in setting up new and beautiful camps that would soon be lost and preparing for the coming potentially violent military occupation , and less than optimal amounts of energy were focused on actually evacuating sacred objects and valuable gear . People were there in many capacities , doing important work on many fronts . So we cobbled together volunteers and took down the most important structures , including a sacred longhouse , packed together the most important belongings , and moved them into two little houses on the hill above the flood-plane , Grandma Dorothy insisting they would stay past the eviction . I spent hours with trash bags by the river , finding Matter Out Of Place everywhere . You could spend an entire day just towing people out of the mud , it was that thick , the paths dangerous even in four wheel vehicles . Once the Army Corps brought in the heavy machinery , any hope of passing through at all was completely demolished . I was a road warrior , who drove like a maniac , surfing the mud like a monster truck derby , and praying every single time that I could make it to dryish ground by the sacred fire . We needed that truck . The trailer I fundraised for and brought with team Sustain Standing Rock in early December became home again for those days . It sat on the horn , surrounded on all sides by lakes of mud . And as the weather shifted it became clear it needed a new home , or it would be stuck and impounded on eviction day . On what was truly the last morning with any ice over the mud , Joe , the head of construction , helped us tow her out . We practiced our route and went for it , getting all the way to the South Gate exit before his bumper fell loose on his trusty work truck . With a smile and a kick to the old rusted bumper he laughed that he was glad not to have to pull anyone else out of the forsaken mud . Of course at that very moment an elder drove by and offered to get our dear Canadian Bacon up to the Four Teepees Camp , and I gave him an entire pack of American Spirit Organics , like gold . So we unhitched her again , and set her up , door facing east , in a patch of corn and horse manure at the new campgrounds . She is safe , and currently residing in South Dakota , where a No KXL Camp is in the planning phase . She is such a brave warrior , a protector to the highest , that I will always admire and send thanks to . Through the end she stood tall and advocated for the most peaceful and humane outcome . I went to a few of the meetings , us relating human to human , every day the same response . The eviction date stood . Despite the weather , despite our seemingly miraculous progress considering the lack of people , despite the fact the flood they predicted was nowhere near , despite the fact that elders and children had no place to go , despite treaty rights , despite the first amendment of the constitution . But as the situation became clearer , a steely gaze , a prideful prayer , fell into the eyes of those who chose to remain . They would come , the men with the guns and the tanks would come and many , many , would stand , even in the face of certain arrest and possible violence . The time around the sacred fire became absolutely precious , the gift of tobacco and sage , a salutation . The end of something can be so very , very beautiful and each of us soaked our moments up , tucking them away for safekeeping inside our hearts . There were two nights of no sleeping and ceremony for me in those precious ten days . There were two nights in a hotel , and three showers . On the last night I stayed late by the pow-wow at Two Kettles Camp , the drum a constant heartbeat there . In the wee hours I walked with a friend around the many bonfires burning across the plain , offering tobacco . I ran into Sonya who I knew from the Taos Pueblo Camp during my first trip , and we shared laughter and courage , her camp close enough to the DAPL lights that you could have shouting matches across the line , and they would . As the first crest of sunrise came up we were greeted by snow . I prayed by myself on the icy river . Two giant Hogons burned to the ground . I had friends that were supposed to be sleeping in one , so I ran to it in a panic , but was told the fire was controlled . It felt dangerous to me . Fires started all across camp , people choosing to burn structures rather than have them desecrated by the armed forces . We prayed the morning in at the seventh generation kitchen , and word had it that the very sacred White Buffalo Calf Woman Pipe and bundle was praying with us that day , for the first time in over 100 years . There would be a safe-zone , there would be ample time to get out . The authorities were playing nice . We certainly all held a very strong and clear prayer . I had been tasked with getting some youth to South Dakota , and it involved me borrowing a car to drive up the road and retrieve my truck , then driving on . I had left the rental outside of camp in case the road block turned hard in the morning . My dear friend Uncle Raymond Kingfisher had us in tears with his eloquence . Grandmother Dorothy plastered our cheeks with mud and buffalo blood . We sang and circled together , then we marched out the north gate and down the road , heads held high , tears tucked just behind the eyes . I held the line to keep the media back , facing the drummers and singers , holding space for them , walking backwards , the moment seared into my heart like a brand . I barely noticed the ambulances go by , but as the march concluded I ran the long road to the North Gate , looking for my people , ready to leave before the 2 PM deadline . Then I heard the terrible news , that two of the children from Oglala camp had been injured badly in a structure fire . From what I was told , they were inside one of the tarpees -LRB- a tipi made out of plywood and thick plastic -RRB- getting some last things , and it had exploded in flame . Their relative was nearby and pulled the 17 year old girl out , putting her in the mud , but she had bad burns all over her face . The ten year old boy had burns on his face and hands . They had been taken to Bismark in an ambulance . I of course offered to drive them to the hospital . I was enraged . I ran out into the mud-field , crying out in fury . I screamed loudly and wanted to throw rocks , to run to the crowd in the distance and yell how fucked up they were . I was called back by a sister who calmed me down , breathing deeply with me . I had to help now . The girl had been airlifted to a special burn unit in Minnesota , and neither of her brothers had been let in the helicopter . I called legal and got them out there to stop the intimidation . It was an accident , but the agents were very concerned about booby trapped structures and weapons at Oceti . There were none . Finally I drove the gang back to a South Dakota safe house , got a couple hours of shuteye , and then drove back to Bismarck for my early morning flight . The military invasion held off until the 23rd . Many of the elders left the next morning , as the tanks lined up and drove down the hill . There was plenty of time to escape if you wanted . However Grandmother Regina and protectors from the Veterans stayed : my friends Evan Duke and Ed Higgins arrested for her stand . I encourage you to watch and see for yourself the level of force used to arrest the 44 souls brave enough to stay until the very end . I was on a plane , watching through my phone , the final moments of Oceti Oyate . And though we scattered like seeds , the movement continues . The seed planted in those final days of camp grows in the hearts of everyone who shared those days together . Now we move towards other pipeline camps and to divestment campaigns in each of our own places called home , in each step we take onward . All of us -LRB- and this includes you -RRB- have waters and lands to protect , everywhere that we travel . The fossil fuel industry , supported by the US Government and Military , is coming for you : they are poisoning waters across the country and de-regulating our environmental protections . The indigenous tribes are bearing the brunt of the force now , but they will come for everyone . I encourage every single person who has read this far to think about what they can do to protect the waters and lands that give us all life , and how we will stand up for a future for our coming generations . I know that this is a cause I will carry with me for the rest of my days , in every step that I take from this day forward . The water protectors at Standing Rock will always be water protectors , we have been moved , and we will stand . Give Madeline Merritt a round of applause .
