She was arrested near Standing Rock last week . But most of the press has been silent about the charges she faces -LRB- and the implications for the First Amendment -RRB- . It basically means that police work together . A call goes out from Morton County and , right or wrong , law enforcement from around the country provides back up . You would think journalism would be like that too . When one journalist is threatened , we all are . We can not do our jobs when we worry about being injured or worse . Well , everyone who claims the First Amendment as a framework should object loudly . Last Wednesday Monet was arrested near Cannonball , North Dakota . She was interviewing water protectors who were setting up a new camp near the Dakota Access Pipeline route on treaty lands of the Great Sioux Nation . Law enforcement from Morton County surrounded the camp and captured everyone within the circle . Most were charged with criminal trespassing and inciting a riot . As was Monet . She now faces serious charges and the judicial process will go forward . The truth must come out . But this story is about the failure of journalism institutions . The press is silent . I have heard from many , many individual journalists . There should news stories in print , digital and broadcast . There should be editorials calling out North Dakota for this egregious act . If the institutions let this moment pass , every journalist covering a protest across the country will be at risk of arrest . The funny thing is that journalism institutions were not quick to embrace Goodman either . The lack of journalistic coverage is disgraceful . If we are to be saved from our environmental poisoning behavior , it is by the actions of the these indigenous heroes , people whose land was stolen and is now being desecrated . This is torture and should be punished as a crime . Email check failed , please try again Sorry , your blog can not share posts by email . but there was an error posting your comment .
