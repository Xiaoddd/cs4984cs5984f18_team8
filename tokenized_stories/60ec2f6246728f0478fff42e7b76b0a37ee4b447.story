We want our finances to contribute to positive change , not destructive development projects , and so we are choosing to do business with a bank that better reflects our values . EcoViva is dedicated to environmental protection and sustainable development in Central America . Our work supports grassroots struggles against climate change and for clean water , healthy forests , sustainable livelihoods , and vibrant communities . We have had a banking relationship with Wells Fargo Bank for several years.The bank assisted us in our grantmaking through low-cost wire transfers to our partners in Central America . They also highlighted the need to stop supporting harmful projects through our bank accounts . To that end we are transferring our funds to Beneficial State Bank , a company that recognizes that investing in communities is good for job growth , and that transitioning to a sustainable economy means weaning us from our dependence on fossil fuels . We will bank with an institution that shares our principles of promoting sustainable and dignified livelihoods , human rights , and clean water and air both locally around the world . In addition , we will bank with an institution that will offer competitive rates for a comparable service . Water is Life . Beneficial State Foundation and Beneficial State Bank are separate entities . -LRB- You can unsubscribe anytime -RRB- Constant Contact Use .
