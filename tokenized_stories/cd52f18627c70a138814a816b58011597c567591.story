Manning , a transgender woman , will walk from a male military prison in Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , on 17 May , almost seven years to the day since she was arrested at a base outside Baghdad for offences relating to the leaking of a vast treasure trove of US state secrets to the website WikiLeaks . Manning , 29 , is a former intelligence analyst in Iraq who was sentenced in 2013 after a military court convicted her of passing more than 700,000 documents , videos , diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to WikiLeaks . It was the biggest breach of classified material in US history . In 2010 , WikiLeaks worked with media organisations including the Guardian to publish material that offered unprecedented insight into the workings of US diplomacy . Among the files Manning leaked was a gunsight video of a US Apache helicopter firing on suspected Iraqi insurgents in 2007 , killing a dozen people including two Reuters journalists . But the commutation was condemned by leading Republicans . Assange has denied receiving the material from Russia . Two women in Sweden have accused him of rape and other sexual offences , which he denies . He did not mention his earlier pledge that he would agree to US extradition if Obama granted clemency to Manning . Manning , who is a columnist for the Guardian , was the symbol of one of the harsher aspects of the Obama administration , as an official leaker who suffered a longer custodial sentence than any other whistleblower of modern times . The soldier has experienced some very hard times while in military prison . In 2010 she was transferred from Iraq and Kuwait to the military brig at Quantico , Virginia , where she was put through prolonged solitary confinement . Manning , formerly known as US army private first class Bradley Manning , revealed after being convicted of espionage that she identifies as a woman . She has said she was confronting gender dysphoria at the time of the leaks while deployed in Iraq . She has endured recent challenges with her morale and mental health , having attempted suicide on at least one occasion last year . The US military responded to that attempt by punishing her with further solitary confinement . She was not due to be released until 2045 . Obama has commuted the sentences of 1,385 individuals , more than any other US president . The official said the president believed six years in prison was sufficient relative to sentences given to others who committed similar crimes . Earlier on Tuesday , the White House press secretary , Josh Earnest , was asked if the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden , currently living in Russia , could also be in line for a pardon . But Earnest argued that there are key differences between the two cases . Thank you for what you did for everyone , Chelsea .
