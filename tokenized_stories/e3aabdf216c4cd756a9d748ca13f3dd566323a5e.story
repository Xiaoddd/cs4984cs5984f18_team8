Mortgage Refinance Switch your mortgage for a home loan with better rates and terms . Credit unions provide an attractive alternative to banks for many Americans . Fees and loan rates are usually lower and interest rates returned on your savings are generally higher . This is because credit unions are not-for-profit organizations that are owned by their account holders , also known as members . They are also governed by a volunteer board of directors who are also members of the credit union . Instead of using their profits to pay dividends to owners or shareholders , as banks do , credit unions reward members by offering higher savings returns and lower fees . However , there are some downsides to credit unions , particularly with the smaller ones . For instance , credit union members must meet certain eligibility requirements , such as working at a certain company , being a member of a particular association , or living in a certain area . The credit cards issued by credit unions will typically have lower rewards and credit union accounts may not have all the bells and whistles that high net worth individuals require . Generally , credit unions that manage more assets and have more members can afford to provide their members with more services , better rewards , higher interest rates and lower fees . The key is to choose the best credit union that you are eligible to join . Most of the credit unions listed below will accept anybody who makes a small , one-time donation to a charity or association sponsored by the credit union .
