I am half Southern Cheyenne and Half Choctaw Native . My oldest brother called it the University of all universities . The project we were both working on ended in Oct . We had heard their land and water was being threatened by the Dakota access pipeline . On Sunday , November 20 Israel was injured on the front line by 2 inch rubber bullets to the back and head . It required 17 staples to close his head wound . We truly appreciate any donations toward his medical expenses . In honor of her of Her memory , all future donations will go towards her Burial expenses . Thank you for all your Prayers and for helping us Celebrate her life . Israel was having back and neck pain so he returned to the Doctor at the hospital to get it checked out . He possibly has a pinched nerve in his back and inflammation in his back .
