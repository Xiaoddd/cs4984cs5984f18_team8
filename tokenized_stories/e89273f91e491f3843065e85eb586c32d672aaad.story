In a filing in U.S. District Court in Washington , Jan Hasselman , a lawyer with Earthjustice who represents the tribes , said the court should rule , in a partial summary judgment , that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers violated the National Environmental Policy Act and Clean Water Act by issuing the final permit . That easement will allow the Dakota Access pipeline to be completed by tunneling under Lake Oahe , a reservoir that forms part of the Missouri River . It comes after Judge James Boasberg on Monday denied the request by the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux for a temporary restraining order stopping the last stretch of construction . Energy Transfer Partners is building the 1,170-mile -LRB- 1,885 km -RRB- line , which will run from North Dakota to Patoka , Illinois . The last permit was denied in December and later subject to further environmental review , by the outgoing Obama administration . After taking office last month , President Donald Trump ordered that steps be taken to expedite the permit . The Army Corps then elected not to undergo the additional environmental review and issued the permit last week . The tribes ' legal options are narrowing , according to Dave Archambault II , chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux .
