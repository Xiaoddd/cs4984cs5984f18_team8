The move drew outrage from opponents , including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , whose reservation in North Dakota sits less than a mile from the proposed pipeline route . The chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux , Dave Archambault II , responded to the decision by vowing to fight it in court . The pipeline is set to run under the Missouri River near the reservation . It is opposed by many members of the tribe . Construction of the route has become a global rallying point for environmental and tribal activism , drawing thousands of people to a sprawling protest camp and sometimes prompting clashes with authorities . Members of the tribe also said the pipeline would cross through sacred ancestral lands . The project would carry 470,000 barrels of oil a day .

The move will allow for the completion of the last mile and a half of the 1,172-mile project , connecting oil production areas in North Dakota to a crude oil terminal near Patoka , Ill. . The pipeline is owned by Energy Transfer Partners . The decision prompted immediate outcry from people within the protest camp , which now numbers about 400 people , according to Manape LaMere , 38 , a leader living by the route since October . Pray for the water . Pray for the people . Pray for the water protectors . The decision left some feeling whiplashed .
