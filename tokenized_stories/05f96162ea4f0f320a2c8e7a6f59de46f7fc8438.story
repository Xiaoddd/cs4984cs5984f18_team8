And Something To Say . Dec 1 , 2016 The Journey With Standing Rock . Jerry Spirit Hawk Brown . Photo credit : Hector Cruz Photography . Jerry is an Apache . One of four Founding Fathers of the South East American Indian Council . Jerry is a Veteran , who took a bullet to the chest in Vietnam , costing him one of his lungs . Today , he stands near Lake Oahe , to join the thousands who are joining in solidarity at the Standing Rock Reservation . The protests at Standing Rock have gained international attention after questions arose regarding the role of law enforcement against those protesting . The following is a living account of the journey taken 1300 miles across five states by Jerry Spirit Hawk Brown , Stephanie Tallent and photographer , Hector Cruz , who agreed to have their story shared here with interviews , images and live updates . We all have a responsibility to this earth and to the human race . That spirit brings us together in times of despair and times of joy . This is one of those times that I hope we can look deep within ourselves and find that fighting united spirit that makes us human and compassionate . This affects us all TODAY . This will affect our children and grandchildren . We owe this beautiful earth a lot better than the way we have treated it . We have a 16 foot trailer full of supplies . The local community started donating and we even saw people coming from two hours away to be sure our trailer was full . People were donating necessities and hand made art and any cash they could spare to help us help others . It was an outpouring of community effort . Then , we stopped along the way to get even more . There are threats we will be turned away or fined and we pressed on . If we get fined , so be it . Supplies are needed . And we hope others will help provide .

This is what we are protecting . Lake Oahe . Mid Morning , December 1 , 2016 . Photo Credit : Hector Cruz Photography . 7:30 PM EST : Arrival at Camp Grounds The Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . Photo Courtesy : Stephanie Tallent It is nightfall now on the grounds of the Standing Rock reservation , where temperatures are falling into the lower twenties Fahrenheit and cell phone signals are unreliable . Cell Phone Footage Courtesy Hector Cruz Photography . The Human Spirit is warm and inviting however . The resolve , compassion , determination , and commitment of the people here is invigorating and inspiring . The women here are strong and have left me in awe of their strength . The elders , the children , the vets , are all united and that my friends is the Human spirit . Hundreds of people are here . All busy and working or praying or meeting in all elements of the huge camp life . Met two veterans last night that quit their jobs and plan on staying here as long as necessary . Later every random person we crossed paths with . The warmth and friendliness of the people here is amazing . Heavy tarps , mattresses , herbs , essential oils , supplements , kids clothes , heavy winter coats , blankets , cups , first aid supplies , cedar and sage etc. . We sort and organize and then delivered to tents based on the category . Hector Cruz pauses to take in the view as unloading of donations begins . Photo Courtesy : Stephanie Tallent There are different kitchens here and communal sleeping areas . There is legal staff here also . You can sense a feeling of panic among some organizers . They realize once the veterans leave the governor will come in . 2:00 PM EST : Media converging on campgrounds to prepare for Veterans Stephanie , Hector and Jerry pack up the tent to move from this location . Supplies all unloaded as they now travel through more of the grounds . Photo Courtesy : Hector Cruz Photography 5:00 PM EST : Weather making conditions harder for those on site : We just got in a really bad accident . Will keep you all posted . We are in shock and glad to be alive . They are staying tonight in a hotel near the grounds while they await decisions on repairs for truck and trailer . December 3 , 2016 7:00 PM EST : Nightfall Back On The Lake After recovering from the accident , Hector and the crew head back to the reservation . Jerry Spirit Hawk Brown , standing just outside Lake Oahe at dusk on the Reservation . As Hector and his team leave for Oceti Sakowin , Hector and Jerry share a moment of goodbyes . Jerry offers his blessing and trust and said the accident was meant for the good that can be accomplished . Tell their story . My story is their story . Photo Courtesy : Stephanie Tallent 1:00 PM EST : Massive Presence Now On Grounds 3:00 PM EST : Coveted Press Passes In Hand Two hours in line in freezing cold . My feet are just now getting feeling again . Stephanie Tallent After tight security was placed on media entertaining the grounds , it was uncertain how many photographers and journalists would be granted access . Jerry is a little better and resting . At historic moment on blockaded bridge on hwy 1806 with veterans and medics . Her office had announced on November 14 , 2016 that it was delaying the decision on the easement to allow for discussions with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , whose reservation lies 0.5 miles south of the proposed crossing . Tribal officials have expressed repeated concerns over the risk that a pipeline rupture or spill could pose to its water supply and treaty rights . Surreal . My brain heart and emotions are still trying to process everything we saw . Best part of the day was getting to tell Jerry the good news . I am terrified of NOT LIVING . You see I cared about this cause but a big part of me did not want to come . I did not want to be uncomfortable , but even more so I did not want to make myself vulnerable again . You see , when you photograph someone there is a connection that is made and a vulnerability must occur to be able to capture the spirit of the person . I am thankful that this has inspired me once again to continue the work that I do with my camera in support of social issues . Photo Courtesy : Hector Cruz Photography I had a chance to talk with Hector about the events he witnessed as the Army Corps decision came down . He described it as tense and determined . He told me that many of the veterans were not convinced that the decision would be honored . He also said it appeared there were now more veterans on site than Lakota . Hector witnessed veterans wanting to claim the land to stand as a front line for the peaceful protesters as the tribes pulled them back into the celebration not wanting any sort of tactical advantage scenario that might escalate away from the peaceful resistance happening . Hector described it as a bit of a power struggle , where you could feel the tension . Hector said the tribal members deescalated the situation at the blockade yesterday . I was standing right there . I saw them . You can see the grenade pins right there at the blockade . Hector said he also received reports that on a back dirt road , that had not previously been barricaded was now blocked off . Hector said about one mile from that road , camps are being set up by what appeared to be military or armed guards . On the evening of December 5th , a Forgiveness Ceremony was held in solidarity between veterans and natives of Turtle Island . Photo Courtesy : Hector Cruz Photography December 6 , 2015 10:00 AM EST : Stranded But Safe Hector and his crew remain near to the grounds with Jerry . Blizzards have closed the roads and they have no access currently to get back into the camp grounds . Stephanie asked that all coming to the camp and those traveling through the small towns near remember the community that is here and to not take advantage of the hospitality on the camp and the small business needs in those towns nearby . She said contrary to what she was led to expect , she has seen great support from those in smaller communities they have visited near the grounds . I just want to remind everyone to respect culture and community and that if they are coming through as a water protector or protester they will represent all water protectors and protesters . Wind gusts combined with icy roads in the town we are in with our trailer makes it extremely dangerous for us to try to head out . We might have taken our chances to get out if it were just a few miles but the entire state is covered with winds like that . We have and continue to explore every option for weighing down the trailer . Boxes with rocks , bags of cement , containers of water etc. . We are two hours drive from the nearest big store which makes figuring out that kind of thing a little more complicated . then the people have lost their voice . No one hears the peoples voice , no one cares that the almighty dollar is more important than the wishes of the people . This is the fight for the land . This is democracy or democracy has failed . I love my country . I love my people . I even love my enemies . If this pipeline goes through , we have lost our voice in America . I am sad . I hurt for all the people younger than me . I hurt for my children and your children , my grandchildren and your grandchildren . Packing last of stuff . Leaving trailer because there is no way to safely tow it in these conditions . Our window to leave is now or he may wind up hospitalized if we stay here another week waiting for weather to clear . Trusting a local stranger with the care of the trailer until pickup arrangements can be made . Jerry wants to continue traveling home , but an agreement is made that they will stop in Pierre to check on his temperature and vitals and decide at that point whether or not to find a hospital near town . Hector shared his thoughts as they settled in and kept Jerry comfortable . Resting now . You know as we steadily get closer to home you start to realize the impact of what is going on at Standing Rock . I have been feeling some anxiety and sadness , but I am definitely still processing those emotions , they are pretty overwhelming at this moment . I knew that I wanted to go , as I felt strongly about this but there was a big part of me that felt I had no place going . I wanted to humanize the cause , give the Water Protectors names and faces . It is easy to ignore a cause , but it is not easy to ignore a face . I need a day , time , to process and really think about this because I am not the same man , and I have changed in some meaningful ways . This was a life changer .
