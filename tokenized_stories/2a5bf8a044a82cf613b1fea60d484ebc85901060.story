American Indian tribes who are still fighting the Dakota Access oil pipeline in court are once again awaiting a decision from Judge Boasberg . President Trump unabashedly pushed for permit approval over the vehement , demonstrative objections of the tribes , environmentalists , and their supporters worldwide . The Native nations involved maintained that the pipeline would pollute a sacred waterway , the Missouri River , endangering their health and well-being and that it violated long-established tribal sovereignty . The Standing Rock Sioux and the Cheyenne River Sioux sued the Corps of Engineers soon after the pipeline was approved , contending that the tribes had not been properly consulted . Despite an abundance of legal setbacks from Boasberg , the tribes are still hopeful that he will suspend DAPL operations . The prosecution of Indigenous demonstrators is ongoing by governmental authorities . Reportedly , Natives charged with offenses are receiving inordinately long prison sentences . He was an organizer and delegate to the First and Second Intercontinental Indian Conferences held in Quito , Ecuador and Quetzaltenango , Guatemala . Recently , he has been an active participant and reporter in the Standing Rock struggle in North Dakota . He is an attorney and is currently writing a legal treatise on Native American sovereignty . He is also writing a book on the war crimes committed by the U.S. against the Maya people in the Guatemalan civil war of the late 20th century . He is also the recipient of several Eagle Awards by the Tennessee Native American Eagle Organization and a former Director of Native American Legal Departments and a Tribal Public Defender .
