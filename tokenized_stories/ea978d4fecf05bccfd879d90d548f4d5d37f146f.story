Describing an agenda that included setting company vehicles on fire , stealing equipment , and intentionally riling up protesters , Kourtni Dockter , 22 , of Bismarck , exposed that the security firms involved actively attempted to pin illegal activities on activists . Dockter contacted Michael Fasig , who worked Oceti Sakowin security during the controversy , and Aubree Peckham , both affiliated with ActivateNow , an independent news network , for the interview . Days before she spoke , she made an announcement . Appearing slightly nervous , Dockter first said that she was speaking of her own free will , and had not been coerced in any way . Dockter is also the former girlfriend of Kyle Thompson , the Thompson-Gray LLC security employee who was disarmed by activists of a AR-15 on October 27 , 2016 while reportedly driving his pickup truck at high speeds toward the Oceti Sakowin camps . She would frequently meet at the Mandan Yard where the security firms , TigerSwan Inc. , Leighton Security Services , LLC , established in 2011 in Honey Grove , Texas , and 10 Code Security , established in 2010 in Bismarck , frequently met with pipeline executives and law enforcement . Leighton Security Services owner Kevin Mayberry , said he has never heard of Dockter , but that if she had worked for his company it would have been indirectly with EH Investigations LLC . EH Investigations LLC is listed as a limited liability company involved with private investigations and security , and established on November 5 , 2015 in Bismarck , according to the North Dakota Secretary of State . Other media have listed HE Security , Russell Group Security , and SRG Security , along with other security agencies , worked the Dakota Access Pipeline route , and were responsible for equipment safety , drilling operations , and filming operations . Dockter said illegal activity was encouraged by security companies , who used agents to infiltrate the camps , and commit crimes that were later pinned on activists . TigerSwan at times authorized deadly force , and looked favorably at employees who incited violence that led to arrests , Dockter said . She went on to describe a day when Thompson allegedly swerved into the opposite lane and into oncoming traffic intentionally sideswiping youth on horseback . On the day he was arrested by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation , he was snorting methamphetamine on a hill overlooking the camps , she said . He was very high and strung out . Kyle was trying to keep it all together , he was the only one who could do it , because he was high on meth . Security employees were also overworked , and security firms frequently overcharged their employer , Energy Transfer Partners , Dockter said . Out of 12 positions allocated for , only seven people worked security for Leighton Security Services , Dockter said . He liked it . After the Treaty Camp was cleared on October 27 , TigerSwan mercenaries set fire to the five-ton trucks on the bridge , she said . Porter was the chief security officer for Energy Transfer Partners , according to documents leaked to media outlet The Intercept . Thompson also allegedly stole a radio from an elder at the camps , Dockter said , and went inside the camps on multiple occasions . She referred to the same night that Sophia Wilansky , from New York , nearly had her arm blown off by what activists say was a concussion grenade , and what law enforcement claim was a homemade Coleman propane tank bomb . In an unrelated incident , Thompson , 30 , was arrested April 18 for simple assault domestic violence , carrying a concealed weapon , and for possession of schedule I , II , and III drug paraphernalia , according to the Burleigh County arrest records . By the following afternoon , the domestic abuse charge was dropped , leaving two Class A misdemeanor charges : carrying a concealed firearm in his vehicle , and possessing drug paraphernalia , namely syringes and spoons , to consume methamphetamine , according to the Burleigh County Clerk of Court . The North Dakota Secretary of State holds one record for TigerSwan , LLC , established in Fargo on November 7 , 2016 , seven months after the controversy began . They wanted that to happen . Ten Code Security and Leighton Security Services was contacted for comment , but did not reply or refused to comment . TigerSwan Inc. was also contacted for information , but did not comment . Additionally at press time , it was unsure if Dockter will testify in any potential court proceedings . This is a breaking story , updates to continue when available .
