Despite brutal sub-zero conditions about one thousand water protectors remain at the Standing Rock encampments . Among them are hundreds of veterans from across the country , like Kellan Moore , who was so outraged at the treatment of water protectors by law enforcement that he drove from Chicago to stay at camp .
