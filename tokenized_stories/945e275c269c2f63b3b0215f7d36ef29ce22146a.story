The company posted a notice yesterday which said it would be submitting a planning application to continue the life of the pipeline which connects a gas-fired power station to six well sites in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire . Last month , the campaign group , Frack Free Ryedale , threatened an injunction against fracking at Kirby Misperton because it said the pipeline would be operating beyond its designed life . -LRB- DrillOrDrop report -RRB- The pipeline was constructed in 1994 with a design life of 15 years for carrying gas which contained hydrogen sulphide . Third Energy extended the design life in 2010 and the pipeline was re-validated for another 14 years until 2024 . Since then the company has said it intended to use the pipeline for a further 20 years to carry fracked gas . This would take the use to 2038 . Third Energy also said it was continuing to invest in its Ryedale fields , where gas is currently being extracted using conventional techniques . Third Energy confirmed that it wanted to extend the planning consent until 2035 for both the pipeline and the sites -LRB- Kirby Misperton A and B , Malton A and B , Pickering and Marishes -RRB- . Documents suggest that the current planning permission for the pipeline expires in May this year . DrillOrDrop asked Third Energy to confirm this but has not received a response . Extract of newspaper notice , 7 January 2018 The company has said it would also ask the government to extend the life of the gas-powered Knapton Generating Station . Third Energy said the pipeline was fully compliant with the Pipeline Regulations and Pressure Systems Safety Regulations 2000 . Since then , Russell Scott , a campaigner with Frack Free Ryedale , asked Third Energy for evidence of these inspections . This reply coincided with the publication of a newspaper notice from Third Energy about its plans . This runs until 2026 . Reply gasman says : February 8 , 2018 at 7:53 pm What a load of Balls . When pipelines are given a design life of 15 years there is obviously good reasons . A short extension is one thing but another 25 years plus is ridiculous for a system that carries toxic explosive material . I doubt anyone would be comfortable with gas pipes or electric cables in their houses which were older than 25 years past there design life even if they appeared to be operating correctly . Reply hewes62 says : February 9 , 2018 at 12:12 pm John I have worked on North Sea platforms that are well beyond their design life and have felt safe to do so . The justification for doing so forms part of the installations safety case , the documentation for which is available to all who work on the installation . These platforms were built by very professional extraction companies , some of whom still exist . A platform jacket installed in 1966 , and still there some 50 years later is a testament to the sound engineering principles applied . Some later platforms , lighter engineered are not so fortunate and have had to be decommissioned . The extension of the life of a pipeline is an engineering decision , predicated on factual information about its condition . Hence some pipelines exceed their design life by many years , some do not achieve their design life intended . That an extension may be a multiple of its design life is not in itself ridiculous . In this case , the original company who installed the pipeline -LRB- and would not have considered fracking -RRB- may have though 15 years for a conventional reservoir was ok . That those conventional reservoirs are still in Production is fine , so it makes sense to see if the pipeline is ok for more years . In this case yes , so they can continue production . If the Regulator had thought no , then they would have had to think again . It is worth noting that UK N.Sea production -LRB- which you often mention as a reason not to bother with fracked gas -RRB- relies heavily on infrastructure that is past its design life . In Particular inter field pipelines , and old jackets . One saving grace for many pipelines has been that the decay in reservoir pressure has allowed pipelines to continue in use at a lower pressure than they were designed for to take . Phew . Reply hewes62 says : February 9 , 2018 at 11:37 am Gasman Yes , there seems to be some misunderstanding going on , some of which looks to be intentional . The key issues for the report above are 1 . Third Energy are seeking planning permission for a pipeline network , not one pipeline . 2 . The pipelines have permission from the competent authority -LRB- HSE -RRB- to operate further . 3 . The request for planning permission relates to their being there , not specifically that they are fit for purpose . The council would ask the relevant authority for information in that respect . 4 . Frack gas , is just gas , it is a meaningless term in relation to pipeline integrity . You are more interested in what is in it and the pressure . 5 . 6 . 7 . The Parish Council should represent the community , so it is good to see that the company is happy to deal with the democratically elected part of the community , and as the community can attend parish council meetings , I hope they attend . Others can attend as well , but unless invited to , should not speak -LRB- boo or cheer as well -RRB- . 8 . There is some misunderstanding on the ability to extend the Design life of equipment in the various replies . As noted in the TE reply , they inspect the pipeline at ground level -LRB- above ground visually , below and above by intelligent pig -RRB- , have a pipeline integrity management system , and fly over it -LRB- not just fly over it -RRB- . Flying over it allows you to quickly assess if someone is doing something over it or near it that they should not , such as digging a hole with a jcb , or building a house or barn , so on and so forth . Or The number of years in future for which supply will be more than demand . Design period is provided because : It is very difficult or impossible to provide frequent extension . It is cheaper to provide a single large unit rather to construct a number of small units . Factors affecting design period Life of the structure Life of structure is the number of years in future for which the design period is physically suitable to provide the intended facility . So it should be less than life of structure . Ease or difficulty in extension For the projects whose extension is easily possible , it is kept low . For example we can install new tube wells at any time , so we do not need to install all tube wells which would be required after 20 years . But for the projects whose extension is difficult , their design period is kept greater . Long design lives Some products designed for heavy or demanding use are so well-made that they are retained and used well beyond their design life . Obsolescence Design life is related to but distinct from the concept of built-in obsolescence . That is a low figure . The experience with those tended towards a shorter operating life than the design life period would indicate , due to wear and tear , environment accident or attack , but mainly just general neglect and failure to maintain a safety regime over its useful life . Reply hewes62 says : February 9 , 2018 at 8:01 pm Phil C Thanks , a bit more engineering in that . The issue of design life and multiple extensions thereof is not cut and dried , as you note . Re the headline , interesting but if the pipeline is to be operated when not safe to do so I would first look at the HSEx to comment on its capability -LRB- which they have -RRB- , and then on any pipeline engineers who have contributed to the debate . Good for the public to be informed . I am not in a place that considers public accountable proof to be proof that excludes the view of the regulatory agencies engaged to provide assurance that it is -LRB- to the extent of their powers in inspection , permission and sanction -RRB- . However I would be happy for TE to present to the parish council , and planners , the information they have on why they have determined it as ok , along with representatives of the regulating authorities -LRB- and that part of Yorkshire council accountable for Pipeline ER response -RRB- . So I look forwards to hearing about and or attending any meeting between TE and the Parish council , and their response -LRB- and the Regulatory Authorities response -RRB- to the council as part of the planning application . Some better liaison with the local community would also be good . Good old democracy at work eh . What is not to like about it . Reply Phil C says : February 9 , 2018 at 10:34 pm Dear hewes , Oh , if you want more engineering and less excitement in returning in kind the usual implied insults , there is much much more where that comes from . No , the public , are the only ones that engineering is supposed to serve , to provide an engineered future for all , not for profit only , not for a wealthy few only , no , for everyone to be informed and made richer by experience . Reply hewes62 says : February 10 , 2018 at 5:33 pm Phil C Re intentional misunderstanding It was the bit about the aerial survey being laughable , and that there are joint testing services available . However the company had already stated -LRB- or as reported in the post -RRB- that this was just part of the inspection and maintenance plan . I imagined that you knew that such surveys are an integral part of a pipeline integrity management plan . . Not sure why it was something to laugh at , but I could be wrong . Plus that you may know that joint testing is something you do after making it up . Gas Pipelines are welded -LRB- other than at each end -RRB- so joint testing is not a major part of the pipeline integrity plan for the buried and or welded bit -LRB- but intelligent pigging is -RRB- . But again , I could be wrong , you did not know . Re higher education , it was in coal mining , which did not have a wealthy few in it , being a nationalised industry . I remember the day the production manager turned up in a new rover 2000 -LRB- SD1 -RRB- . Turns out he had come into an inheritance . Everyone kept a sharp eye out for new cars , Be they management or union . So engineering and coal was for the common good , and we all leaned to the left -LRB- hence the shock of a conservative MP for Mansfield , but Mining has gone -RRB- . I will have to defer to others as to the need to teach university students that profit is not for the wealthy few , as at polytechnic level , where most people had worked their way up through night school , HNC and HND upwards , it was already known . A few continued through to university and beyond , so I will ask them if it was part of the course . Each of us will think we occupy the moral high ground , but we all stand on our own Hill . Kisheny says : February 9 , 2018 at 10:21 am British power capacity auction . Reply john Powney says : February 9 , 2018 at 11:21 am I think we should embrace our cheapest cleanest most reliable form of energy first . That is wind power . The UK has far higher wind speeds than Germany . Double the wind speed equals 8 fold power increase . Commercial battery storage is already available -LRB- thank you Elon -RRB- so solar potential is now even more successful . We have 20 billion barrels of oil and gas in our own North sea . Plenty to go at whilst we maximise our renewable potential . Last year I was proud to be part of the team installing the Hywind project off Peterhead . There is nothing I would like more than the UK to be fully self sufficient in renewables but the reality is renewables alone even with battery capacity at this stage in time is nowhere near enough of the energy that is required or expected here in the UK . as for our ability to generate electricity through wind , this is fantastic but on overproducing days subsidies which pay more to the wind turbine companies to put the brakes on seems a very strange way to conduct business . Your quote : I think we should embrace our cheapest cleanest most reliable form of energy first . The UK will enforce the strictest controls through the enviroment agency in the World . As for your point on reliable energy for three months in total in the UK each year the wind does not blow . There is absolutely no legitimate argument to substantiate that the wind is reliable and in the winter months sunlight is a scarcity . As for gas in the North Sea , this is on the decline and we are relying more and more heavily on LNG from Qatar and shale gas from the USA ; piped gas from Norway and Russian gas through Belgium . This supply will only increase over the next few years with demand growing exponentially through more housing and the massive draw that will be coupled with electric vehicles . The security of our gas supply has recently been brought into focus in the past months starting with Qatar problems involving its ability to ship LNG . Also cracks found in the forties pipeline and an explosion in Austria all causing gas prices to rise in the UK . This combination of problems caused an embarrassed Government to have a Russian diverted LNG cargo moor at the Isle of Grain obviously an emergency contingency if the UK really needed it as the UK has very limited gas storage facilities now to buffer such supply problems . We all have a responsibility to understand where our energy comes from . By accepting LNG from the USA and Qatar the energy required to liquify , transport then regasify is massive with no financial benefit to the Government -LRB- Also consider Qatars human rights record -RRB- . By accepting gas from Norway and Russia we are relying on other countries for our basic needs . Russia is not our friend . I also see Norway this week has also rejected a Greenpeace action to stop it from exploring for oil and gas in the Arctic region . Unfortunately people in the UK have become complacent with regards to their energy requirements and usage , with a total disregard as to where and how the electric and gas happens to enter their homes . Reply john Powney says : February 9 , 2018 at 3:12 pm Hi Kisheny You mention the Hywind project . An amazing advance in floating offshore wind . The ability to locate high output wind farms in places that till recently were inaccessible . Huge potential and now a proven technology . You mention Germanys Energiewende program but then reference how much coal they burn which has no connection with the proven facts that they have 5,433 GW wind capacity , far in excess of the UK which I have shown has far greater offshore and onshore wind speeds . Your comments on the UK tax payer having to pay to turn wind turbines off goes a long way to answering your concerns on electric vehicles . Over production from renewables and nuclear during the early hours when demand is low will be used to power up our cars , our commercial batteries , and our domestic batteries -LRB- power walls -RRB- Car batteries will also put back into the grid . UK Government funding is working on that right now . The cost of decommissioning is irrelevant . We all pay for that as a result of collecting billions in revenue over the last 40 years . We choose where we import from . We choose to not limit ourselves to Norway in order to keep a diverse supply and keep prices competitive . We buy gas they buy our military and luxury goods . We could export less of our North sea gas if there are concerns about supply . As for Qatar human rights . I doubt very much Qatar oil and gas workers get a bad deal compared to some Chinese workers . Every day we receive thousands of containers from China with goods at unbelievable low prices . I thank you for your reply and appreciate that all view points should be made available . The massive reliance on coal for power is very evident . The German coalition Government desperately trying to meet carbon targets that they will not hit and only now about to put the squeeze on coal will result in a massive reliance on gas . I remember reading about the investment by the Government into battery technology . Battery technology research has been going on quietly for some time . I remember visiting a battery research department near Woking funded by a middle east consortium back in the mid nineties . One of my friends in Cornwall who was among a group of people against the mining was given the option . Either let us mine for the stone to be barged up to Swansea or oppose it and said stone will be trucked through the superb road infrastructure in the Cornish part of the World . In my opinion the move towards electric vehicles will happen a lot faster than most people think . I have seen this rapid transission in Norway over a few short years mostly incentivised through tax breaks -LRB- normally heavy taxation on vehicles in Norway -RRB- . It has moved at such a pace in Norway that these tax breaks are beginning to be removed . My main point is the energy that will have to displace petrol and diesel . I remember reading that if every car in the UK was to become electric we would need the equivalent of 7 , yes 7 hinkley point C nuclear power stations to meet the demand . Men and Women put their lives on the line every single hour of the year to facilitate our oil and gas from the UKCS . Yes everyone volunteers for the obvious financial remuneration , but every helicopter , bad weather or day to day risks are still risks to human life . As for the big picture of cost we will have to let market forces determine that . The long term investment to secure a supply to the UK is immense . The Defence Secretary Gavin Wiliamson bringing to the Nations attention how Russia is probing weakness in our energy network combined with what happened recently with the Forties pipeline also brings into question our security of supply from the North Sea . Centrica has fingers in many pies , if shale was such a dud they would not invest . The head of Statoil has said there is no money in UK shale . Well he would be an absolute fool to say anything else . I have made well over 50 trips to Norway and have seen the riches that have come from selling all that gas to the UK and others . Incredible . We have no choice but to import and we will have no choice but to import more and more gas . The Choices when it comes to importing gas : Norway who I have previously mentioned only this week slamming Greenpeace in its pursuit of new exploration in the Arctic Circle . -LRB- LNG Liquifying , transport and regasification : big energy use -RRB- American shale gas feeding Trumps coffers -LRB- LNG Liquifying , transport and regasification : big energy use -RRB- As for the Qatar trade deal , we buy their gas and they buy our arms this seems a very awkward bedfellow . The 24 Typhoon jets to Qatar deal in 2017 was the first major arms deal with Qatar . Saudi Arabia , UAE , Egypt and Bahrain have all cut ties with Qatar accusing Qatar of supporting terrorist groups . Whilst the UK supplies arms to Saudi Arabia surely it is the UK being the submissive partner in the deal to guarantee gas deliveries . This could place the UK in an extremely difficult position if the tensions in the region were to escalate . We would be in a great position if we could keep all our gas for ourselves and not rely on imports but that ship has sailed long ago . I agree with your stance regarding how the western world benefits from cheap imports . i am sure we are all aware the means by which we enjoy cheap clothing and plastics from the likes of India and china . maybe this should be the next campaign to stamp this out . The solution in my opinion is lets take the UK as an example . Very low cost power into the manufacturing industry coupled with the latest robotics in manufacture with a small amount of skilled workers . Tax revenues harnessed from these industries direct to Government . With Brexit on the horizon there has never been a more important time to fire up the Northern Powerhouse with shale gas enabling this . Lets not fill our countryside with wind and solar farms . Lets create fertilizer from natural gas and get farming . Out of the EU we will not allow meats from the continent with lower regulations which allow them to undercut British farmers . The energy conundrum the UK faces should allow gas and renewables to live together and hopefully within the next generation lead the world in renewables and gas will go the way of coal . This will take time and we can not allow short term vision to dictate our political will . How can Europeans possibly enforce sanctions on Russia for its Crimean advance . Weakness will fuel foreign powers in their ambitions , be it Qatar with its armament deal leverage against the UK or Russia with its race for Arctic occupation having completed the first LNG shipment through the Arctic without an icebreaker last August . Geopolotics is changing . Russia can be curtailed . Imagine the UK flowing gas into the EU network and pushing back the need for reliance on Russia . The Russians are old hands at trying to head off impending gas production as Hilary Clinton debated uncovered in wikileaks . How suprising Russians channeling money through anti fracking groups in the states . So as a footnote : I live quite close to the Cuadrilla Preston New Road site and see only a handful of protestors most days . Reply hewes62 says : February 10 , 2018 at 6:52 pm Kisheny The good news is that the St Just area is safe from Lithium Brine extraction , so Poldark should be OK . The drilling should be around South Crofty , which should hopefully reopen as well . A few friends down there think some real jobs would be a boon . Better than collecting the dole or waiting on rich second home owners . You can guess that they are not farmers , nor do they own holiday homes to rent out . Better they ship it , or at a pinch truck it to the rail head as the line has spare night time capacity for freight . My friends -LRB- who read DOD -RRB- suggest the tidal barrier be crowd funded , as that would demonstrate how many members of the public supported it on terms of hard cash . They are retired miners -LRB- tin or coal -RRB- , so you should take what they say with a pinch of salt -LRB- as Clint Eastwood notes on his approach to politically correct speech -RRB- . Reply Kisheny says : February 10 , 2018 at 9:05 pm Hi hewes62 Thanks for the information , much more knowledgeable than me with regard to the Cornwall situation . Job creation is great news and for a good cause . I would much prefer the UK to mine its own Lithium under strict regulations and revenues going direct to the Government . than shipping it in from the Congo . I believe the UK will lead the World with Renewables just about in my lifetime but a steady balance towards this with sound economics has to be the course we progress with . Reply hewes62 says : February 10 , 2018 at 10:29 pm Kisheny Thanks . I agree . I will need hydrogen power to tow the caravan and young H needs hydrogen too as jobs are as scarce as rocking horse poo out here on the boonies , so long commutes are key to employment . I am sure the UK will muddle through as normal . The resource is finite and will see a rapid output decline . A tidal barrier has an expensive start up cost but will then produce fee sourced energy for eternity . A no brainier . The Government should get the tidal barrier started immediately . Russia bad . Chinese good . john Powney says : February 11 , 2018 at 12:55 am More orders coming in for commercial battery storage . Great news for renewable energy . In 2017 the price of gas was between 35p and 53p per therm Plenty of evidence UK shale is not profitable with nothing to prove it could do more than break even occasionally . No wonder the big players never got involved . john Powney says : February 11 , 2018 at 8:59 am Best sited onshore wind power is the UK , s cheapest electrical energy source . Offshore wind was very expensive to start . That was when the industry was getting established with few competitors and with turbine output of 2.5 MW . Things have now changed significantly . Comparable with fossil fuels . Competition is fierce and the turbines are 8MW . The disruption to the grid from intermittent power is minimal and carries little cost . Very expensive . That cost will drop just like the cost of other wind projects We are an island with high wind speeds yet we lag way behind Germany with lower wind speeds . Starts 16-38 We have used 40 billion barrels in 40 years so have 20 years supply left . We will have moved onto cleaner energy well before that time . No need for a new expensive , dangerous , dirty , unwanted fossil fuel industry blighting our beautiful English countryside . hewes62 says : February 11 , 2018 at 11:02 am John Yes , those 20 Billion barrels will probably be got , less if the oil price is low , and more of it is higher . If there was a parting of the ways , English and Welsh oil reserves would be confined to what we have onshore , plus a bit in the Solent maybe . Ie not a lot at present . So it may well be worth exploring in the weald to see what there is , just in case . Mind you , it could sharpen minds a bit and lead to a quicker move to offshore wind and other renewables -LRB- reversing decisions re wind farms around and on the IOW for example -RRB- , and maybe speed up tidal power . We need to quickly ramp up our clean renewable energy generators . Reply john Powney says : February 9 , 2018 at 1:12 pm Looks like the winners were BP on the forties pipeline . BP are not in the habit of selling off long term secure infrastructure which makes good returns . Ineos can now spend millions on sticking plasters to hold their leaky asset together whilst BP invest their money into profitable projects . Reply hewes62 says : February 9 , 2018 at 4:08 pm John Bp make mistakes , they sold Forties and made Apache -LRB- and the lads -RRB- rich . Preliminary analysis of the site is very encouraging , bearing out the British Geological surveys analysis that the Bowland shale beneath Northern England holds one of the richest gas resources known : a huge store of energy at a cost well below that of renewables and nuclear . A glance across the Atlantic shows what could be in store for Britain , and what we have missed out on so far because of obstacles put in place by mendacious pressure groups and timid beauracrats . The effect of the shale revolution has been seismic . Cheap energy has brought industry back to America yet carbon dioxide emissions have been slashed far faster than in Europe as low carbon gas displaces high carbon coal . Environmental problems have , contrary to propaganda , have been minimal . All thoughts of imminent peak oil and peak gas have vanished . opens cartel have been broken , after it failed to kill the shale industry by driving the oil price lower . American shale producers cut cost faster than anybody thought possible . A limit has been put on the economic and political power of both Russia and Saudi Arabia , no bad thing for the people of both Countries and their neighbours . Shale drillers turn gas and oil production on and off in response to price fluctuations more flexibility than old fashioned Wells . Seven years ago it was possible to argue that shale would prove a flash in the pan . No longer : horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are the biggest energy news of the Century . For those that still think the falling price of wind and solar is more dramatic , consider this . Gas is one of the cheapest , safest , least polluting , most reliable and flexible energy sources and it does not require subsidie or huge areas of land like renewables . Britain once had a great abundance thanks to the North Sea but that is dwindling . Shale resources would almost certainly have come forward to fill the gap but by letting the renewables lobby and green pressure groups rig the market against gas , the Government is letting slip a historic opportunity . If the UK is to meet its Paris commitments , either CCS must be made to work commercially and at scale or , by 2030 , we will need to start reducing our reliance on gas . Shale has come 20 years too late to the party . And China was encouraged to build coal-fired power stations by the prospect of cheap US coal . So on a global level , the shale revolution has maybe not been as good for the climate as its supporters suggest . And the UK will have little success in trying to influence other countries to stop exploiting new carbon sources when we are busy trying to do it ourselves . Reply Paul Seaman says : February 13 , 2018 at 9:43 pm And all this is before you even start considering the practical problems of creating an onshore gas field without industrialising the countryside and making life unpleasant for the people who live there . The UK can not exploit another fossil fuel . big missed opportunity for UK business strangled by the narrow minded governance we currently have to endure . You can not eat money -LRB- remember , one day the poor will have nothing to eat but the rich -RRB- , you certainly can not eat plastic . hewes62 says : February 14 , 2018 at 11:00 am Paul I think we can forget CCS . Plus the UK is not the only country set to miss its CO2 targets . What transpires in the meantime will be interesting . China turned to importing coal in 2009 , a bit early to read the runes on us shale . They did this for a variety of reasons , such as going easy on their coking coal reserves , closing a lot of unsafe small mines , and using more coal in the many power stations they were building . This allied to their problems with infrastructure and inability to move the coal from the North and Mongolia to where it is needed in the South , and on the coast . If US coal is available -LRB- and when we say cheap , we mean cheaper than somewhere else -RRB- then I am sure they will have some , at the right price . America faces its own infrastructure problems . Hard to shift it to the coast , which is where the costs come into play . Well , whether or not I , or the person next to me , is a member of a pressure group or not , we are still members on the public . Being a member of a pressure group does not take any rights as a member of the public . The consequences of pipeline failures , and the high level of public concern about such failure , puts the spotlight on the company to show they care about being the good neighbour they claim in their PR to be . Well , now the pressure is on this company , that mask is slipping . Because , being so closely watched , we will see the pollution levels rise , the mistakes , the leaks , the corners cut . But we will continue to be there , watching , documented , monitoring , protesting , until the frackers have gone for good . We can wait , we live here . You frackers will be here today , gone tomorrow . We are here to try and limit the damage you make , stopping fracking in its tracks , until you frackers leave our communities for good . Reply Phil C says : February 9 , 2018 at 2:28 pm Well said Ian . It does not take long after the disingenuous and somewhat insulting damage limitation team move in until the personality attack frack hacks slide back in to divert , disavow and make an attempt to change the dangerous subject onto safer personal ground , they are masters of that , sadly nothing else , but they just about serve their purpose . Then they introduce irrelevant favourite fictitious fabrications to diffuse the issue . That is called reframing the subject . Classic NLP and management negotiation domination speak . But also very transparent . The agenda in all these posts is to once again try and kick start the industry credibility myth back into its over extended , well past its design life , sell by date . Rational debate must never be allowed to continue , there be dragons . Classic reframing technique . You are right about everyone being public , regardless of what they stand for , everyone stands for something , especially those very same entities who accuse others of not being members of the public themselves . No-one is excluded , or excludable , just because they dare to object to anything at all . And we do not like what we see , and we will not stop until it is all exposed for what it is . A massive fraud perpetrated on the now awakening defrauded tax payer by the compromised government , the conniving financiers and the failing incompetent operators . Reply hewes62 says : February 9 , 2018 at 3:57 pm Ian Thanks . You may represent your members . I do not consider , for example that if IGas decide not to communicate with Frack Free Bassetlaw , that the public , of which I am a member , is not informed . If IGas are asked by the council , HSEx , And EA , for information , and it is not handed over , then I think they are not communicating as they should . Frack Free Bassetlaw does not represent me , nor the public at large . That TEare willing to discuss issues with the parish council shows , in my opinion , that they are indeed willing to discuss this with the public . We shall see how that goes . This holds , in my opinion , for any pressure group , be they anti fracking , anti wind farm , anti GM , anti EU or whatever . With regards to your comments on past performance of the company -LRB- mercaptans and tank cleaning etc -RRB- I think you are correct in that the company , from the information provided , has been somewhat diliatory in addressing the issues . Having looked at the Parish council meeting minutes and past and forthcoming agendas , it does not look as if there has been much activity either way . I am not sure why , especially as the operatives who work there live in the vicinity . Re frackers here today , gone tomorrow , yes . That applies to the conventional gas you have , the blast furnaces , iron ore mines , Rosedale railway , mixed farming , wheelrights , blacksmiths and even our good selves . But are you suggesting that those in your community who work locally and or abroad in the Hydrocarbon Industry leave the community you live in -LRB- as the request to renew planning permission is not dependant on fracking -RRB- . Reply Martin Collyer says : February 9 , 2018 at 1:20 pm I think you showed your bias pretty well there Ian . Not sure that you , and others with the same attitude , will get much back from TE when you are not willing to engage constructively . As INEOS get paid by those who wish to transport their output , it is unlikely that INEOS will be out of pocket . I would like to take the time to pull apart some of your assumptions but that will have to wait . You also fail to recognise that many people are thinking critically and researching these issues for themselves here . On that last point the worst thing I find about your argument is the smear that critics are probably just propagandists with -LRB- implied -RRB- Russian backing . That drags any argument into the gutter of ideological mudslinging and divisiveness . account . Notify me of new posts via email . This site uses Akismet to reduce spam .
