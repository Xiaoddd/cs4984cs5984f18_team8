The pipeline has been the focus of intense opposition from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota , who fear that a spill would poison their water supply , as well as from other Native Americans , Indigenous peoples in Canada , and environmentalists .

On Saturday , Democracy Now filmed construction site security guards attacking protesters with dogs and pepper spray . On Thursday it was reported that the North Dakota National Guard will be activated . TD subsidiary TD Securities , an investigation has revealed , is one of the seventeen banks that have provided project-level loans to Dakota Access LLC . An overlapping group of banks are also , according to data from Hugh MacMillan , a senior researcher with consumer advocacy group Food and Water Watch , financing the conversion of a second oil pipeline that would run from the southern end of Dakota Access to the Gulf . We employ due diligence in our lending and investing activities relating to energy production . We also work with our customers , community and environment groups , and energy clients to better understand key issues of concern , and to promote informed dialogue . Scotiabank is also identified as a lender to Sunoco Logistics only , while the Royal Bank of Canada has commitments to all three Energy Transfer family corporate credit lines . Neither provide project-level loans to Dakota Access LLC , however . The Royal Bank has also been accused of a conflict of interest after they recently upgraded their assessment of Enbridge , a part owner of the Bakken Pipeline System which includes the Dakota access line , encouraging investors to buy its stock even as the bank helps to fund one of its signature projects . Its author is Hugh MacMillan , of Food and Water Watch . Graphic via Food and Water Watch The data MacMillan collected shows relationships between banks and some of the companies , known as the Energy Transfer family , that own the Dakota Access LLC joint venture . RBC 's commitment stands out because of its focus on environmental initiatives , particularly on its well-advertised Blue Water Project . The poisoning of drinkable water is the central concern of Native American activists who oppose the pipeline . A spokesperson confirmed over the phone that RBC was financing the Energy Transfer family companies , but declined to comment further . RBC agreed to accept questions in writing but a response was not received by publication time . Phone calls and emails to Scotiabank were not returned . Energy Transfer companies , as well as Enbridge , along with Phillip 66 and Marathon Oil form the Dakota Access LLC joint venture , MacMillan explained . And we know that that 's exactly what we ca n't afford when it comes to the stability of our climate . MacMillan also acknowledged the consequences that banks could face from more public awareness . Groups such as Move Your Money and Fossil Free Canada encourage cutting ties with banks that finance fossil fuel projects . Spreading opposition Indigenous people in Canada and others have been traveling to North Dakota in recent days to express solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux . Acts of resistance have also spread to other U.S. states , while media coverage of the attacks on Native American protesters on Saturday has also spurred public outcry . Representative David Greendeer is a legislator with the Ho-Chunk Nation in Wisconsin , one of the many Native American groups that have sent letters of support to the Standing Rock Sioux . Greendeer explained that the Ho-Chunk Nation 's motivation stemmed from it being affected by the sand mining industry in Wisconsin and that much of the fracking sand used on the Bakken oilfield comes from the state . We do n't see this as a protest . We do n't really see this as a fight . We do n't see it from that perspective . The Mother Earth and the Creator have a calling . We are the Creator 's people . He expressed concern for the tribe 's ability to cope with the influx of supporters and for the risk that the tribe will be blamed for any disorder . The tribe asked them to come there and to help protect and pray . Revelations no surprise to coalition members Angie Carter , a board member with the Women , Food and Agriculture Network , itself a member of the Bakken Pipeline Resistance Coalition , is concerned about the impact of the pipeline on Indigenous groups , women , and the water and farmland that it will cross . Members of the coalition were among those recently arrested in central Iowa when they tried to halt construction activity by forming human chains . She responded to the revelations of MacMillan 's work in a phone interview with Ricochet on Wednesday evening . We 've long known that the banks have been taking advantage of and exploiting vulnerable people throughout the mortgage crisis and our financial recession . She also responded to the attacks which injured protesters . It was horrifying to see that footage . I think that was very shocking for many people . Archambault , the Standing Rock Sioux leader , has called for investigations over the incident . Brenda Brink , an activist with Bakken Pipeline Resistance from Huxley , Iowa , witnessed a smudging ceremony on Sunday at the site of the attack that was meant to bring healing . She expressed worry about the escalating tension . It 's to that point now . The Governor 's ordered the National Guard to the protect the workers . Brink also reacted to MacMillan 's investigation . We are up against the most powerful force on the globe . And I do believe that . But Brink also expressed skepticism over the effectiveness of boycotts and divestment , at least in the short-term efforts to stop the pipeline . It 's only going to be public outrage .
