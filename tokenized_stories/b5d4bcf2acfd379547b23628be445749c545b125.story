A few seconds later , a nuclear bomb two and a half times the size of the one that dropped on Hiroshima exploded less than two miles below him . As a 33-year-old anti-nuke hippie , McQueary was protesting the blast , an experimental operation attempting to retrieve natural gas from deep below the earth . A five-mile quarantine zone had been set up around the site with the understanding that the blast would not go off if humans remained within the boundary . But the project had experienced repeated delays already , and despite McQueary and his crew setting off smoke flares to announce their presence , the 40-kiloton nuclear device was , in fact , detonated . The blast was one of several projects under Operation Plowshare , a postwar plan to use nuclear explosions for peacetime purposes . In addition to energy production , plans were also in the works to use nuclear explosions to widen the Panama Canal , link underground aquifers in Arizona , and carve rail lines and highways through mountainous regions . But by 1975 , hefty expenses , public outcry , and a lack of economic return brought Plowshare to a dismal halt . Of course , that was after 27 bombs had already been detonated . The first subterranean blast intended to retrieve natural gas was titled Project Gasbuggy . The 29-kiloton bomb was detonated in northern New Mexico in 1967 . After waiting a month for radioisotopes to decay , drilling began and scientists working with the Atomic Energy Commission estimated the Gasbuggy well was producing five times the gas of nearby wells drilled with hydraulic fracturing . Though these numbers were disputed by outside investigators , the project was looking like a success . Two additional , and much bigger , blasts would go off in Colorado before anyone realized -LRB- or at least acknowledged -RRB- that the gas was completely unusable . While Plowshare was in effect , large swaths of the American public remained skeptical that nuclear weapons could be safely detonated for non-military purposes . After the New Yorker published excerpts from the Pulitzer Prize-winning book Hiroshima in 1947 , and again when further information about the bombings was released in 1951 , citizens developed a crazed fear of the Bomb . It would take a lot of convincing before Coloradans would allow it to be detonated in their own backyard , even underground . Prior to laying his life on the line protesting the bombing in Rulison , Chester McQueary had encountered his first nuclear blast during a high school trip through Nevada in 1953 . However , if you proceed , you must not leave your vehicle under any circumstances until you reach Cedar City in Utah . If your vehicle becomes disabled , you will not leave it until help arrives . You will not open your doors or roll down your windows . If Project Rulison explosion was a success , it was estimated that another 1,500 underground nuclear explosions would commence throughout Colorado in the years to come . Public hearings were held and editorials were written , and an 11th-hour ruling by the Supreme Court came down on the scheduled day of the blast allowing it to go ahead . While they camped , the date of the blast kept getting pushed back due to concerns about high winds potentially blowing fallout outside the quarantine area . McQueary and his crew listened to the news on battery-operated radios , while friends below told anyone who would listen that there were people up there near the detonation site . This was important , because just before the group left for Rulison , they consulted with a geologist who told them that if they should end up at the site during the blast , it was important not to position themselves below cliffs or any giant trees that might come whipping across the earth . The very moment news arrived in Colorado that the Supreme Court had ruled in favor of Operation Plowshare , the scientists detonated the bomb . Some of them were caught and ordered at gunpoint onto the aircraft . He recalls that just as he watched the chopper pull away , one of the soldiers flashed him a peace sign . Clutching their portable radio , the two of them laid prostrate on the ground and listened to the countdown . Following the blast , gravity caused the chimney of the well to collapse . Worse , the gas they could retrieve was so contaminated with radioactive material that none of it was deemed safe enough for use in the average household . One failed experiment after another resulted in either environmental damage , contaminated gas , or both . With each project being more disastrous than the one before it , neither the public nor Congress were pleased . In 1973 , Operation Plowshare birthed its most destructively ambitious scheme yet . Only 75 miles from Rulison , the blast site of Rio Blanco absorbed three separate 33-kiloton bombs , each buried a mile beneath the earth . Ralph Nader , Senator Floyd Haskell , the State Board of Health , and others were critical of the project , but the optimism among Atomic Energy Commission scientists that a blast six times the size of Hiroshima would get the job done overcame the public outcry . Rio Blanco ran into the same tainted-gas conundrum as the Rulison and Gasbuggy tests that came before it . In each case , a large pond of radioactive fluid collected at the bottom of the wells , which was then sealed over with concrete . At the same time , alternative , non-nuclear technologies were being developed , such as hydrofracturing . Hydraulic fracking , on the other hand , remains an economic powerhouse and source of contentious public debate in Colorado and other states to this day . Modern fracking is a much more subtle process , which squirts water down in there , and instead of a sudden shock , it keeps applying pressure , making the rock crack instead of using a bang . Activists like Shane Davis have been voicing concern about the inevitability that some number of these new wells are subject to damage , which could then leak harmful fracking fluid into groundwater . Davis does not share his optimism . Follow Josiah M. Hesse on Twitter .
