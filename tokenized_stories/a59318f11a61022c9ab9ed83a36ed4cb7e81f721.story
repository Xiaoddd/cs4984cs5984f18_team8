Brazil 's indigenous communities are protesting as the Supreme Court deliberates on the legality of President Michel Temer 's plan to restrict land titles awarded to their communities . Mato Grosso , a large Brazilian state on the border with Bolivia , had argued the reserves were created in the 1960s on state lands . In an 8-0 decision , the Supreme Federal Tribunal disagreed , saying the land was owned by the federal government and it had the right to hand over the territory to the indigenous communities . Her comment alluded to claims by indigenous communities that their way of life has increasingly come under fire during the administration of President Michel Temer . Last month , Temer signed a recommendation to block the demarcation of any land on which indigenous people were not living by 1988 , the year of Brazil 's latest constitution . Indigenous advocates rejected the proposal , arguing that many native communities had been violently forced from their lands before that date . They accuse Temer of signing the recommendation to cater to the interests of the powerful agribusiness bloc in Congress who he depends on to stay in power . There are more than 700 requests for the demarcation of indigenous land pending and Temer has not signed one of them during his 16 months in power .
