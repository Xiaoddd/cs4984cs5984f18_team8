The Dakota Access Pipeline , enabled by Barack Obama signing a bill in 2015 to lift a ban on U.S. Oil exports creating the demand for domestic pipelines to be built for oil export , emerged as a movement for indigenous rights and environmentalism , as camps close to where the pipeline is being constructed under Lake Oahe in North Dakota swelled with water protectors trying to halt its construction in 2016 . Pipeline security and local police forces made controversial headlines throughout late 2016 with their use of militaristic tactics against the water protectors , including the use of overt propaganda , water cannons in sub-freezing temperatures , attack dogs , and inflicting severe injuries against water protectors . The memos recently removed from the Department of Interior website could provide the necessary evidence for a court to rule in favor of the Standing Rock Sioux . Sunoco Logistics , the company that will operate the Dakota Access Pipeline , tops charts in the United States for most oil spills , with over 200 leaks since 2010 . The memos also affirmed that the Army Corps of Engineers made no efforts to consult with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe after the decision to move the original pipeline route . My intuition says that many & different groups are sympathetic to those who have been legally cheated . After gold was discovered , the US govt . essentially decided to unilaterally ignore the treaty . Many people categorize those stories as old history , so it helps , on both sides , to link them to ongoing legal violations .
