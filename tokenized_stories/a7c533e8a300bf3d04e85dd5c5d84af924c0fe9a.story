John Maxfield -LRB- JohnMaxfield37 -RRB- Jan 29 , 2017 at 9:09 AM Wells Fargo owes Donald Trump a thank-you note . Wells Fargo -LRB- NYSE : WFC -RRB- found itself in an unusual position over the past few months , going from golden child of the bank industry to its fallen angel thanks to a scandal and a series of regulatory missteps . But the tide has already begun to turn for the nation 's third largest bank by assets , thanks in no small part to the new presidential administration . The regulatory rollback has begun Earlier this week , the U.S. Labor Department removed a website it had created to log complaints from Wells Fargo employees who claimed to have been retaliated against by supervisors for blowing the whistle on a massive fake-account scandal that look place at the bank from at least 2011 through 2015 . The removal was noted by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren in a letter to acting Labor Secretary Edward Hugler . This move is consistent with other ones that the Trump administration has taken to begin rolling back regulations in the financial services industry and others . But it comes at an especially important time for Wells Fargo . A series of unfortunate events The California-based bank has had a number of run-ins with regulators over the past five months . It all started in September , when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau revealed that thousands of Wells Fargo employees had opened millions of accounts for customers , without customer approval to do so , in order to meet aggressive sales quotas . At first glance , it appeared as if Wells Fargo would suffer only minimal damage from the scandal . On top of that , there was little reason for the bank to be concerned that its customers would abandon it , given how inconvenient it is to change banks . But any thought that Wells Fargo could simply close the book on the scandal was shot down when its chairman and CEO at the time , John Stumpf , was publicly harangued by members of congress in hearings later that month . His belated response to the crisis combined with a disappointing performance in front of Congress led to his resignation two weeks later . Things continued to deteriorate from there . In November , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency began requiring Wells Fargo to seek regulatory approval for changes to its executive officers or board of directors . And then in December , after failing a critical regulatory test , the Federal Reserve limited its ability to make acquisitions or expand internationally . The good news was that the scandal did n't have a debilitating impact on Wells Fargo 's fourth-quarter earnings . The bad news , however , is that it will almost certainly result in lower long-term growth , a point its new CEO Tim Sloan has acknowledged . Both figures fell after Wells Fargo eliminated sales quotas in its bank branches in the wake of the scandal . Suffice it to say , then , Wells Fargo is undoubtedly ecstatic with the latest turn of events . Beyond the Labor Department 's decision to take down the whistleblower website , the Trump administration has promised to dramatically deregulate the bank industry and defang the very same regulatory bodies that have made life so difficult for Wells Fargo over the past few months .
