I had been in Iowa to attend an annual Catholic Worker gathering , a weekend of camping , roundtables , skits , and socializing , mostly with Christian anarchist folks from the Midwest who are engaged in hospitality , simple living with people at the margins , and social activism , either on farming communes or communal houses in cities . Eight of us decided to take advantage of our proximity to construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and spent Saturday , September 17 , with protesters at Mississippi Stand , where Catholic Workers and others had already been disrupting pipeline construction for several weeks . We turned down the drive and met a kind family who was offering their yard and driveway as a parking lot for people coming to the demonstration . We parked and took a tractor-pulled ride down to the protest site . Tractor ride from a parking area down to the protest site As we neared the site , we passed a row of tents along the road where protesters had been staying since late August . Nearly 350 miles of the planned pipeline stretches diagonally across Iowa before crossing under the Mississippi River in Keokuk and into central Illinois . Entire ecosystems depend on soil health , as it in turn affects vegetation and microorganisms as well as the animals and others that use vegetation for food and shelter . Many people were coming from Keokuk and other cities throughout Iowa and across the river in Illinois , and others traveled farther from St. Louis ; Springfield , IL ; South Bend , IN ; Evansville , IN , and other places in the region . Many came in solidarity with those at Standing Rock or for their own kids , grandkids and future generations . I had come for many of those reasons , too . There was also an explanation of the proposed action and time for folks to discern if they were willing to risk arrest , as well as a presentation about possible legal consequences . In one of the role plays , everyone partnered up and took turns acting like a police officer and someone who was being arrested . One person gave a short presentation about the use of civil disobedience as a tactic , or perhaps even an obligatory step , toward fighting oppression and injustice . Intentionally breaking an unjust law and being arrested for it , such as during sit-ins during the civil rights movement , was described almost as a noble deed . I had decided that I was willing to risk arrest . According to organizers who had been in conflict with the construction for couple of weeks , it was likely that the group using the access road would be stopped by law enforcement fairly quickly , at which point people had at least two choices . They could stop walking toward the construction site and therefore likely avoid any risk of arrest but be unable to interfere with construction . Alternatively , people could continue moving toward the construction site , which would allow them to potentially stop construction , but would likely put them at risk of arrest for trespass , disorderly conduct , or interference with official acts . The group that approached through the woods faced a similar scenario , except that they would likely be at very low risk for arrest until they reached the end of the private property , which was within easy earshot and eyesight of the construction site . People gathering to walk toward the construction site , with the Mississippi River in the background Two of the other people I had come with had decided that they were willing to risk arrest as well . A group of police formed a line between the two groups of protesters , and when the lagging group reached the police , the group stopped moving and grew quiet . A police officer pulled out a piece of paper that he read in a loud but shaky voice , explaining that we were not allowed on the property and would be trespassing if we continued past the police line . I felt disappointed that we were making their job easier . As the police officer finished reading the statement , I started walking farther up the hill . The others who were already past the police line also continued on , and many from the larger group joined us . Protesters approaching the first line of police en route to the Bakken pipeline construction site on the other side of the hill We met a second line of police . The police officer directly in front of me looked nervous and kept looking over at the other officers as if begging someone to step in and take over . The officer spoke in an unsteady voice and choppy sentences . In our role plays , the police officer was always aggressive and authoritative , but the person in front of me was scared and hesitant . I decided to try to step around . Again , looking back , I think I could have pressed on . I was nervous , too , because when it comes down to it , police can always just resort to their tasers , their guns , and the system that supports their harassment and control . I knew from the pre-protest legal talk that under Iowa law , to be guilty of trespass , one has to enter a space without permission , be explicitly asked to leave , and continue to stay in the space . This kind of back and forth went on for a while , until one of the other police officers was free , came over , and said I could leave or get arrested . The group at the base of the access road parted to make way for those who were arrested to come back down the hill Since I was last to be arrested , I was first to go back down the hill , through the crowd of protesters and into the paddy wagon . And that was exhilarating . In such a weird way . In that moment , I was in a new place surrounded by various people , only a few of whom I knew . I was taking in the sights and sounds and energy of fifty or more people cheering as we walked through the parted crowd . I was noticing the Mississippi River , majestic as ever , in the background . As others who were arrested trickled into the jail , I learned about the efforts of the group that went through the woods toward the construction site . Protesters emerging from the woods and continuing toward the construction site on the horizon As predicted , protesters who went through the woods were able to get rather close to the site before police presented them with the option of stopping or getting arrested . For an hour . I was told that , eventually , energy for chanting and carrying on dwindled , and the protesters retreated . Maybe . Not likely . I also think about how the action relates to privilege . Many -LRB- but definitely not all -RRB- of the organizers and people who risked arrest were white and had the ability to pay fines , which was seen as the likeliest consequence of the action . The action likely excluded some people of color or asked them to take a greater risk . At the same time , the action brought in many locals who were participating in their first protest or first act of civil disobedience with a risk of arrest , and I wonder what value that adds to the action and the overall momentum and effectiveness of the NoDAPL compaign . If the goal that day was simply to stop construction for as long as possible , I wonder what would have been more effective . For instance , if we all would have gone through the woods to the edge of private property , where we could legally be , and put all of our effort into distracting the construction workers , maybe we could have found creative ways to keep ourselves engaged and could have stopped construction for longer than an hour . I wonder , too , what people are taking away from the action . I have a shared experience with these friends and strangers . I have a story to tell . Probably not . A few hours of my time here and there . A reason to go back to Iowa -LRB- for court -RRB- or to avoid Iowa forever -LRB- or at least avoid getting pulled over there -RRB- . Maybe . But fuck jobs . The other person opted to plead guilty by mail . I plan to go to my scheduled arraignment . Our mission is to provide a resilient platform to publicize and promote revolutionary theory and action .
