The project had been put on hold under the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama , but new President Donald Trump , a Republican , helped put it back on track . The federal government this week cleared way for the project to resume , leading the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to file a court challenge on Thursday seeking a temporary restraining order to halt construction and drilling for the pipeline . The court set oral arguments on the legal challenge for Monday . Legal experts say the tribe faces long odds in convincing any court to halt construction , Energy Transfer Partners needs only to cross beneath Lake Oahe , part of the Missouri River system , to connect a final 1,100-foot -LRB- 335 meter -RRB- gap in the 1,170-mile -LRB- 1,885 km -RRB- pipeline , which will move oil from the Bakken shale formation to a terminus in Patoka , Illinois . Supporters say the pipeline will be safer than transporting oil by rail or road , and industry leaders have praised the project for creating high-paying jobs With work on the final tranche now under way , Energy Transfer Partners expects the Dakota Access Pipeline to begin operations in approximately 83 days , according to a company spokeswoman . She declined to specify when drilling began except that it was after the company received federal permission on Wednesday . Public opposition drew thousands of people to the North Dakota plains last year including high-profile political and celebrity supporters . Large protest camps popped up near the site , leading to several violent clashes and some 700 arrests . A few hardy protesters have remained camped out near the lake , braving sub-freezing temperatures . Among them is Frank Archambault , 45 , who has lived in the camp since August when he left his home on the Standing Rock reservation . Ptery Light , 55 , of Portland , Oregon , who has lived in the main camp since Oct. 31 , said he was not giving up hope . For now , their hopes are pinned on the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe winning a legal victory . To obtain the temporary restraining order , the tribe must convince the judge there will be immediate harm suffered and prove it has a strong overall case should its lawsuit to halt the project result in a full trial . -LRB- Additional reporting by Daniel Wallis in New York , writing by Daniel Trotta ; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Matthew Lewis -RRB- Posted in : News Subscribe If you enjoyed this article , subscribe to receive more just like it .
