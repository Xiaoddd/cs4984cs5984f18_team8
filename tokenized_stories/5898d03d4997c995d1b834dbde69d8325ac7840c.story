The pipeline was projected to run from the Bakken oil fields in western North Dakota to southern Illinois , crossing beneath the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers , as well as under part of Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation . Many in the Standing Rock tribe considered the pipeline and its intended crossing of the Missouri River to constitute a threat to the region 's clean water and to ancient burial grounds . In April 2016 , Standing Rock Sioux elder LaDonna Brave Bull Allard established a camp as a center for cultural preservation and spiritual resistance to the pipeline ; over the summer the camp grew to thousands of people . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had conducted a limited review of the route and found no significant impact , but in March and April 2016 the Environmental Protection Agency , the Department of Interior , and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation asked the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a formal Environmental Impact Assessment and issue an Environmental Impact Statement . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed suit against the Corps of Engineers in July , but the motion was denied . In December , under President Barack Obama 's administration the Corps of Engineers denied an easement for construction of the pipeline under the Missouri River . Several acts of violence used on protesters gained a great deal of media attention . In September 2016 , construction workers bulldozed a section of land the tribe had identified as sacred ground and when protesters entered the area security workers used attack dogs which bit at least six of the protesters and one horse . The incident was filmed and viewed by several million people on YouTube and other social media . In October , armed soldiers and police with riot gear and military equipment cleared an encampment that was directly in the proposed pipeline 's path . In November , police use of water cannons on protesters in freezing weather drew significant media attention . During the protest numerous high profile activists and Congressional Democrats spoke out for the rights of the tribe . Senator Bernie Sanders actively supported the movement and President Obama spoke with tribal leaders and offered his support . Standing Rock Chairman David Archambault II , arrested and strip searched himself while protesting , gave numerous interviews explaining the tribe 's positions ; he also addressed the tribe 's positions at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva , Switzerland .

Routing the pipeline across the Missouri River near Bismarck was rejected because of the route 's proximity to municipal water sources ; residential areas ; and road , wetland , and waterway crossings . The alternative selected by the Corps of Engineers crossed underneath the Missouri River half a mile -LRB- 800 m -RRB- from the Standing Rock Indian Reservation . However , citing potential effects on the Native tribes , most notably the Standing Rock Sioux , in March and April 2016 the Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- , the Department of Interior -LRB- DOI -RRB- , and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a formal Environmental Impact Assessment and issue an Environmental Impact Statement -LRB- EIS -RRB- . Noting that the water system serving Fort Yates on the Standing Rock Reservation was only 10 miles -LRB- 16 km -RRB- downstream of where the pipeline would cross Lake Oahe and the Missouri River , the EPA recommended that the Army Corps revise its Environmental Assessment and open up a second public comment period . The DOI also expressed concerns about the pipeline 's proximity to the tribe 's water source : The routing of a 12 - to 30-inch crude oil pipeline in close proximity to and upstream of the Reservation is of serious concern to the Department . When establishing the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe 's permanent homeland , the U.S. reserved waters of sufficient quantity and quality to serve the purposes of the Reservation . The Department holds more than 800,000 acres of land in trust for the Tribe that could be impacted by a leak or spill . Further , a spill could impact the waters that the Tribe and individual tribal members residing in that area rely upon for drinking and other purposes . In September , Allard said : Of the 380 archaeological sites that face desecration along the entire pipeline route , from North Dakota to Illinois , 26 of them are right here at the confluence of these two rivers . It is a historic trading ground , a place held sacred not only by the Sioux Nations , but also the Arikara , the Mandan , and the Northern Cheyenne ... The U.S. government is wiping out our most important cultural and spiritual areas . And as it erases our footprint from the world , it erases us as a people . These sites must be protected , or our world will end , it is that simple . Our young people have a right to know who they are . They have a right to language , to culture , to tradition . The way they learn these things is through connection to our lands and our history . By late September NBC News reported that members of more than 300 federally recognized Native American tribes were residing in the three main camps , alongside an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 pipeline resistance supporters . As winter approached numbers grew lower , but the protesters winterized and prepared for an indefinite stay . They have been very active in raising public awareness through social media , petitions , teach-ins , rallies , and videos . In May 2016 , 13-year-old Anna Lee Rain Yellowhammer and thirty young people launched a petition that opposed the pipeline . Speaking in an interview with Truthout in June 2016 , Tokata Iron Eyes , a 12-year-old Lakota girl who has been one of the leading youth organizers in the campaign , said : The role of Indigenous young women coming together in this campaign has also been paramount , signaling the enduring strength of Indigenous women 's leadership in questions of tribal governance . Women were the people who held the tribe together and they were the willpower of the tribe and its strength . The group was founded by Jaslyn Charger -LRB- Cheyenne River Sioux of Eagle Butte , South Dakota -RRB- . Tara Houska -LRB- Ojibwe , Couchiching First Nation of International Falls , Minnesota -RRB- , national campaigns director of Honor the Earth , has actively helped to explain the protest aims . In a letter to the Iowa Utilities Board , Tribal chairwoman Judith Bender wrote : As a people that have lived in North America for thousands of years , we have environmental concerns about the land and drinking water ... Our main concern is Iowa 's aquifers might be significantly damaged . And it will only take one mistake and life in Iowa will change for the next thousands of years . The tribe sued for an injunction on the grounds that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had failed to conduct a proper environmental and cultural impact study . The Standing Rock Sioux tribe believes that the pipeline would put the Missouri River , the water source for the reservation , at risk . The Tribe was also concerned that the pipeline route may run through sacred Sioux sites . Peaceful protests continued and drew indigenous people from throughout North America , as well as other supporters . When unarmed protesters crossed the perimeter fence to stop the bulldozers , the guards used pepper spray and guard dogs to attack . At least six protesters were treated for dog bites , and an estimated 30 were pepper-sprayed before the guards and their dogs left the scene in trucks . Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said they were investigating both sides in the incident , including wounds inflicted by the dogs , and that they had no prior knowledge of the use of dogs until a 9-1-1 call was made . This was more like a riot than a protest . Individuals crossed onto private property and accosted private security officers with wooden posts and flag poles . The aggression and violence displayed here today is unlawful and should not be repeated . I did n't think it was appropriate . On September 7 an arrest warrant was also issued in Morton County for Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein and her running mate Ajamu Baraka on misdemeanor counts of criminal trespass and criminal mischief . A warrant for journalist Amy Goodman 's arrest was issued by Morton County on September 8 . On October 1 , Canadian journalist Ed Ou , on assignment with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to cover the protests , was detained at the US border for six hours , with his cell phones and other electronic media confiscated . Speaking on October 5 , Standing Rock Tribal Chairman David Archambault II said that as of that date 135 anti-pipeline demonstrators had been arrested . On October 17 , District Judge John Grinsteiner did not find probable cause for multiple riot charges , including the one brought against Goodman . Some protesters who were arrested for misdemeanors and taken to the Morton County jail reported what they considered harsh and unusual treatment . Cody Hall from Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota also reported being strip-searched . Amnesty International spoke out against the use of strip searches and said that they had sent a letter to the Morton County Sheriff 's Department expressing concern about the degree of force used against people taking part in the protests . I ca n't stress it enough , this is a public safety issue . I mean , they were very worried about the possibility of violence . You have seen law enforcement marshaled from six states , armored personnel carriers , hundreds and hundreds of law enforcement officers with concussion grenades , mace , Tasers , batons . And they used all of it . And it finally took an elder to actually walk by himself in between the two lines , stand there , face his people , and say : ` Go home . Police must keep the peace using minimal force appropriate to the situation . Confronting men , women , and children while outfitted in gear more suited for the battlefield is a disproportionate response . The bridge is about a mile -LRB- 1600 m -RRB- south of where the pipeline developer plans to drill . A number of videos posted on social media show protesters being doused with continuous streams of water . A woman 's arm was seriously injured by an explosion that protesters claimed was part of a concussion grenade but which police suggest may have been an exploding propane canister . By December the protest camp had dwindled to a few hundred people due to the construction work stoppage and harsh winter weather . Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault called for the camp to disband because of the weather and the possibility of contamination of the river with garbage and debris during the spring flood . In February 2017 , amid concerns that warmer weather would accelerate flooding of the area , removal of garbage and debris from the campsite began to prevent the contamination of the river . On February 23 , National Guard and law enforcement officers evicted the remaining protesters . Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. On September 9 , U.S. District Judge James Boasberg denied the motion . Later the same day , a joint statement was issued by the US Departments of Justice , Army , and Interior temporarily halting the project on federal land bordering or under the Lake Oahe reservoir . In closing the agency representatives said : Finally , we fully support the rights of all Americans to assemble and speak freely . In recent days , we have seen thousands of demonstrators come together peacefully , with support from scores of sovereign tribal governments , to exercise their First Amendment rights and to voice heartfelt concerns about the environment and historic , sacred sites . They did not indicate that they would voluntarily cease work on the pipeline . On October 5 , federal appeals judges heard arguments over whether to stop work on the pipeline ; a ruling was not expected for several weeks . At that time the Army Corps of Engineers had not yet made a final decision on whether to grant an easement to build under the Missouri River . Speaking on the PBS Newshour on November 16 , Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren responded to questions about the Tribe 's two main concerns , damage to ancestral sites and the potential of water contamination if a leak occurred : Well , first of all , I think this is well known by now . We 're not on any Indian property at all , no Native American property . We 're on private lands . That 's number one . Number two , this pipeline is new steel pipe . We 're boring underneath Lake Oahe . It 's going to go 90 feet to 150 feet -LRB- 27.5-45.7 m -RRB- below the lake 's surface . It 's thick wall pipe , extra thick , by the way , more so than just the normal pipe that we lay . Also , on each side of the lake , there 's automated valves that , if in the very , very unlikely situation there were to be a leak , our control room shuts down the pipe , encapsulates that small section that could be in peril . So , that 's just not going to happen . Number one , we 're not going to have a leak . And , number two , there is no way there would be any crude contaminate their water supply . The announcement was made by the Assistant Secretary of the Army -LRB- Civil Works -RRB- , Jo-Ellen Darcy : Although we have had continuing discussion and exchanges of new information with the Standing Rock Sioux and Dakota Access , it 's clear that there 's more work to do . Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners issued a same-day response : The White House 's directive today to the Corps for further delay is just the latest in a series of overt and transparent political actions by an administration which has abandoned the rule of law in favor of currying favor with a narrow and extreme political constituency . As stated all along , ETP and SXL fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe . On February 8 , 2017 , the U.S. Army Core of Engineers -LRB- USACE -RRB- granted Dakota Access , LLC an easement based on the Mineral Leasing Act to cross Lake Oahe and finish construction of the pipeline . On February 14 , 2017 , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed a motion for summary judgment . The motion asked the Court to rule on unresolved legal questions concerning USACE , including the meeting of National Environmental Policy Act -LRB- NEPA -RRB- requirements and the violation of Tribal treaty rights . The court halted construction on the pipeline until USACE could adequately address these concerns . The Court 's finding did not include a decision on continuing pipeline operation , but did request an additional briefing on the subject . The Tribes received support from law professors and practitioners , tribes and tribal organizations , and other amicus parties . The Court granted the Tribes ' motion for summary judgment for three reasons . First , the Court held that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers failed to address expert critiques of Dakota Access , LLC 's oil spill risk analysis . Finally , the Court found that USACE conducted a skewed assessment that reached the conclusion that the selected site raised no environmental justice concerns . On October 11 , 2017 , the Court ruled that DAPL could continue to operate while USACE reassessed the environmental impact of the pipeline . While the Court did not find that shutting down the pipeline would cause a major economic disruption as claimed by DAPL , they refused to shut the pipeline down during the impact study due to the possibility that USACE would be able to justify its decision to not do a full environmental review . USACE predicts that the review will be finished by April 2018 . Following the Court 's finding a statement was issued by Earthjustice Attorney Jan Hasselman , who is representing the Tribe . Today 's decision is a disappointing continuation of a historic pattern : other people get all the profits , and the Tribes get all the risk and harm . The court already found that the Corps violated the law when it issued the permits without thoroughly considering the impact on the people of Standing Rock . The Court ordered three measures , which had been requested by the Tribe . According to a report published by Earthjustice , a non-profit public interest law organization dedicated to environmental issues : The Court ordered the Corps and DAPL to work with the Tribes to complete oil spill response plans at Lake Oahe . Up to now , the Tribe has been kept in the dark about spill response planning and was not involved in the process of developing plans to address spills at Lake Oahe . Second , the Court ordered an independent audit of DAPL 's compliance with the permit conditions and standards . The Tribe has to be involved in the selection of an auditor . Finally , DAPL must file regular reports on any incidents or repairs on the pipeline . The conditions were all opposed by the Corps and by DAPL . TigerSwan also collected information used to assist prosecutors in building cases against protesters and used social media in an attempt to sway public support for the pipeline . Trump signing the Presidential memoranda to advance the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines . Expect mass resistance far beyond what Trump has seen so far . We are opposed to reckless and politically motivated development projects , like DAPL , that ignore our treaty rights and risk our water . Indigenous drummers , activists from a number of Nations , and diverse supporters march in solidarity . Dakota Access Pipeline protestors at March for a Clean Energy Revolution , Philadelphia , July 2016 Solidarity rally in Saint Paul , Minnesota , September 2016 . Standing Rock solidarity march in San Francisco , November 2016 . Native Nations Rise march in Washington D.C. , March 2017 . Oklahoma tribes also expressed support for the pipeline protest movement . Like the Keystone XL pipeline , which I opposed since day one , the Dakota Access fracked oil pipeline , will transport some of the dirtiest fuel on the planet . Regardless of the court 's decision , the Dakota Access pipeline must be stopped . Field reporter Jordan Chariton -LRB- of The Young Turks ' on-the-road program TYT Politics -RRB- was one of the most active journalists participating in the protests . As a long standing climate change activist , Klein said that past resistance has brought about change incrementally and only after a delay following mass actions . Standing Rock is different . This time the movement was still out on the land in massive numbers when the news came down . The line between resistance and results is bright and undeniable . That kind of victory is rare precisely because it 's contagious , because it shows people everywhere that organizing and resistance are not futile . The mayor of Seattle and city council members joined leaders from Northwest tribes from Quinualt , Makah , Lummi , Suquamish , Tulalip , Swinomish , Puyallup and others to show opposition to the pipeline . This is much larger than a specific infrastructure project . In October , the Morton County Sheriff requested police from surrounding areas to assist in regulating the protests near the pipeline . Looking Horse called upon President Obama to keep his word : When you met with our people on your campaign trail in Sioux Falls , South Dakota , you stated that you are a lawyer and understand treaty documents . You told us that you realized our treaties were violated and you would address these violations against our people if you became President . Senator Bernie Sanders spoke at a protest in front of the White House . Robert Kennedy Jr. visited the protest camp and spoke to the protesters . The influx of many new people over Thanksgiving weekend caused new problems , according to some activists . The organizers of these protests included retired Baltimore police sergeant Michael A. Wood , Jr. , and Wes Clark , Jr. , the son of former Supreme NATO Commander and 2004 presidential candidate Wesley Clark . Following the executive order made by President Trump in January 2017 which overturned the decision of former President Obama to halt the construction of the pipeline and the February order in which he authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed , US veterans returned to Standing Rock to a form human shield to protect Dakota Access pipeline protesters . We 've stood in the face of fire before . In March 2017 , the Standing Rock Sioux tribe led a four-day protest in Washington D.C. , culminating in the Native Nations Rise march on March 10 . Following the use of the National Guard and police in riot gear to remove protesters from a protest camp in October , Sanders again called on the president to suspend construction of the pipeline . With promises broken , land stolen and sacred lands desecrated , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is standing up for their right to clean water . They have lost land for settlers to farm , more land for gold in the Black Hills , and then again , even more , land for the dam that was built for hydropower . He again discussed the protest movement on November 2 , saying : We 're monitoring this closely . My view is that there is a way for us to accommodate sacred lands of Native Americans . And I think that right now the Army Corps is examining whether there are ways to reroute this pipeline . Several members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives weighed in on the protest on November 29 , 2016 . Native American lacrosse players Lyle Thompson and his brothers Miles , Jeremy and Hiana and others including Bill O'Brien and Scott Marr , used social media to support the protesters . They visited the camp as well , bringing lacrosse sticks and organizing games , giving instructions to those who had never before played the game . Following President Trump 's January 2017 reversal of the Court decisions made under the Obama administration , the players said that they planned to continue with their support . In an interview she recalled her visit to Standing Rock as a tipping point , saying that she had previously felt that the only way to effectively run for office was if you had access to wealth , social influence , and power . Retrieved November 3 , 2016 . It is crucial that people recognize that Standing Rock is part of an ongoing struggle against colonial violence . So when you talk about Standing Rock , please begin by acknowledging that this pipeline was redirected from an area where it was most likely to impact white people . washingtonpost.com .
