The rules developed under President Barack Obama would have applied mainly in the West , where most federal lands are located . Companies would have had to disclose the chemicals used in fracking , which pumps pressurized water underground to break open hydrocarbon deposits . The rules to be rescinded Friday were supposed to take effect in 2015 but a federal judge in Wyoming blocked them at the last minute . In September , the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver declined to rule in that case because the Trump administration intended to rescind the rules . The long-awaited change drew praise from industry groups including the Washington , D.C.-based Independent Petroleum Association of America and Denver-based Western Energy Alliance , which sued to block the rules . They claimed the federal rules would have duplicated state rules , putting unnecessary and expensive burdens on petroleum developers . Fracking has been so successful in boosting production over the past decade it has become almost synonymous with oil and gas drilling . In many areas , it would be rare nowadays for a gas or oil well to not be fracked . The process requires several million gallons of water each time . Environmentalists say the potential risks to groundwater require regulation . Copyright 2018 The Associated Press . All rights reserved .
