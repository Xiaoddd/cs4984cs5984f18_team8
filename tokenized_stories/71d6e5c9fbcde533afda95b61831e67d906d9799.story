We have never provided and will never provide our collective free , prior and informed consent - the minimal international standard - to the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline Project or the Kinder Morgan Man Camps . Kinder Morgan is applying for a 1000-worker Blue River Campsite on 16 hectares of our lands where we harvest berries . We are also opposed to Kinder Morgan 's anti-spawning mats . Even though Kinder Morgan has been ordered to stop installing these mats , we have found and removed anti-spawning mats from our waters . Salmon are our sacred lifeline through generations and we will not compromise the health of our salmon . Kinder Morgan and any other corporate colonial project that seeks to go through and destroy our nation and land will be refused passage . We stand resolutely together against any and all threats to our peoples , our women , our two-spirits , our children , our lands , the wildlife , the salmon , the waterways . This is a consistent pattern of the settler state over the past century . Hudson 's Bay Company prohibited European women from accompanying , and flooded Indigenous lands with non-Indigenous men who kidnapped , sexually exploited , enslaved and sold Indigenous women . As development results in the destruction of our land base and our food sovereignty , it also drives up food and housing prices . This further intensifies our economic insecurity and we are forced into even more vulnerable conditions . The Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota , for example , is at the epicenter of the Bakken shale oil boom - one of the largest sources for oil extraction in the U.S. . The rates of violence against women at Fort Berthold have tripled with 243 reported rapes in one year . North Dakota now has the eighth highest incidence of rape in the U.S. . Our missing and murdered women , girls and two-spirits are individual lives that represent ongoing colonial gendered violence . The national homicide rate for Indigenous women is seven times higher than for non-Indigenous women in Canada . We know this horrific violence will not end while the pillage of our lands continues . The water of our lands and the water in our bodies create and sustain our nations . The colonial corporate system of resource extraction relies on the connected violences of destroying our lands and violating our bodies . We are currently building ten solarized Tiny Houses on our land to block Kinder Morgan . By doing this , we are providing housing to Secwepemc families , re-establishing our village sites , and asserting our Secwepemc responsibility to our lands and waters . We have lived on our land of 180,000 square km of unceded territory since time immemorial . We are committed to upholding our collective jurisdiction to look after the land , the language , and the culture of our people , as well as the safety and wellbeing of our women , two-spirits , and children . We invite all women , children and two-spirit people to add your name to this Declaration . shoshone-paiute .
