Credit : Andrew Lichtenstein Getty Images Advertisement The company building an oil pipeline that has been subject to sustained public protests said on Thursday it has resumed drilling beneath a North Dakota lake despite a last-ditch legal challenge from a Native American tribe leading the opposition . The project was put on hold under the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama , but new President Donald Trump , a Republican , helped put it back on track . The federal government this week cleared way for the project to resume , leading the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to file a court challenge on Thursday seeking a temporary restraining order to stop the 1,170-mile -LRB- 1,885-km -RRB- pipeline . But Energy Transfer Partners said it has begun drilling under Lake Oahe , which is part of the Missouri River system . It expects the Dakota Access Pipeline to begin service in approximately 83 days , according to a company spokeswoman . Drilling under Lake Oahe will be completed in 60 days , and the company will require another 23 days to fill the pipeline to Patoka , Illinois , the spokeswoman said . Native American tribes and climate activists have vowed to fight the pipeline , fearing it will desecrate sacred sites and endanger a source of the country 's largest drinking water reservoir . Public opposition has drawn thousands of people to the North Dakota plains , including high-profile political and celebrity supporters . Large protest camps popped up near the site , leading to several violent clashes and some 600 arrests . Supporters say the pipeline will be a safer mode of transportation for the oil than rail or trucks . Legal experts have said the tribe faces long odds in convincing any court to halt work on the pipeline . To obtain the temporary retraining order , the tribe must convince the judge there will be immediate harm suffered and prove that it has a strong overall case should its suit to halt the project completely go o trial .
