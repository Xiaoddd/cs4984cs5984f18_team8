Peres , alongside then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , U.S. President Bill Clinton and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat on their way to sign the accords . The intelligence branch and the chief of staff , who is beginning his fourth and final year at the helm of the army , are concerned about two possible scenarios . The first would be the result of a reaction by one of Israels enemies to an Israeli show of force . The second would stem from a flare-up on the Palestinian front . When the terrorism genie gets out of the Palestinian bottle , it takes many months or even years to put it back . Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot , center , being briefed by Col. Gilad Amit , commander of the Samaria Brigade , following the murder of Rabbi Raziel Shevach , January 18 , 2018 .

Usually , such operations draw little media attention and Israel invariably dodges the question of responsibility . The previous Israel Air Force commander , Gen. Amir Eshel , told Haaretz last August there were nearly 100 such attacks under his five-year command , mostly on Syrian and Hezbollah arms convoys on the northern front . However , the more Israel carries out such attacks , and the more it does so on increasingly sophisticated systems -LRB- according to foreign media reports -RRB- , the higher the chances of a confrontation with other countries and organizations , increasing the danger of a significant retaliation . A similar thing is happening on the Gaza border . Work on the defense barrier against cross-border attack tunnels is advancing , while Israel is simultaneously developing and implementing more sophisticated methods to locate these tunnels . Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman , accompanied by Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot during a visit to a military exercise in the Golan Heights in 2017 . Ministry of Defense At least three tunnels were seemingly located and destroyed near the Gaza border in recent months . However , this success could exact a price if Hamas or Islamic Jihad decide to try and use the remaining attack tunnels before they are completely destroyed or redundant . It is usually accepted practice to call out intelligence officials over mistaken forecasts . But we received a small example of all these trends on various fronts over the past two weeks . The cabinet convened for a long meeting about the northern front last Sunday . Arab media reported early Tuesday morning about an Israeli attack on Syrian army weapons depots near Damascus . A base in the same area , which Iran had reportedly built for one of the Shiite militia groups , was bombed from the air in early December . In most of the recent attacks , the Syrians fired at the reportedly Israeli aircraft . The Syrians also claimed recently that the attacks have become more sophisticated , made in multiple waves and even included surface-to-surface missiles . Meanwhile , in the West Bank , the demonstrations to protest U.S. President Donald Trumps recent recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital were dying down , out of a seeming lack of public interest . Then , on Tuesday evening , Rabbi Raziel Shevach , from the illegal outpost of Havat Gilad , was killed in a drive-by shooting attack near Nablus . The army responded by surrounding villages and erecting roadblocks around Nablus , for the first time in two years . The IDF moves were acts of collective punishment the chief of staff would normally rather avoid , but they were approved on a limited basis due to the murder of an Israeli . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted that the Shin Bet security service is close to solving the murder , but at the time of writing it was still unclear who did it . U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at a more amicable time , May 3 , 2017 Carlos Barria , Reuters Its statement , which was posted on several Facebook pages , attributed the attack to the Raed Karmi cell , marking the anniversary of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades leaders death . Woe to Abbas The Palestinian Authority , whose leadership has avoided condemning the murder of an Israeli citizen , is making an effort nonetheless to capture terrorists in designated areas in Nablus under its jurisdiction . The Israeli moves in the area added to the humiliation of the PA , which looks like it has navigated itself into a dead end . President Mahmoud Abbas is in trouble . The Trump declaration on Jerusalem provided him with a temporary escape . Last November the Palestinians received worrisome information that the Trump administrations brewing peace plan was leaning in Israels favor . Trumps so-called deal of the century would likely include leaving settlements in the West Bank in place , and declaring Abu Dis the Palestinian Jerusalem , capital of a prospective state . These planks are unacceptable to Abbas . However , the Trump declaration allowed the PA leader to accuse the Americans of giving up any pretense to being an honest broker . He found refuge in the embrace of attendees at the Islamic Conference in Turkey , and in halting all discussion of renewing negotiations . Abbas soon discovered that rejecting a reopening of talks with Israel didnt stop the drumbeat of bad news coming his way . UNRWA was facing a severe financial crisis well before the Trump administration threatened to freeze the U.S. share of funding for the UN agency in charge of Palestinian refugee assistance . The crisis , incidentally , also worries Jordan , which hosts at least 3 million Palestinian refugees and descendants . The flow of funds from the donor nations to the territories is dissipating , at a time that the reconciliation process between the PA and Hamas has ground to a halt , with Abbas saying he doesnt see any benefit that can come of it . Meanwhile , Fatah members from activists in the field to the aging leadership are despairing of the chance of realizing the two-state solution . Israel protests the statements of senior Fatah officials about the right to wage armed struggle . It recently arrested a retired Palestinian general on the charge that he had organized protests in East Jerusalem . Fatah plans a council meeting next week , in which participants are expected to adopt a militant line . Abbas , who turns 83 in March , is increasingly feeling his years . His health has deteriorated and so has his patience and fitness to work , although it seems his love for travel has not faded . Claims of widespread corruption , some of which allegedly involve his family , are increasing . Other forces in the West Bank are aware of his weakened physical and political condition . Hamas is vigorously encouraging attacks against Israel , probably in expectation of humiliating the PA. . Last week the Shin Bet asserted that for the first time , an Iranian agent was operating a Palestinian terror cell in Hebron . Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants take part in the funeral of their comrade in the central Gaza Strip October 31 , 2017 . Under the shadow of rockets by Salafi groups in Gaza , Israel and the PA announced the transfer of additional funds from the PA to pay for increasing the electricity supply from Israel to the Strip . There has not been a single rocket fired this week , but the situation remains fragile . The army increased security around communities close to the border and has stepped up exercises that simulate terrorists using tunnels to infiltrate under the border to kidnap and kill Israelis . The chief of staff watched the elite Shaldag unit going into action in such a scenario this week . The army has to stay alert because Islamic Jihad has yet to avenge the killing of its people together with Hamas operatives in a tunnel explosion on the border last October . In November , Jihad militants fired over 20 mortar shells in a four-minute span at an army outpost near Sderot -LRB- no one was injured -RRB- . Shells were fired a month after that , probably by Islamic Jihad , at Kibbutz Kfar Aza during a memorial ceremony for Oron Shaul , who was killed in the 2014 Operation Protective Edge and whose body is being held in Gaza . Army officials expect more attempts . An opposition fighter fires a gun from a village near al-Tamanah during ongoing battles with government forces in Syria 's Idlib province on January 11 , 2018 . Israeli officials are also kept awake by recent reports from Syria of a mysterious glider attack against a Russian air force base in the countrys north . Organizations in Gaza are in arms reach of this technology . Syria war still isnt over The civil war in Syria , which enters its eighth year in March , has not completely died out . The Assad regime , which has restored its rule over most of the countrys population , is still clashing with rebels in the Idlib enclave in northern Syria and is preparing for an eventual attack to chase the rebels out of the border area with Israel , along the Golan . The two attacks on the Russian base in Khmeimim -LRB- artillery shelling , which damaged a number of planes and helicopters , preceded the glider attack -RRB- indicate that some of the groups are determined to keep fighting Assad and his allies . The war in Syria started with a protest by residents of Daraa , a town in the south , against a backdrop of economic difficulties for farmers whose incomes were suffering from desertification . The regimes brutal methods of oppression led to the spread of protest , and things quickly descended into civil war , in which several countries have meddled until today . The war often has consequences on nature . There has been a rise in the number of rabies cases in Israel in recent months , mainly in the north . One of the possible explanations involves the migration of rabies-infested jackals from Jordan and Syria . During the war Syria has suffered a total collapse of civilian authority , and certainly of veterinary services . When there are no regular vaccinations , neighboring countries suffer as well . The Middle Eastern country suffering the second bloodiest civil war , Yemen , gets only a tenth as much attention as Syria . The war in Yemen has raged for three years . Some 3 million residents out of a total of 28 million have fled the country as refugees . Over half of those remaining suffer from food insecurity . The UN recently estimated that about a million residents have contracted cholera from contaminated water or food . Such outbreaks can erupt easily , even closer to home . The European Union is expected to hold an emergency session in Brussels about the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza . The Israeli defense establishment has confirmed the frequent reports by humanitarian organizations of the continued collapse of civilian infrastructure , mainly water and sanitation , in Gaza . Wastewater from Gaza , flowing straight into the sea , is reaching the beaches of Ashkelon and Ashdod . I recently asked a senior Israeli official if he doesnt fear an outbreak of an epidemic like cholera in Gaza . Every morning , I am surprised anew that it still hasnt happened , he replied .
