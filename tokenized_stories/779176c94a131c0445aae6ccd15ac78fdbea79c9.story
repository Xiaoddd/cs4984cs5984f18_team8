Vibeke Larsen , president of the Sami parliament , said the pension fund announced the move when she arrived at a meeting in Oslo to discuss Dakota Access . But Larsen alerted the investment fund to a report earlier this month by the UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples , Victoria Tauli-Corpuz , which concluded the tribes affected by the pipeline had not been consulted sufficiently . Opponents of Dakota Access have also waged a divestment campaign against the pipeline company , Energy Transfer Partners . Using the slogan Defund DAPL , activists have also urged individuals and institutions to move money out of companies involved in the project . Larsen believes KLP realised the case was serious when the parliament began writing to them . Norwegian financial group Storebrand announced earlier this month it was divesting from companies tied to Dakota Access , and in February , Nordic bank Nordea sold its bonds in three of the pipeline companies . As non state-owned businesses , they had not been targeted by the Sami parliament , a parliament spokesman says . As indigenous people who are themselves protected under international conventions , the Sami campaigners believe that their voice can have an impact far beyond their numbers , said Larsen .
