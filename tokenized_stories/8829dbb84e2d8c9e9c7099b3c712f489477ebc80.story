Gasoline which spilled from a pipeline leak is contained to retention area Pond 2 and skimming operations continue . Colonial Pipeline Co and its peers in the oil and gasoline transport sector , tout high-tech , complex leak detections systems that measure hydraulic data and count on overhead flights and other measures to ensure their pipelines work efficiently and safely . But the fact these systems did not flag the Colonial Pipeline spill is not unique . A Reuters review of U.S. federal records shows that sensitive technology designed to pick up possible spills is about as successful as a random member of the public like Aldridge finding it , despite efforts from pipeline operators . In the past 20 months , Colonial has had eight pipeline spills across its 5,500-mile -LRB- 8,851 km -RRB- fuel pipeline system . Colonial did not provide any explanation why the system did not detect any of the most recent leaks . The issue stretches beyond Colonial . Over the last six years , there have been 466 incidents where a pipeline carrying crude oil or refined products has leaked . Of those , 105 , or 22 percent , were detected by an advanced detection system , according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration -LRB- PHMSA -RRB- data . The others were discovered in different ways , including 99 leaks found by the public . Detection is critical because the earlier a leak is found , the less damage to the environment and the pipeline . Pipeline safety is a hot-button issue since demand for new infrastructure picked up to move fuel coming from the U.S. shale boom . But there has been push-back . Energy Transfer Partners which , for example , has said that it would use technology on the Dakota pipeline to detect leaks as small as 1 percent of its flow rate , or about 4,700 barrels , according to Reuters calculations . The top suppliers of the most widely used leak detection system to oil and gasoline markets include Schneider Electric SE -LRB- SCHN.PA -RRB- , Emerson Process Management , Yokogawa Electric Corp -LRB- 6841 . T -RRB- , Honeywell International Inc. -LRB- HON.N -RRB- , and ABB Ltd -LRB- ABBN.S -RRB- , according to ARC Advisory Group . Computational Pipeline Model -LRB- CPM -RRB- based technology for leak detection is most successful when combined with good infrastructure , a reliable monitoring system and efforts in the control room , he added . Honeywell , Yokogawa , Emerson Process Management and ABB did not respond to requests for comment . U.S. regulators declined to comment on the Colonial Pipeline failure to detect the leak because it is part of the ongoing investigation . The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration published a congressionally-mandated report in 2012 that provided no recommendations , but did note that computerized detection of spills is uncommon . Pipeline operators utilize systems with varying degrees of sophistication amid a lack of broad-based regulations , according to the report . Pipelines rely on detailed inspections , corrosion prevention and public awareness campaigns . The most common leak detection method for pipeline operators is called the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition -LRB- SCADA -RRB- system . The SCADA system is the brain of the pipeline systems , using a series of sensors to track data such as pressure , flow rates , temperature , and whether valves are open or closed . The information is then relayed to a control room , where trained operators are often required to distinguish between false alarms and real leaks . Some systems , however , have added the Computational Pipeline Monitoring System -LRB- CPM -RRB- , whose main task is to detect leaks . Since 2010 , there have been 264 pipeline spills where a CPM was functioning at the time of the incident , federal data shows . The leaks were detected by the CPM 19 percent of the time , according to the data . The section of pipeline involved in the recent Colonial Pipeline spill did not have a CPM . Federal data shows the leak detection systems have caught small leaks and missed some of the largest . Six out of the largest 10 pipeline spills in the U.S. since 2010 , all of which were as big or bigger than the Colonial spill , went undetected by the system . Larger pipelines with multiple exit and entry points , such as the Colonial , make leak detection more complicated , experts say . The opposite can be true for shorter pipelines that serve fewer users and are better at detecting spills . An overhead flight on Sept. 7 - two days before the leak was discovered - also did not raise any red flags .
