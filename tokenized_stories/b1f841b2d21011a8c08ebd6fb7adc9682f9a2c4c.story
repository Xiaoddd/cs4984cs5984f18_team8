I 'm really tired , necessitating lots of tea , napping , and the elimination of dairy products from my diet , at the suggestion of a local barista and my doctor alike . While I rest up with that run-down feeling , I 've been catching up on t.v. with a few DVDs from the library . It 's wild America at its most beautiful . The climate is quickly changing in a warming trend that 's been dramatically effecting the seasons for a long time now , with the polar ice caps melting to catastrophic effect . Bearing the brunt of this global impact are the Inupiaq people , who have relied upon seasonality to provide for their families for over 4,000 years . Worsening storms from enormous ice melts and longer warm seasons have caused so much damage to their small island , that the tribe has already moved their homes back from the shoreline once . Sadly , that 's not enough to save it . Shishmaref will soon be totally under water . The good news is that part of the mainland has been reclaimed for their tribe . They will still have their ancestral hunting grounds and fishing territories , though serious adjustments will be made by their moving . They have been an island people for a very long time . While the wheels of government adjust slowly to our everday realities , the fact is this : relocation is extremely costly to people and the environment . The indigenous people of the Americas were here first . In this global world we live in , we are all neighbors .
