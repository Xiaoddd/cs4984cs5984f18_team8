Fearless . Since 1897 . Letters Fertility Is Not The Enemy Of Feminism . The Way The Jewish Community Pushes It Is . Stein , 24 , told the student she was Jewish and that her ancestors spoke Yiddish . And when she said no , he accused her of being a hypocrite . That was , in a nutshell , how Stein ended up this past summer learning Yiddish at Yiddish Farm , an organic farm in Goshen , New York , that works entirely in the mameloshn and runs intensive language immersion classes . And that was where Stein found herself when history happened on an encampment at a reservation about six hours north of Pine Ridge . Protests against a massive oil pipeline , partly organized by a group Stein had helped start , had grown by leaps and bounds to defend land local Native American groups view as both sacred and crucial to their welfare . Dusty Nelson A Different Approach : Stein started teaching at the Pine Ridge Girls School , which incorporates Lakota culture throughout the curriculum , in September . Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email Several months before she left for Yiddish Farm , Stein became an early participant in the current struggle to protect Native American land in the Dakotas . Energy Transfer Partners , a Texas-based oil and gas company , is trying to build an immense 1,172-mile pipeline from North Dakota to Illinois over the objections of Dakota people on the Standing Rock Reservation , whose land it will cross . Like the Pine Ridge Reservation to the south , where Stein works , the Standing Rock Reservation , which straddles the border between South and North Dakota , suffers from a shortage of potable water . In March , Stein , Locke and another friend , Margaret Potts , founded the organization People Over Pipelines to help rally opposition to the plan . The activists met with tribal councils and Dakota elders , and organized protests . People Over Pipelines , alongside other organizations such as ReZpect Our Water , circulated a petition that received more than 200,000 signatures . A group of runners carried the document over 550 miles to Omaha to deliver it in person to the nearest district office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . Stein accompanied the runners for 15 miles of their journey . In April , demonstrators founded an encampment known as Sacred Stone Camp on the Standing Rock Reservation in an effort to monitor the situation and prevent construction of the pipeline through direct action and communal prayer . Stein helped organize a group of young people who rode horses to the camp , stopping at sites that are holy or of historical importance to the Dakota people . By July , several hundred people from more than 90 tribes nationwide were participating daily . On weekends , their ranks swelled to thousands . Today , hundreds of tents and teepees , serving as homes to whole families , dot the protest site , at the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers and stretching across the plain . What has become the largest gathering of indigenous nations in modern American history has moved the U.S. Army , the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior , which oversees Native American affairs , to issue two key decisions . One , by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , was to hold off on issuing permits to Energy Transfer Partners to dig on federal land near or under the Missouri River above the Standing Rock Reservation . Back home now , in Porcupine , South Dakota , on the Pine Ridge Reservation , Stein is again immersed in the struggle . But her summer at Yiddish Farm has affected her . I come from a very assimilated Reform family , and although I went to synagogue and had a bat mitzvah , I felt that my student was right . I was estranged from my roots . Stein spent a lot of her time at Yiddish Farm thinking about the similarities between Ashkenazi Jewish and Lakota culture . Though the two seem worlds apart , she saw certain similarities . The relationship of both groups to their ancestral language , for instance , has been strongly influenced by the collective trauma of genocide . Stein voiced frustration that there has been so little discussion about the pipeline protest in the Jewish world . One of the few groups to demonstrate in support of the effort , she noted , is Jewish Voice for Peace , which is essentially persona non grata in the organized Jewish community due to its stance on boycotts , divestment and sanctions relating to Palestine and Israel . In July , the group sent a delegation to the National Democratic Convention in Philadelphia to join a protest in solidarity with the demonstrators on Standing Rock . Indigenous issues and the plight of endangered languages were the main reasons Stein originally decided to move to Pine Ridge . Stein received a teaching fellowship through AmeriCorps to work at a Catholic high school on the reservation , which is known for its intensive Lakota language program . While teaching computer skills , she became a student herself , sitting in on Lakota classes at the Red Cloud Indian School . Life on Pine Ridge is very different from her life growing up in Connecticut and going to college in Boston . Environmental toxins left behind from uranium mining have led to increased cancer rates . Other diseases , including diabetes and alcoholism , shorten life expectancy by nearly 30 years compared to the national average . After generations of suppression by schools and government agencies , the Lakota language and culture is undergoing a renaissance . Education institutions such as the Red Cloud Indian School once punished children for speaking their mother tongue or using their Lakota names . Now , they encourage students to embrace their culture . With an initial enrollment of 16 girls in sixth and seventh grades , the school teaches all its classes through the lens of Lakota culture . In science , her students learn about the big bang and explore how the scientific theory aligns with the Lakota understanding of the origin of the universe .
