Transcript This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form . AMY GOODMAN : CNN is reporting the Trump administration has prepared an arrest warrant for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange . Attorney General Jeff Sessions confirmed the report at a news conference on Thursday . ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS : We are going to step up our effort and already are stepping up our efforts on all leaks . We have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks . And some of them are quite serious . So , yes , it is a priority . Pompeo made the remarks last week at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in his first public address as CIA director . Their currency is clickbait , their moral compass nonexistent . Their mission , personal self-aggrandizement through destruction of Western values . AMY GOODMAN : In his speech , Pompeo went on to accuse WikiLeaks of instructing Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning to steal information . They impaneled a grand jury to criminally investigate WikiLeaks and Assange . They wanted to prosecute them for publishing the trove of documents back in 2011 relating to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , as well as the U.S. State Department diplomatic cables . And what they found , the Obama Justice Department found , was that it is impossible to prosecute WikiLeaks for publishing secret documents , without also prosecuting media organizations that regularly do the same thing . The New York Times , The Guardian , many other news organizations also published huge troves of the documents provided by Chelsea Manning . So it was too much of a threat to press freedom , even for the Obama administration , to try and create a theory under which WikiLeaks could be prosecuted . And the Trump administration obviously believes that they can now safely , politically , prosecute WikiLeaks . And the danger , of course , is that this is an administration that has already said , the President himself has said , the U.S. media is the enemy of the American people . And this is a prosecution that would enable them not only to prosecute and imprison Julian Assange , but a whole variety of other journalists and media outlets that also routinely publish classified information from the U.S. government . MIKE POMPEO : The days like today , where we call out those who grant a platform to these leakers and so-called transparency activists . We know the danger that Assange and his not-so-merry band of brothers pose to democracies around the world . Ignorance or misplaced idealism is no longer an acceptable excuse for lionizing these demons . AMY GOODMAN : And CIA chief Mike Pompeo continued . MIKE POMPEO : Julian Assange and his kind are not the slightest bit interested in improving civil liberties or enhancing personal freedom . Assange is a narcissist who has created nothing of value . He relies on the dirty work of others to make himself famous . AMY GOODMAN : Julian Assange responded to the comments earlier this week while speaking with Jeremy Scahill on the Intercepted podcast . JULIAN ASSANGE : Pompeo said explicitly that he was going to redefine the legal parameters of the First Amendment to define publishers like WikiLeaks in such a manner that the First Amendment would not apply to them . This is the head of the largest intelligence service in the world , the intelligence service of the United States . This is not how the First Amendment works . The First Amendment is not a positive definition of rights . It limits what the federal government does . It limits what the federal government can do to take away a certain climate of open debate in the United States . So , the First Amendment prevents Congress and the executive from engaging in actions themselves which would limit not only the ability of people to speak and to publish freely , but would also limit the ability of people to read and understand information , because it is that climate of public debate which creates a check on a centralized governmental structure from becoming authoritarian . GLENN GREENWALD : I think the key point here to understand is the way in which governments typically try and abridge core freedoms , because what they know is that if they target a group that is popular or a particular idea that people agree with , there will be an uprising against the attempt to abridge freedom . So what they always do , for example , when governments try and abridge freedom of speech , is they pick somebody who they know is hated in society or who expresses an idea that most people find repellent , and they try and abridge freedom of speech in that case , so that most people will let their hatred for the person being targeted override the principle involved , and they will sanction or at least acquiesce to the attack on freedom because they hate the person being attacked . But what happens is , the abridgment then gets institutionalized and entrenched . This is what Mike Pompeo is strategizing to do now and what Jeff Sessions wants to do , as well , is they know WikiLeaks is hated on all sides of the political spectrum . The right has long hated WikiLeaks because of all the publications they did of Bush-era war crimes , and Democrats now despise WikiLeaks , probably more than anybody else that they hate , because of the role that Democrats believe WikiLeaks played in helping to defeat Hillary Clinton . AMY GOODMAN : Let me get your response to this other point that CIA chief Mike Pompeo made . MIKE POMPEO : In January of this year , our Intelligence Committee determined that Russian military intelligence , the GRU , had used WikiLeaks to release data of U.S. victims that the GRU had obtained through cyber-operations against the Democratic National Committee . Nobody suggests that WikiLeaks did the actual hacking . We criticize the journalism of pretty much every media outlet . If bad journalism or making poor journalistic choices can now justify having the Justice Department prosecute you , there will be no media organizations left . There is Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorean Embassy for almost five years now . And the question that you just raised is the towering one for me , which is , OK , so the U.S. government indicts WikiLeaks and issues an arrest warrant for Julian Assange . And remember , the reason the Ecuadorean government gave Julian Assange asylum in the first place was because they said they were worried that if he were extradited to Sweden , that that would then be used to send him to the United States , where he would be prosecuted for publishing information , for doing journalism . That was always what Ecuador was most worried about . So it seems very unlikely that Ecuador is going to voluntarily withdraw its asylum . But the asylum that Julian has should prevent the U.S. government from apprehending him , even if they do decide to go ahead and indict WikiLeaks . AMY GOODMAN : Chelsea Manning is about to be released in May . And ultimately , they found no evidence whatsoever to support that theory . Glenn , thanks so much for joining us . GLENN GREENWALD : Thanks , Amy . AMY GOODMAN : Glenn Greenwald , Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist , one of the founding editors of The Intercept .
