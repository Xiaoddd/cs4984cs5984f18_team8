I am seventeen hundred miles away , watching safely from my living room . But every picture and every story that comes out of Standing Rock hits with such impact that the great distance seems negligible . I am a child of the Dakotas . I was born in North Dakota . I spent almost every holiday and summer in the Badlands of North Dakota , or with family in the Black Hills of South Dakota . When I was young , my family moved to the prairies of Saskatchewan , Canada , but we stayed close , just a few miles above the border . My childhood memories of the Dakotas and the Canadian prairies have blended , forming idyllic vignettes of golden sunsets , gorgeous but fierce winters and peaceful life out West . One thing that always stood out to me in the Dakotas was the deep respect for Native American culture and history . I always felt a profound sense of love and respect for our brothers and sisters . I grew up having a real connection to the land and to the people and cultures that have always called it home . When I was very young , I had a doll that I named Paha Sapa , which means Black Hills in the language of the Lakota Sioux . The Sioux have been a part of my life since I was born , ever-present brothers and sisters , aunts and uncles , grandparents and ancestors . I am forever tied to this place . My loved ones are buried there . The battle for Standing Rock has been an incredible thing to witness . Thousands of people are standing in support of the Sioux . Millions of people have offered their support and donations . But I am deeply conflicted . There is no valid argument to not modify the location of the pipeline . In the interest of giving the benefit of the doubt , maybe the planners were careless . Dakota Access , LLC and Energy Transfer Partners have based their entire claim on the fact that the Sioux no longer have legal claim over the land . But their legal ground is as shaky as their moral one . The Dawes Act of 1887 helped to usher in waves of white settlers on Sioux land . The Standing Rock Sioux Reservation is one of six fragments created when Congress split up the Great Sioux Reservation on March , 2 , 1889 . The legality of these actions are beyond question . Many people are familiar with the massacres and war , but the shadowy history of cultural warfare was conducted quietly under the auspices of legal policies . In his 1889 annual report to the Secretary of the Interior . They must adjust themselves to their environment , and conform their mode of living substantially to our civilization . This civilization may not be the best possible , but it is the best the Indians can get . Clearly , the people behind DAPL are taking advantage of acts that should not have been legal , and are asserting that the Sioux only have claim over their territory . The Standing Rock Sioux are opposing an unfair risk to their land and health . For the last decade , I have seen my home destroyed as the big oil boom attracted thousands eager to exploit the land . The landscape is unrecognizable . There have been more spills than can be counted . You can see a visible scar stretching through parts of North Dakota and Saskatchewan , left by heavy tankers , filthy trains , and the traffic caused by the thousands of extra workers . Where once we could stand in complete darkness and count the stars , we now see dozens of flares from oil wells . The towns of Williston , ND , and Estevan , SK , have exploded in population , and have seen a corresponding explosion in crime , drugs , and homelessness . There are not enough houses for everyone coming to work in the oil fields . Of course , big hotels and apartment complexes were hastily constructed to profit from the boom . I understand and empathize with the concern over jobs . Replacing coal and oil with renewables will change a lot , for a whole lot of people . It is home to two major coal power plants that provide power to millions , and jobs to thousands . My dad worked at both of them . When I saw that Canada aims to phase out coal by 2030 , my heart sank . Places that have fueled society for decades with government-operated power plants . When we talk about phasing out fossil fuels , we can easily point to the destruction and devastation left in their wake . I can look at my ruined prairies and grieve for the beauty that is lost . But when we talk about phasing out fossil fuels , we have to remember to not forget about the Estevans , the Willistons , the Dakotas and Saskatchewans that have been diligently bearing the cost of fossil fuels while the rest of us reap the benefits . These costs are real and measurable , not just potential collateral damage . The conversation about these costs usually focuses heavily on controlling emissions to avoid or mitigate future risks . But pollution already poses a direct and severe threat to public health . While I was growing up I suffered from several cases of bronchitis and pneumonia , and I was once hospitalized for a week with pneumonia in both of my lungs . I will suffer from asthma and higher susceptibility to pneumonia for the rest of my life , as will many others who grew up in Estevan or similar towns with air pollution . I am another veteran who has taken the oath to defend the Constitution of the United States , and I stand with the Standing Rock Sioux . That is what the oath means , and it means more now than ever . As someone of the Dakotas , I stand with my brothers and sisters , and Standing Rock , as well as Fort Berthold . I also stand up for my fellow Dakotans and Saskatchewanians , and I am saying enough is enough . We need to end this dependence on oil .
