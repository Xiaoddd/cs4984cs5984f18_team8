The Oglala Sioux Tribe has filed a lawsuit calling for the Army Corps of Engineers to stop construction of the pipeline until an environmental impact statement is completed . Tom Stromme , Bismarck Tribune Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Fearing contamination of its drinking water , the Oglala Sioux Tribe has entered the legal fray against the Dakota Access pipeline . Attorneys working for the tribe filed a lawsuit Monday in U.S District Court in Washington calling for the Army Corps of Engineers to halt construction of the controversial oil pipeline until an environmental impact statement is completed . The Oglala Sioux filed their complaint the same day that a federal judge in Washington , D.C. , denied a similar request from the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe . Situated on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in southwest South Dakota , the Oglala Sioux Tribe draws its drinking water from the Missouri River , as do more than 200,000 Native and non-Native American people in the state . The tribe gets its water from the Mni Wiconi Rural Water Supply System , which draws water from the Missouri River . Owned and operated by the tribe , the Mni Wiconi rural water system is one of the largest in North America , measuring more than 4,000 miles and serving about 55,000 people in western South Dakota , according to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation . Starting from an intake at the Oahe Reservoir near Fort Pierre , the system stretches 150 miles to Pine Ridge , where it provides drinking water for an estimated 21,500 tribal members . The Mni Wiconi water system also supplies water to the Rosebud Sioux and Lower Brule Indian reservations , as well as non-Native communities including Fort Pierre , Murdo , Kadoka , Wall , Philip and Midland . In 2015 , the system supplied those communities with a total of about 78.4 million gallons of water . On Dec. 4 , under the Obama administration , the Army Corps ordered a complete environmental impact statement on the pipeline project . But when the Trump administration took over , the Corps reversed its decision and granted the final easement to allow the completion of pipeline construction near the site of a massive protest movement outside the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation in North Dakota . Bad precedent . Also in Washington , the Standing Rock Sioux asked the U.S. District Court to overturn permits issued for the pipeline . Tribal lawyers filed for a summary judgment on the permits issued by the Corps . The tribe said it is seeking the judgment in hopes of getting a decision before the pipeline starts operating .
