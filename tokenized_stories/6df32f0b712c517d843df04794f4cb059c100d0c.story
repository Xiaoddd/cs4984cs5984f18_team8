Rich Gullick , a former RWSA director of operations , has spoken out at recent meetings of the RWSA board , the Albemarle County Service Authority board , the Charlottesville City Council and the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors . Gullick distributed flyers at the meetings that address why the pipeline is not needed now and when it will be needed . The RWSA board and staff have been discussing the timeline for a water pipeline from the South Fork Rivanna Reservoir to the Ragged Mountain Reservoir . The construction of the water pipeline is currently planned to begin between 2027 and 2032 and be completed between 2035 and 2040 , depending on which schedule option is ultimately selected . According to Gullick , the pipeline is not needed until 2062 , at the earliest , based on relatively stable demand over the past eight years . Mawyer agreed that demand has declined recently . He said that 9.1 million gallons per day is the average demand for the past 12 months . New demand and safe yield studies are scheduled to be completed within the next 12 to 15 months . Mawyer said the most recent study predicted demand would be around 14.5 mgd by 2025 . According to Gullick , the reservoir was dropping 17 million gallons a day in late September , and then immediately stopped dropping when the leaking gates were plugged with cat litter and garden mulch . In November , Mawyer told The Daily Progress that the two unmetered gates were leaking , releasing a total of about 3 million gallons per day , and that contributed to the decline of the reservoir . The 3 million gallons per day number came from comparing the leakage flows to the flow through a third dam gate , which was metered , and should be considered the minimum leaking amount , not the average , according to Gullick . Mawyer said the pipeline was not a result of the water restrictions that were put in place in 2017 . Mawyer said there were three main reasons for the south drought restrictions in 2017 : the leaking gates ; drought conditions ; and that the authority was using provisional numbers from a gage that determines the amount of water that is required to be released to the river . The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality was over-recording the amount of water flowing into the reservoir . Even with the provisional numbers , the RWSA released more than what was mandated by DEQ in August 2017 . The overages were as low as 0.42 million gallons per day higher than the requirement and as high as 12.1 million gallons per day above the requirement , according to charts provided by the RWSA in the fall . Gullick said the water level at the Ragged Mountain Reservoir should be raised an additional 12 feet ahead of construction of a pipeline , and that other upcoming projects , such as the Observatory Water Treatment Plant expansion and the Pantops-to-Avon waterline , will allow Rivanna to have two whole separate treatment plants each with their own source of water that can provide more than the average daily demand to the whole urban system . RWSA staff last week did not know what the safe yield demand percentage currently is . Liz Palmer , RWSA board member and an Albemarle County supervisor , said she wanted to clarify that no one is committed to a time for the pipeline project to begin .
