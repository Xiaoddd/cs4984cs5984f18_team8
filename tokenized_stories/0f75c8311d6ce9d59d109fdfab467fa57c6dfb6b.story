This is a call for submissions of texts about strategic lessons that can be learned from the resistance at Standing Rock . As one phase of the resistance has ended and another has begun , I think that it would be valuable to take a minute to reflect on the lessons learned from this game-changing moment in movement history . This project is mostly for the benefit of those who were not present at Standing Rock but who might participate in something similar in the future . My plan is to publish a compilation of thoughtful strategic analyses , both online and in print . However , seeing as I might not want to or be able to publish everything that people submit , I plan to put everything that anyone submits unedited onto a wordpress site . Please include whatever information about yourself that you consider relevant . P.S. . If you spent time at Standing Rock and are interested in collaborating on this project , please let me know .
