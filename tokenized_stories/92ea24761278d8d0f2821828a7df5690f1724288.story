THE TRITON Independent , student-run news source at the University of California , San Diego . The UC has been divesting and will continue to divest from Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics , two companies involved in the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline , according to Jagdeep Singh Bachher , Vice President of investments and Chief Investment Officer of the Regents . The video was posted by the UC Board of Regents YouTube account on Tuesday . This statement comes after several protests and a UC-wide day of action against the Pipeline . Bachher , however , noted that the decision was purely economic , despite significant pressure , including phone calls and postcards , from students and community members . Burgundy Gregg Fletcher , an organizer of the UC-wide day of action protest at UCSD and the vice president of the Native American Student Alliance , is unsatisfied with the report . UC investments in unsustainable resources have been a topic of controversy since the Fossil Free UC movement began in 2012 . Neither the UC Office of the President nor the Office of the Chief Investment Officer have released statements regarding the status of UC investments . But when student monies are being used to fund agents that are actively exerting violence , cash is political . The UC Office of the President and the Office of the Chief Investment Officer did not respond to requests for comment . Aleena Karamally is the Managing Editor for The Triton .
