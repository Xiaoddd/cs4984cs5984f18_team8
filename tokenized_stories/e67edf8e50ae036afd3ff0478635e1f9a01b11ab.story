This coming weekend of December 3rd and 4th , 2016 is likely to mark a massive shifting point for our world . If the veterans are beaten and abused , we will almost certainly see a major uprising within this country . If the police drop their weapons and begin siding with humanity , we will see the uprising and revolution continue to spread . The latter of the two is the most preferred . Polls are suggesting that anti-establishment candidate Norbert Hofer is likely to win , which would be yet another blow to the banking and political cabal . Hofer has stated in the past that if he wins , he will hold a referendum that will allow Austrian citizens decide if they would like to leave or stay in the European Union . While some may not think this is a big deal , the elites consider it a major deal as European Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker issued a statement and pleaded with the candidates not to hold a referendum . Essentially , he does not want the voices of Austria to decide their own course , but to continue to remain subservient to the Federal Superstate known as the European Union . Italy Also on Sunday , Italy is holding a referendum as to whether the Italian constitution should be amended or not . Essentially , the change would lead to more control from the Prime Minister , and less control from the Senate and regions around Italy . While there are multiple situations that could play out from that point , one situation is that of the anti-establishment and anti-Euro political party known as The Five Star Movement to come into power . If the M5S came into power , this would be another major defeat for the globalists plans of retaining control over several European nations through a single currency . Leaving the EU is a win for humanity and a defeat for the NWO . With anti-establishment parties assuming more power in Europe in the past few weeks -LRB- Moldova and Bulgaria -RRB- , Austria and Italy could be the next to fall from the grips of the global cabal . Interestingly , anti-establishment candidates are leading the polls in The Netherlands and France , who vote respectively in March and April . This weekend could mark a turning point for our world . May freedom , peace , truth and love prevail everywhere . The course of things is about to take a different turn . The voice of freedom can not be imprisoned ; it rings like a bell . They demand politicians who take them seriously , who listen to them , who speak on their behalf . It is a genuine democratic revolt .
