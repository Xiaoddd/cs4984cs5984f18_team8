The Wisconsin State Troopers and inspectors were sent under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact -LRB- EMAC -RRB- . This is a national disaster-relief compact that provides a way for states to request assistance from other states during governor-declared times of emergency . The very noble purpose of this compact is being abused and manipulated in a way that clearly does not fit the original intent . In the months since DAPL protesting began , it has been the people who are simply trying to protect the water who have had their safety compromised . One of these occurred just 150 miles from Cannonball , spilling 176,000 gallons of oil of which 130,000 gallons made it into Ash Coulee Creek . Clean water and Native American sovereignty are not for sale , no matter how large or rich the corporation . All usage is forbidden . On Friday , September 21 , 2018 , parking spaces around the globe will be temporarily reclaimed for people . In downtown Milwaukee , a dozen metered spaces will be transformed into new territories for creative experimentation , activation , socializing and play .
