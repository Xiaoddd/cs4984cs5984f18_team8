Iverson said that the use of the fire hose as a water canon was justified . Iverson said that the road closure would not hamper medical services to Standing Rock protesters if needed . However , Iverson said that rubber bullets have not been used against the Dakota Access protesters and he can not comment on the potential lethality of weapons including fire hoses , sponge rounds and bean bag rounds . Attempting to breach the police line results in action taken by law enforcement . Photos and videos show officers using less-than lethal rounds against protesters , including the shooting of an unarmed indigenous man off his horse , bruising his ribs . Reports from the Oceti Sakowin camp have said that another woman was injured so badly by police that her arm may need to be amputated . Weeks ago , police and protesters agreed that the bridge would be cleared as soon as possible , but protesters are frustrated with the delays from law enforcement in doing so . Protesters allegedly set fire to the two trucks on Oct. 27 , which to this day , many of them and their leaders deny . Police charged all of those arrested that day with attempting to endanger by fire or explosives , a felony charge , because of the fires . They also gave a New York journalist the same charges . Dallas Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environmental Network has made several attempts to quell rumors in the camp that police surveillance aircraft have sprayed protesters with mustard gas . Police have routinely said that protesters have used weapons against them , including : guns , bows and arrows , Molotov cocktails and slingshots . Red Fawn Fallis was arrested for allegedly trying to shoot officers . The weapon was confiscated . Clear evidence , including video footage , shows DAPL workers have made attempts to kill and critically injure protesters . Police have said little these events and little seems to be done about stopping workers from engaging with the protesters , protecting the safety of the protesters . Iverson said one officer was hit in the head with a rock during the Nov. 20 protest action , but the extent of his injuries are unknown . Iverson said he was unaware of the Nov. 20 action did any further damage to the bridge .
