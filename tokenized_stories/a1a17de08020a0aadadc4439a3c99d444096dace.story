I 'm a civil rights activist , writer , and transgender woman from St Louis . The podcast will be a weekly show , available on all the standard podcasting platforms including iTunes . I will still , additionally , be publishing the planned written pieces about these activists ' work . In order to make this work , I will need to raise the funds by next Saturday , so I can buy everything I need before my trip . Simply put , your financial support makes my work possible . Your support inspires and invigorates me and I am ineffably grateful . As you may know , I am actually homeless at the moment . I was living in my car for awhile , but I 'm currently staying in a homeless shelter in St Louis . -RRB- . I am working hard to begin transitioning as a trans woman , and it 's going very slowly . The world is not very accepting of people like me , but I 'm not letting that stop me , or even slow me down . If you would like more information about my current situation , or if you have ANY other questions , please feel free to ask me directly , or also , last week I also hosted a 2-hour video AMA -LRB- ask me anything -RRB- here . I am very grateful for your support , at any dollar amount . I will then keep the Shure SM58s from above for panel shows , when I have additional guests . We are unfortunately still having trouble integrating our site with iTunes for RSS syndication and distribution , so the website is not online yet . Today is Greta 's birthday , as well . We will update you again soon when the website is online -LRB- and with more episodes -RRB- , but we hope you enjoy this one in the meantime . As supporters in launching the podcast , I am especially interested in your feedback . If you have constructive criticism , suggestions for guests , or other ideas , please let me know . To those of you who will receive the perk of a shoutout on the first episode : I want to let you know that , because this episode is not being distributed on iTunes yet , we wanted to wait for widespread distribution to do your shout-outs , so that as many people hear them as possible . We appreciate your support in helping to get this project going and want this to be something you 're proud of . This morning I met with the podcasting consultant here in St Louis who is helping us with the launch , the website , the digital distribution , and several other key parts of getting this all off the ground . We have so far recorded the guest interviews for 8 episodes , plus several pieces of bonus content just for you , our GoFundMe supporters . All the needed equipment is purchased and working great . All the artwork is complete , including art for stickers , shirts , coffee mugs , and tote bags , in addition to the social media assets and album art for iTunes . I do have 1 bit of bad news : We were tentatively planning on a late February launch date , but because of some hiccups with the website construction and promotional plan , I 'm unfortunately going to have to push the launch date to early March . Thank you again for your support and trust in me in getting this project going . I 'm really excited about the interviews we have recorded so far , and ca n't WAIT for you to hear them . I ca n't thank you enough . I 'm thrilled to tell you that we have completed the first round of interviews , and I think you 'll be very excited to hear the results once they are edited . Our guests so far have included Amnesty International Executive Director Margaret Huang , The LGBTQ Task Force Digital Strategies Director Kayley Whalen , American Atheists Public Policy Director Nick Fish , DC-based journalist Jamila Bey , and several more . We are still about 2 weeks away from the official launch of the podcast , but the website is almost ready , and we have some other big things in the works , as well . While I 've got you here , I wanted to let you know 2 things : 1 . We 've just today launched a Patreon page to help fund the ongoing , month-to-month expenses for the show . Patreon uses a system of monthly pledges , and it would help us a lot if you could spread the word . Thank you again for all your incredible support of this project . I have started to purchase the needed equipment , including a Zoom H6 recorder , several of the microphones needed , and a few sets of headphones and a miniature headphone mixer . I have also been working with a graphic designer , Will Loren from Memphis , to come up with some great design assets for Twitter , Facebook , the cover art for iTunes , and the t-shirts . Additionally , I 've been working with an excellent rock band , called The Many Colored Death based out of mid-Missouri , to record the theme song . Since this is a podcast theme , only a few seconds will be used during fade-ins and fade-outs of different segments , but this is the full version -LRB- ready for such edits -RRB- .
