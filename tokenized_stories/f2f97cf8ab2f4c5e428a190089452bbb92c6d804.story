The notice comes after Donald Trump formally backed the project last month in one of his first acts as US president . The Standing Rock Tribe vowed to fight the decision in court . The 1,172 mile -LRB- 1,886 km -RRB- , four-state project is almost finished except for a one-mile stretch under Lake Oahe in North Dakota , where demonstrators have set up protest encampments . Easement is a special permit that allows a company to cross private land . Final approval is expected to be announced as soon as Wednesday .

James Cook , BBC North America correspondent Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionThe BBC 's James Cook visits the Standing Rock camps As the spring thaw approaches , opponents of the pipeline who have maintained their protest through the bitter winter months are full of fighting talk . There has been a great deal of activity at the main Oceti Sakowin site on the Cannonball river as its occupants strike camp in preparation for annual flooding . An attempt to set up an alternative camp on land owned by the pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners was short-lived , and resulted in 75 arrests -LRB- taking the total since August close to 700 -RRB- but at least three new camps have been established in recent days . Among those arrested was Chase Iron Eyes , a prominent member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe who says he is facing five years in jail on charges - which he denies - of inciting a riot and criminal trespass . Environmental groups , including Greenpeace , the Sierra Club , and the Center for Biological Diversity , issued statements criticising the decision . They accused the Trump administration of putting corporate profits ahead of Native Americans and the environment . Nearly 700 people have been arrested since protests first began last year , according to law enforcement officials . Just last week 76 protesters were arrested after refusing to leave land owned by the energy company .

The pipeline 's owner , Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners , says the project is safe . In September , the Obama administration announced that it would not allow the project to proceed . Just before President Trump 's inauguration , the Army Corp of Engineers took steps to launch a full environmental impact study of the project . Pipeline supporters say it will allow North Dakota oil to be transported more cheaply , allowing the US industry to better compete with Canada .
