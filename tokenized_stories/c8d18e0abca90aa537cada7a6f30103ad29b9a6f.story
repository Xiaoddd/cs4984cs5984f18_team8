By Nidhi Subbaraman Nidhi Subbaraman BuzzFeed News Reporter Posted on March 4 , 2017 , at 11:08 a.m. Tauli-Corpuz cited clashes between tribes and federal agencies over the Dakota Access pipeline as symptoms of a broken system of communication between the US government and native people . On her ten-day tour last month , Tauli-Corpuz visited tribes all over the country , from Albuquerque to Bismarck to Boulder . She also discussed the Dakota Access pipeline with North Dakota Senator John Hoeven and Major General Donald Jackson , Jr. , the United States Army Corps of Engineers Deputy Commanding General for Civil and Emergency Operations . In January , the US Army Corps officially announced their intention to conduct a lengthy environmental inspection before issuing a permit for construction of the Dakota Access pipeline . Just days after President Trump 's memoranda were issued , the Corps reversed that decision and on Feb. 7 issued permission to begin drilling . But it stops short of requiring the government to act on those suggestions , and tribal leaders and activists say their preferences have long gone ignored . He added that the report was spot on . In discussions with US officials , Tauli-Corpuz suggested strengthening the requirements for agencies to communicate with native tribes on decisions , and Anderson believes such a statutory fix is necessary . Previous UN rapporteurs have made similar recommendations to better acknowledge tribal rights , particularly pertaining to consultation . A final report will be presented at the UN Human Rights Council in September , and submitted to the State Department for distribution to other federal agencies . Submit it here .
