CREDIT : Elizabeth Hoover Most eyes turned away from Standing Rock in December , after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied an easement for construction of the Dakota Access pipeline . That changed on Tuesday , when President Donald Trump signed executive memoranda to move forward with the Dakota Access pipeline , as well as the reviled Keystone XL pipeline . The fight at Standing Rock begins anew . The Standing Rock Sioux say it will damage sacred Native American sites and threaten their sole source of freshwater . But the protesters are also anticipating increased aggression from law enforcement . Those remaining at camp are trying to decide on the most effective way to proceed . Salazar said peaceful demonstration is now more important than ever . But as winter presses on , water protectors must contend with harsh weather and a new administration unsympathetic to environmental issues and even less so for political dissent . Last week , during a three-day confrontation between police and protesters , live-streamed videos showed police firing non-lethal bullets , teargas , and mace into the crowds . According to one of the protesters , Christian Espinosa , these aggressive tactics are partially in response to the military vehicles , razor-wire fences , and police barricades that are lending a prison yard atmosphere to the landscape of Standing Rock . The increasingly violent actions by some water protectors has sparked internal conflict within the camp . According to Sioux and Lakota tribal elders , violent protests have damaging consequences for the community and the movement to stop the pipeline .
