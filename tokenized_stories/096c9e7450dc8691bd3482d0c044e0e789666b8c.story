Fifty yards away , construction trucks set the first cement blocks in a line , forming the second barricade on Highway 1806 . Weeks earlier and under emergency orders issued by former Governor Jack Dalrymple , the North Dakota National Guard manned the first barricade , more of a checkpoint for passing cars . Tensions brewed at the frontline that day . Police or security personnel taunted activists through a megaphone , teasing them about being cowards behind masks . At their line sat military Humvees , a tan armored vehicle equipped with a sound cannon . Activists brandished plywood shields , and refused to budge . Most activists shouted peaceful messages ; one man hurled insults at the police . After police issued a final warning , law enforcement from five states decked out in sheriff deputy uniforms , riot gear , and armed with mace , pepper spray , rubber bullets , zip ties and clubs , some with live ammunition , formed a Roman-style phalanx and marched down the highway toward Backwater Bridge . Activists smudged each other with burning sweetgrass and sage . One woman sat amidst the crowd praying , crying so hard her shoulders shook . Two women hugged each other tightly as the marching police neared . The day was saved by one man with snowy-white hair , smoking a pipe , and wearing a jogging suit , Miles Allard , an elder from Standing Rock . After negotiations , both sides backed down , but the near-altercation was a sign of bigger events to come . TigerSwan , straight from the war-torn fields in Afghanistan , was in town . TigerSwan operatives called security workers from Silverton International unprofessional and unarmed . Now , the mercenary-for-hire company and its founder , James Patrick Reese , face a civil action lawsuit filed by the North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board on June 12 , 2017 . A security company providing illegal security services in North Dakota is a Class B misdemeanor , Rogneby said . The North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board is a governor-appointed committee that licenses and regulates private security industries , according to its website . EH Investigations civil complaint According to the civil complaint filed by the North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board , Jeremie Meisel is listed as the responsible license holder for EH Investigations and Security , LLC , a licensed security agency in North Dakota . In August , 2016 , Meisel and EH Investigations were contacted by Leighton Security Services , Inc. to assist with security along the Dakota Access Pipeline . In the fall of 2016 , Meisel relinquished his responsibility to Leighton in violation of North Dakota law , according to the civil complaint . The civil complaint further mentioned some of EH Investigations employees : Richard Anderson , Jason Wentz , Chris Anderson , Eizabeth Marlow , Merry Jenson , and Kimberly Stuart . None were registered in North Dakota to provide security services at the times of their hiring . The North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board further requested a hearing to revoke the license and registration of Meisel and EH Investigations , or take lawful disciplinary action against them . Calls were made and messages were left to EH Investigations personnel for comment , but no replies were made at press time . TigerSwan civil action The civil action lawsuit against TigerSwan revealed the mercenary-for-hire company had a methodical and blatant disregard for North Dakota laws . Energy Transfer Partners hired TigerSwan in September 2016 , the civil action lawsuit reported . On or before September 23 , 2016 , the North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board notified TigerSwan with a letter that it was illegally providing security services in North Dakota . On October 5 , 2016 , North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board sent TigerSwan the guidelines for licensure in the state , and on November 16 , 2016 , TigerSwan submitted its application on behalf of Reese , but its application was denied one month later . The company also utilized international anti-terrorist strategies and tactics against NoDAPL activists . Intelligence came in the forms of flyover photography , summaries of arrests , activist activity , numbers , alleged criminal actions , and equipment . TigerSwan also provided projections of activist activity including the surveillance of social media accounts , according to the lawsuit . TigerSwan maintained the Joint Operations Command Center to coordinate security and intelligence gathering , and organized a Quick Reaction Force to respond to activist activities . TigerSwan operatives targeted individuals within the American Indian Movement , the Red Warrior Tribal security . Operatives took keen interest in Native Americans from Standing Rock , Red Warrior Tribal security , Pine Ridge Sioux , the American Indian Movement , and others from Polynesia and Palestine . The Dakota Access Pipeline began shipping oil on June 1 . The idea that women are not funny never entered my mind .
