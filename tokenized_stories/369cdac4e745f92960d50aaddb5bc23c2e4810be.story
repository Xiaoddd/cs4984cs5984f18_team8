Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II said the tribe has started the process since Standing Rock has been in a months-long fight against the 1,172-mile Dakota Access crude oil pipeline , which is proposed to cross the Missouri River just north of the reservation . The tribe fears that a leak in the line would pollute the river and the tribal water supply . The tribe will first need to create a regulatory code before forming a commission , said Archambault , who said the new code , once written , has to be posted for 30 days to garner tribal member feedback . Archambault said the commission would have authority over all utilities infrastructure , from water lines to power lines . And despite the opposition to Dakota Access , the creation of a commission would not rule out the possibility of crude oil pipelines on the reservation . Opposition and 2007 tribal council action to prevent crude oil pipelines from crossing tribal lands came from fears the industry was not regulated well enough , Archambault said . If the tribe were to be more the master of its fate , with direct input on projects through its regulatory authority , there would be less reluctance to allow their development . And though the Dakota Access pipeline would not cross the reservation , the chairman said he is hopeful a tribal utilities commission could also give the tribe more weight on the national stage should similar projects arise in the future . Standing Rock is looking to the Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota as a model for its proposed commission , according to Archambault . Neiss said he had a recent conversation with Archambault about the creation of a commission on Standing Rock . On the Rosebud Reservation , its existence has allowed the tribe to be an advocate for utilities consumers within tribal homelands . It came mostly from utilities cooperatives , used to dealing with the state for permitting , questioning why the tribe was taking up regulating . Most of the utility infrastructure on the Rosebud Reservation is operated by cooperatives . One thing that has helped bridge gaps is the election of two tribal members to a local cooperative board . An annual utilities forum between cooperatives and the tribe is another way Rosebud has tried to develop relationships . Over the past two decades , most of the Rosebud Sioux Tribal Utilities Commission work has been on easements for telecommunications and electric lines , particularly fiber for high-speed internet . The commission has been an advocate for renewable and energy-efficiency improvements , though there have been no major wind or solar farms developed on tribal lands that would have required permitting . Neiss said they recently completed a 50-year right of way with the Western Area Power Administration for a 115-kilovolt transmission line . Along with development of a utilities commission , Archambault said Standing Rock is talking with Rosebud about the possible establishment of an intertribal utilities commission . Neiss said there has been interest from the Yankton and Ogala Sioux , too . And Rosebud has offered to share its Title 20 regulatory code with others . He said the benefit of an intertribal commission , or at least commissions with similar codes , would be a continuity of regulation across tribal homelands , making it easier for utilities companies to follow . There is also the opportunity for shared resources to save on cost and increase representation on the national scale . He said having a shared commission could help tribes initiate conversations with state governments about the possibility of sharing jurisdiction on projects that cross tribal treaty lands . The tribe defines treaty lands as lands within tribal territories established in the middle of the 19th century by various treaties between tribes and the federal government . Many parts of the treaties , which laid out rules for interaction among the tribes and provided easements for westward expansion , remain in effect today . Areas on the Dakota Access pipeline route run through the 1851 treaty territories of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the Yankton Sioux Tribe , as well as through the Great Sioux Reservation drawn up in the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868 . Archambault said joint jurisdiction on those lands would give tribes the opportunity to have a say as more than just stakeholders on projects crossing them . Tribal opinion could go from being recognized by state and federal regulators to having authority alongside them . Chris Nelson , South Dakota Public Utilities Commission chairman , said he has no experience to draw upon to weigh how tribal and state regulators may work together on utilities projects .
