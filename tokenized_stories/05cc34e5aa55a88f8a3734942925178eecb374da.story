Antifa Cracked His Head Open With a Bat . According to a report by KCTV-5 : Plumes of fire and heavy smoke were showing from the scene and lit up the sky from miles away . An hour after the fire started , it was still burning , but the flames had reduced significantly . The fire was burning itself out a short time later . While this pipeline explosion ruptured on private property in an isolated area , if a similar incident were to occur near the Missouri River , it would decimate the water supply of the Standing Rock reservation . It seems crazy that a 13-year-old can have a better understanding of reality than the proponents of the DAPL , but perhaps that is due to the fact that they have vested financial interest in seeing oil flow , while she cares solely about the health and safety of her family , friends , and neighbors . This latest explosion only serves to highlight why there is such vehement public opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline .
