Native Americans and activists from around the country have been gathering at the camp for several months trying to halt the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . Native American riders listen at an interfaith ceremony at Oceti Sakowin Camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on December 4 , 2016 outside Cannon Ball , North Dakota . The developer of the Dakota Access project , Energy Transfer Partners , and the Army are battling in court over permission for the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe , a Missouri River reservoir in southern North Dakota . The pipeline rupture spilled about 176,000 gallons of oil , about 130,000 gallons of which flowed into Ash Coulee Creek . A photo released by the North Dakota Department of health shows the creek with a brown muck on it . Another photo shows what appears to be the pipeline break with oil oozing out . As of Wednesday , about 46,000 gallons had been recovered . It appears no oil got into the Little Missouri , and no drinking water sources were threatened , according to Bill Suess , an environmental scientist with the North Dakota Health Department . The creek was free-flowing when the spill occurred but has since frozen over . The spill was in a remote area of the southwest part of the state , far from any major population centers . It fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway . A landowner spotted the spill about 16 miles northwest of the town of Belfield on Dec. 5 . The pipeline was shut down as soon as the leak was discovered . Owen said erosion of a hillside might have ruptured the pipe , but the cause is still being investigated . For example , in September 2013 , a Tesoro Corp. pipeline break spilled more than 840,000 gallons of oil into a wheat field near the northwestern town of Tioga . That spill is still being cleaned up . True Cos. has a history of spills in North Dakota and Montana , including a January 2015 pipeline break into the Yellowstone River . The 6-inch steel Belle Fourche Pipeline , built in the 1980s , is mostly underground but was built above ground where it crosses Ash Coulee Creek . It is largely complete except for a segment near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation , where it would be buried 90 to 115 feet below Lake Oahe . Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners says the line will have modern leak detection equipment , and that workers monitoring the pipeline remotely in Texas could close valves within three minutes if a breach was detected . The pipeline route skirts the northern edge of the Standing Rock Reservation , which straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border . The Standing Rock tribe argues that putting the pipeline under the lake imperils drinking water for more than 8,000 tribal members and millions downstream . ETP and other pipeline advocates maintain that transporting oil through pipelines is safer than shipping it by truck or train . CBS RADIO and EYE Logo TM and Copyright 2016 CBS Broadcasting Inc. .
