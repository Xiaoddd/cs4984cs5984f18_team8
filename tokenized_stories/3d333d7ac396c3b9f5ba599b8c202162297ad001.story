First Americans have served in the United States Military , defending the soil of our homelands , at a greater percentage than any other group of Americans . There is no other people more deserving of veteran support and this situation encapsulates whether we are called heroes for violence and cashing paychecks or for justice and morality . They will be limited in their violence against us by US and international human rights laws , a national press presence and observers from the US Congress . In the ultimate expression of alliance , we are there to put our bodies on the line , no matter the physical cost , in complete non-violence to provide a clear representation to all Americans of where evil resides . The Water Protectors are leading the way against this same evil which we must all face globally , saving ourselves and our children from the apocalyptic outcome of climate change . This is not an action of violence , if you feel any potential for violence or antisocial behavior , do not participate in actions , contact us for resources to address that first . Anytime one of us who speaks to a camera or tweets something out , you are a representative of all of us , feel no shame in leaving that to members more experienced in that lane . II . III .
