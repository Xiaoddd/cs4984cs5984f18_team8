That state expects an official tally of costs from the protests in July , said Cecily Fong , spokeswoman for the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services . North Dakota must reimburse Nebraska and other states under the national Emergency Management Assistance Compact , which offers help during governor-declared emergencies and disasters . The federal government provided no financial support for the response , Fong said . More than 1,800 government personnel responded to the protests , Fong said , including about 400 from other states . Protesters also left behind food , tents and other structures , and pits filled with human waste at their camps on Army Corps of Engineers land north of the Cannonball River during the winter , Fong said . Crews hauled away nearly 5,000 tons of trash . It 's too early to tell whether Nebraska will experience similar protests should state regulators here approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline , Kleeb said . The Nebraska Public Service Commission hosted a public hearing on the Keystone XL last week in York , and will hold at least one more hearing , in August , before reaching a decision as soon as Sept. 14 . If approved , pipeline builder TransCanada expects the Keystone XL to be completed within two to three years . Bryan Tuma , assistant director of the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency , said this state is monitoring the Keystone XL controversy as it unfolds and will request help from other states if necessary .
