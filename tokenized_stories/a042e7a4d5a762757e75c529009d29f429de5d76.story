BLOG MASSINGS TWITTER CONTACT Divestment : Only We Can Stop the World from Burning By Gayil Nalls and Lyndsey Walsh Published January 26 , 2017 Only we can stop the world from burning , and the majority of Americans know it . However , on Tuesday , January 24 , Trump gave an executive order to fast-track the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline . Protests against the use of fossil fuels and the denial of climate science have taken place this week not only in New York , but all over the country . Fossil Free reports that this was the largest student mobilization in the Trump era so far . The event was spearheaded by environmental activist and director of Gasland Josh Fox , as well as a variety of organizations including Millennials for Revolution , Defund DAPL , The People for Bernie Sanders , Our Revolution , and Grassroots Action New York . Groups of college students , many of whom members of organizations responsible for pioneering the Divest Movement in 2012 , were also present at the event . Stanford , Yale , Georgetown , and RISD are among the large and growing list of educational institutions that have divested from fossil fuels due to student-led initiatives . Other groups have followed suit , with various American pension funds , NGOs , city and district governments , faith-based organizations , philanthropic foundations , healthcare institutions , for-profit corporations , and cultural institutions also pledging to divest from the fossil fuel industry . The Divest Movement aims to enable a future that confronts the challenges of global warming and its increasing damages to society , the environment , and our economy . It seems the unclouded vision of students and millennials allows them to see that their lives and futures are at risk , and that the only solution is to rapidly evolve to sustainable and renewable energy resources .
