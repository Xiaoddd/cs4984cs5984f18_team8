The attack was on a bridge near the main Oceti Sakowin resistance camp . It began after the water protectors attempted to clear access to the public bridge , which has been blocked by authorities using military equipment chained to concrete barriers . Medics on scene say multiple people were shot by rubber bullets . And we have seen at least four gunshot wounds , three of them I know of to the face and head . Rubber bullets . Water protectors say the police also fired rubber bullets at journalists , shot down drones being used to document the attack and fired flares which ignited grass fires . Legal observers with the National Lawyers Guild said multiple people temporarily lost consciousness after being shot . Witnesses say one elder also went into cardiac arrest and was revived on scene by medics . Both the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe sent medical first responders . This is Angela Bibens , a lawyer with the Red Owl Legal Collective , speaking in a telephone interview recorded by Dallas Goldtooth Sunday . They deployed 20 mace canisters in a small area in less than five minutes , to the point where people have lost bowel function . At least one seizure has been witnessed at the front lines by our legal observation team . There have been people vomiting from the exposure to the mace . And canisters were shot at the medic area at the front line . There is at least one woman who has a broken kneecap .
