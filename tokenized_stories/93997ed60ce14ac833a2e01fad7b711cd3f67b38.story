Over the years , I have seen people who identify as asexual mocked and discriminated against for their lack of sexual desire . I have written about my discomfort with the word in the past . In short , being an ally very rarely entails the risk that simply existing as a marginalized person brings . An ally can always leave . An ally can always withdraw . An ally can choose to stop supporting a cause or go find a different group of people supporting that cause . A marginalized person can not stop being Black , Brown , trans , a woman , or whatever it is that causes them to be marginalized . The march was largely successful , and sparked another smaller protest the next day . This sparked an intense discussion on the event page the day after the protest , when the second protest was being planned . This is because there are many cases of police brutality experienced by the Latino population . Holding a toy sword . Holding a toy gun . Holding a toy gun in the toy gun aisle of Wal-Mart . Doing these things while also NOT BEING WHITE is enough to get you killed and your killers will go home and sleep well that night . This should not be an issue . While your presence , the visibility of your skin and gender , can be a powerful statement , your words may not be needed . You are able to send a message just by showing up . This is also something a marginalized person can not do . Oppressed people destroy symbols of oppression . Decentering whiteness and working to dismantle White supremacy takes a lot of work , and to be honest , a lot of that work is learning to be silent or how to amplify the voice of the person you are supporting . Your words have power . Your words have merit . Use them when they are needed . White people , especially men , are used to being heard . We are used to having our opinions be given equal weight simply because it is a White person saying it . We do not realize this is a part of White privilege . A big part of White privilege is the ability to be ignorant that you have privilege . People of color are used to having to shout , and even then , have their voices ignored . White people who are unaware or still fighting awareness of privilege do not believe that people of color have to fight , because they , as a White person , do not have to fight . Please believe me , people of color have to fight . These meetings are run on a tight schedule . Statements and questions are kept to under 2 minutes , and they only allow a certain number of people to speak at all . I had raised my hand and was in line to ask my question . Frankly , I already knew the answer to my question , but I wanted to get them to say it out loud . Two other people were set to follow me . A White man , and a young Black man . The moderator announced that only the first two of us would be able to ask our questions , that they did not have time for the third person . Of course , this meant that a young Black man would not get to ask his question . It was obvious he was very disappointed . White man in line also elected not to ask his question , in favor of the young Black man speaking . We had each given up our time in order to give a young Black man an opportunity to speak . By doing this , and not demanding we be heard , we decentered Whiteness from that conversation . It was the right thing to do . The young man spoke of his mistreatment at the hands of the Denver police force , both as a young teen and as a young man . What he had to say went beyond what the other man and I had to say . After the forum , I talked with the other man who had elected to not ask his question so the young Black man could be heard . He was also an organizer who has done work against racism in his community in North Denver . If I am talking to other White people , I should talk about dismantling White supremacy and the need to decenter whiteness . I can talk about the centuries of structural oppression that has resulted in such high numbers of incarcerated and dead Black and Brown people in the United States . If I am in a group where people of color are discussing race , I have already been given a gift . I have been given an opportunity to learn . Generally , when this happens , it is because I am with people of color who know I will not insert myself into their discussion . As a White person in a Black or Brown space , I need to be aware that I am here to learn , and generally have little to teach . This is especially important in online discussions because asking for an explanation while someone is already giving information can derail the conversation . If the conversation was deep and the person you want to ask seems troubled or needs space , respect that . Their need for space is more important than your need for a quote at that moment . A lot of my work with Coloradans for Justice is clerical and supportive . I get permit paperwork done . I make Facebook events . I write emails . I write press releases . I canvass . I bring snacks and I make sure the amp is charged and the bullhorns have batteries . I make protest signs with generic sayings for people who want to hold a sign . I bring supplies for people who want to make a sign . I take pictures and video , and then upload it . I tweet . All of these things are things that need to be done in order for protest events to be peaceful and effective . All of these roles are activist actions . All of this is a huge reward , even if it is not a public reward . It is all the reward I need . In order for the movement to be maintained , there need to be more White people willing to take a backseat . To do the clerical and supportive work . To bring the activist cookies . There are a ton of things White people can do to further this movement , including talking to other White people . Black and Brown people do not need to hear about how oppressed they are and how much White supremacy sucks from White people . I promise you , they already know . Registered Nurse .
