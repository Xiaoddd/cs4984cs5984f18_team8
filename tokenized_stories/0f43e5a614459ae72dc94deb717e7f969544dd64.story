Your weather is set to . You can change the location at any time . However , in order to grow stronger together , the world that we live in must be able to outlive us all . Life on earth is not solely dependent on people . It is an interaction between all living things and the ecosystem , to a point where the existence of these living organisms and the vegetation present in it , heavily relies on the environment . PennEast Pipeline threatens N.J. 's environment The environment necessitates protection , as it is the primary determinant of survival . Forests remove carbon dioxide and other pollutants from the air , creating a clean atmosphere . Suitable climate conditions facilitate the growth of food . Earth is truly the only home that we have that can sustain life . Therefore , considering the immense life sustaining contributions the environment avails to human beings and other living things , the least we as a society can do is to save our environment . While the PennEast Pipeline would provide many temporary jobs , allowing workers to make thousands of dollars , this is only a short term economical benefit . The destruction to the environment would be permanent . The proposed route would cross 88 waterways , potentially releasing dangerous levels of arsenic and other harmful chemicals into the water used for drinking , cleaning , and bathing . In addition , millions of gallons of water would be pulled from the Delaware watershed . This pipeline would render 114 miles of land useless for agricultural , and destroy the habitats of endangered species . Aside from crossing some of the Mid-Atlantic 's most popular recreation destinations such as Hickory Run State Park , Weiser State Forest , and the Sourland Mountains , homes from hundreds of families would be taken in the process . The effects extend far past the land itself , and into the lives of friends , families and neighbors . Saving the environment saves the future generation . We will not live forever . Therefore , we should leave the environment habitable and conserved in a way that our grandchildren and great grandchildren can appreciate it . We are blessed to enjoy the onset of sunrise and sunset , the beautiful beaches and forests , jungles , and wildlife . Making sacrifices today of preventing harm to the environment creates a brighter tomorrow . Believe in the people , believe in the future . Sections N.J. News Local News N.J.
