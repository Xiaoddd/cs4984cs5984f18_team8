The pipeline proposal is as ambitious as its predecessor , the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System . Starting at Prudhoe Bay , on the Beaufort Sea , the proposed 42-inch-diameter pipeline would extend south for 825 miles to Nikiski , on the Kenai Peninsula , southeast of Anchorage . Not all environmentalists see the natural gas pipeline in a negative light . Ultimately , the outcome will come down to money . Alaska hopes to attract Chinese investors to the project . Last November , Alaska Governor Bill Walker went to Beijing and signed a deal between his state and three Chinese entities , including a major state-owned petroleum company and the Bank of China , to advance the pipeline . Even with Chinese backing , the pipeline might not make sense financially . A big reason was its huge construction costs . Alaska Wants to Build a Second 800-Mile Pipeline Some see economic windfall . Others , a carbon bomb . The pipeline proposal is as ambitious as its predecessor , the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System . The pipeline proposal is as ambitious as its predecessor , the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System . Starting at Prudhoe Bay , on the Beaufort Sea , the proposed 42-inch-diameter pipeline would extend south for 825 miles to Nikiski , on the Kenai Peninsula , southeast of Anchorage . It also could spur future energy development in the Arctic . A completed pipeline would make several river crossings , and would pass for 28 miles beneath Cook Inlet , which is home to endangered beluga whales . Much of the natural gas lies in areas where there already are existing wells , says Houseknecht , pointing to Prudhoe Bay and Point Thomson , the latter about 60 miles to the east near the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . For instance , exploratory wells over the years in the foothills of the Brooks Range in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska , or NPR-A , have found significant gas there , he says . Not all environmentalists see the natural gas pipeline in a negative light . Epstein added that the pipeline would be able to bring cleaner natural gas to communities such as Fairbanks , which now have horrific air quality in winter due to wood-burning . Ultimately , the outcome will come down to money . The new pipeline would provide gas to China , whose demand for natural gas is expected to surge in the coming decades , according to the Energy Information Agency .
