Share Tweet Reddit Flipboard Email President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that construction would move forward on the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines , both of which had stalled under the Obama administration . The decision was a blow to environmental activists and supporters of tribal sovereignty , but was touted by the White House as a great boost to the American economy . As for who could benefit from the completion of both pipelines , the potential winners are many and varied . Workers President Trump on Tuesday predicted the revived projects would create 28,000 jobs in the U.S. . But job claims for Keystone XL , the larger of the two , have been all over the map . TransCanada , the owner of the pipeline , said in 2011 that it would create 20,000 direct jobs in the U.S. and support an additional 118,000 . The Keystone XL project aims to complete the northern part of a pipeline bringing oil from the tar sands of Alberta , Canada , to the U.S. Gulf Coast . Reuters Of those 42,000 predicted jobs , just 3,900 would be full-time construction jobs for one year . However , fact-checking outfits that include the Washington Post have cast doubt that so many jobs would be created -- the news organization put the actual figure closer to 16,000 indirect jobs , and concluded that even if the figure were 42,000 , it would not have a significant impact . For comparison , last year the economy created an average of just under 180,000 new jobs every month . Job estimates for the Dakota Access pipeline are harder to come by . Most of the project is already constructed ; all that remains is a piece that would pass under Lake Oahe , a source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe , which has opposed the pipeline for that reason . Once the pipeline is operating , maintaining it would support 160 jobs in the region , according to an economic report prepared for the Dakota pipeline owners , Energy Transfer Partners . As for Keystone XL , it would need a mere 50 people to maintain it -- 35 employees and 15 contractors -- according to TransCanada . This has already happened along the Dakota Access corridor . However , like the construction jobs that fuel it , the boom is temporary . The projects would also increase local tax revenue . U.S. steel industry Mr. Trump has directed that companies working on the pipelines use pipes made from U.S. steel . The industry has lost about 16,000 jobs in the last two years , mostly due to competition from China . Canada TransCanada -- as its name indicates -- is a Canadian company , which is why the State Department was tasked with reviewing the project to begin with . Until last year , Donald Trump was an investor in Energy Transfer Partners -- but he sold all of his stock holdings in June , his transition team told reporters last month . Mr. Trump is not required to file another disclosure form until later this year . So far , he has not provided documentation of the divestment . All Rights Reserved .
