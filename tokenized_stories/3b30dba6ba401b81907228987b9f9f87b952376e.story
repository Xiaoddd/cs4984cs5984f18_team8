-LRB- Cars and tires were set ablaze as police moved in on a barricade across a North Dakota highway . Smoke filled the air as tires were set ablaze and police fired pepper spray , rubber bullets while sound canons blared ear-splitting blasts in an effort to push people south of the camp . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of South Dakota say the land where the pipeline is being built is on sacred land . The individual at 1:05 is acting as if he were hit with a taser , and is not being hit with a taser . Although some may experience a taser differently than others , I have seen , first hand , people react to a taser exactly in this way . Please continue to write to APTN with your comments .
