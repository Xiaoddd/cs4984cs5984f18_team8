Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin Activists on horseback pass through the Oceti Sakowin Camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on December 3 , 2016 outside Cannon Ball , North Dakota.Native Americans and activists from around the country gather at the camp trying to halt the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . If anything , this represents a victory of image over reality , despite the claims of native Americans , Hollywood stars and veterans . It seems as if very little logic has been applied to the question , and unsupported claims are repeated ad nauseum in the media . Some have broader goals than simply changing the pipeline route . Unfortunately , this attitude is contradicted by the protesters own reliance on gasoline fired automobiles and , with the onset of winter , propane for heating . Photos showing protesters on horseback , but with lines of parked cars behind them , belie the supposed opposition to fossil fuel use . This is a classic case of branding which disguises the reality . The pipeline is , after all , intended to reduce the usage of rail transport of crude oil from the Bakken oil fields , and there is little reason to believe the river will be any cleaner without it . The lack of context provided by most stories is rather startling , so I did a little research of my own . In fact , the Missouri River is described as one of the most endangered rivers in America , because of urbanization , soil erosion , and pollution . Between farming and industry , the river has suffered a number of dramatic spills , aside from naturally occurring contaminants -LRB- heavy metals and such -RRB- . As it is , in North Dakota there are apparently three petroleum pipelines that cross the Missouri River , three coal mines nearby , as well as four oil rail terminals . There is a website that shows incidents of pollution , and it includes many oil spills . Spills of crude oil do occur , and tend to be larger than those of products , but are still small . In terms of the safety of respective modes of transport , railroads have more but smaller accidents , and the most recent data I can find -LRB- which pre-dates the Bakken boom -RRB- suggests that pipelines spill roughly four to five times as much per ton-mile as rails . Hardly an existential threat . It seems to me , observing from a distance , that Energy Transfer Partners could have done a better job of planning and negotiation their route , but the vast majority of protesters , and media exposure , have their attention elsewhere . One wonders what they will do if the tribal opponents reach an agreement for an altered pipeline route .
