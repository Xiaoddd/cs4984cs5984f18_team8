On the other is Paul E. Singer , the hedge fund mogul whose firm is the biggest creditor of Energy Future . Mr. Singer is exploring making its own takeover bid for the company , which has spent more than three years in bankruptcy proceedings . A fight between the two would serve as the latest source of tumult for a company mired in financial and legal problems . At the center of the brewing conflict is Energy Future , whose Oncor subsidiary is the biggest utility in Texas , with 10 million customers . Yet it is best known as a sinkhole for investor money , with the three firms that bought it having written off their entire stakes in the enterprise and creditors still squabbling over how to reorganize its finances . But what was essentially a debt-heavy bet on high natural gas prices began to falter quickly amid the onset of the crisis and the collapse of natural gas prices . Yet four years later , Berkshire Hathaway seeks to buy Energy Future outright in a bid to expand its growing energy holdings . Oncor is meant to augment Berkshire Hathaway Energy , whose collection of utilities delivers power to 11.6 million customers across the West and Midwest , as well as in Britain and Canada . Berkshire first bought control of what was then MidAmerican Energy in 2000 . It has since become an assembly of utilities , gas pipelines and renewable energy assets like solar and wind generators . Mr. Buffett has pointed to the energy division as a business that generates steady , though not blockbuster , returns on capital . Utilities tend to perform well even in recessions , he wrote in his February letter to investors , and can draw earnings from a variety of sources that reduce the power of any single regulator . One possibility that Elliott favors : letting the hedge fund convert its debt holdings into equity , giving the investment firm a path to taking control . While some of the debt that the hedge fund and other creditors own would be paid back in full through the Berkshire deal , certain bonds that Elliott also owns would not be . In its lawsuit filed in May , Elliott argued that Energy Future was wasting time and money on reorganization plans that were unlikely to succeed . Elliott has begun preliminary consultations with prospective partners and sources of financing . Still , it is not clear whether the hedge fund would ultimately proceed with its own bid .
