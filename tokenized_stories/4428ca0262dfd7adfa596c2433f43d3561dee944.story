Bayou Bridge Pipeline LLC , a subsidiary of Dakota Access owner Energy Transfer Partners , began building the pipeline earlier this year despite multiple legal challenges . Sharon Lavigne and Geraldine Mayho , St. James residents and members of the community-based organization H.E.L.P. , had little to no faith the pipeline could be stopped through their town . Mayho can see numerous oil storage tanks from her front yard . Both women worry that air pollution from the oil and chemical facilities nearby are killing them . Lavigne credits Jordan for getting the judge to understand the injustice facing the community . Dean Wilson , director of the Atchafalaya Basinkeeper , said no one knows when a judgment will be made in that case , but he hopes it happens soon . Despite years of disappointment , Lavigne finds herself hopeful again .
