A clean-up crew pulling a trailer got mired in deep mud at the bottom of Flag Road on Friday morning , Feb. 24 , 2017 . The corps ' contract with a Florida-based company to provide trash removal and environmental cleanup includes the main Oceti Sakowin camp on the north side of the Cannonball River and the smaller Rosebud camp on the south side . Both are on corps ' - owned property . Corps ' spokesman Ryan Hignight said the corps planned to work through the Oceti camp first , where even after three weeks of clean up by the tribe , a large amount of abandoned camp material , garbage , debris and stranded cars and motor homes had to be hauled out . The camp is in a floodplain and Hignight said the corps wants to be sure nothing contaminates nearby Lake Oahe , used for tribe drinking water and others downstream . About 240 rollout dumpsters have been hauled out , each brimming with debris of old food stores , structures , tents , building materials and personal belongings , much of it buried under winter blizzards or simply left behind . Officials are estimating it will require another equal number of loads to get the job done . Hignight said the corps and the tribe are doing a cultural survey to see if any special items , such as teepees , require separate handling and consultation . The contract also included a special environmental crew to deal with potential hazardous or toxic materials . He said his crew would get some instruction from health officials on how to handle the human waste and waste compost in the camp . The corps plans separate contracts to restore and remediate the camp area , according to Hignight , indicating that it had been a pasture area leased for livestock grazing before the camp started in August . Many who left the main camp moved into other camps on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . Tribal officials , along with the Bureau of Indian Affairs , are moving to clear those camps and may get some help from the state . Gov. Doug Burgum 's spokesman Mike Nowatzki said the office supports Standing Rock 's efforts , but there are no definite plans to deploy any state resources . He said the North Dakota Highway Patrol can assist on public roadways , while use of the National Guard requires an official request from either Sioux County or the Bureau of Indian Affairs . The concrete barricades that have been used to blockade and route traffic near the Oceti Sakowin camp were also being moved Friday , but Highway 1806 remains closed north and south of the camp . Highway Patrol Lt. Tom Iverson said reopening the highway to through traffic is a priority , but it 's not clear when that will happen .
