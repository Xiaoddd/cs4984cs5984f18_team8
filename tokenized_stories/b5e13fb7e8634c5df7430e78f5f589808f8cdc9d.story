I asked why they were arrested and he said they were trespassing . I was expressing my outrage at the militarization of their police force and he interrupted to ask if I was watching the videos that the police department is putting out showing the violence that the water protectors were doing . I brought up the girl that that was hit with some type of projectile and was badly injured . He said she was building a bomb and it exploded and that 's how she was hurt . He went on to say that the water protectors were throwing Molotov cocktails . I asked if he was seriously asking me to think that the police were in such danger that they had to use such force . He went on to say that the police dealing with this situation were much more peaceful than what one could expect from the police in a big city . I was about to ask how he could justify their use of water hoses in freezing weather and he wished me a happy new year and hung up . December 28 , 2016 at 9:15 AM Unknown said ... I just called they said call the sheriff 's department , there 's nothing they can do unless there bonded out . Then he hung up on me December 28 , 2016 at 9:44 AM ELEGANSKO said ... I just called . The first woman I spoke to would give me no information , said she just worked there , then hung up . The second call the man who answered was willing to tell me the details that one person had been bonded out , and the rest would go to court later in the afternoon . He said they were arrested for trespassing on private property . That 's all he really had to say . I suggest posting this ibfo as Google Reviews -LRB- 1 star -RRB- on Wells Fargo , Bank of America , CitiBank and Morton County to get the word out far and wide and fast . Also close your accounts with these banks . December 28 , 2016 at 1:07 PM Joanie Trussel said ... I just called and was told they were posting bond as we speak -LRB- 2:55 pm MST on Dec 28 -RRB- . I asked why they were arrested if they were peaceful protestors and he said they were trespassing . I said that it is not private land it is their land under a treaty and if I wanted to say anything more about it I could call a different number and he hung up . -LRB- no number was given -RRB- .

Good idea 2 give the number tho , keep doing it por favor . December 28 , 2016 at 10:17 PM M.R. Hawks said ... Wrong . RCMP pulled this same bs tactic in Canada . Police are trained in a tactic called professional aggitators , where they hire people to infiltrate peaceful protestors , start violence so that they have the legal right to use aggressive force against us and manipulate the military , lower our profile , and cost us our support ... which we NEED TO WIN . It is not in our BEST INTEREST to become violent . We understand that if we do that , we LOSE . No one is so stupid as to cross that line . We believe this same tactic was used at Wounded Knee . Do n't fall for this bs . It is propaganda . We are not going to do what what we KNOW would cost us support and what we KNOW would cause us to lose when something means this much to us .
