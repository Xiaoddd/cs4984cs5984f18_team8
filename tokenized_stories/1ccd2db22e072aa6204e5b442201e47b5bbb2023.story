It Could Be Coming Soon . The traffic is lighter . The food is better . The people are nicer . The neighborhoods are more walkable . The mountains are beautiful . Most politicians and bureaucrats are further away . In fact , when I buy beer , wine , or liquor , signs nearby in the store indicate it 's regulated by a body known as the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board . I 'm a longstanding supporter of drug legalization . As a former writer for the Drug Policy Alliance , the idea that I 'd some day be one of millions of Americans to live in a place where it 's perfectly legal to buy a joint is both bizarre and wonderful . But movement toward legalization is slow , and oftentimes inconsistent . Washington State , for example , still prohibits people from growing it at home . Indeed , when it comes to growing cannabis -LRB- and its non-psychoactive cousin , hemp -RRB- , farmers and individuals who want to grow pot continue to face some absurd legal hurdles . Many are fighting back . In California , voters recently chose to legalize marijuana statewide . But those who want to grow it must still apply for approval from local zoning authorities . Tax incentives built into the law make it likelier counties and other local governments will grant zoning approval . But it 's no slam dunk . Such fears do n't appear unwarranted . In neighboring Oregon , some local governments have rejected legal weed , something state law seemingly allows . But some who 've been told by local governments that they ca n't grow cannabis are fighting back . Oregon farmers who 've sued appear to be relying at least in part on the argument that prohibiting cannabis farming amounts to a regulatory taking . These are just two of many legal arguments adopted recently by state and local cannabis-farming legalization advocates . But these state and local fights only tell part of the story . Just this week , the Hemp Industries Association , a pro-hemp trade group , petitioned the Drug Enforcement Administration -LRB- DEA -RRB- to reverse a newly adopted final rule designating non-psychoactive hemp extract as a Schedule I drug . In the petition , the HIA argues in part the DEA rule is preempted by the 2014 Farm Bill , which limited the DEA 's authority to prohibit a limited amount of hemp planting . The HIA argues that these various flaws amount to an unconstitutional exercise of DEA power . The Farm Bill does permit some limited planting of hemp . But state governments are the only ones -LRB- e.g. , through a state university -RRB- who may do the planting . Individuals must seek a permit . That 's exactly what federal , state , and local restrictions on marijuana and hemp do : they restrict economic opportunity for farmers , entrepreneurs , and consumers . They also diminish other important freedoms , along with government tax receipts . For these reasons , it 's never been more important to hasten the inevitable demise of these restrictions .

Mine all work my monocle mines , but I do n't judge others for using theirs in different ways . Laissez faire , my friend . For me to gain , someone must lose . I 'm waiting for a company to start selling GMO - and gluten-free distilled water . Pure salt is absolutely not purple . If you want pure salt , Kosher salt is your best bet . If you want pure salt , make it yourself . But use better gear than those guys . The salt in the Himalayan Salt Range originates from the evaporation of a sea that occurred way back in Precambrian times . She did n't get it , so I had to explain to her that almost all the chicken sold in the US is made in the USA , organic does n't really mean anything , poultry hormones are banned in the US , uncaged just means there 's 12,000 chickens crammed on top of each other in one room , etc. and she 's falling for a scam . I thought that if there is gluten in your vodka , you have done something terribly wrong . The most like scientifically vetted thing in like the whole history of science , maaaaan , just unexpectedly moved in the wrong direction . Well , it sort is , but you get my point . Here in my town , the leftoid city mayor may be in for some timing problems . Maybe not , because the lone surviving subscription paper here is like her NYT . A few months ago the city evicted everybody trespassing at an old scrap recovery yard downtown . About 40 hobo camps moved out . Instead of a Hooverville , it was an Obamaville but nobody called it that . There were a few folks who called it Rogerostan , including me , but that never managed to catch on either . Years after murders happened there and the property owner was ordered to demolish more buildings . BTW , the buildings would not be a hobo problem if the damn cops would enforce trespassing laws , they were finally moved out . They were burning piles -LRB- yuge piles -RRB- of insulated wire and other crap , which may have been something the mayor would not put up with . If you look at a google satellite image of the Knoxville Police Department HQ , -LRB- TN -RRB- you will see their is plenty of room around their office for the vagabonds . Noplace in the US was pot legalized . It was just re-regulated and Reason cheered . If you wanted it legal , you should have advocated for that in the first place . You sold it to the legislatures as a profit center with more control over their subjects and that is what they bought . Stop pretending to be unhappy with the outcome you demanded . Yeah me fucking neither . Plenty of people did just that . You seem to have an inflated sense of how influential libertarians are . I do n't think it 's the case that if we just applied libertarian principle harder things would have gone differently . Sadly , that 's not how it is . The best we 're going to do is observe and comment . Sorry . Though , to be honest , I was guilty of thinking the same way on gay marriage and look what we got . I think my new stance on this sort of crap is ` no compromise ' nowadays . At least when its not ` everything burns ' . It 's not total victory , obviously , but not getting thrown into a cage for simple possession of a plant is an improvement . In the states where it got decriminalized they have to at least prove that someone did n't pay his taxes upon selling said plant before it 's time to start up the state barbarism . All you can ever get is someone 's forebearance as to kicking you in the shin this minute . Ultimately nobody cares whether they have authority to kick you in the shin , if they 're going to do it they 're just satisfied that they have the power to do so . Some think that that was the real purpose of marijuana prohibition all along . There is probably some truth to the story . If Hemp was a genuine economic ` threat ' , those guys would have simply co-opted it by producing it . Pied piper candidate . Never forget . Palin wins and gets to be the first female President and HRC 's dark heart gives out and takes out all her gathered cronies simultaneously in the resultant explosion . You typically need a liquor license to sell alcohol , too . Zoning restrictions will apply -- they do n't want you opening a bar near a school . I 've seen a proposed 7-11 shot down in southern California because they wanted to sell beer . They wo n't let just anyone brew alcohol for public consumption either , and it does n't matter if you do n't make it for recreational use -- just like with hemp . My understanding is that if you make alcohol for fuel , you 're supposed to mix mustard in to make it nauseating . My main concern is still the federal government . Obama raided state legal medical marijuana dispensaries hundreds of times during his first term , and that sword is still hanging over the industry 's heads . The whim of the emperor is n't much to bank on , and Trump could change his mind about respecting state laws tomorrow . One of the local gals -LRB- our boys were on the same baseball team -RRB- wanted to open up an arcade . It 's a small town , there 's nothing to do , and frankly I think she 's right about Gen X nostalgia being the extra business so 's she 's not relying on the spending power of boys aged 10-20 . Ca n't do it . Would n't be prudent . Well , actually , the city council did give her permission , they just promised to regulate her identical to a gambling house or casino . No arcade for us . Gee , I wonder why there ai n't shit out here in this county and everyone leaves . Justice Thomas gets it . Too bad he wrote that in dissent . And I would add , purchasing legal marijuana for personal use in a state where it is legal has nothing to do with interstate commerce either . However , if you depart a legal sale state and have that states license plates on your car , you have a good chance of getting an obligatory pullover by the neighboring states troopers to ensure you are not planning to engage in interstate commerce . That would be a wonderful thing . Would strike a big blow for small government . Probably too much to hope for . No one likes a bunch of angry retards pointlessly blocking the road and fucking up everyone 's commute . One in three voters in California voted for Trump . Yeah , nobody wants their commute fucked up , but assuming that the people around them are all progressives just like them is also bullshit . Social justice warriors are not the new normal -- and they never were the norm . The discussion is about music . It 's light banter , sometimes clever . Some dingbat just barged in a few minutes ago and dropped a Trump turd right on the coffee table . These people are convinced that everyone must think like them . The crummy part is , I want to lay into this numbnuts , but there 's a pretty good chance I 'll get the banhammer . I ca n't quite tell . He has a website and everything . Someone must find it amusing , or nobody ever searches for him . But on the other hand I support killing babies . It 's a real moral dilemma . I meant to put that joke in the boar shin thread yesterday . Also , you would think homeless barefoot dudes would be all for climate change and warming since he was n't wearing shoes . That 's why he was in Florida instead of Ohio . ... . Rosangela Diaz , a mother of four , said she did not even know about the flag until she saw a Facebook post about it . Someone slashed her tires . People have threatened to burn down her house . After first passing a motion that condemns Islamophobia , last month , Iqra Khalid , a Member of Parliament -LRB- MP -RRB- from the governing Liberals , tabled Motion M-103 in the House of Commons . The motion demands that Islamophobia be treated as a crime without even bothering to define the offense . The Canadian parliament is apparently trying to codify social signaling . That will be enforced completely arbitrarily and , eventually , used to eliminate political enemies . I mean all the left needed was free shit . That was their one winning strategy . And they seem to have mostly put it on the back burner in favor of supporting jihadists and every other looney fringe identity politic issue they can dig up . He knew political Islam and communism were going to fail if they directly challenged a capitalist , secularist Western system because it was obviously superior . Only way for these ideologies to ever move forward would be to destroy the alternative that everyone would prefer . Both parties planned to wipe out the other after Shah was dispensed with . Islamists were faster in that case , but both sides knew who the primary enemy was . Gore was right all along . Then , evidence emerges that the rules leads to various bad effects . It 's vicious cycle of accelerating stupidity . I like the idea of no new rules without repealing at least 2 old ones . e.g. nothing else has produced permanent , isolated , racially-segregated disadvantaged enclaves quite like like Public Housing projects and welfare . Fucking over our native allies is a vaunted American tradition . That would be wrong . I would oppose that . That would violate the First Amendment -- which prohibits the government from discriminating on the basis of religion . But Donald Trump did n't ban these asylum seekers because they 're Muslims . He rejecting them entry to the United States because they 're coming from a country where anti-American terrorism is rife . I believe the ban also applies to Christians coming from Iraq and Syria , as well , and , therefore , it is not a ban on Muslim asylum-seekers . No . The order applies to asylum seekers generally . If exceptions need to be made , they should be made . Regardless , the present policy is not to ban Muslim asylum seekers . If that was the headline you quoted , then the headline was factually incorrect . The Quran claims to be both clear , so no room for interpretation and final , so no room for alteration . It also claims to be correct , which shuts the door on even questioning whether it should be followed . Reform of Islam is impossible without ignoring or expunging its central doctrines . In cases like this , hypocrisy is a blessing . Perhaps the only solution is to pretend you believe it all while quietly disregarding the troublesome parts . That does n't mean taking large numbers of refugees from countries of concern - that would guarantee that those admitted would include plenty of jihadi types . And experience has shown that jihadi types will sometimes pretend to be peaceful and tolerant ... until they are n't . So for those who want to come to the US , the burden 's on them to show it 's in America 's interest . Those already hear - especially Muslim-American citizens - should be presumed innocent of crime , and those who actually believe in Americanism should n't be mocked as somehow being inauthentic Muslims . Thus the book does n't interpret itself , some Muslims can focus on the tolerant stuff and some can focus on the intolerant stuff . Neither the Quran nor the sayings of Muhammad state which verses stand abrogated . However , narrations from Muhammad 's companions inform about the abrogated verses or rulings of the religion . Never mind that there are Shia and Sunni , five schools of Sunni jurisprudence , disagreements within each of those schools , and a bunch of guys sitting around in your neighborhood mosque right now arguing about what the Quran really means where it says such and such ... You went off the rails right from the beginning . You have no idea what you 're talking about , and your claims are all easily disproved using simple facts . In Islam , there is a concept called Ijma which means consensus . This means that when Islamic scholars reach a consensus on something , the matter is considered settled and no further discussion is permitted . One of the greatest sins in Islam is bid ` ah , which means innovation . Perhaps you should read some more before accusing me of ignorance . That 's horseshit . The fact that there are numerous schools , within Sunni Islam alone , that differ in interpretation show that to be bullshit . The fact that the Quran itself claims to have revised itself also shows that statement to be bullshit . This is also horseshit . Islam has been reformed . They have no basis in reality . Wherever you 're reading this crap , do yourself a favor and stop . You 're coming out the other end knowing less than you did when you knew nothing . The differences between schools and sects today are not about whether killing blasphemers is valid but over how many times one should pray per day -LRB- Sunnis say 5 , Shia say 3 -RRB- or whether an animal must be facing Mecca when it is slaughtered . There is a sect of Islam that originated in India during the 19th century called the Ahmadiyya . They are regarded as heretical precisely because they reject the violent teachings of the Quran . The first Pakistani to win a Nobel prize in physics was an Ahmadi Muslim . It appears that actual Muslims are not nearly as tolerant of different interpretations as you think they are . I think you 're talking past each other in terms of ` reform ' . That is ridiculous on its face . Take the transition from the Umayyad to Abbasid Caliphate . In the Umayyad Caliphate , power was concentrated amongst ethnic as well as religious lines , with Arabic Muslims on top . Even other people who converted to Islam were n't held on the same level as Arabic Muslims . You had to officially be ` adopted ' into a Arabic tribe to be even close , and even then you were effectively a ` second class Muslim ' . As the Caliphate expanded across the Middle East and absorbed other cultures -LRB- many of whom had Muslim converts who were more educated than their conquerors -RRB- this system began to cause rebellion and illegitimacy amongst non-Arabic Muslims . Eventually the Abbasids exploited this and used dissatisfaction by non-Arabic Muslims , as well as Christians , Jews , etc. to overthrow the existing system . In its place they promoted a far more general legal status for Sunnis not based on ethnicity -LRB- they still screwed the Shia over of course , because that will go on forever -RRB- . Some people started pointing out the cognitive dissonance necessary to be a true believer in the literal text of the bible and most others , not being religious fanatics and fairly sensible preferred a different cognitive dissonance ; believing it while quietly ignoring the troublesome parts . The enlightenment in one clumsy , rambling sentence . Of course the difference there is , no commandments . But still an understanding , which all but the really , really bereft of common sense always had , that the lore is not to be taken literally .
