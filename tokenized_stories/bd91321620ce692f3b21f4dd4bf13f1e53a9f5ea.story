At around 7:00 AM , about 30 people holding signs and banners gathered on a dirt road leading to the construction site , blocking workers and work vehicles from driving down the road for about half an hour . The workers , all of whom were brought in from out of state , were attempting to bore hole drill under the Santa Fe River to create a path for the pipeline . Police arrived after a few minutes , ordered the protesters out of the road , and shoving demonstraters in the process . Despite the order , protesters continued down the road towards the work site . Around half of the protesters entered a piece of property adjacent to the work site and approached workers with signs and banners , then came back to the road where everyone gathered to block a large water truck from entering the site . The water is necessary for bore hole drilling , and preventing the water from entering the site meant stalling construction yet again . Police again approached , and one protester was pushed into a barbed wire fence by an officer , but the blockade held strong for an hour and a half , with a banner crossing the two-lane road . It is believed that other vehicles and equipment were also unable to access the site due to the blockade . During this hour-and-a-half-long standoff , some protesters moved to another side of the site and blockaded yet another work truck for about an hour . The blockades ended with no arrests . If completed , the 515-mile Sabal Trail pipeline , partly owned by Spectra Energy , would carry fracked gas through Alabama , Georgia , and Florida , threatening wildlife and water sources . We must fight wherever and whenever we can . They Cried many tears . Just ask the people in Shelby County Alabama Reply Julie McLaughlin says : November 6 , 2016 at 11:06 pm Fracking has ruined every area where it took place . Water sources are contaminated , especially wells . I moved to Florida from PA to escape the horrors of fracking . Go solar and clean energy for our environment and for the health of our families . namaste Reply wturnipseed says : November 8 , 2016 at 12:18 am This is inspiring . I live in the Orlando area -LRB- UCF student -RRB- and would like to get involved with this . Take it from me there is no fracking going on . And for the little piece if shit who keeps saying get a real job towards the pipeliners wait until this is over buddy your ass is grass . In fact , I long for a day when we can stop extracting most of our fuel resources out of the ground . Modern pipelines are extensively tested for leaks and current pipeline leak detection technology can detect a pin-hole sized leak within minutes . It certainly is not foolproof , and yes , accidents are still a possibility , but its currently the best method of TRANSPORTING oil and gas . But unless everyone protesting wants to stop using their cars , gas fueled stoves , gas fueled heaters , ect. . Journal Collective . Please consider subscribing today .
