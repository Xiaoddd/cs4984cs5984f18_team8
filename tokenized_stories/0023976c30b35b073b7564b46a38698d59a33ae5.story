Over this past year , tribes throughout the U.S. and world have come together in Standing Rock , North Dakota , to stand in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe 's efforts to halt the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline . As a way to connect our community to the national resistance movement against the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- , Colby Roanhorse started a group called the Grand Rapids DAPL Resistance Fellowship . Through the Facebook group , the members sought to educate , promote awareness , and mobilize action in Grand Rapids in solidarity with Standing Rock . Additionally , from November 22-27 , a group of nine people - including Roanhorse - traveled to Standing Rock , ND . In this conversation , Roanhorse shares more about the Pipeline plans and NoDAPL movement , how people can get involved from Grand Rapids , and what he learned and experienced from being in Standing Rock for just under a week .
