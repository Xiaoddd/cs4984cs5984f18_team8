The Washington Post was the first news outlet to irresponsibly report that Donald Trump sold his shares in Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- ETP -RRB- , the parent company of the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- . Such reports have mislead the public into believing it is a fact that Trump sold all his investments in the pipeline . Again , Hicks was caught lying to The New York Times when she denied that Trump encouraged British politician , Nigel Farage , to oppose wind farms . With no evidence given to prove the contrary , it is only correct to assume Donald Trump is still financially invested in DAPL despite recently signing an executive order to expedite its construction . This is no small conflict of interest . It is blatant corruption . Matt Orfalea makes videos on Youtube . You can also follow him here on Medium , Twitter , and Facebook .
