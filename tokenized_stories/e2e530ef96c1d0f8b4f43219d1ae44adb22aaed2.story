Keep in mind that this is the middle of winter , when much of the high Arctic is still shrouded in darkness . Sea ice throughout the past three months has been especially low in the Kara , Barents and Bering Seas . Remarkably , during January the sea ice edge remained north of the Svalbard Archipelago in far northern Norway , which typically is surrounded by sea ice during the winter . The NSIDC cited the analysis of a NASA researcher , Richard Cullather , who found that the winter of 2015-2016 was the warmest on record in the Arctic during the satellite era , which began there in 1979 . It 's unclear if 2017 will rank higher , given the whims of natural weather variability and the long-term influence of human-caused global warming .

The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the globe , causing changes to cascade throughout the eight Arctic nations and beyond . Some studies have shown that sea ice loss is causing changes to weather patterns in the northern mid-latitudes , including across North America and Europe .
