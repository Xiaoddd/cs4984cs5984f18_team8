Better Leadership 4A Better Bismarck and others have submitted a draft petition to the Secretary of State 's Office for approval . Paul Maloney , a spokesman for the group , said the aim is to start circulating petitions next week and hold a special recall election possibly in the spring . He characterizes the action as a collaborative effort involving different facets of the community with varying concerns about Seminary 's leadership . Secretary of State Al Jaeger said his office will review the petition to ensure it is formatted correctly before it is circulated . The earliest it could be approved is Jan. 19 . State law requires petitioners obtain enough signatures to match 25 percent of the number of people who voted in the most recent mayoral race , about 1,898 signatures , according to Kevin Glatt , county auditor for Burleigh County . If enough signatures are obtained , they would be delivered to Bismarck City Administrator Keith Hunke 's office . Hunke would confirm whether the signers live within Bismarck city limits and are of legal voting age . Jaeger notes that an official whose term is up for office within 12 months will not be subject to a recall under state law . Your notification has been saved .
