Standing Rock water protector . Robin Wall KimmererKathleen Dean Moore posted Nov 05 , 2016 Two lines , facing each other on a North Dakota highway . On one side , concrete barriers protect a row of armored vehicles and helmeted police with assault rifles . On the other , a young man rides a white horse whose legs are stained with blood . A woman , wearing a scarf to protect her lungs from tear gas , wafts sage smoke over a boy to give him strength , wash away hate , and remind him of his sacred purpose . Here , on a highway stretching across trampled prairie grass , the fundamental contest of our time is playing out . The fundamental contest of our time is playing out . The space between the lines vibrates with tensions of race , historical trauma , broken treaties , money and politics , love and fear . But the underlying issue that charges the air , mixing with the smells of tear gas and sage , is the global contest between two deeply different ideas about the true meaning of land . On one side is the unquestioned assumption that land is merely a warehouse of lifeless materials that have been given to -LRB- some of -RRB- us by God or conquest , to use without constraint . On this view , human happiness is best served by whatever economy most efficiently transforms water , soils , minerals , wild lives , and human yearning into corporate wealth . And so it is possible to love the bottom line on a quarterly report so fiercely that you will call out the National Guard to protect it . The fertile soil , the fresh water , the clear air , the creatures , swift or rooted : they require gratitude and veneration . These gifts are not commodities , like scrap iron and sneakers . The land is sacred , a living breathing entity , for whom we must care , as she cares for us . And so it is possible to love land and water so fiercely you will live in a tent in a North Dakota winter to protect them . It may turn out that the cracks in that stretch of two-lane highway mark a giant crack in time , when one set of assumptions about reality snaps and is replaced by another . This , like all times of paradigm shift , is an unsettled time , a time of shouting and police truncheons , as privileged people defend the assumptions that have served them royally . But once people accept with heart and mind that land is our teacher , our mother , our garden , our pharmacy , our church , our cradle and our grave , it becomes unthinkable to destroy it . This vision threatens the industrial worldview more than anything else . Indigenous people are saying , there are honorable and enduring lifeways that beckon to people who are weary of destruction . Everyone can join the people of Standing Rock and say No . No more wrecked land . No more oil spills . No more poisoned wells . We can say Yes . Yes , we are all in this together . Yes , we can all stand on moral ground . Yes , we can all be protectors of the water and protectors of the silently watching future . Right here , between the barricades , we are offered a choice . On the highway , a warrior steps around the concrete barrier , offering a sage bundle that trails white smoke . Approaching a figure in riot gear , he extends the blessing to the officer , letting the smoke wash over him . To give him strength . To wash away hate . To remind him of his purpose . No Paywall .
