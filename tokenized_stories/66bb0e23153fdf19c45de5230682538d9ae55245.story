The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of Fort Yates , North Dakota recently filed a lawsuit against the United States Army Corps of Engineers -LRB- 2 -RRB- , who approved construction of DAPL segments in North Dakota . The Tribe argues that the environmental assessment conducted for DAPL -LRB- 1 -RRB- did not reflect important negative ecological , cultural , socioeconomic , and public health impacts on the Tribe and region -LRB- 2 -RRB- . The DAPL project is just one of many haphazard approaches to natural resource extraction that overlook broader consequences of oil development -LRB- 3 -RRB- . Such practices do not comply with recent Paris Agreement commitments to cut fossil fuel emissions by 2030 -LRB- 4 -RRB- . Open in new tab Supporters of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe rally in opposition of the Dakota Access oil pipeline . In light of recent Paris Agreement commitments , the resolution calls for the U.S. Federal Government to give explicit consideration to how this and any other proposed national energy strategies affect public health , environmental justice , and biodiversity conservation .
