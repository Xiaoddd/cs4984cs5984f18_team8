This oil pipeline runs a distance of nearly 1,172 miles , from North Dakota to Illinois , and its cost is estimated to be around 3.7 billion dollars . In its destructive path , this mega-project is causing irreversible damage to territories , rivers and surrounding communities . Among the affected areas is also Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota , where residents alongside people in solidarity resist the police , forces of the US army , and security guards of the groups assigned to construct the pipeline -LRB- Energy Transfer Partners being the main contractor -RRB- . At the same time , there have been many actions of resistance in various cities across the US and beyond , with rail-track and train blockades , direct actions and symbolic gestures of solidarity . We send strength to anarchist comrades and all others who fight in an anti-institutional , anti-hierarchical manner and without mediators against the construction of the pipeline , showing what it really is : one among the tentacles of domination draining the Earth . Our opposition to this and any other mega-project of the techno-industrial civilization stems from the conviction that the Earth belongs to no one ; from our need to defend by all means necessary everything that has remained untamed and wild in this artificialized world . Journal is the voice of the radical environmental movement . It is meant to be bold , controversial , amusing and diverse in content and style .
