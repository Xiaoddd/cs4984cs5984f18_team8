The event -- organized by the Bakken Pipeline Resistance Coalition -- included a press conference , flotilla , river ceremony , and community gathering . Various participants provided information and stories related to water quality , geology , species diversity , and human habitation from the past to present . The pipeline can transport 570,000 barrels of toxic crude oil per day with the potential of spilling roughly one million gallons an hour . One gallon of oil has the capacity to pollute and make undrinkable 750,000 gallons of fresh water . The Coalition plans to return to Pilot Mound annually to celebrate and protect the Des Moines River . Boone resident Mark Edwards speaks at press conference along Des Moines River .
