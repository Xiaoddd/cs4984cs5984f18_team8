While there are no official numbers of how many students were killed and wounded in the massacre , it is estimated at least 30 students died and over a hundred more were wounded . Every year , organized students at the UES hold a variety of activities including academic panels , art expositions , and an all night vigil to remember and commemorate the massacre . The students also hold a march that follows the same path taken by the student demonstrators of 1975 before they were attacked with tanks by the Armed Forces . The march ended at the site of the 1975 massacre , where survivors shared their testimony and students placed a floral arrangement at the site . March participants then observed a minute of silence with their left fists in the air in memory of those who were murdered . The march ended with the burning of the effigies representative of repression and economic exploitation . See the complete July 30 , 2012 photo album on facebook .
