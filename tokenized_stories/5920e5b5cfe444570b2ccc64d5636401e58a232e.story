Supporters of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe have been protesting the development of the DAPL since April because of the threat it poses to sacred burial grounds as well as the Missouri River . Three federal mandates were issued to halt the construction of the DAPL in recent months , but development continued nonetheless . Finally , on Sunday , the US Army Corps of Engineers denied an easement for the pipeline to cross Lake Oahe , meaning the DAPL would need to be rerouted .
