It is now standard operating procedure for the US military and the US media to publicly accuse any country -LRB- they wish to demonize -RRB- of any crime they can fabricate with virtually not a shred of proof to substantiate their accusations . The completely out of control corporate police state is fully demonstrating their tyranny at the Dakota pipeline protest . A Fukushima reactor cooling system shut down after the latest Japanese earth quake only a few days ago . The actual number of dead trees is likely many times higher and climbing by the day . Chemical ice nucleation is a primary tool in the climate engineering arsenal . Manufacturing winter . The stock market is artificially inflated to new record highs in the power structure 's increasingly desperate effort to keep the population complacent until the last possible moment . Mainstream media 's perpetual flow of total propaganda has so far ensured that the majority of the masses are still all too willing to remain completely asleep and oblivious to the converging catastrophes . The latest addition of Global Alert News is below . The truth will not get out to the masses in time unless all of us help with this critical task . Activists are desperately needed to be active , and not passive . We must all learn how to effectively and efficiently share credible information with others . We must make every day count , time is not on our side , make your voice heard . I contacted the only radio show host who has previously interviewed all the parties involved : myself , Mr. Griffin , Tim Ball , and Lord Monckton . This radio host is Jeff Rense , who is well known and respected in the alternative news community . Jeff 's previous unbiased interviews of all the individuals in question is a clear reflection of his unbiased position . On Tuesday , November 22nd , Mr. Rense sent the following message to G Edward Griffin . The world stage has become ever more dark and dangerous as we all see on a daily basis . I received a note from Dane yesterday in which he suggested we have a round table ` debate ' between you and Dane of the issue of GeoEngineering and the evidence for it . We agreed this was the place to do it and I 'd be very happy to donate a two hour segment on the program to host you both and present your positions . Equal time will be the format . If this is something you 'd like to do , just say the word and I 'll pull some dates together for everyone to agree upon . The 13 minute video below is a public statement which makes clear all the reasons why G. Edward Griffin 's disinformation event is so harmful to the critical effort of exposing and halting the ongoing climate engineering insanity . This week 's GeoengineeringWatch.org outreach booth is at the Monterey County Fairgrounds , Monterey , California , and is shown below . My most sincere and continuing gratitude to the Gem Faire exhibition organizers for facilitating and setting up this very effective booth in every week 's Gem Faire location . The schedule for upcoming Gem Faire events is HERE . A geoengineeringwatch.org booth will be at all events , thanks to the steadfast support of Gem Faire .

A second later , once I acknowledge to beautiful silence , the noises come back again . I adore the silence moments , wish it happened more often . Ears sounds since 2012 , getting louder lately . Hit with abundant chemtrails recently . Bill Mcguayhey says : December 2 , 2016 at 3:11 pm The actions of our kids and college students over some stupid election shows the undermining of our education system and how our youth is not in touch with their own environment anymore.Instead of protesting something that does n't effect them they need to look around at dead trees , no sunshine , sick people and question whether they will live to see 30 . Globalism to me means keeping the population confused while the real agenda is taking place to control people.We can only hope someone honest is now in charge . Spraying has to cease Mr.Trump . Reply Dave Avers says : December 2 , 2016 at 6:40 am God Bless you Sir My only wish it that one of these Chem-trail spraying planes crash sometime , in my back yard , So I can So Proof , to all of the nonbelievers . God Bless you for your Unrelenting fight to get the truth out . The other video was about the Thunderstorm Asthma in Australia . The Weather Channel states that the Thunderstorm caused pollen grains to explode which caused people to get sick . Five dead , 450 to emergency rooms . Many of the victims have never had asthma , as was the fact of the Melbourne attack . Rachel Robson says : November 29 , 2016 at 7:43 pm Dane , thank you for this broadcast . But then , I seem to be profoundly depressed . When I last knew , California had the 8th largest economy in the world . I did ask who took a hit out on California trees . Here in Berkeley a garden , tomatoes and all , can still be grown . But , it has been cold so very long . Our leaves are falling . Lots of sweeping up to do . What is odd here , other than the insane sky , is the hit and miss part . Next door , two cypress trees next to each other . One , quite dead , one quite alive . A lily of the Nile is in bloom right now and they always bloom right around the 4th of July but for earlier-ish last year . Oddities . Plant confusion . Healthy looking trees next to ghost trees . We have birds and bugs but not like we used to . It seems spiders are taking over everything . Including me . I appreciated your food saving suggestions . I would have been surprised about sugar as it is so bad and I do n't do sugar . On the other hand , in Lodi for Thanksgiving , outside by a ` campfire ' most of the time even though quite cold , I watched many many hummingbirds come to my daughter 's feeder . She read to me the ingredients which seemed to be well thought out , more than sugar water-apparently they need a certain calcium too as egg shells often too fragile . They have to flap their wing so very much All the time . So the sugar and calorie thing resonated and I ` get ' it . By the way , I finally finished reading a book that took me a very long time , so dense . It , me too for that matter . So , finally reading The Brothers Vonnegut : Science And Fiction in the House of Magic . Utterly fascinating . Kurt 's older brother was involved in early weather modification and early days at GE . A guy there , Irving Langmuir , discovered and played with plasma , he named it that . This is a biography , not only of Kurt and brother and family , but of this country and the development of geoengineering in the skies . What science used to be like , and what inspired all . including GE and our government . I highly recommend it . I was bummed to hear of the troubles Legal faces . But then , that was to be expected . Our government will not let this happen . I mean if they told the truth , the degree to which they 've broken all sorts of laws , local and international , as Earth burns , all will turn on US with such hatred . Perseverance furthers : Confucius . Those grudges would be Socratic dialect , and binary all . Studied them very early on . I do like some ancient Eastern philosophies , especially Lao Tzu . Gatlinburg TN burned down yesterday . I 've used it as an example to open eyes . Tree 's dead , city in ruin , smokey mountains are on fire still even with an inch of rain overnight . Unreal drought . Reply Rachel Robson says : November 30 , 2016 at 7:41 am Hello TNGeoWatch , Gee . Pointed out they were dying . So , if I saw this early last year , plus the time it takes to make and produce a film , these trees would have been dead or dying at least 3 years ago . Seemed very much like what has gone on in the Sierras . The Smokey Mountains are much loved back East , even if they seem mild by comparison , they are a beloved connection with nature . Cold comfort . RockStar says : November 29 , 2016 at 9:39 am Greetings Dane , I just wanted to say thank you for all of your hard work and loyalty to the truth . It takes a brave person to stand in the face of tyranny like we 're seeing today from the globalists . I salute you and everyone in the truth movement who has the courage to put all they hold sacred on the line to save our planet and the future of our most precious possession , our children .

Being a resident of Northern California , Neil Young can also see what 's going on in the sky above him , the dying trees and all else . Sure could use a song about this too . Corporate media will of course trumpet this completely engineered cold anomoly in order to further the climate confusion of the population . We live in CT and see evidence of aerosol spraying and frequency clouds on a daily basis . I have battled , and kept under control , eczema for most of my life . Over this past summer and , more specifically these last two months , I have developed a more acute form of eczema that is worse than ever experienced . I can only surmise that it has to do with the toxins that are in the air and in my system . In 2013 , you had a doctor guest on your show who provided information on a lab -LRB- DDS -RRB- that does hair analysis which I had done without a physicians order . When I contacted this organization a few days ago for information on another analysis , I was told that ` regulations require a doctors order ' for any testing . martin says : November 29 , 2016 at 5:44 am I spoke to a Muslim handing out religeous pamphlets in Greenford , London last week . He was the only person who had ears open to hear about this lunacy , apart from 2 Israeli 's I bumped into at Auschwitz camp 2 Birkenau this last summer during a visit . Nobody else seems to want to hear about this , including my work mates , boss or friends , it 's like living in a cave , isolating , to know this & not be able to speak out . I guess most people just do n't want to believe it . thanks for being there . Reply Mark bayne says : November 29 , 2016 at 1:24 am Mark here from Australia . 8 people have now been confirmed dead , over 8000 were hospitalised and the official story was that the storm stirred up pollen and people with allergies succumbed to this . This week warning of an extreme heatwave -LRB- lasting more than 3 days -RRB- , temps over 40 degrees Celsius , extreme warnings on staying in air conditioning , staying out of direct sunlight , that this is a lethal event and extreme fire alerts . This being said , there is yet good in the world , and compasionate human beings . There is yet much worth fighting to preserve , never give up my friend , many march with you in this battle , and our numbers are growing . There is no rye grass growing in the desert , I do n't think so . There has been another probable ice nucleation assault in that region . One has to consider the chemicals and screw ups in overloading applications done by these weather terrorists . Capricious winds , faulty equipment , experimentation , or deliberate to kill and injure , any and all must be considered . It was not coined until the 1980s , well within the time line to the ratcheting up of aerosol weather warfare . It is not related to geoengineering , but gives us a pretty good idea how twisted it all is . Y' all have lifted me back up from a dark place : Irene Parousis , Penny , Andrew from Scotland , Susan Ferguson , Virginia , Ron Hall , and last , but not least , Dane Wigington , without whom we 'd be much , much further down the rungs of this ladder . A real gentleman . Everyone gets ` tired ' and its a good idea to rest up , search out the ` good ' and focus on that for awhile . There 's plenty of ` battle ' to come so do n't worry about missing any action while you R and R . As for a literary diversion -LRB- you 're a literary guy -RRB- , get ahold of William Faulkner 's ` The Reivers ' . As one of America 's native sons , his Pulitizer Prize winning novel -LRB- 1962 -RRB- touches on a few analogous topics and how to address them . I 've tried for several years to get other green non-profits to work with our group , and ALL have said they did not want to risk loosing funding , followers , family , friends , etc. . I have had a few tell me privately that they think it 's horrible , but do not want to rock the boat at work . They all have children . It is extraordinary to me how people can have children and not do EVERYTHING they can to get this message out . Reply jeff says : November 28 , 2016 at 8:53 am A little ray of light , in my battle here , has been a number of people I have discussed geoengineering with have been responding to me about there observations of it actually taking place . I have -LRB- like many of you -RRB- noticed the blank stare that is many peoples response when you confront them on the issue . I have had a few people that told me that it really hit them , when seeing it going on above them -LRB- finally looking up -RRB- . I was able to get a client into a conversation last week about geoengineering when just discussing the weather . The best part was the client telling me of there observations at there other house in Sea Side Orgegon . They were saying that they were curious about the strange flight of jets flying from the ocean toward the coast leaving a trail that morphed into a white haze . I relayed the information that I have with them , and they were some what relieved to hear it , because it connected dots for them . suggested that they visit this sight for more info . In all I am feeling that the mass awakening is coming soon . Thank you Dane for your huge efforts in exposing this crime . I hope to effect many more . I really like the information booths you have shown , and I am looking into setting one up , I live very rural , and am looking for outlets . I will keep you posted . Some never had asthma before . The story was taken down shortly after I posted a comment about GEOengineering and Dr. David Keith . I saw only one other comment suggesting Aluminum Oxide might be to blame . I posted the story to facebook . Reply Mark from OZ - MN native says : November 28 , 2016 at 3:40 pm Yes Paul . This IS a very big deal ; on the scale of a large terrorist attack which in many ways , it is . There is no dispute that CO2 levels are rising rapidly and as all plants employ the ` carbon cycle ' -LRB- converting CO2 to O2 -RRB- in their life cycle , it stand to reason that amplifying CO2 will have direct effects on plants including those that are associated with rhinitis -LRB- hay fever -RRB- and other allergies . You 'll observe from the link below that ` this ' -LRB- patronizing -RRB- explanation is offered as it remains in the ` natural ' realm ; thunderstorms and plant pollen . They are suggesting that wind power and humidity is causing the pollen to fracture into much SMALLER size where they can find their way deep into the lungs where it causes havoc . We know that many aerosols already -LRB- orders of magnitude smaller than pollen -RRB- penetrate the alveoli gas exchanges in the lungs and enter the bloodstream . This approach hides the more sinister -LRB- and more threatening -RRB- cause which shows that natural pollens are combining with atmospheric aerosols -LRB- industrial and SRM -RRB- which are now overwhelming some human 's ability to effectively mitigate . Smh . Yeah , I 'd seen that story in a few places . The thing is , they could have added anything to the spray , which caused that reaction . I wondered if it was some kind of test-run . Ghost of Fall says : November 28 , 2016 at 2:27 am Open Letter to the Elite Up until this point many people have wanted to talk directly to you but no one ever knew where you were hiding . I am here to tell you that I know EXACTLY where you are hiding . I know because I have been traveling around the world my entire life , and I have seen you everywhere in the shadows of this beautiful planet . you were somehow free . You were wrong . Because of everything you have done I had no choice but to put you in a cage with ME . My conscious would n't let you get away . And now I have set myself free , and you are trapped in that cage all by yourselves . If you knew how to get out of it on your own you would n't be here reading this . And now I 'm looking in at you , waving the key in your faces . We here within this site are the only ones that you are actually afraid of for this reason alone , so you better pay attention to everything we are saying right now . Not only is a large part of the population of the world angry at you , but the Earth itself is VERY ANGRY NOW . I am here to tell you that that will never happen . The population of the Earth is the only spiritual resource large enough to fix the problems you have facilitated by your complete lack of connection to the source . At this moment in time you only have two choices : Option One Stop the chemtrails , stop the vaccines , stop putting fluoride in the water , stop the fracking , stop HAARP , stop the slave labor , stop the wars , stop the armies , stop the contract government , stop building nuclear facilities , and most importantly stop the lies . For once in your lives tell the world truth . Use the media to start telling the populations around the world the seriousness of situation and how everyone must now focus on turning things around while there is precious little time left . The population will start to renew their karma by restoring the planet back to a natural environment that supports all life as it once did . This will be more difficult in the first world countries that have gotten far too comfortable living within your lies . It will be easier for the third world countries which is most of the planet , who have been forced to endure your shackles . You will start to renew your karma by making a book listing in detail all of the countless ways that you have brought an entire planet nearly to the brink of extinction . This will be spread across the entire planet as the new law of the land for future generations to know exactly what to never do ever again . Your karma will be so beyond repair that you will never escape this cage you are in for the rest of eternity . Let me explain to you what this looks like . This cage you are in now still has some natural light bestowed on you by God . That light will be replaced by artificial light . Your grandchildren will not be close to you because you will be the only connection they have to a humanity that destroyed the entire world , to which your lies with continue on even to them . They will go looking for the truth , and they will find it in a book about the changing of the seasons that no longer exist . And I will come back to them as the Ghost of Fall , time after time . And I will tell them that I tried to save their futures even though you would n't . And I will show them the truth behind every one of your lies . After awhile none of them will keep coming back to this Earth down there where you reside because there will be nothing left for anyone to learn there . The artificial light in your cage will then go dark . The spirit of the Earth itself will depart , and you will be left there for the rest of eternity by yourselves trapped within a dead planet unable to ever escape . Only God holds the hands of time and this is what it looks like . If this post is removed it will only prevent everyone that needs to , from being able to come out of the shadows immediately which will further seal your own fate . You are only serving yourselves . So know this : EVERYTHING YOU DO TO US NOW ONLY COMES BACK TO YOU . Even at this late hour GOD will not take away free will . The fact that you are reading this now before everyone around the world that cares the most about the future of this Earth is the only sign that GOD needs . EITHER TAKE THE KEY OR DO N'T THE CHOICE IS YOURS . You see , they will look at your post , not as a warning but of weakness . Their hatred for THEMSELVES knows no boundaries . Not my speak , theirs . So , we are up against people who think of themselves of GODS , NOT HUMAN . Diane Friday says : November 28 , 2016 at 5:07 pm Ghost of Fall : I want to commend you on your exquisitely written notice to the elites . I 've been wanting to do something like this for a long time , but what you 've written is far superior to anything I might have come up with . A benign but consistent and , again , annoying curse . We posit that it probably goes back centuries , when one of the patriarchs angered the wrong person -LRB- as they all seem to do -RRB- who , fortunately , was n't too adept at curses . Thinking about that , I decided to bestow a new family curse upon not only elites , but every single individual who is or has ever been involved in , or who has now or has ever had any knowledge of the systematic destruction of this beautiful planet and every living thing on it . My curse is this : May they feel the fear , the suffering , the hunger , the thirst , the hopelessness , and the endless pain they 've caused and continue to cause every living thing on this once beautiful planet . May they feel it slowly , for to feel it all at once would result in their immediate demise , and they do not deserve an immediate demise . And may they and their progeny feel it for eternity , or for incarnation after incarnation , with the acute knowledge that there is no hope it will ever end . If these so-called elites have any of the beliefs , or engage in any of the practices we 've read about for so long , they should know there is great power in focused intentions and in words , particularly once they 've been spoken , or written . Thank you , Ghost of Fall , for inspiring me to finally write these words . And heartfelt thanks to you , Dane , for your unwavering commitment , tenacity , and bravery in the face of such overwhelming odds and such genuine evil . Thank you for sharing that . Pedro says : December 2 , 2016 at 2:03 pm Hello All . You are in the right tune . virginia says : November 27 , 2016 at 7:48 pm Andrew : I have such respect for posters such as yourself for taking the time to do research and then generously relaying it to us . The Fukushima earthquake and tsunami has long been thought by many to have been caused as a lesson to Japan for its financial and moral and political support for the Palestinians and for their statehood . Israeli security was in charge of the Daichi plant -LRB- as they were at the Twin Towers -RRB- and Japan was warned to cease their Palestinian support . To the detriment of the entire world and the poor people of Japan , warnings were ignored . It has also been researched that the tsunami could have easily been caused by nuclear explosions on the continental shelf . I read all this with some questions until reading former Sec . of Defense Cohen 's remark that we do , indeed , possess that capability . There have been too many ` natural disasters ' occurring on countries that do not march to the beat of the drum of the deep state 's new world order . These people are totally insane and without a shred of regard for humanity or wanton destruction . Thank you , Andrew . Peace and hope .

Rachel Robson says : December 1 , 2016 at 9:18 am Interesting Jake , I 've not seen this . It was very frightening to see last year , when I first noticed it here in Los Angeles . It does n't always come down that way . For example a week ago , we had lot 's of rain , but no foam . Of cource last week in W. LA , in a distance of just one mile with no rain , a sudden arrival of enormous dark clouds , a huge downpour for 4 hours , and then it stopped.There is so much Aerosol spraying in LA that is visible in the skies from vertically asceneding planes , and more. , and it seems to be obviously a result of the rain bringing down the stuff from the sky . The other day when it rained here , however , there was no frothy white stuff . Joseph L. says : November 27 , 2016 at 1:33 pm I was in Home Depot and lots of aersol spraying over N.Y. .

Reply penny says : November 27 , 2016 at 12:22 pm A fact about the Fukushima cooling system shutdown , they are talking about Fukushima Daini , not Daiichi . I would guess that they just say ` Fukushima ' so that people will get the impression that the Daiichi reactors -LRB- the ones that blew up and melted out after the 2011 tsunami -RRB- are functioning properly again . Daini lies south of the Daiichi disaster site . The reports about the cooling system that temporarily cut off after this recent quake sometimes mention Unit 3 . Unit 3 at the Daiichi plant was devastated , and has no cooling system left , let alone one that might have been running and been restarted after a temporary glitch . Just as with the fake images of western reporters standing ` inside Unit 4 ' -LRB- when Unit 4 looks like this -RRB- , all mainstream coverage of Fukushima is the usual lies and mis-direction . Likewise , talk about having evacuated workers from Fukushima was about the Daini plant . I recently saw a headline about Tepco planning to send another robot into one of the Daiichi buildings ; all the robots sent in so far have melted down within minutes . I am most grateful for what rain we received . Tomorrow Monday , I expect Chemtrails to begin to plaster our High desert Valley skies tomorrow . . this always happens . . the pilots short Thanksgiving vacation is over and they need to make their money anyway they can . . and they 'll be back at it tomorrow . . I 'll update you tomorrow . . Earth Angel says : November 27 , 2016 at 4:34 pm ` Hatrick Penry ' has done some very good research on the Fukushima Daichi meltdowns . His inquiry shows directly from FOIA documents communications from TEPCO officials taken immediately after the disaster occurred and is telling as to how truly out of control the situation was right from the start and still remains today .

Pretty sure it 's about posting articles from Geoengineeringwatch.org because I do so very little on FB . Was inactive for ages , I guess they let their guard down , because in August I posted a painting . Got immediate acclaim from friends , people 30 years into the woodwork came back to say hello , and I ultimately sold a painting . I guess FB looked darkly at that , because now I ca n't get my art in front of anyone . I call friends to verify , as most of my FB contacts are people I know face to face . They are not getting my messages or posts with scant exception . So I 've paid out of the pocketbook for affiliation with this website . I am proud to be associated . These are such dark times .

I kept wondering why we could get the new LED lightbulbs so cheaply now . People are snatching them up as fast as they can with their promises of long life and extremely low energy consumption . Seems these newfangled lights , because of their extremely limited unhealthy blue light range , cause depression and blindness among other cellular changes . So now , besides not breathing outside , drinking the poisoned water , or eating the genetically modified food , we can not even escape to the sanctuary of our electrically lighted homes without fear of personal damage . Great-grandma 's candlelight , turns out , may be the best thing for us . Turns out those spendy little bulbs put out a lot of dirty electricity .

They showed pictures of the ridiculously thick icing which WE KNOW results from artificial ice nucleiation processes and yet NO MENTION of the climate engineering which has been taking place for decades .

When people like John Casey make outlandishly false claims , the alarm bells should go off , and the claims then fully investigated -LRB- along with investigating John Casey himself -RRB- . Sheila Donna-AZ says : November 27 , 2016 at 10:24 am Saturday 2AM spraying , and continued all day in Sun City , AZ. . We should have had a good amount of rain coming from the Pineapple Express , but they put a stop to that . Deficiency on demand , and theft of rain . The thieves need to be put in jail . That is you ADEQ , -LRB- you all are complicit in this illegal act of poisoning us and stealing our rain -RRB- . Reply BaneB says : November 27 , 2016 at 4:13 pm Donna AZ : Yep , the weather control terrorists sprayed the hell out of that Pineapple Express . I do n't think they had enough resources to microwave-deflect it south . So much of their attention is dealing with mega lows coming into the Pacific Northwest . Their juggling is becoming more complex because nature is fighting back . And these creeps sure as hell could not push it north due to a low pressure system already in play there . So . As soon as the express came into northern Mexico these psychopaths buried it under a moisture thieving canopy of aerosol particulates . And , no doubt you were sprayed , too because the moisture will tend to recoales once it gets past the spray field . Pedro says : November 27 , 2016 at 9:58 am Hello All . Andrew from scotland , thank you . Reply Sanjeet Veen says : November 27 , 2016 at 2:53 am The overall requirement for todays time and in the near future is to get rid from climate change and removal of carbon dioxide . That ` weather prediction ' is not a prediction , it is already happening . We have massive crop failure here due to drought , severe storms and flood damage . Yes , they are probably trying to block sunlight from reaching the ocean 's surface around Australia , but that water drives our weather . Now it is completely altered . The weather predictions are frustrating in that it is obvious they are hedging their bets with stupid and meaningless percentage chances of rainfall . It basically means nothing and that anything , most likely no rain , will occur . I have n't found one person who can definitively interpret these ` percentage predictions ' . They are pure obfuscation . But I spread the word , especially where I work with its large work force and people are listening , especially now with events like the Melbourne Asthma Storm . Such events are going to help unravel the Geoengineers ' efforts . But even without that there is still plenty of evidence above our heads and raining down on us . Just . CAN NOT . FEEL . ANYTHING . Michel B says : November 28 , 2016 at 1:08 am Hi Dennie , Yep , I agree with all of your points . You should read ` Blood Meridian ' by Cormac McCarthy . It seems greatly prophetic ; at least insightful . Yes , I agree , the inability to care is not evil in itself , but it leads to disaster nonetheless . As for the Dialectical , it has been foisted upon us to prevent the full scope of critical thought possible . It is polarity , such as the two party system , where nothing essential changes . It is so important to grasp this , and thus it requires a bit of an academic ability to out-argue them . Their weasel words and ideas are slyly slid into our vernacular and into our lives . We must be ever ready to detect them and undo them . Stephan from Canada : Yes , the weather has been scripted for a long time . It is just getting more fictitious as time goes on . Joseph L. says : November 26 , 2016 at 8:40 pm Dane great show telling the truth and I hope alot more people listen to your show . I am encouraged by your words of wisdom and I continue to pass out information flyers about this site . The masses are to blame by not questioning anything and being dumbed down . But after all , it 's the leaders of the country who determine the policy , and it 's always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it 's a democracy , a fascist dictatorship , or a parliament , or a communist dictatorship . Voice or no voice , the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders . That is easy . The spray mix contains drugs to cause us to be sleepy and compliant . Thank you Dane for the quote from the O.R. geo engineer . Us against them . California 's voting block boasts putting the losing person for pres. in the majority vote category . There is no shame in standing , living , breathing and acting on the truth . BaneB says : November 27 , 2016 at 4:34 pm Joseph L : Oh my , but would not that monster Herman Goring enjoy the fruit of his self indicting remarks were he here today . He would have been one of the first to recognize the World Trade Center debacle for exactly what it was and still is . The con is precisely what Herman Goring refers to that has dragged Babylon into a false war founded upon a false flag out of which to date several million innocent Middle East civilians have been murdered . Since Goring stated the obvious about 9-11 , I think it can be said that our traitorous leadership has Nazi attributes . attack Russia . The Nazis failed to study Napoleon 's mired muddy defeat though Hitler was the one who forced the German army to do the stupid . kathleen says : November 26 , 2016 at 7:15 pm Sigh . I feel your sense of urgency , Dane , as TPTB fights back with lies on top of more lies . Once greed grabs a hold , it apparently does n't let go . But the truth MUST win out or the entire planet will be uninhabitable . For max health bennies and shortest cooking time , soak at least overnight -LRB- or even to the point of beginning to sprout , which may require rinsing to avoid mold or spoilage -RRB- before cooking . Do n't add salt until the end or that will inhibit them from getting soft . Some beans -LRB- like mung -RRB- and seeds -LRB- like quinoa -RRB- can be eaten raw , once sprouted . but there are surely other local sources for each . In general , I look for organic , certified Non-GMO . 2 . Save all glass jars as potential rodent-proof containers for beans , seeds , grains , pasta . Use glass to store homemade tinctures like elderberry syrup -LRB- for colds -RRB- , and water , too , but keep out of sunlight or the potential magnification could start a fire if it focuses on something combustible -LRB- even on a cloudy day -RRB- . Greens are a hugely important food that few of us consume in the quantities most beneficial to us . Leaves of topside greens -LRB- lettuces , spinach , chard , endive , etc. -RRB- can be picked daily for a delicious salad or soup . 4 . Investigate moringa , all parts of which are edible and loaded with nutrients . 5 . Weeds -LRB- any plant that grows where you do n't want it to grow -RRB- are hardy , and often more nutritious than what you can buy in a store . Should barter become our only option , give the GMO sugar you 'll have set aside . Salt used to be a currency -LRB- hence salary -RRB- , but it might be difficult to ascertain mineral content nowadays . Salt is not necessarily your enemy , and its elements are mandatory to our saline bodies . offers a wide variety -LRB- and weekly sales -RRB- , many in small reusable jars , but nothing organic . Frontier , Simply Organic , and MountainRoseHerbs offer organic , and the latter has monthly specials . Seeds : Please try seeds , like radish -LRB- easy to grow and easier to sprout and eat -RRB- , sesame -LRB- easy to grind or toast -RRB- , the dreaded broccoli which looks and tastes like alfalfa but without the dangers of poisons in alfalfa , and mustard -LRB- easy to grow , grind , sprout -RRB- . Search on each of these topics for a plethora of info , being mindful that you will always get contradictory opinions . We must be strong to combat the horrors being rained -LRB- and reigned -RRB- down upon us , and that means we must feed our bodies what they need . Here are my top five underappreciated foods : dark leafy greens , ginger , turmeric , garlic , fermented veggies . Follow those with foods of every color , every day . Here 's a book I recommend -LRB- I 've read it twice and still have n't absorbed it all -RRB- : How Not To Die , by Michael Greger , M.D. . It will open your mind , even if you do n't agree with everything . It does not , sadly , address geoengineering side affects , but it 's a sound basis for a start . Check it out from your library and see if it helps guide you towards healthier eating . The index is paltry , too . Sorry . Never give up , my friends . We are in the fight of our lives , and for the lives of every creature extant on this planet , the numbers of which are decreasing at alarming rates never seen in recorded history . It 's up to us , or there 'll be no one to stop this madness . If you have any spare change , please donate to the brave people who are attempting to rectify the horrors we are experiencing . If you have no spare change , then prayers from those who appreciate the earth can not hurt . I have n't bought from the latter , even though they may be good -LRB- or better -RRB- . I 've started stockpiling dried beans . I used to have a problem with getting them to soften enough -LRB- I have very hard water -RRB- , but then I learned that adding half a teaspoon of baking soda to the soaking water solves that issue . virginia says : November 27 , 2016 at 9:59 am Kathleen : Hi and thanks so much for your info-filled post . I intend to click on to your links , some of which are new to me . Thanks for the time spent on giving us these facts and options . Peace . horsegirl says : November 27 , 2016 at 1:58 pm Thanks for this info . Seeds are great for long-haul hunker down needs . Rachel Robson says : November 30 , 2016 at 8:45 am Kathleen , Thank you for some good advice . We do have rodents . Good idea . And about spices , since many of my good ones are ground and I use them often , but I do have many not ground and it is good to know they are worth keeping . My next door neighbors are ethical vegans and she grows many greens . Via experimenting , she 's come up with the most wonderful soups , ones I thought I 'd never like but in fact love . And purslane , miner 's lettuce and many others . By the way , one of my favorite beans when young were the small whites called navy beans . It was some time before I could find them out here in California . Thing is , these are known to last longer than any other bean and so were stocked on ships for long , long voyages , hence being called navy beans . Not all beans have the same shelf life . And , indeed , salt is a commodity worth stocking up . Heck , people used to trek very long distances just to get salt . It could well be currency . As it is , I trade my chicken eggs with neighbor next door , who will eat mine as she knows how they are raised , and she gives me homemade soups from greens , even carrot tops , in return . Marc says : November 26 , 2016 at 6:04 pm Dane , many of us are walking a fine line between continuing to try to raise awareness of active geoengineering and it 's harms , and simple resignation to what seems an inescapable collapse of civilization . It almost seems the more dire things get , the more people just want to party , laugh , forget . I get that . Do n't misunderstand me . I will do what I can , but I got ta tell you , it is getting mighty hairy , and knowing what I know now about the impenetrable and inviolate forces behind all of this , coupled with an understanding of just how deep the deception and the evil intent goes , AND an increasingly acute awareness of how short a timeline we are on , I find my conviction faltering . I 'd wager many others who visit here are also feeling completely and utterly overwhelmed with the magnitude of the dying now everywhere around us . Many may not admit to it . Some will , some wo n't . I am ADMITTING to it . Today , over St. Louis , Missouri , the skies started out relatively blue earlier this morning , no clouds , no trails . Lots of 'em , crisscrossing every which way , fanning out into broad patches of semi-transparent cloud blankets . This is a tough one to swallow , for those of us who have become quite adept at blaming everything and everyone BUT ourselves for our predicament . Granted , in spite of our personal rates of consumption , what is being INTENTIONALLY done now to thoroughly muck up the biosphere on a grand planetary scale is light years beyond anything I will accept any blame for . Except for perhaps my guilt for not having lifted a finger to do anything about it sooner . Lastly , -LRB- I promise , sorry -RRB- I saw an old and dear friend today . He and I go waaaay back and are connected on a soul-level . We were driving around and I was just kind of making conversation when I said you know , things are getting very , very dark on the horizon for humanity . He agreed . He knew I was talking about weather warfare and so on , I did n't even have to say it . -LRB- we 've had discussions about geoengineering but he has great difficulty with the topic -RRB- His response is one I 've encountered many times before . I so wish everything was different than it is . Reply Dane Wigington says : November 26 , 2016 at 7:51 pm Hello Mark , thank you for the honest and hearfelt message you have shared with us all . If we fully embrace this moment in time as having the deepest potential purpose , no matter how painful , there is great meaning . To all those that are awake , thank you , and consider that this is not an accident of fate to be regreted , dreaded , or avoided , but rather to be embraced . If we do not yield our values , our virtue , and our honor , ever , then we can not lose this greatest and most profound struggle . We must never give up , ever , this power belongs to each of us . That is not who you are . There are no guarantees in this life . Ever . The legacy we leave for others who follow will prove invaluable . Our courage in the face of whatever is to come is what counts . We must never betray our own heart and soul . Dane is right . Andrew from scotland says : November 27 , 2016 at 12:16 am Marc and Dane , excellent comments . On on . Irene Parousis says : November 27 , 2016 at 9:14 am Hi Marc , just like you I vacillate between fighting in this battle and giving up , almost on a daily basis . But yesterday I had a strong revelation and that is that the fighter cells in our bodies do n't give up 'till our last breath and sometimes there is miraculous healing even when the body is ravaged with cancer . Those of us who are awakened are the fighter cells of our Planet and she needs us to keep fighting for her life , that is our PURPOSE . I believe if a critical mass is reached a quantum leap will happen and a spontaneous healing will occur . I ca n't explain how this works , but I did experience it many years ago and I know the potential for such an event is GREAT . Dane Wigington says : November 27 , 2016 at 11:31 am Hello Irene , YES virginia says : November 27 , 2016 at 10:24 am Dear Marc : Thank you for your honest assessment as well as the heart-wrenching truth that we all feel . Admittedly , after living some very long years and experiencing some brutal wars and other social conflicts , these times in our country as well as internationally are the roughest , toughest and scariest of all . How many times , I , myself , am ready to say ` the hell with it ' and get back to my knitting . For the future is theirs . We made it . We screwed up royally It is up to us to try to rectify our errors . Hang in there and know you have a lot of cohorts . Let us strengthen each other by our endeavors to improve , as much as we can , in any small way . Talk up this assault on our climate ; the Fukushima disaster whose radiation is sickening all of us ; expose the liars like Griffin ; expose the deadly vaccines given our babies ; expose Monsanto ; expose the crooked politicians with dollar signs for eyeballs . Well , you get the picture . Sorry to sound so personal , but , as you , I feel the hurt . Thanks , Marc . Peace . If it were merely challenging , that would be no problem . But I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world . Marc , your honesty is greatly appreciated . I have had the same feeling many times . I think that everyone who visits this site has a personal philosophy that includes setting a high value on honesty and integrity , and it 's obvious that that is true for you . It is possible , imo , to reframe the issue from one of ` the battle to wake others up ' to ` a desire to help others to prepare for an imminent upheaval ' . It 's damaging to some people 's spirit , to push a message of doom and despair on others , especially since many others instinctively repel that message . But most people now realize that things are falling apart , and welcome anyone who can face the looming crisis with some degree of calm , and with advice on where to start in the effort to make our landing as soft as possible . To paraphrase Gandalf -LRB- okay , Tolkien -RRB- , we ca n't choose the time into which we are born , we can only choose the manner in which we confront it . The hobbits were remarkable for their ability to do the right thing without letting it crush them , and without expecting any thanks or accolades . They were true heroes because they were not heroic : they were only trying to live with integrity and to be helpful . Also , I remember you talking about the beauty of the world and how you refused not to enjoy that , in former posts . That in itself is a tremendous thing . I wove my webs for you because I liked you . We 're born , we live a little while , we die . A spider 's life ca n't help being something of a mess , with all this trapping and eating flies . By helping you , perhaps I was trying to lift up my life a trifle . I agree , we are doomed and each of us has role , albeit , subconscious , in our inevitable extinction . Opaque psychopaths . Now we are learning that our Govt . seems to harbor pedophile rings that stretch to Europe-such has always been the case . And we wander and live a somewhat decent life as India crumbles into chaos . Even though humanity 's time is coming to a close , the mystery of mysteries continues . I really wish for you to continue your penetrating writing , my friend , because it is so real . Pedro says : December 1 , 2016 at 3:39 am Hello Friend . We ARE guilt-FREE . Do n't Worry . Find new friends and talk to them . We ARE 7 BILLION . Find them outside the US , if necessary . Situation is Critical . No time for crying . Now is fighting . Hug to You All . All they are doing is preventing free markets the chance to self clear . All they are doing is keeping the planet from getting a chance to clear itself of the poison and heal itself . penny says : November 27 , 2016 at 10:49 am Cliff Carnicom has a fascinating and vital paper on his site , in which he discusses the original SRM proposal from that Evil Genius , Edward Teller . Teller 's claim was that aerosols spread through the stratosphere , or even higher , would abate global warming . He knew that spraying the same materials in the troposphere -LRB- where they are sprayed now -RRB- would exacerbate warming . That the term SRM is NOT a scientific term when applied to the spraying -LRB- all done in the troposphere -RRB- advocated by Evil Idiots like David Keith . They are abusing the term , and might as well be saying ` chemtrails ' . Of course , most of them are just saying what they 're being paid to say . Some , like Peter Wadhams -LRB- author of The End of Ice , recently forced out of his professorship at Cambridge for being too brutally honest -RRB- , probably are just too focussed on their own narrow aspect of GW research . Dane Wigington says : November 27 , 2016 at 11:27 am Hello Penny , the basic points you have made regarding the altitude of the spraying -LRB- and the overall heating it creates -RRB- are valid . Pedro says : December 1 , 2016 at 4:11 am Hello All . Hello Dennie . Precisely . Good Luck to Us All . Pedro says : December 1 , 2016 at 11:26 am Hello All .

My suspicions were aroused immediately having researched your website countless times and no longer a sceptic about the insanity going on over our heads . I 've never known a non-existant Spring weather pattern like the one we 've just had . It seems the climate engineers are doing their dirty deeds in this part of the world too . Another article now states 6 people have died . Lots of conflicting articles . At one point 8,500 needed assistance . Many people never had a history of asthma . It 's chemical warfare . It breeches our anti-terrorist laws also . I would also agree that it has become increasingly difficult to grow a successful , bumper garden . Most plants , especially if not from GMO seeds , are struggling , particularly tomatoes . I 've been noticing this for years . Here , just outside Winnipeg , professors at the University of Manitoba were recently on strike . Incidentally , one of the first buildings you see entering the University of Manitoba campus is the temple built by Monsanto . Enough said . Reply MS P says : November 26 , 2016 at 1:57 pm It 's raining in Ventura since noon today . A big wave looking cloud rolled in . Sunny 10 miles to the East . Now also getting rain . Reply MS P says : November 26 , 2016 at 3:38 pm Rain did not last long , Seems like it was strong at the beach , then had greatly weakened , as it moved inland 10 miles , to the east . I know this , because I was on the road . Interesting wavy cloud pattern in a NW-SE line , to the front of the storm . One minute just dark . At the beach . Then light drops . I walked 1 city block to my vehicle . By the time I started driving , major down pour , While driving inland . At 10 miles east , I had got ahead of the storm . It was weak by the time it got out to Heritage Valley . OK rain . I sure hope that the Antelope Valley gets some rain , or even snow . Please . I 'd like to take a drive out that way . So anyone east of I-5 please do share . Thank you . It is obvious that Modi single-handedly took the decision to ban the banknotes , with most people in his cabinet and virtually all in the central bank oblivious to his plan . A true demagogue , Modi , has already convinced the gullible , salaried middle class that anyone who opposes the ban is hiding corrupt money and is anti-national . The lives of literally hundreds of millions are in deep chaos . This event may well go down in the history books as one of the worst man-made crises ever . Often repeated visits to the bank are necessary , with no guarantee that the bank will have cash available for the conversion .

But , it must be said , such a corrupt country . Thugs running most everything . Brutal thugs at that . I know this sounds bad and is . As always , the most helpless will suffer the most . Reminds me a bit of Mexico . Many in India are doomed from birth . The queues were long before this and everything took days and days and bakshish . Probably not spelling that right but the term meaning money , came to mean lubricate , as in what oils , greases the palm of time . Layer upon layer of graft far worse than what we here know , far worse . The IMF is practically single handily responsible for financial woes in Africa , and apparently India too , not to mention Monsanto who operates a lot like the IMF with the goal of deeper debt . Modi seems to be on the wrong course of action , but also sorely pressed . Huge huge issue . Sooner , one hopes than later , this is bound to flush out some illegal monies . Doubt that . Modi must have more of a plan than what he 's done . Michelle shipka says : November 26 , 2016 at 12:31 pm Thank you for increasing awareness Dane . Thank you for all you do . Reply Dane Wigington says : November 26 , 2016 at 1:20 pm Hello Michelle , though we are diligently pressing forward with pending legal action to help fully expose the climate engineering assault , a critical mass of public awareness must still be reached or all other efforts will be futile . China is our toxic dumping ground . Production Overseas : At the same time , though , production in the Middle East has jumped from 0.9 million metric tons -LRB- mmt -RRB- in 1999 to an expected 5.7 mmt this year , and Chinese primary production has skyrocketed from 2.6 mmt in 1999 to reach 31.2 mmt in 2015 , with more to be added in 2016 . But global aluminum stocks are estimated at around 15 mmt compared to global consumption estimated at around 58 mmt this year and are expected to increase further due to rising output in top producer China . US army complete missile base in Redzikowo -LRB- Poland -RRB- and each day we are brutally sprayed with aerosols . HAARP is often in action .

We need to stop this contamination of our public and children . Thanks and keep up the good work . I 'm interested in how to find these studies you mention . As concerning working of aluminum ` particles ' . Yes , indeed we need to stop this . Just one of many things , but major nonetheless . So I asked where she was from . Surinam she told me and proudly said her country was known for its aluminum and mines , and aluminum exports . Of course aluminum is used in all sorts of things , so years ago now I looked up places that processed aluminum . I figured that processing it might make some airborn . I know I found some . None of which seemed significant at the time . If I Ever regain Any energy , I 'll try again . I did the same for barium , because of you and as I recall , if I can trust what I recall , there was a plant using it about 80 miles from you . My aluminum search was prior to that by some years . virginia says : November 26 , 2016 at 11:34 am Hi , Dane , We look forward to listening to your broadcast after lunch when we all sit down near a cozy fire . But , I wanted to know how much of an impact the following will have on our fight : Current report that Donald Trump is planning to ban all climate research conducted by Nasa . So far , Trump has backed off too many campaign promises and is bringing back all the Bush mafiosi-neocons into his cabinet . This does not look good , IMO . But then , I am struggling , really struggling to seeing an upside with Trump . I swear I do n't get how someone so obviously clinically insane would be allowed to be president . Not that all have been , but Trump 's insanity is writ large . I get wanting to shake things up , off with the old , etc. , but the man is a lunatic . Perhaps that is the point . Perhaps he is being used to take the fall , as the world burns . And you are right , it so does not look good at all . Interesting to see how much hate he 's released . I mean wow . So much hate of the petty sort , like kids fighting at school recess . Over last 2 weeks the Arctic sea ice area has remained about 8 million sq km -LRB- Norway 's NERSC data -RRB- . If it remains at this level until the start of the official ` ice melt season ' -LRB- April 2017 -RRB- , or returns to it at that time , then there is no doubt that we will have an ice free Arctic sometime between June and Sept 2017 . Sam Carana is now suggesting that humans could be extinct by 2026 , and Matt Nelson suggests it will start in 2018 . It does not matter if you believe in Global Warming or not , the Arctic and Antarctic are seriously short of ice and a root cause is geoengineering and atmospheric spraying . Q . The geoengineers , manufacturers , pilots , ground staff and crews will argue that : a. b.spraying us with their toxic chemicals -LRB- globally causing mass mortalities , and a host of respiratory , cardiac , brain , blood and immune system ailments for all life forms -RRB- . 2 . There is a massive psyop against the truth . Industrialists and the military destroyed the natural precipitation cycle and put holes in the atmosphere decades ago . Many of those particles , such as Barium Titanate , are piezoelectric . They are attracted to sunlight -LRB- helps keep them in the atmosphere -RRB- , can generate an electrical charge in response to applied pressure , or generate pressure in response to applied electrical charge . William S Cohen , US Secretary of Defence . General Schwarzkopf after Desert Storm . One nation may attack a competitor covertly by bacteriological means , thoroughly weakening the population -LRB- though with a minimum of fatalities -RRB- before taking over with its own overt armed forces . Gordon J. F. MacDonald . It appears that everything is a game to them , including our health and our lives . Turkey then accuses Syria of night airstrikes on Turkish troops . Turkey -LRB- NATO -RRB- is now preparing for airstrikes on -LRB- Russian backed -RRB- Syrian troops . Guess we know where this is heading .
