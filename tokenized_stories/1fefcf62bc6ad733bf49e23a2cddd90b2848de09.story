On Tuesday , President Trump signed five executive orders , two of which revive the Dakota Access -LRB- DAPL -RRB- and Keystone XL pipelines . The other three were drafted to fast track the environmental permitting processes required to complete the controversial projects while directing the Commerce Department to maximize the use of U.S. steel in their construction . A video of Trump briefly commenting as he signs the orders is embedded below . The Department of the Army pledged to conduct a full environmental review of the Missouri River crossing and evaluate alternative sites , which would not put the Tribe at risk of an oil spill . But tribal leaders note the bulk of pipeline jobs are in pipeline construction . The pipeline only creates a total of 15 permanent jobs in North Dakota . Sunoco , one of the American companies operating DAPL , has a poor record on pipeline safety and spill prevention . Data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration , show operators have reported about 200 crude oil spills per year , on average . More than 176,000 gallons of oil spilled in western North Dakota last month alone . We are opposed to reckless and politically motivated development projects , like DAPL , that ignore our treaty rights and risk our water .
