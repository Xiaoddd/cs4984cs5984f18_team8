A video of the incident went viral . In it , an adult can be seen standing in the aisle , making no attempt to end the derision . Several other occurrences of racial harassment , including physical violence , took place across the country that day . And they continue . But before I could process those acts of ignorance and hatred , my son called me . While he and other students , Black and White , were upset about the election results , they were the minority on campus . The gloating by the students who supported Trump was insufferable to him . Later , I found an answer . Stay informed and make wise decisions in local elections . Support organizations and individuals making a positive impact , and businesses and institutions that keep money circulating locally . And continue to build relationships with others who have access to resources and can help influence policies that benefit everyone . Most of what I said to him describes the world I live in here in Detroit . Detroit has a history as a union town and home to Black nationalist movements . White participants from New York to California told similar stories . Polls show the nearly 60 million people who voted for Trump were overwhelmingly White . Many them are relatives of White people who did not vote for Trump . More importantly , I wonder what difference still could be made . I learned of two occasions where those processes have had success . In Maine , a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was set up to investigate the kidnapping of Native American children who were placed in foster care with White families . Recommendations from the commission are now being implemented . In addition , White allies of the Wabanaki tribe held a workshop to talk about how White privilege has benefited them and negatively impacted Native people . Initiate truth-telling circles around the shared histories of your community , city , and state . From there we can move to a place of understanding and start to work together . And I think it should start in our own communities . No Ads . Just Readers Like You . You can help fund powerful stories to light the way forward .
