Terms of use . Quadrotors are becoming more prevalent , but if TechJect has their way , their new dragonfly drone will be the wave of the miniature robotic flying future . Ratti and Jones claim the unit is useful for more than just the usual quadcopter hobby flying , noting that the Dragonfly could make the perfect spy drone , citing the initial development for the Air Force as proof . The designers also state the current prototype weighs less than one ounce , comparing the weight to that of one AA battery , in other words , much lighter than a standard quadcopter . The unit also comes equipped with cameras and can be piloted by a device as common as an iPhone or tablet . The company suggests the Dragonfly could provide the perfect up-close sports shot , tailing the action , but being small enough to stay out of the way . Considering the unit can seamlessly switch from hover mode -LRB- like a helicopter -RRB- to fly mode -LRB- like a plane -RRB- , it should actually be maneuverable enough to pull off some pretty complicated aerial techniques . The small size makes it fairly portable , able to be carried just about anywhere should the need for it arise . The unit also comes with its own SDK , so more advanced users can customize the Dragonfly as much as their know-how will allow .
