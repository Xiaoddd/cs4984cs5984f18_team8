The group he was with walked atop ancient Native burial grounds singing songs and playing drums . Tensions were high outside the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Reservation last year . Direct actions and peaceful walks -LRB- like the one Simon took part in -RRB- would often lead to clashes with local law enforcement , which The Intercept uncovered was working directly with pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners and the private firm it hired to surveil the protests , TigerSwan . He felt a need to stand up and advocate for indigenous rights . On October 19 , 2017 , Simon was finally sentenced to 18 days in jail after being found guilty of physical obstruction and disorderly conduct , but his good behavior and time served last year reduced his sentence to 13 days and he left the Burleigh Morton County Detention Center on Tuesday .

Mary Redway , a 64-year-old retired biologist from Rhode Island , also served a jail sentence for disorderly conduct ; hers was six days . Mary Redway during her court hearing October 19 , 2017 .

Mr. Simon professed financial problems , so I waived all his fees . Other state judges have entered into conflict with pipeline opponents recently , too . In September , Judges of the South Central Judicial District issued a petition asking the North Dakota Supreme Court to end provisions for out-of-state attorneys for these cases , which the court denied . The Supreme Court originally allowed this practice in January to help with the hundreds of court cases resulting from opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline . Saylor is with Freshet Collective and the Water Protector Legal Collective , both of which were created to provide free legal support to those arrested during the Standing Rock encampments last year .

Sentencing is supposed to serve a purpose beyond just punishment , Saylor told Earther . Now , the team is appealing . Twelve people are still awaiting trial from the events October 22 , 2016 . Depending on the judge they receive , they could meet a fate similar to Simon and Redway .
