Degrowth and the death of capitalism Stealth fascism in the UK Fake news and propaganda wars The Black Volcano of Industrialism Acorninfo 1 . Three great victories have been notched up by the global struggle against industrial capitalism in the last few weeks of 2016 , giving renewed energy for the battles ahead in 2017 . And if sometimes the level of lying , manipulation and sheer violence they use against us is overwhelming , it is important always to remember that they act this way because they are scared of us and of our collective power to resist their rule . In France , the big December news is that the ZAD protest zone against the long-planned new airport at Notre-Dame-des-Landes near Nantes has seen off the latest eviction threat -LRB- see Acorn 27 -RRB- . Celebrations at Standing Rock Meanwhile , across the Atlantic , the Standing Rock campaign against the North Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- see Acorn 27 -RRB- scored an unexpected victory when the Army Corps of Engineers , a federal agency , announced that it would deny developer Energy Transfer Partners a permit to cross the Missouri river . Thousands of protesters cheered and chanted to cries of Mni Wiconi , or water is life . This decision comes in the last days of the Obama administration and may well be overturned under a new president with links to the industry , but , as at Notre-Dame-des-Landes , it was clearly forced on the authorities by the sheer gritty willpower of the campaigners . From the opposite perspective , the signals are highly encouraging . The land protectors are not packing up and going away and neither is the spirit of unity , understanding and determination that has been forged in the face of massive state-corporate violence . The third big victory took place in a courtroom in the north of England where anti-fracking activist Tina Rothery -LRB- above -RRB- saw off a bid to put her in jail . Frack-free campaigners like Tina and the Nanas of northern England do not fit the usual profile of full-on environmental protesters and Cuadrilla and the UK state clearly thought they could bully them into silence and submission . She was judged to be in contempt of court when she refused at a hearing this summer to complete a questionnaire about her finances . But on December 9 a judge at Preston Combined Court discharged this ruling and said she would not be sent to jail . There were cheers inside and outside the court as the outcome became known . I see it as a victory for honesty because corporations have a lot of power and a lot of money . But , like the campaigners at the ZAD and at Standing Rock , she knows this is far from the end of the struggle . There is plenty of interest inside for those who refuse to succumb to the insanity of industrial capitalist life and thought . You are never allowed to stop producing and consuming . Even sleeping time is being reduced . For some years now , especially with the spread of smartphones , our mental space has become more and more saturated with news and materialism . We have less and less time to think and find our place in the world . Vernet goes on to state that the capitalist system is manifestly on course for a major implosion . It has long been apparent that the UK state has adopted the second softly-softly approach to lowering its jackboot onto the face of its hapless subjects . Bullying of the Muslim community under this flag has been ongoing for years , but has been swallowed by a general public constantly told that the Islamic religion represents a terrorist-inspiring threat . And research by Spinwatch has revealed this is not an isolated incident . Chesswood Junior School in Worthing , West Sussex implemented a similar policy to that of Driffield College until public reaction forced a retreat . Elsewhere , City of York council working with the North Yorkshire police force have used the strategy to link anti-fracking activism with terrorism risks . The same FOI request made to multiple forces could therefore identify how Prevent resources are apportioned across the country . Fracking , like all the infrastructures of industrial capitalism , is close to the cold heart of a corrupt state which operates not in the interests of the people of the UK but of the financial interests that own and control it . Therefore anyone who opposes fracking in any -LRB- effective -RRB- way is a simply an enemy of this mafia and is labelled appropriately . This is happening all over the world . The current weapons of choice for this kind of dictatorial institutional bullying are Public Spaces Protection Orders -LRB- PSPO -RRB- . PSPOs were introduced to the UK by the Anti-social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act of 2014 and have already been widely used to target the homeless . Sleeping in public is a criminal offence in certain areas of Shepway , while Rushcliffe Borough Council is currently consulting residents on the same ban . This wider application of PSPOs has seen Kettering Borough Council introduce a curfew on under-18s , who must now be home by 11 pm or risk receiving fines or a criminal record . Back to top 4 . Fake news and propaganda wars Covert foreign interference in elections to ensure a right-wing victory has been a speciality of the CIA for decades . The main worry for anti-capitalists is perhaps that any cancellation of his win would also cancel the J20 day of resistance planned for his inauguration -LRB- see Acorn 29 -RRB- . But behind the pantomime absurdity is a worrying phenomenon . This is the news . The only news . And on the same site , Norman Solomon sets out what one of these sinister next steps might be . In the UK , the Russian scare has been taken up enthusiastically by The Guardian , itself very close to the transatlantic neoliberal establishment despite its pseudo-radical window dressing . Right-wing Blairite Labour MP Ben Bradshaw has also leapt enthusiastically onto the Russian-scare bandwagon . Back to top 5 . The Black Volcano of Industrialism The monstrous Black Volcano which has loomed and leered menacingly over Happy City since it was founded has finally erupted . Vast rivers of lava are streaming down the mountain slopes towards the human settlement and ash is already beginning to rain on the rooftops . It is only a matter of time before a pyroclastic cloud scorches instant death onto the people or the molten rock pours into the narrow streets and kills everyone . But in the city there is complete calm . Goods are bought and sold , meals prepared and eaten , couples married and children educated . There was a brief moment of confusion when it was discovered that the Happy City authorities had cut down every single tree in the Great Gardens in order to build a massive wooden fence on the northern limits . But rumours that this was designed to hide from view the erupting Black Volcano were soon dismissed as malicious paranoid fantasies , as the King explained that it was a completely necessary step to protect his people from blood-thirsty foreign pirates and smugglers . And so , as certain extinction draws ever closer , the people of the Happy City keep bustling around , making money , gossiping , squabbling over the petty details of their lives and reporting to the Official Inquisitor any citizen seen to be sniffing suspiciously at the sulphur-laden air , cocking an alert ear to the distant rumbling or trying to peer through the gaps in the Great Anti-Crime Fence in order to see if the lava is close . That is what it feels like to me to be living at the start of the 21st century . Humankind has taken a dangerous wrong turn . Modern capitalist society is an out-of-control nightmare . The future mapped out for us can only lead into the dead-end of destruction , disaster and death . Tinkering with the detail will change nothing . We need to abandon this experiment before it is too late and live in a completely different way . Otherwise the Black Volcano of Industrialism will kill us all . Back to top 6 . Acorninfo More than 400 people took part in a walk to the top of Leith Hill near Dorking , England , on Saturday December 3 in protest against planned exploratory drilling for oil and gas in the area -LRB- see our special report in Acorn 29 -RRB- . An indication of the levels of local support for the campaign comes from the fact that the Leith Hill Celebration Walk , intended to demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposed drilling within the Surrey Hills area of outstanding natural beauty , was organised by a mum and baby group called Surrey Hills Slings . The massive turn-out involved a wide cross-section of Surrey folk , from families to protectors , from horse riders to mountain bikers . Meanwhile opposition to similar plans in Eastbourne saw hundreds of people take part in a protest walk -LRB- below -RRB- from local beauty spot Beachy Head on December 3 . For background info , see our report in Acorn 29 . This is the conclusion of an important article by Jason Hickel , an anthropologist at the London School of Economics . The airshows , violent movies , military recruitment in our schools , and many other cultural avenues are all aimed at militarizing our culture . The kids are being taught that violence is cool and normal . 33 . . Revolutionary UK Paper . . Fracking Resistance . account .
