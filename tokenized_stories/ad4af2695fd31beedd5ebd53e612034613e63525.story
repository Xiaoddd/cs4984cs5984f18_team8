Greenpeace USA What We 're Doing Power the resistance with a gift to Greenpeace . Energy Transfer Partners President and CEO Kelcy Warren speaking on a panel at the CERAWeek Conference on March 7th , 2018 in Houston . Energy Transfer Partners President and CEO Kelcy Warren was speaking on a panel at an industry conference in Houston to discuss the strong opposition that his pipelines have faced from communities across the United States . Flanked by his peers Russell Girling from TransCanada , and Steven Kean from Kinder Morgan , Warren was asked about his thoughts on growing opposition to oil and gas pipelines . These remarks emphasize that the actions of Energy Transfer Partners against Indigenous protesters have been consistently dehumanizing . They provide a glimpse of the underlying values of an industry that has shown repeatedly how far it is willing to go to shield profits . The decisions these top executives make in their corner offices impact the lives of frontline and Indigenous communities in the paths of their pipelines . Unfortunately , this is not a first for Warren or his company . Millions across the country and the world saw in real time the virulent reaction that Energy Transfer Partners had to the peaceful Water Protectors at Standing Rock . Water Protectors engineered a makeshift wooden pedestrian bridge over the Cantapeta Creek . They were trying to access ancestral burial grounds they believe are being damaged by the Dakota Access Pipeline construction . Heavily armed law enforcement officials were deployed . As they pulled the bridge apart with boats , the Water Protectors swam and used their own boats to cross the water . Facing effective opposition from the Indigenous-led movement at Standing Rock , Energy Transfer Partners hired TigerSwan to usurp police tasks and spy on Water Protectors opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline . The company also paid TigerSwan for information that was used to manufacture a meritless conspiracy lawsuit against environmental groups that supported the Indigenous-led movement.This is a firm founded by former U.S. military contractors turned corporate mercenaries . TigerSwan has still not been held accountable for human rights abuses against peaceful demonstrators . As oil and gas pipelines continue to meet effective opposition across the country , their owners and financial backers need to be reminded that human lives are a priority over any business deal . We can not let this pattern of behavior go unchecked .
