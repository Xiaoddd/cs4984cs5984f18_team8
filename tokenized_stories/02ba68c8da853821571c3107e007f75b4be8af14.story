High near 70F . Winds NW at 10 to 15 mph . . Tonight Partly cloudy skies . Slight chance of a rain shower . Low 38F . Winds ENE at 5 to 10 mph . An early thaw turned their campsite into a muddy cesspool . The local tribes were concerned that snowmelt would inevitably wash tons of garbage and waste into the Cannonball River . Of course , it 's impossible to remove every drop and particle of waste . The Missouri River downstream from the Cannonball is almost certainly polluted . The Sierra Club and Greenpeace were among the organizations that compensated them . Among environmentalists , these organizations are respected and considered responsible . The Dakota Access protest is reported to have provided inspiration and a blueprint for protests against pipelines elsewhere . If future protests do n't include facilities for waste disposal , they will do only harm . In the spirit of good environmentalism , recycle bins should also be provided . They know how to handle oil spills and will respond immediately . Oil does n't mix with water like sewage does . Cheap energy from fossil fuels now supplies 86 percent of the world 's energy and has kept seven billion people from starving . It 's good reading . Stop watching this discussion .

Report Add Reply H Miller Apr 18 , 2017 1:33 pm I watched the video because I am open to any new facts to get to the truth . The way everyone should be . Unfortunately , the video is completely ambiguous to what is actually happening , and it states this at the end of your article that you cited , but failed to include with your comment . But of course they did n't ask the questions . And that is from a far left website . But the trash is from the protesters . For all his talking on the video , he never went up and asked the people what they were doing . That is all he had to do . But instead he just sat in his truck and speculated . That is not concrete evidence . It is him providing his own narrative without the facts . -LRB- That are sitting right in front of him -RRB- This is not proof of anything other than getting all the trash collected in one spot . And the narrator is n't sure or not if one truck full of trash is from the protesters . But he never said it was n't their trash . Because he knows they left a big garbage mess , as he pans his shot across mounds of other garbage he knows came from them . After seeing the video , I believe more now that they left a terrible garbage problem . You are doing the same thing you are accusing Mr. Ferguson of doing . And no , I have never read or listened to breitbart ever . When I looked online for more concrete information , I found almost only postings from virulently alt-right websites that make the John Birch Society look like a PTA meeting , and various outlets of Fox Fraudcasting . This does not fill me with confidence and credulity . I located another information source that presented contradictory material , and provided some pretty specific detail . I posted that material and cited the source so readers could make their own determination of credibility . You argue that source is not credible , but you did not refute even one of the statements made there . Then , when refuted , you huff and puff in self-righteous indignation , while just repeating the same ridiculous fabrications all over again . Rather , it just makes your arguments look silly . They 're just lies . Report Add Reply H Miller Apr 19 , 2017 2:37 pm FB - I was about to give in to your complete and utter false claims , but then I had a moment of clarity to take one minute to search for myself . Yes , Mr. Ferguson should have cited sources and I should have done my own search first . You are either completely inept at research or are purposely lying to this audience . My paragrahs 2,3 , and 4 are all filled with refuting your statements . Paragraph 2 is straight out of your own source , refuting your statements . On the other hand , you have refuted none , I repeat , none of my statements I made . Again that is none , did you understand that . And none of these are personal insults , like your entire paragraph 3 is and accusing me of fabrications -LRB- which I take very seriously -RRB- . Instead of creative writing , I think you needed debate , because your statements have been proven to be completely and utterly false . Your defense of this garbage mess is essentially a fraud . But of course they did n't ask the questions . And that is from a far left website . But the trash is from the protesters . For all his talking on the video , he never went up and asked the people what they were doing . That is all he had to do . But instead he just sat in his truck and speculated . That is not concrete evidence . It is him providing his own narrative without the facts . -LRB- That are sitting right in front of him -RRB- This is not proof of anything other than getting all the trash collected in one spot .

Because he knows they left a big garbage mess , as he pans his shot across mounds of other garbage he knows came from them . After seeing the video , I believe more now that they left a terrible garbage problem . You looked for sources that said what you wanted to hear , and found them almost entirely on the far right . Report H Miller Apr 20 , 2017 9:19 am To FB comment below - You neglected to mention Northcountry NPR , that is NPR , National Public Radio , or do n't you know about them . It is one of my staples for news information , and everyone on the left of the political spectrum . I ca n't believe you even believe what you think . Even when the truth is pushed right in your face . You should have just said , they screwed up and I hope they learn from it . And this has nothing to do with the pipeline . I liked how you tossed that in their to distract from the real issue . That outlet is located in upstate New York , and anything they broadcast would n't be from direct reporting . Semi trucks have been hauling debris out of camp and people here are piling garbage into bags . I 'd bet you were one who swallowed the criminally fraudulent edited video of Planned Parenthood . You really should be a little less gullible about the fake news coming out of those alt-right sources that you let do your thinking for you . Report Dale Ferguson May 23 , 2017 3:17 am I wanted to add a lot more material , including citing sources , but the Valley Journal limits letters to 350 words . My primary source was the Washington Times for Monday March 17 , 2017 . And it was the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who did the cleanup , not Morton County Sheriff 's Department . That is the progressive movement in a nutshell . Progressives look down on us hippies , but it is the hippies that have the higher ground here and they always will . Maybe the progressives could learn something in this aftermath , but that would take them understanding there are other opinions that matter . They will never admit they made a mistake , and they shout down anyone who does n't agree . They constitute anarchy , not even close to democracy . Truly pathetic Chris . Again , you have nothing relevant to say . So you say nothing of relevance . Lets hear your defense of this letter to the editor , instead of just one more personal attack . Hit to close to home . Since you did n't condemn what they left at the protest site , you have just endorsed it . It should have been easy for you to say this was wrong to do to the land . Sort of reminds me of something I have said before . And your exclamation points just top it off . I laughed for a good 5 seconds . thanks . Because they will do nothing that does n't get media attention . Get out there and start cleaning chris . Report Add Reply Dori Skrukrud Apr 18 , 2017 1:44 pm Relax and cut with the tension . It was a joke . I thought about the argument but opted for the joke instead . If you like it fine , if not oh well ... . CHRIS HARRIS Report H Miller Apr 19 , 2017 1:40 pm CH below - I do n't have strong opinion one way or another about DAPL . But I do have a strong opinion about keeping the environment clean . If I misread your intent I apologize . The destruction to the land with the leftover garbage should have never happened . I am not a true hippy , but can identify with their main ideals , heard about the Rainbow Family previously and went for a day outside Dillon . A bunch of media attention happened , tv and paper , about the possible land degredation . And it proved to be no worries . Now DAPL leaves this mess and it is barely reported , and it took me all of 1 minute to find reputable news media that had reported it . -LRB- see response to FB above -RRB- Report Welcome to the discussion .
