Due process From Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Due process is the legal requirement that the state must respect all legal rights that are owed to a person . Due process balances the power of law of the land and protects the individual person from it . When a government harms a person without following the exact course of the law , this constitutes a due process violation , which offends the rule of law . Joint Anti-fascist Refugee Comm . v. McGrath -LRB- 1951 -RRB- -LRB- J. Republican Party of Minn. v. White -LRB- 2002 -RRB- -LRB- J. Scalia -RRB- Due process has also been frequently interpreted as limiting laws and legal proceedings -LRB- see substantive due process -RRB- so that judges , instead of legislators , may define and guarantee fundamental fairness , justice , and liberty . That interpretation has proven controversial . Analogous to the concepts of natural justice , and procedural justice used in various other jurisdictions , the interpretation of due process is sometimes expressed as a command that the government must not be unfair to the people or abuse them physically . When English and American law gradually diverged , due process was not upheld in England but became incorporated in the US Constitution . Thus , Magna Carta established the rule of law in England by not only requiring the monarchy to obey the law of the land but also limiting how the monarchy could change the law of the land . In 1608 , the English jurist Edward Coke wrote a treatise in which he discussed the meaning of Magna Carta . Chart . c. 29 , no man ought to be taken or imprisoned , but by the law of the land . But to this I answer , that lex terrae is not confined to the common law , but takes in all the other laws , which are in force in this realm ; as the civil and canon law ... . By the 28 Ed . 3 , c. 3 , there the words lex terrae , which are used in Mag . Char . Chief Justice Holt dissented in this case because he believed that the commitment had not in fact been by a legal authority . Although the Queen 's Bench held that the House of Commons had not infringed or overturned due process , John Paty was ultimately freed by Queen Anne when she prorogued Parliament . That view usually held in regards to what was required by existing law , rather than what was intrinsically required by due process itself . Lacking the power of judicial review , English courts possessed no means by which to declare government statutes or actions invalid as a violation of due process . As a consequence , English law and American law diverged . Unlike their English counterparts , American judges became increasingly assertive about enforcing due process of law . In turn , the legislative and executive branches learned how to avoid such confrontations in the first place , by tailoring statutes and executive actions to the constitutional requirements of due process as elaborated upon by the judiciary . In 1977 , an English political science professor explained the present situation in England for the benefit of American lawyers : An American constitutional lawyer might well be surprised by the elusiveness of references to the term ` due process of law ' in the general body of English legal writing ... . Today one finds no space devoted to due process in Halsbury 's Laws of England , in Stephen 's Commentaries , or Anson 's Law and Custom of the Constitution . The Supreme Court of the United States interprets the clauses as providing four protections : procedural due process -LRB- in civil and criminal proceedings -RRB- , substantive due process , a prohibition against vague laws , and as the vehicle for the incorporation of the Bill of Rights . Although the specifics are often unclear , most nations agree that they should guarantee foreign visitors a basic minimum level of justice and fairness . Some nations have argued that they are bound to grant no more rights to aliens than they do to their own citizens , the doctrine of national treatment , which also means that both would be vulnerable to the same deprivations by the government . With the growth of international human rights law and the frequent use of treaties to govern treatment of foreign nationals abroad , the distinction , in practice , between these two perspectives may be disappearing .
