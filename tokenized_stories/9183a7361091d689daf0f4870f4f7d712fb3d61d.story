The rally was put together by a coalition of academic higher education unions , activist organizations and student government leaders . Various speakers took the mic as others held up signs . It is intended to transport about 470,000 barrels per day across four states , according to developer Energy Access Partners . Protesters in North Dakota have said the pipeline will threaten the land near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation . The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says the pipeline , part of which would run under the Missouri River , could affect the tribe 's drinking water supply and put communities downstream at risk of contamination from crude oil leaks and spills . More than 400 people protesting the pipeline in North Dakota clashed with police Sunday on a bridge north of a protest camp near the Standing Rock reservation . Tear gas , rubber bullets and a water cannon were used on protesters Sunday night . Van Den Abbeele and other speakers encouraged those at the UCI rally to learn how to organize demonstrations peacefully and to protect their right to assembly and free speech . The rally came together after Ben Garceau , a lecturer in the UCI School of Humanities , returned this month from a four-day trip to Standing Rock , where he said he saw people being pepper-sprayed and doused with water in freezing weather . Garceau said he helped organize the rally with the University Council-American Federation of Teachers local and UCI 's American Indian Resource Program , which offers support services for tribal students . Petition seeks sanctuary campus Many UCI staff , faculty and alumni have signed an online petition seeking to make the institution a sanctuary campus to help protect undocumented students . As of Monday morning , the petition had 966 signatures . The action is part of a trend in which petitions and protests at universities nationwide are calling for the schools to become sanctuary campuses in response to President-elect Donald Trump 's pledge to deport millions of undocumented immigrants . Columbia University Provost John Coatsworth described in an email Monday the New York institution 's plan to withhold undocumented students ' information from immigration officials without a subpoena , prevent immigration officials from entering the campus without a warrant and provide more financial aid for such students if Trump decides to repeal a federal law that shields undocumented students from deportation .
