Ohio EPA Another Day , Another Pipeline Spill By Joshua Axelrod After months of protests and passionate pleas for the government to recognize and analyze the threats Energy Transfer Partners ' Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- could pose to fresh water resources and numerous others , news came this week that before even fully opening , the pipeline had already leaked . A few states away , in Ohio , the same company 's effort to build a natural gas pipeline has been put on hold after 18 leaks and a massive spill of drilling fluids into a pristine wetland convinced state and federal regulators to largely shut down the company 's construction of the project . And even as this happens , we 're facing similar threats as the Trump administration and TransCanada try to ram Keystone XL through America 's heartland . Back when Keystone 1 opened , for example , it experienced its first leak within months . A few years later , it experienced a major rupture in South Dakota , spilling at least 17,000 gallons of oil into a farmer 's field . At the time , it was revealed that TransCanada , Keystone 's owner and operator , had been warned about potential problems with the steel pipe it had used to build the line , as well as the welds holding the line together . And DAPL is n't the only new oil pipeline rearing its ugly head and threatening our precious resources with the risk of an oil spill . Keystone XL has come back from the grave under President Trump and the State Department 's rubber stamp cross-border permit . Enbridge is trying to expand its Alberta Clipper -LRB- Line 67 -RRB- and Line 3 pipelines in Wisconsin and Minnesota . And the list goes on and on . The easy answer is : oil pipelines leak . They always have and they always will . They are complex projects that span thousands of miles and are held together by welds that commonly fail . They use materials sourced from manufacturers around the world that are almost always found to have anomalies . They carry substances that create conditions that can accelerate corrosion . They are impacted by external conditions like moisture and freezing and thawing and intense summer heat . All the technology in the world will not stop an oil pipeline from leaking . And what 's worse , the best technology available today to detect a leak almost always fails to do so . This week 's leak is another example in a growing list that proves the concerns of Native Americans , farmers , ranchers and the public about the impacts these projects can have on water resources are real and pressing . For months , leaders from Standing Rock and elsewhere raised serious concerns about DAPL , its threat to water resources and the likelihood it would spill only to see those concerns not addressed by the current administration . And that underlying fact will only become more established as energy efficiency rises , vehicle electrification increases and renewable energy production grows . Joshua Axelrod is a policy analyst for the Canada Project at Natural Resources Defense Council . The scorecard shows that 140 House members voted against chemical safeguards every time , while 149 members consistently voted for chemical safety protections . However , the action fund praised the lawmakers that bucked their party to vote for chemical safety , including Reps. voted for funding chemical reviews and against a farm bill that included pesticide safety loopholes . Florida Reps. A Preview of the People , Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule , two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Updated and reissued every five years , these guidelines are the nation 's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations . supply . These nominees will be well-known in their fields , and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers , academics and practitioners . part of the process is happening in real time . what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors . Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff , and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally . Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries . And here 's the first place you 'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition : rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected , USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first , soliciting public comments in the process . In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts , it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance . And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious . After the committee is announced in early 2019 , it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report . all appearances , the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs . though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable , plant-based diets have been all but stymied , there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle . Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance , including the meat industry , dairy industry , and sugar-sweetened beverage associations , as well as formula companies , which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers . -LRB- This may be happening in real-time , too . Exposure can be caused by contact , ingestion or inhalation . Short-term health effects can range from skin irritation and numbness to fever and headaches . Long-term exposure can lead to cancer , liver failure and sperm damage . is traditionally called blue-green algae is actually a class of microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria . Cyanobacteria can be toxic and can also produce various types of cyanotoxins that have different hazards . With their small , developing bodies , children are especially endangered by algae exposure . was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption . But it probably wo n't be the last , especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year . Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets . If you believe your pet may have been exposed , be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy , seizures , diarrhea or vomiting . And as climate change gets worse , the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks , creating a toxic feedback loop . The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish . Communities that struggle with regular , serious toxic algae outbreaks , like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie , can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation . The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth . The women were all non-smokers , had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies . Macrophages , which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body , protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles , such as bacteria and pollution particles . The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants . That 's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA 's Office of Inspector General -LRB- OIG -RRB- , the agency 's internal watchdog . EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement , and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was required to respond to the April 2017 petition within 90 days , but nearly 17 months have passed with no finding . more than 97,000 giraffes remain in the wild , and the species is gravely imperiled by habitat loss , civil unrest , hunting for meat and the international trade in bone carvings , skins and trophies . U.S. provides a large market for giraffe parts . for their six-foot-long necks , distinctive patterning and long eyelashes , giraffes have captured the human imagination for centuries . But so , under this definition , are multi-thousand-acre corporate entities using automated machinery to grow genetically engineered corn . Size of the farm is not a factor ; neither is the style of agriculture . A family farm may not even have a family that owns or works the land . issue with such a broad definition of family farming is primarily in the discourse . Aid is divvied up by revenue among family farmers , with additional programs going to some specialized farmers , like young or beginning farmers , organic farmers , and sustainable farmers .
