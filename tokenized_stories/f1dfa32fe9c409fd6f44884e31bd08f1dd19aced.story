Morning Mix Facing orders to leave camp , Dakota Access stalwarts brace for police crackdown By Derek Hawkins Derek Hawkins National reporter focused on cybersecurity Email Bio Follow February 22 , 2017 The Oceti Sakowin camp near the site of the Dakota Access pipeline in Cannon Ball , North Dakota , pictured Feb. 19 , 2017 . By mid-February , only a couple of hundred stalwarts remained . A mandatory evacuation order from the North Dakota governor and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is set to take effect at 2 p.m. local time . Anyone who stays behind will face arrest and trespassing charges . Part of the camp sits on a floodplain , they say , which could create dangerous conditions as the weather warms and the snow melts . Floodwaters could also wash trash and debris from the camp into nearby rivers , according to North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem . They also say it violates long-standing treaties and disrupts sacred lands . The developer , Energy Transfer Partners , rejects those claims . Legal challenges from the tribe have failed to stop the project from moving forward , although an Obama administration order in December temporarily halted construction . The order was recently reversed by the Trump administration , and drilling commenced in early February . Pls do n't advocate for violence , especially when you are n't out here putting your own body in front of a corporate army ready to wage war . Tensions erupted again less than a month later , when police turned water cannons on activists in subfreezing temperatures . Many of the remaining protesters are expected to leave Wednesday on their own accord . Women , children and elders will stage a symbolic march out of camp around noon , activists say . Others have vowed to stay and nonviolently resist . Bigelow , of the Standing Rock Sioux , said he too plans to stay past the 2 p.m. deadline , but only as an observer . His goal Wednesday , he said , is to document the response from authorities and the last moments in camp . The protest camp near the Dakota Access pipeline drilling site , in North Dakota , where rising temperatures have led to snow melt and rising water . On top of that , few people are left to help out . But trucks arrive regularly to haul trash , and the remaining volunteers have busied themselves dismantling structures , collecting debris and moving leftover supplies out of camp .
