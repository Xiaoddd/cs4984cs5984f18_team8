Whatcom County Superior Court Judge Charles Snyder on Wednesday denied a request to revoke the latest version of the search warrant , which the judge approved May 11 . The American Civil Liberties Union successfully challenged the first warrant for being too broad and unconstitutional , while Facebook told investigators the second warrant was too specific for it to be able to filter for the requested information , according to court documents . Like the ACLU , Brodsky argued the search warrant violated the First and Fourth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution . The Fourth Amendment protects individuals against unreasonable search and seizure . The investigation stems from an hour-long demonstration against the Dakota Access oil pipeline that led to a 4-mile freeway backup after protesters stopped traffic just south of the Lakeway Drive exit on Feb. 11 . The Washington State Patrol said the blockade led to a five-car rollover crash that injured one person . The agency began investigating the protest the following day , soliciting information from witnesses to bring charges against participants . Roughly 100 protesters were on the freeway . Investigators are trying to identify as many of them as possible .
