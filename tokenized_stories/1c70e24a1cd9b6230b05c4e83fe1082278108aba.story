They later claimed the water cannons were only used to extinguish fires set by protesters , although hours of video footage clearly throws the main target of the water cannons were in fact protesters . Below is a picture of a propane tank found on the bridge following an explosion early Monday morning . An explosion that would cause such severe injuries would most certainly have torn apart the cylinder , but instead it looks like a used and discarded cylinder that has sustained some fire damage . It was seeing a woman severely injured . He said he and Butte friend Isaiah Other Bull were close to protester Sophia Wilansky when she was injured in a confrontation with police . After the water-spraying , the crowd had thinned out to fewer than a dozen people . Law-enforcement at the scene denied using grenades , and said the Wilansky may have been hurt by a propane tank being used as a weapon by the protesters . But Wilansky , Willis , Other Bull and other eyewitnesses dispute that account . He said the police were firing tear gas canisters while she was down . Big old wound . All open . Willis said he saw men get out of a giant armored vehicle labeled Stutsman County -LRB- N.D. -RRB- . They acted like were in a different country and they were in a war . Afterward , both Willis and Other Bull said the event had changed them . Other Bull , 23 , lives in both Butte and on the Cheyenne reservation in Lame Deer . Everyone was there just to help each other . Bookmark the permalink . 3 Comments . account . Notify me of new posts via email .
