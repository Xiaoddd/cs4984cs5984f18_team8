They had one of the best band logos in the world , designed by comix artist Gary Panter of Jimbo renown . We thought the Screamers and Tomata du Plenty were fucking unbelievable . They were so way ahead of their time . They were using rudimentary synths and sequencers but with punk energy and aggressive lyrics and theatrical staging with German expressionist lighting . Tomata had been banging around the Seattle scene in the early 1970s before relocating to L.A. . After the Screamers broke up in 1981 , he switched his attention to painting . Sadly , in August 2000 , Tomata died of cancer at the age of 52 . At some point in the 1990s he executed a series of punk rock portraits , for lack of a better description , featuring people from the L.A. punk scene as well as other rock and roll luminaries -LRB- and , randomly , the 19th-century French author Guy de Maupassant -RRB- .
