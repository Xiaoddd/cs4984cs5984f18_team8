Magazine The head of National Museum of the American Indian on what we should all know Kevin Gover , director of the National Museum of the American Indian . A member of the Pawnee tribe , he was born in Oklahoma . He and his wife , Anne Marie , live in Northern Virginia . An identity as a Native American is secondary to your tribal identity . And then your identity as an American is also part of your makeup . Just a basic civics lesson : That Indian tribes are governments . That they are part of the federalist system . But certainly the existence of Indian tribes on a permanent basis was anticipated by the founders and the Constitution . I think native people actually welcome questions and are very responsive . Usually Cherokee . Indian leaders have talked about the pipeline protests at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota as a reawakening for tribes . Some insult or degradation of tribal property rights or tribal environmental interests are happening on an ongoing basis . The reason the other tribes support them is they all have suffered some similar insult . There are 568 federally recognized tribes , and they range in size from a few dozen people to several hundred thousand people . I imagine you feel pressure to represent 568 different stories . When the museum first opened , we basically had 24 tribes represented . And each got to create their own little exhibit . In our actual spaces , here and in New York , it has to be for the visitors . We have other programs and projects that are more wide-ranging and really intended for the audience outside the museum . But inside the museum it has to be for the visitors who come , only a small percentage of whom are Native Americans . The museum has been open 12 years . The answer is yes . There are thousands of stories that remain untold that , over time , the museum can and will hopefully address . Our charter goes beyond the U.S. . It goes to Canada , Mexico , Central America and South America . So in one sense our work will never be done . Second , I think that what is expected of any museum will change over time . And the museum delivered that message effectively . What we get from popular culture about Indians is almost entirely wrong . So we think about what can we do about that . Surely one of them , perhaps the largest , is the ignorance of the non-Native public about the Native American past and present . Because that leads to misunderstanding in evaluating contemporary issues . Take Standing Rock , for example . And that would be a perfectly rational point of view . But if you know what the history of the Sioux Nation is , you know that treaties were made with the Sioux Nation concerning these lands that no longer belong to the Sioux Nation . And you know that the development of the Missouri River for the past century has always , always involved taking of Indian land . They were building dams up and down the Missouri , and every Indian reservation along the way was flooded . Some of the best land was flooded , which only deepened their poverty and made it that much harder to climb out . So we should know that kind of history . We need to know that in order to know what equity is in this contemporary situation . No . I experience that as a racist word . As an insult . And so , no , there is no acceptable use of that word .
