Kirchmeier , who has been leading the response to the protests has taken what has been controversial - and some say overly aggressive - action against demonstrators . ` We are just not going to allow people to become unlawful , ' said Kirchmeier , a veteran of the North Dakota Highway Patrol and National Guard who was elected to his first term as sheriff about two years ago . ` It 's just not going to happen . ' Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier , front , listens to Brian Wesley Horinek , of Oklahoma , outside the New Camp on Pipeline Easement in North Dakota But US authorities said on Sunday they had no plans to forcibly remove activists . But the US Army Corps of Engineers , which manages the federal land where the main camp protesting the Dakota Access pipeline is located , said last week it would close public access to the area north of the Cannonball River on December 5 . On Sunday , the agency said in a statement that it had ` no plans for forcible removal ' of protesters . A representative for the agency could not be immediately reached on Sunday to provide further clarification on its plans . Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault said he and Kirchmeier have met many times and each meeting has been tense and unproductive . ` I do n't think aggressive force is necessary and he thinks it 's necessary , ' Archambault said . Archambault called the confrontation an act of terror against unarmed protesters that was sanctioned by Kirchmeier . ` His job is to protect and serve , not to inflict harm and hurt , ' Archambault said . But Kirchmeier , who has the backing of the state 's Republican governor and attorney general , defended officers ' actions . He and other authorities said officers were assaulted with rocks , bottles and burning logs .

Women hold a demonstration on Backwater Bridge during a protest against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation Kirchmeier , like many other of the state 's elected officials , blame the Obama administration for not stepping in . ` The issue of the pipeline is not going to get solved with protesters and cops looking at each other , ' Kirchmeier said . ` This is bigger and takes way more political clout than what the county has to offer . ' Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said Kirchmeier is in ` an incredibly difficult position . ' ` He has the responsibility to allow people to lawfully exercise their First Amendment rights and he has the obligation to stop it when there is violence contrary to the law , ' Stenehjem said . With winter looming , the Corps has decided to close the land north of the Cannonball River where the Oceti Sakowin protest encampment have flourished on December 5 , also citing the confrontations between protesters and authorities , according to a letter Archambault said he received . ` To be clear , this means that no member of the general public , to include Dakota Access pipeline protesters , can be on these Corps lands , ' the letter provided by the tribe said . The agency says anyone on the property north of the Cannonball River after Dec. 5 will be trespassing and subject to prosecution . Protest organizers said Saturday that they do n't intend to leave or stop their acts of civil disobedience . Kirchmeier said before the Corps ' move that North Dakota residents who have grown tired - and increasingly afraid - of the protests are backing law enforcement . ` People do n't want their livelihoods disrupted , ' he said .
