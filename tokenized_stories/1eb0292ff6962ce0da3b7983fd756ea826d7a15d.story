Our people will continue to resist in and beyond this moment , as this is but one front in the wars being waged against us . A confrontation earlier this month that turned violent . Photo by Rob Wilson . First and foremost , this is a struggle that has made the shape and function of colonialism quite clear . Our society can no longer pretend that the atrocities against us have ended , and with that knowledge comes a renewed accountability . These events should also reinforce to everyone the realities of state violence , in all its forms . Native people are killed at a higher rate by police than any other group in the United States . As we have witnessed with police attacks on the movement for Black lives , structural violence is cyclical . It is a remix of old atrocities and abuses . It is the character of law enforcement , born of slave patrols and indian constables , on full display , and we must not pretend otherwise . The Army Corps and Obama have repeatedly invoked politicized language of empathy and concern . While our people have converged in peace , police from around the Midwest have also converged , to play their role in this moment of colonial and anti-colonial struggle . We are not simply protectors and warriors . We are storytellers , and we will not allow the indulgence of forgetting . Lastly , I want to reinforce that this is not over . Our people have not backed down , and I do not anticipate any such action . Elders , children and other vulnerable individuals will likely be evacuated when an eviction attempt seems imminent . These evacuations have happened effectively in the past , and I trust the best efforts of our people on the ground will safeguard many . But we , as resisters , do not believe in done deals .
