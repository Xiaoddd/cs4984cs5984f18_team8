A stray shower or thunderstorm is possible . High 94F . Winds SSW at 5 to 10 mph . . Tonight A clear sky . Low 73F . Winds S at 5 to 10 mph . I was deeply touched by the resolute spirit and collective power of the water protectors , and I am so proud the Cherokee Nation is standing united with our brothers and sisters from North Dakota . It was a powerful moment to stand shoulder to shoulder with friends , associates at the Cherokee Nation and tribal citizens from around the country to lend our voice and support for the Standing Rock people in their just fight to reroute a proposed oil pipeline that could harm historic and sacred sites , and potentially contaminate the water supply for 18 million people . It is simply amazing what tribal people can accomplish when we come together in times of need . We delivered vital supplies , including firewood and winter clothing that our Cherokee Nation Youth Council collected . It marked the third official trip from our government , not to mention the hundreds of individual Cherokees who have traveled to support the cause . We have contributed funds for the legal battle and much needed firewood and supplies for the upcoming winter months , which on the North Dakota prairie can be brutal . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , like Cherokee Nation , has always been a good steward of the land . However , Native people can and should be part of the solution for a sustainable future and for the development of clean , safe energy . We must have a seat at the table before decisions are made impacting the safety , health and natural resources of our communities because economies can no longer be built on the backs of Native people . At the Sacred Stone Camp , water protectors are prepared for a long winter and ready to peacefully defend the water that sustains so many communities down the river . Like others across Indian Country , I hope for a positive and safe outcome and the federal government truly takes into account all tribal concerns . We pray that the well-being of the community will be prioritized ahead of profit and corporate interests . This battle is really about more than just one tribe . Wado .
