Block Kavanaugh 's nomination . The City of Eureka with their usual blockheaded lummoxing screwed the pooch by overexposing this effort by California police agencies to keep police videos out of the public eye . hidden . It should be expected that this will be appealed to the Supreme Court in CA . . and we will see . McClain was the young man , RIP . -RRB- EPD has refused to expose that video , still , I am pretty sure ... -LRB- without checking I may be wrong about that , so . . -RRB- Yay for the North Coast Journal for doing this , the rights of citizens and transparency in their dealings with police just has taken a step for the better .
