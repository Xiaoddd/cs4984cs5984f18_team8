The Democratic establishment has responded to their downward trajectory by largely choosing to ignore it , presumably hoping it will go away . Wall Street ally Sen. Charles Schumer was elected Senate minority leader , and Rep. Nancy Pelosi was re-elected as House minority leader , despite Democrats failing to recoup majorities in both Houses of Congress . Instead , they continue expressing animosity toward Sanders supporters , treating them as outsiders rather than equal members of the party . Though registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by over 200,000 voters , Republicans hold strong majorities in the state House and Senate , the governorship and the majority of congressional seats in the state . The Florida Democratic Party Chair race is now between multi-millionaire real estate developer Steve Bittel , who Debbie Wasserman Schultz hired as a DNC finance co-chair last year , and progressive alternative Dwight Bullard . Bittel also held a fundraiser at his home for Wasserman Schultz in May , which was attended by Vice President Joe Biden . Similar issues were expressed in other states where Sanders had strong support among Democrats . Disclosure : Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner , the publisher of Observer Media .
