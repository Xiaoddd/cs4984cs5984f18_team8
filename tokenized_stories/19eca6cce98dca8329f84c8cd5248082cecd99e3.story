The Wall Street Journal and New York Times later confirmed the reports . The subpoenas indicate that the agency 's probe into Elon Musk 's Twitter activity has reached a more formal phase . This story , about the SEC 's investigation into Musk 's tweets , originally ran on August 14 . Elon Musk is , if nothing else , a warrior . He has battled short sellers . He has waged war against the auto industry and the National Transportation Safety Board . He has scrapped with the media and Los Angeles traffic and , because 2018 , Azealia Banks . Now , Musk may be in yet another battle , with the US Securities and Exchange Commission . But as Musk revealed in a Monday blog post , that funding may not , in fact , have been all that secured . And for the agency that regulates the securities industry , that may be a problem . One that could hurt Tesla where it counts : its checkbook . The problem is that securities law requires that public companies make certain sorts of information public to all their shareholders at the same time . And that said information be true . Anything less could be construed by courts -LRB- and juries -RRB- as fraud or market manipulation . Tesla declined to comment . One is the medium . Sure , anyone investing in Tesla should know Musk says all the juicy stuff on Twitter . And the Commission has allowed companies to disclose information on social media in the past , provided other shareholders are alerted in some other way . In the eight days since Musk tweeted about taking Tesla private , the automaker has not filed paperwork to disclose a material event or disclosure , the kind of big deal happening that all shareholders need to know about . Securing take-private funding is not that easy , says John Coffee , Jr. , the director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia Law School . If Tesla were smart , Coffee says , it would strike a deal with the feds , and quickly . In rule violations and breaches , federal regulators generally appreciate a touch of diplomacy , or contrition . Fighting the SEC , on the other hand , might get the electric carmaker in to deeper trouble , for more legal headaches lurk . By Tuesday , three Tesla shareholders had filed proposed class action lawsuits against Musk and Tesla , alleging the CEO tweeted to squeeze Tesla short sellers and goose its stock price . To win their cases -LRB- which may be combined -RRB- , the plaintiffs will have to prove Musk meant to screw with the stock price . But if Tesla loses a case to the SEC , Coffee says , elements of that judgement could be used during a civil case . Bad begets bad . Musk , and Tesla by extension , have always been scrappers , and unafraid of a fight . For years , the CEO has expressed intense frustration with short sellers , and with the requirements that come with being a public company . But when it comes to the SEC , some contrition might be wiser . Now that federal investigators are involved , the well-paid lawyers are here , too .
