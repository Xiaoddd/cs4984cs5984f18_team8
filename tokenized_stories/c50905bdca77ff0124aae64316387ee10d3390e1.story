Earlier this month , a federal judge from the U.S. District Court in Washington , D.C. , denied a legal request from the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline through their lands , arguing that the construction itself was n't bringing harm to either tribe . The judge did , however , schedule a longer hearing for February 27 to discuss the impact of the project on Native American communities in the area once oil begins to flow through the pipeline , reported the Associated Press . Despite the ongoing legal battle , The Intercept reported that construction has already restarted , and oil could be going through the Dakota Access Pipeline within the next 30 days . Because of the restart of construction , women at the Oceti Sakowin camp at Standing Rock are making a call for protesters and media to join them in protecting the camp as law enforcement officials continue to surround the site . People at the camp were notified on February 15 by North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and the Bureau of Indian Affairs that their site needs to be cleared by Wednesday , February 22 . If they are n't out of the camp by then , the women say in the video , they could face arrest , federal charges , and prison time . The group , however , declare that they wo n't be going down without a fight .
