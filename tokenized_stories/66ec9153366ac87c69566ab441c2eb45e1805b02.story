Palestine is resilience . It 's patience . It 's joy . It 's history . It 's rich heritage . Palestine lives within us , in our young and in our old . 69 years later , we have not forgotten . Palestine will be free . The struggle for Palestinian justice is interconnected to struggles against settler-colonialism and state violence across the globe . Militarization , surveillance , and violence against Palestinians and communities of color in the U.S. are deeply interconnected . Not just theoretically , but literally : G4S , the largest security corporation in the world , funds prisons , checkpoints , and the wall in Palestine as well as prisons , security measures at schools , and immigration detention centers in the United States . Combined Tactical Systems -LRB- CTS -RRB- makes tear-gas used by both U.S. police forces and the Israeli Army - often used against protesters . Despite these connections to existing movements against state violence in the United States , the movement for Palestinian justice remains marginalized . This needs to change . Justice for Palestine must become a normalized and inherent aspect of movements for racial and social justice . This syllabus is an effort to engage others in the critical conversation on historic and contemporary violence against Palestinians as well as Palestinian resistance . During the formation of Israel in 1947 to 1949 , there was a violent and systematic displacement of indigenous Palestinians . Approximately 530 Palestinian villages were destroyed and over 13,000 Palestinians were killed . This plan led to violence and ultimately , the creation of Israel as it is today . Today , Palestinians remain essentially undocumented in their own homeland , which has been stolen to make way for Israeli housing complexes or nature reserves -LRB- Airbnb even offers homes in illegal settlements as vacation spots -RRB- . Palestinians face high rates of incarceration and abuse and many of these prisoners are held in administrative detention , without a right to trial . Families are literally divided both by expulsion from Palestine and by the Israeli wall . Despite the words of many American politicians , Israel is not a democracy , as Palestinians under occupation are not able to vote for fear that they , along with Palestinians living in Israel , would form a majority . Sixty-nine years after the Nakba , there are more than 12 million Palestinians living worldwide , including more than five million registered refugees . The vast majority of Palestinians live outside of their ancestral homeland and are not permitted to return or even to visit . To understand Palestine is also to understand its diaspora , which includes generations of Palestinians who , unable to visit the country of their parents or grandparents , continue to fight for the Palestinian right of return . Meanwhile , the Israeli Law of Return guarantees Jewish people around the world Israeli citizenship should they want it , allowing them to settle on stolen land . Critiquing state violence perpetrated by Israel is not anti-Jewish . As within all marginalized communities , Palestinians in Palestine and of the diaspora have a strong history of resistance . For example , over the last four weeks , 1,500 Palestinian political prisoners have been on hunger strike to protest state sanctioned violence against prisoners . This syllabus not only highlights historical context , state violence , and Zionism , but resistance and personal Palestinian stories . These perspectives must always be included to center the lives of Palestinians themselves , not the violence perpetrated against them . With this perspective , as Linda Sarsour poignantly stated , liberation is inevitable . This syllabus was compiled by Abaki Beck and Sarah K. Abaki Beck is a young American Indian writer and the founder of POC Online Classroom . Sarah K is , among other things , an editor , a podcaster , and a Palestinian American . - Angela Y.
