The dead being collected after Wounded Knee massacre The Crime : On December 29 , 1890 , U.S. government soldiers massacred nearly 300 of the 350 Lakota men , women , and children on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota . The massacre took place near Wounded Knee Creek . Some of the women murdered were already widows whose husbands had previously been killed by U.S. troops . The Lakota Chief Spotted Elk -LRB- Big Foot -RRB- , who was dying of pneumonia , was among those massacred . The Lakota had been chased down by a detachment of the U.S. 7th Cavalry under the command of Major Samuel Whiteside . They were later joined by additional troops of the 7th Cavalry under Colonel James W. Forsyth . The U.S. troops , now numbering 500 , surrounded the camp and positioned four Hotchkiss guns nearby so no one could escape . The Lakota feared that there would be revenge in the hearts of the 7th Cavalry . This was the unit that had been defeated at the Little Big Horn when under the command of General George Armstrong Custer . On the morning of December 29 , the Lakota men were separated from the women and children , and were ordered to disarm . Unsatisfied with the number of rifles that were turned in , Colonel Forsyth ordered that all lodges and men be searched . In the course of the search , a scuffle broke out between the soldiers and one of the Lakota , a deaf man named Black Coyote -LRB- Black Fox -RRB- , who had spent a lot of money on his rifle . In the course of the struggle , a shot rang out . Immediately , the soldiers opened fire on the whole encampment . ... There was a woman with an infant in her arms who was killed as she almost touched the flag of truce ... . Right near the flag of truce a mother was shot down with her infant ; the child not knowing that its mother was dead was still nursing , and that especially was a very sad sight . The women as they were fleeing with their babes were killed together , shot right through , and the women who were very heavy with child were also killed . Little boys who were not wounded came out of their places of refuge , and as soon as they came in sight a number of soldiers surrounded them and butchered them there . After a few days , and a freezing blizzard , the dead became frozen in grotesque shapes . Then these Lakota were buried in mass graves . At least one was buried alive . This was the most ever awarded for a single battle in American history , before or since . Despite protests and demands , those medals have never been rescinded . The Criminals : U.S. President Benjamin Harrison : In late November 1890 , President Benjamin Harrison ordered federal troops into South Dakota in the largest military mobilization since the Civil War . During 1874-1875 , he led the attacks on the Kiowa , Comanche , and the Southern Cheyenne . During 1876-1877 , he forced the Lakota and their allies onto reservations . In 1890 , Miles aimed to crush any further resistance by the Lakota on their reservations . Major Samuel Whiteside and Colonel James W. Forsyth : Carried out the bloodthirsty massacre at Wounded Knee . In 1890 , the public excuse given for the campaign against the Lakota was that the rise and spread of the Ghost Dance would lead to a violent outbreak by the Lakota . Journalists who accompanied the federal troops sent to South Dakota wrote inflammatory articles to spread fear among the whites who had settled on Lakota land , which led to hysteria by 1890 . The Actual Motive : In reality , the Ghost Dance was a pacifist movement . The U.S. government wanted to consolidate its rule over the original inhabitants of North America , further opening up the West to white settlers , and saw any kind of resistance among the Lakota as a threat to its ambitions . In 1851 , the U.S. government had promised the Lakota an enormous extent of land in the north-central U.S. in the Fort Laramie Treaty . The government broke that treaty , and signed a new one for a much smaller amount of land in 1868 . But three years later it passed the Indian Appropriation Act , which effectively turned reservations into prisoner of war camps whose inhabitants had no rights and could not leave . When gold and other valuable resources were discovered in the Black Hills , the government divided up the land , between Native Americans who hated the concept of private ownership of land and white settlers to whom private property was everything . Native Americans were left with land nobody else wanted . and Revolution Send us your comments . If you like this article , subscribe , donate to and sustain Revolution newspaper .
