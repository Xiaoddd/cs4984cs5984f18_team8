At around 3:30 in the afternoon on Sunday , an elder approached the sacred fire and , taking a microphone , called the camp together . He announced that the United States Army Corps of Engineers had rejected the permits needed to finish the Dakota Access pipeline project , which would have put an oil pipeline through treaty lands promised to the Sioux in the 1800s . The order effectively halts all construction going forward until further environmental reviews for alternative routes are conducted . The indigenous people of the camp broke out into tribal victory dances . Welden Johnson , a member of the Colorado River Indian tribes , had traveled to Standing Rock to show solidarity with the Lakota Sioux people . At night , fireworks burst overhead , lighting teepees as the crowd cheered . The victory at Standing Rock serves as a bright moment in what has been a dark year for civil rights movements and people of color across the world . Isolationist movements like Brexit , the election of Donald Trump and the resurgence of white nationalism in the U.S. have put the sovereignty and safety of refugees and indigenous people around the world in jeopardy . The Standing Rock resistance , for many progressives , represents a tangible victory at a time when protest has seemed ineffective . Some of the indigenous here are skeptical , after centuries of abuse , that the federal government has suddenly come to their rescue . But even as the future of the Standing Rock struggle remains uncertain , the Lakota people have demonstrated , through resilience and unity , the way forward for resistance movements as racist , xenophobic and authoritarian power flexes its might . Over the months , hundreds of people blistered their palms constructing longhouses and yurts in time for the winter chill . They washed dishes in murky water , chopped wood and woke throughout the night to stoke wood stoves in meeting halls so that dozens of people could sleep without freezing . The resistance at Standing Rock represents a coalition of unexpected allies . It 's the first time in over a hundred years that the seven Sioux tribes have gathered together , and although the Sioux and the Crow Nation have had a centuries-old rivalry based on land wars , the Crow visited in November with gifts of buffalo meat . It has n't been just the indigenous in this fight . In the past week week , Oceti Sakowin camp expanded rapidly to accommodate a flood of non-native visitors and volunteers , growing by hundreds each day . On Saturday , 700 veterans arrived to take part in the protest and stand as human shields between water protectors and police , who have reportedly used tear gas , concussion grenades and water cannons to suppress the water protectors at the front lines . The veterans set up ground over the weekend , building their own accommodations on the north side of camp and registering to serve at the medical tent . Over 2,000 veterans are still anticipated to arrive before Monday , the deadline for an evacuation notice put out by the governor of North Dakota . The fight has just begun But even now that victory has been declared , that tide could still turn . Already , visitors who came to stand in solidarity are packing it in to head home . But not everyone at Standing Rock is convinced that this is the end of the pipeline 's path through treaty land . The Dakota Access pipeline company could continue to drill , choosing to incur fines by ignoring the Army Corp of Engineers . Some fear Trump , who at one point had a stake in the company building the pipeline , will reverse the decision when he takes office in January . It was never true , but the rumors spread .
