More than 8,000 people representing 180 tribes have converged at the Oceti Sakowin Camp at Standing Rock to protect their water and sacred sites . by Indian Country Today Dec 31 , 2016 - edited From the Dakota Access Pipeline to the Bears Ears National Monument , 2016 marked a turning point It almost goes without saying that THE environmental story of 2016 was the standoff over the routing of the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- . The list below covers the major points of the DAPL chronicle , followed by the other big environmental stories , some of which may have been missed the first time around amid the urgency of DAPL . On April 1 , Standing Rock Sioux tribal member LaDonna Brave Bull Allard began hosting about 25 to 30 people on land alongside the Cannonball River . When construction began across sacred , treaty-protected lands in August , people started pouring in , and the numbers soon swelled to hundreds , then thousands , of water protectors . The Apache Stronghold has been fighting for more than a decade to stop the takeover of sacred Oak Flat for copper mining by Rio Tinto . As protests mounted , the arrests began , and later the violence , from an increasingly militarized police force . Three arms of the United Nations also weighed in , condemning the enforcement , the pipeline and the breaching of treaty rights , and the world began to pay attention . Amnesty International also spoke outagainst treatment of the water protectors . Numerous celebrities also came on board , most notably Shailene Woodley , who spent weeks at the camps and hosted Thanksgiving dinner along with Jane Fonda , who donated seven butchered bison and served food for 500 water protectors at Standing Rock . Woodley spoke exclusively to ICTMN about how to be an indigenous ally , and Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt gave a concert the same weekend . With winter setting in , Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault II told the water protectors that it was time to go home . Some folks stayed , but many saw the wisdom of the request given the blizzard conditions , and the fight began moving to the financial front . In the end , water protector Faith Spotted Eagle even got an electoral college vote for President . Then it had to shut down its original Keystone pipeline -LRB- KXL would have been an extension -RRB- south of Freeman , South Dakota , after an oil spill was reported by a local rancher . FRANKENFISH BANNED The Yurok Tribe in California passed an ordinance banning genetically engineered organisms from within its territory . A lawsuit filed by a dozen defendants including the Quinault Indian Nation , against federal agencies that allowed the approval of genetically modified salmon went to court on Election Day . It affirmed that injecting industrial wastewater deep underground makes the Earth shake , and it officially anointed Oklahoma as the new California when it comes to the likelihood of seismic disruption . McCain demanded a criminal investigation . Environmental and tribal activists welcomed the designation of the Gold King Mine as a Superfund site . Obama signed it into law , making the bison the national mammal . National Bison Day fell on November 5 , the same month that the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming reintroduced its first bison since 1885 . This made them the first community of official climate refugees in the United States , though they have a lot of unofficial company . With that , climate change joined colonization as a force removing Indigenous Peoples from their lands . Elsewhere , no sooner had a study come out saying that First Nation fisheries in British Columbia could be devastated in coming years by climate change , than U.S. agencies announced that 2015 had been the warmest year on record . Both NOAA and NASA both attributed the rising temperatures to human activity . BEARS EARS As the year drew to a close , Obama declared 1.35 million acres of land sacred to several tribes as Bears Ears National Monument , a move that Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye said had been 90 years in the making . The resistance to designating the area reached fraudulent proportions as fake news releases and letters were posted in some towns on the Navajo Nation claiming that such a designation would close off access to tribes and that the U.S. Department of the Interior was going to not only reduce the size of the adjoining Navajo Nation but also throw a party that would leave out Utah Navajos . U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell visited the Bears Ears region of Utah to learn more about what has prompted 25 tribes to ask for the 1.9 million acres of land to be designated as a national monument . She told ICTMN that President Barack Obama would make the decision . Meanwhile a congressional bill touted as an alternative to the Bears Ears proposal moved forward from committee to the full House of Representatives but has now become moot . Twenty-four tribes worked to protect it , in collaboration with rock climbers , members of the U.S. Forest Service and conservationists and others . But his administration had been at it all year . He also declared 1.8 million acres in the Southern California desert as a series of national monuments , protecting 1,700 Native petroglyphs and linking Death Valley National Park , Joshua Tree National Park and the Mojave National Preserve . Tribal leaders joined Rep. Raul Grijalva , D-Tucson , to urge Obama to designate 1.7 million acres around the Grand Canyon as a national monument . Tribes are also calling on the President to shield the Grand Canyon from uranium mining in perpetuity . Marine National Monument .
