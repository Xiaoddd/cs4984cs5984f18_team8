Amazon pays no tax and many of their employees are on food stamps and welfare . Walmart encourages its workers to go on food stamps , while it guts municipal tax bases . Apple actively avoids taxes and both Apple and Microsoft built their entire business on technology they stole from Xerox . They should have all gone bankrupt and most of them should have gone to jail . They threw much of the world into an economic crisis which has still not ended . The oil industry receives massive subsidies , and so on and so forth . Studies show that consumption of social media correlates with decreased well-being and unhappiness , and the more you consume the worse it is . The evidence for this is overwhelming . They do it with less employment than prior industries and pay less taxes . This is not the behavior of a symbiote , it is the behavior of a parasite . The simple FACT is that during the 50s and 60s , when high earners -LRB- whom fools seem to think are the same as high performers -RRB- were massively taxed the economy did far better . All other things held equal , it is relative equality -LRB- not absolute , do not straw man -RRB- that makes for better economies and societies . The Athenians were probably right to choose their leaders by lot . An advantage to choosing leaders by lottery would be that the person would have to relinquish power and return to the society that she had affected . Willy permalink May 2 , 2018 In small well-run companies where the owners can literally watch who profits them most , high performers are often fairly rewarded . Now the boss is usually watching for who profits them politically and personally . But this post seems to be about large corporations gaming the system . But most conservative PTB are not that honest . They knew full well that mergers and stock buybacks is where most of the money would go , as predicted by honest analysts . johnm33 permalink May 3 , 2018 This has been a trend since at least the early 80s , I remember an article about how a large employer prefered employees who qualified for various benefits and actually included their assesment of entitlements in the job offer . You need a large HR department to get that sophisticated . Hugh permalink May 3 , 2018 Re Apple , it still would have been insanely profitable if it had kept its production in the US , but Steve Jobs was an anti-labor pirate so jobs went to China . And yes , it incorporated in Ireland so it could dodge US taxes . Sam Adams permalink May 3 , 2018 Behind every great fortune lies a greater crime . The alternatives they presented to random promotion were terrible . Obviously the kid operating your neighborhood lemonade stand will not be nearly as good a dentist as your current one is . But if either lemonade stands or dentistry commonly became part of large corporate organizations , to the exclusion of independent outfits , we would experience a dramatic drop in overall quality . I already theorized that within large corporations -LRB- especially the ones in cahoots with big government such as big pharma -RRB- the rewards become far more dependent on the politics than it does on productive quality . In such environments integrity becomes a fools game . I would never apply that term to a corporation , but only to individuals . And I only apply it to mean that high performance is producing results of some societal value . Not results that are obviously destructive , which seems to be what you want to focus on .
