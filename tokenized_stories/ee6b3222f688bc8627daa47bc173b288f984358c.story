William Happer , an eminent physicist at Princeton University , met Trump last month to discuss the post and says that if he were offered the job he would take it . Happer is highly regarded in the academic community , but many would view his appointment as a further blow to the prospects of concerted international action on climate change . Happer also supports a controversial crackdown on the freedom of federal agency scientists to speak out about their findings , arguing that mixed messages on issues such as whether butter or margarine is healthier , have led to people disregarding all public health information . Unlike many of his scientific peers , Happer is in favour of contentious legislation aimed at reining in the ability of federal agency staff to hold press conferences , give television interviews and promote their findings on official websites . However , critics view the bill as an attempt to strip federal agencies of autonomy and reduce their regulatory powers . When asked for examples of where the current vetting process has failed , Happer cited a recent controversy surrounding a high-profile paper published by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- Noaa -RRB- scientists showing that global surface temperatures had risen again after temporarily levelling off . Happer argues that climate monitoring , such as the collection of CO2 and atmospheric temperature data , is valuable and should be continued . However , he claims that the overall threat posed by global warming has been overplayed by scientists swayed by a political agenda and power-hungry civil servants . Trump is copying the Bush censorship playbook . However , Happer said that the public , who may view scientists as part of a privileged elite , may be less sympathetic . David Gelernter , a Yale computer scientist who has also questioned the reality of manmade climate change , is also reported to be in the running for the role of science adviser , but was not available for interview . An earlier version referred to the George W Bush administration where the George HW Bush administration was meant . The article was further amended on 22 February 2017 to correct the name of John Bates .
