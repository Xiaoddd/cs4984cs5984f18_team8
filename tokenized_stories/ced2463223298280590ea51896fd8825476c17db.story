Shared from the 2016-12-13 Star Tribune eEdition Monitoring equipment failed to detect North Dakota oil leak Spill fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land . A landowner discovered the spill near Belfield on Dec. 5 , said Bill Suess , an environmental scientist with the North Dakota Health Department . Suess said the spill migrated almost 6 miles from the spill site along Ash Coulee Creek , and it fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway . The creek feeds into the Little Missouri River , but Seuss said it appears no oil got that far and that no drinking water sources were threatened . The creek was free-flowing when the spill occurred but has since frozen over . Suess said about 37,000 gallons of oil had been recovered as of Monday . Owen said the pipeline was shut down immediately after the leak was discovered . True Cos. has a history of oil field-related spills in North Dakota and Montana , including a January 2015 pipeline break into the Yellowstone River . The 32,000-gallon spill temporarily shut down water supplies in the downstream community of Glendive , Mont. . Since 2006 , True Cos. has reported 36 spills totaling 320,000 gallons of petroleum products , most of which was never recovered . The six-inch steel Belle Fourche Pipeline is mostly underground but was built above ground where it crosses Ash Coulee Creek , Suess said . The company has hired Alberta-based SWAT Consulting Inc. that specializes in cold-weather oil spill cleanups , Suess said . About 60 workers were on site Monday , and crews have been averaging about 100 yards daily in their cleanup efforts , he said . Some of the oil remains trapped beneath the frozen creek . Dallas-based pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners says the Dakota Access pipeline would include safeguards such as leak detection equipment .
