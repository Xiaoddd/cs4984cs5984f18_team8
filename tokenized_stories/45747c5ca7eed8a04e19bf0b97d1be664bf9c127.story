Gov. Jack Dalrymple , a Republican , signed Executive Order 2016-08 , which mandates the evacuation of all persons in areas of Morton County that are under the jurisdiction of the Army Corps . The order cites harsh weather conditions , improper shelter , dwellings and sanitation as reasons for the evacuation . These persons are ordered to leave the evacuation area immediately , and are further ordered not to return to the evacuation area . Basically , the governor just ordered that all services be cut off for the water protectors in an attempt to get them to leave . This state executive order is a menacing action meant to cause fear , and is a blatant attempt by the state and local officials to usurp and circumvent federal authority . The USACE has clearly stated that it does not intend to forcibly remove campers from federal property . The Governor cites harsh weather conditions and the threat to human life . As I have stated previously , the most dangerous thing we can do is force well-situated campers from their shelters and into the cold . If the true concern is for public safety than the Governor should clear the blockade and the county law enforcement should cease all use of flash grenades , high-pressure water cannons in freezing temperatures , dog kennels for temporary human jails , and any harmful weaponry against human beings . This is a clear stretch of state emergency management authority and a further attempt to abuse and humiliate the water protectors . The State has since clarified that they wo n't be deploying law enforcement to forcibly remove campers , but we are wary that this executive order will enable further human rights violations . Sacred Stone Camp has said via its official Facebook page that campers have no intentions of leaving the area .
