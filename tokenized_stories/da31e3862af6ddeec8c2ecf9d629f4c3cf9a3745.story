The article was published in January , but it drew renewed attention on Tuesday following this weekend 's deadly incident in Charlottesville . As the outrage grew on Twitter , Fox News took action , deleting the version Fox Nation had published . Within hours , the Daily Caller had deleted the original post . That version had been published by Mike Raust , who was then a video editor at The Daily Caller . The Daily Caller 's editor-in-chief declined to comment . Fox was far from the only outlet to pick up Raust 's post . Smaller conservative sites like Right Wing News and Conservative Post also published the video , and with glee . There 's precedent for this type of rhetoric in conservative media . In fact , Raust is n't even the first one at his outlet to endorse driving over protesters . Lawmakers in several states have proposed laws this year intended to ease the liability for drivers who hit protesters . A bill in North Dakota 's state legislature , introduced in response to the Dakota Access pipeline unrest in the state , would have made it legal to accidentally run over protesters in the road . The measure failed to pass in February . Turner Broadcasting System , Inc. . All Rights Reserved .
