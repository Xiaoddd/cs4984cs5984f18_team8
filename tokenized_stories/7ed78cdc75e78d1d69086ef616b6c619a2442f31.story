Ben Van Heuvelen October 2 , 2007 8:08 pm -LRB- UTC -RRB- When Blackwater contractors guarding a U.S. State Department convoy allegedly killed 11 unarmed Iraqi civilians on Sept. 16 , it was only the latest in a series of controversial shooting incidents associated with the private security firm . Blackwater has a reputation for being quick on the draw . According to the New York Times , Blackwater guards were twice as likely as employees of two other firms protecting State Department personnel in Iraq to be involved in shooting incidents . On Tuesday morning , Rep. Henry Waxman , D-Calif. , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , will hold a hearing on the U.S. military 's use of private contractors . When Waxman announced plans for the hearing last week , the State Department directed Blackwater not to give any information or testimony without its signoff . After a public spat between Rep. Waxman and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , the State Department relented . Blackwater CEO and founder Erik Prince is now scheduled to testify at 10 a.m. Tuesday . But the attempt to shield Prince was apparently not the first time State had protected Blackwater . A report issued by Waxman on Monday alleges that State helped Blackwater cover up Iraqi fatalities . The ties between State and Blackwater are only part of a web of relationships that Blackwater has maintained with the Bush administration and with prominent Republicans . Good timing , and the connections of its CEO , may be the answer . His late father , auto-parts magnate Edgar Prince , was instrumental in the creation of the Family Research Council , one of the right-wing Christian groups most influential with the George W. Bush administration . At his funeral in 1995 , he was eulogized by two stalwarts of the Christian conservative movement , James Dobson and Gary Bauer . Edgar Prince 's widow , Elsa , who remarried after her husband 's death , has served on the boards of the FRC and another influential Christian-right organization , Dobson 's Focus on the Family . She currently runs the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation , where , according to IRS filings , her son Erik is a vice president . The foundation has given lavishly to some of the marquee names of the Christian right . Both Edgar and Elsa have been affiliated with the Council for National Policy , the secretive Christian conservative organization whose meetings have been attended by Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Bremer , and whose membership is rumored to include Jerry Falwell , Ralph Reed and Dobson . The former Betsy Prince -- Edgar and Elsa 's daughter , Erik 's sister -- married into the DeVos family , one of the country 's biggest donors to Republican and conservative causes . She chaired the Michigan Republican Party from 1996 to 2000 and again from 2003 to 2005 , and her husband , Dick , ran as the Republican candidate for Michigan governor in 2006 . Erik Prince himself is no slouch when it comes to giving to Republicans and cultivating relationships with important conservatives . During college , he interned in George H.W. Bush 's White House , and also interned for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher , R-Calif . Rohrabacher and fellow California Republican Rep. John Doolittle have visited Blackwater 's Moyock , N.C. , compound , on a trip arranged by the Alexander Strategy Group , a lobbying firm founded by former aides of then House Majority Leader Tom Delay . ASG partner Paul Behrends is a longtime associate of Prince 's . Prince 's connections seem to have paid off for Blackwater . But Prince 's most important benefactor was fellow conservative Roman Catholic convert L. Paul Bremer , former head of the Coalition Provisional Authority , the American occupation government in Iraq . In charge of the Blackwater team guarding Bremer was Frank Gallagher , who had provided personal security for former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger when Bremer was managing director of Kissinger 's consulting firm , Kissinger and Associates , in the 1990s . Blackwater 's benefits from government largess have n't ended with Iraq . Blackwater also became involved in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , and profited handsomely . Joseph Schmitz , chief operating officer and general counsel : In 2002 , President Bush nominated Schmitz to oversee and police the Pentagon 's military contracts as the Defense Department 's inspector general . Unlike previous I.G.s , Schmitz reported directly to the secretary of defense -- a setup that both Democratic and Republican lawmakers objected to , given Schmitz 's oversight responsibility . His father , John G. Schmitz , was a two-term Republican congressman , and his brother , Patrick Schmitz , served as George H.W. Bush 's deputy counsel from 1985 to 1993 . Joseph himself worked as a special assistant to Reagan-era Attorney General Edwin Meese . Schmitz resigned in 2005 under mounting pressure from both Democratic and Republican senators , who accused him of interfering with criminal investigations into inappropriately awarded contracts , turning a blind eye to conflicts of interest and other failures of oversight . According to an October 2005 article in Time magazine , Schmitz showed the White House the results of his staff 's multiyear investigation into a contract in which the Air Force leased air-refueling tankers from Boeing for more than it would have cost to buy them , then agreed to redact the names of senior White House staffers involved in the decision before sending the final report to Congress . Schmitz informed his staff on Aug. 26 , 2005 , that he was leaving the Pentagon ; in September of that year , he went to work for Blackwater . J. Cofer Black , vice chairman : Black spent most of his 28-year CIA career running covert operations in the Directorate of Operations , where he worked with Rob Richer -LRB- below -RRB- . Black is , according to published accounts , a man with a flair for the dramatic , the kind of briefer President Bush likes . Black is also one of the more prominent faces associated with the Bush administration 's interrogation and extraordinary rendition policies . And the group within the CIA responsible for extraordinary renditions -- operations in which covert agents grab terror suspects and take them to secret prison facilities for interrogations that would normally be prohibited as torture -- fell under Black at the CTC , Priest has reported . Black later went to the State Department , where one of his roles was to begin coordinating security for the 2004 Olympics in Greece . In 2003 , the State Department gave Blackwater a contract to train the Olympic security teams . In addition to his work with Blackwater and his own company , Total Intelligence Solutions , Black also recently joined the presidential campaign of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , where he serves the Republican hopeful as senior advisor for counterterrorism and national security . Rob Richer , vice president for intelligence : Richer was head of the CIA 's Near East division -- and the agency 's liaison with King Abdullah of Jordan -- from 1999 to 2004 . In 2003 , he briefed President Bush on the nascent Iraqi insurgency . In late 2004 , he became the associate deputy director in the CIA 's Directorate of Operations , making him the second-ranking official for clandestine operations . He left the agency for Blackwater in the fall of 2005 , effectively taking the agency 's relationship with Abdullah with him . The CIA had invested millions of dollars in training Jordan 's intelligence services . There was an obvious quid pro quo : In exchange for the training , Jordan would share information . Jordan has now hired Blackwater 's intelligence division -- headed by Richer -- to do its spy training instead . Fred Fielding , former outside counsel : After four Blackwater employees were tortured and killed in Fallujah , Iraq , in 2004 , their families brought a wrongful-death lawsuit against Blackwater , charging that the company had not provided adequate arms , armor and backup . Blackwater feared that if it was found liable for its employees ' deaths , a floodgate of future litigation could be opened . To fight the suit , Blackwater hired Fielding , the consummate Republican insider . Dan Callahan , a lawyer representing the families , told Salon he was shocked when he learned Fielding would be representing the company . Fielding has had a long career as a lawyer to prominent Republicans . From 1970 to 1972 , he was an associate White House counsel in the Nixon administration ; from 1972 to 1974 , he was present for the denouement of that administration as deputy White House counsel . Under President Reagan , he served as White House counsel from 1981 to 1986 , where he was the boss of a young assistant counsel named John Roberts , now the chief justice of the United States . In January 2007 , Bush chose him as White House counsel . Ken Starr , outside counsel : According to Callahan , Fielding represented Blackwater as outside counsel for about six months beginning in February 2005 . After Fielding left the case , the law firm Greenberg Traurig , which was once home to Jack Abramoff and worked for George W. Bush in the Florida recount , represented Blackwater till October 2006 . Blackwater then hired another high-profile lawyer with impeccable Republican credentials -- Ken Starr , now the dean of Pepperdine Law School in California . Starr was appointed to the federal bench by Reagan , was U.S. solicitor general under George H.W. Bush and was on Bush 's shortlist to replace William Brennan on the Supreme Court . He is best known , however , as the independent counsel who investigated Bill Clinton . He revealed the intimate details of Clinton 's affair with intern Monica Lewinsky in the infamous Starr Report and set in motion Clinton 's impeachment by Congress . Blackwater continues to assert that the state of North Carolina lacks jurisdiction in the wrongful-death lawsuit against the security firm . Roberts denied the petition on Oct. 24 . In December , Starr filed a motion to bring the matter before the entire Supreme Court . The motion was denied in February . Additional reporting by Tracee Herbaugh .
