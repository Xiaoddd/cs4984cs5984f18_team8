The email reads as follows . This is a message from the North Dakota Health Alert Network . The State Emergency Preparedness and Response Section is seeking assistance with staffing and staging of medical personnel for an ongoing response . EPR requests support for both ALS and BLS ambulance rigs with accompanying crews for staging purposes . A second request will be sent out to EMS and medical personnel to assist with staffing medical assets . No Relation TDH reached out to the number that was listed on the email , and the request was confirmed to be authentic . When asked if the request had any relation to the upcoming eviction date at Oceti Sakowin , we were told while it did have to do with the situation at the camp , but it was not related to the future eviction notice from the Army Corps . TDH was denied further information detailing what dates the NDHAN were requesting emergency workers . Several days ago , Governor Dalrymple declared Executive Order 2016-08 . When Dalrymple declared Executive Order 2016-08 , one stipulation was that those on Army Corps land would be cut off from public services , including , but not limited to , police and medical . Making the emergency worker request from the NDHAN rather bizarre . Emergency Workers Along with the email that was sent to TDH , there was also a screenshot of what appears to be a conversation through texts . The conversation states that the request for emergency workers is not to help water protectors standing against the Dakota Access Pipeline . The text messages seem to match the current narrative . The NDHAN has in fact requested emergency workers , and with Executive Order 2016-08 active until spring , the workers are coming to help law enforcement . Just as the screenshot of the text messages state . The four basic ideas for emergency planning are emergency assessment , hazard operations , population protection , and incident management . While all the warning signs are pointing towards law enforcement preparing for something , at this time , it is not confirmed the request for emergency workers is directly linked to the upcoming December 5 , eviction against those at the Oceti Sakowin camp .
