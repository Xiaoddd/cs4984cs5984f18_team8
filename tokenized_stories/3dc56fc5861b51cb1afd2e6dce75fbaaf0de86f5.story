Sullivan , a 35-year-old navy veteran from San Diego , who returned home from Standing Rock on Monday , had not heard he was a suspect until a Guardian reporter called him on Thursday afternoon . The arson accusation , which police said could lead to prosecution , is the latest in a series of arrests and charges filed against veterans aiding indigenous groups fighting the pipeline , which could soon be in operation . Last month , police filed charges against two veterans supporting Standing Rock , holding one in jail for several days . The prosecutions raised concerns that police were trying to prevent them from going to the camps . The Guardian interviewed Sullivan last week on the day a highly militarized police operation began raiding the camps and making arrests . Throughout the day , some activists were setting fire to remaining structures at Oceti Sakowin , the main Standing Rock camp that is now completely evacuated . Sullivan told the Guardian at the time that he witnessed an explosion in a tipi and helped two people to safety . On Thursday , he said the photo that police took from his Facebook shows him near a different burning structure . He said he was on the other end of camp when people first lit it on fire and that he briefly came over later and took a photo of it . Sean Sullivan says the photo on his Facebook page was taken near a burning structure , but he had nothing to do with the fire .

The veterans charged last month were accused of drug offenses after they were searched and found to have small amounts of cannabis , which they said they were prescribed to treat post-traumatic stress disorder . Some Native American activists are already facing serious arson charges and potentially hefty prison sentences . Many similar charges , however , were also dropped or rejected by a judge last year due to lack of evidence . Keller said he suspects Sullivan could face charges , but did not provide further details . Crane said he suspected Sullivan became a target since he was a visible member of VeteransRespond who had talked to multiple reporters . Mark Sanderson , executive director of VeteransRespond , said he was shocked by the news .
