Further construction on army corps property is not allowed until the final permit is issued . Trump has indicated that he will favor fossil fuels over clean energy and has a history of conflict with Native American tribes , motivated by competition over casinos . He also pointed out that the corporation has previously said in court that if it were not delivering oil by 1 January 2017 , its shipper contracts would expire and the project would be in jeopardy . The army corps and the US Department of Justice declined to comment on the new court filings . A spokeswoman for the army declined to speculate on the impact that the transition to a new presidential administration might have on its planned consultation with the tribe . Members of the tribe fear that the pipeline will threaten their water source and that construction will destroy sacred sites , including burial grounds . Members of hundreds of Native American nations , as well as environmental activists , have joined the original band of water protectors in what are now sprawling encampments near the construction site . More than 400 have been arrested during demonstrations in North Dakota that sought to halt or delay construction of the pipeline . Officers used pepper spray , beanbags and Tasers against the demonstrators . There is no compromise . There is no negotiation .
