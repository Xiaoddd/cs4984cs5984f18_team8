There are numerous pipelines in development . There is the Keystone XL pipeline fight starting up . There are camps at Eagle Butte SD , also in Iowa and in Florida . Many have went to Eagle Butte to regroup . I am planning on going to Eagle Butte where many Michigan water protectors sought refuge Currently I 'm in Michigan , getting me and my truck fixed . I 've brought back equipment that needs repair , or can be used for the Enbridge Pipeline resistance csmp . I 'm gathering a few supplies and tools and financial assistance to return to Standing Rock . We suffered great losses of equipment , vehicles , things . Our health worries me . Everyone is sick and has been . More chaga and honey tea will be prepared . It 's been four months since I 've been home . I slept 10 hours last night and the last few nights and it still hurts physically and emotionally . Im going back to the doctor and a dentist soon , I took a standing 8 count , I 'm functioning above the brain stem , cortex level in my head . Hard to believe I was able to drive back , me and my truck . I will also be at a pipeline advisory meeting at State Capital in Lansing MI , Momday , 13 . Speaking at local colleges and churches to try and help . Ill also be at a meeting Tuesday the 14th in Traverse City for water protectors . It helps me planning on going back to ND is the best thing I 've felt since I 've been back in Michigan . Thats just me , to not leave any tasks possible to complete , uncompleted . I 'll sleep better . The legal cases continue and we seem to be holding our own in court . Judges have thrown some cases out for lack of evidence . However there is still an ongoing need for financial assistance . Lawyers are donating time , but living expenses for attorneys , defendants , and court fees add up I see it as intimidation . Already water protectors have been denied employment from pending charges . My immediate plans are to take care of myself , visit my children and family and begin putting together a caravan to return to Standing Rock , and then to Eagle Butte , where the Cheyenne River Sioux have invited us to seek refuge . I have equipment for 28 people , and it 's mostly winter gear . So I will be switching out to spring . I expect to hear from our crew in Eagle Butte . We are going greener this time . More wind , more solar . Everyone is committed to being greener . We went the entire winter on solar , wind , and wood heat we are looking at building wood burning oven , as we used propane to cook on primarily . The government keeps saying it 's over . It is n't . We lived about 400 yards from the front lines , with snipers and armored personnel carriers on the ridges around us . It is odd not feeling there presence just now in michigan So we are regrouping , counting our losses . We have found everyone on our team we are still helping evacuate folks home , and manning the safe house we set up . We suffered catastrophic losses during three raids on Oceti Sakowin , renamed Oceti Oyate , Rosebud , and Sacred Stone Camp . I really do n't like not being there , but I am able to get and borrow some equipment needed to where it needs to go , and for myself , recycle the last batch of recovered batteries , some recycling , a few folks are still using our safe house , almost compromised by me unfriending someone . Her sis got all uppity . I did n't realize the insane nature of unfriending someone on FB . So I am going back , to reweave loose ends , and finish up the last of the clean up .
