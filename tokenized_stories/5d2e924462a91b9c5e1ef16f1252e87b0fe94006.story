The largest camp in Austria was known as Mauthausen . Mauthausen was a concentration camp near Linz , Austria . It was a camp that centered it 's focus on it 's rock quarry nearby . It survived as a camp for seven years . Mauthausen and it 's sub camps killed 119,000 prisoners of the 200,000 that entered through it 's gates . There , they were forced to construct a granite-fortress prison for the main camp . Mauthausen was located almost 12 miles southeast of Linz , Austria , Hitler 's hometown when he was a teenager . Here , there were 16 tents put up in the fall of 1944 . They were made to hold the large groups of incoming Hungarian Jews . All of these smaller parts of the camp and the main camp were surrounded by electrified fence . The central camp of Mauthausen consisted of 32 barracks . When these barracks became over-filled , the commander , Franz Zieris , ordered the surrounding fields be enclosed with barbed-wire fence . This is where many Hungarian Jews and Russian prisoners stayed out in the open all year round . This is one reason why Mauthausen was known as a category three camp which was the worst of the three categories . Beside the outer wall of the camp , there were a few stone buildings that served as a kitchen , showers , and places where laundry was done . The gas chamber , the place where they were burned , and the camp prison were also among these stone buildings . Mauthausen 's largest sub camp was called Gusen -LRB- KZ Gusen -RRB- , Gusen was built only miles outside of Mauthausen . It was almost as gruesome as Mauthausen . Gusen had two sub camps that were settled later on . Gusen II -LRB- St. Goergen -RRB- and Gusen III -LRB- Lungitz -RRB- . During the time in which the war was going on , forced labor was important to German armaments production . Most prisoners at Mauthausen went through a system in which the Nazi 's picked out the ones that were too weak or ill to perform extreme labor , they were then exterminated . There were many ways an inmate could die , such as being shot , being hanged , beaten , starvation , and diseases . But Mauthausen did indeed have a gas-chamber that could murder 120 inmates per time . Another method of killing inmates , and one of the SS men 's favorite ways , in the winter was to make inmates get naked . Then the SS men sprayed them with cold water until the prisoners froze to death . They died very easily because the average temperature was around 10 degrees Celsius . Another method favored by the SS men , was throwing inmates off the edge of the rock quarry . This was a way where inmates were killed very cheaply . Another way than inmates were killed cheaply was by heart injections . 420 Jewish children from 4 to 7 were murdered in this way . Also another way y which inmates were killed painfully was by showering in the winters , and starvation . An average working day for prisoners started at 4:45 A.M. -LRB- 5:15 A.M. in the winter -RRB- , and ended at 7:00 P.M. . The inmates were taken to a tree and hung by their arms behind their backs . Most times they Most of the time they were forgotten and died only 30 minutes later . In this technique , 40 to 200 prisoners were taken the showers , here S.S. men exposed them to ice cold water . This method was created by Karl Chielewski . Not many but a few prisoners were drowned in huge tubs . Also many prisoners were forced to walk up 186 carrying while holding 100 pounds on their backs , and if one person dropped theirs it would roll back down hitting many people . Some of the expiments that occurred at Mauthausen were performed by Dr. Kaminski . But between the years of 1940 and 1944 absolutely no medical assistance was given to Jews and Russian prisoners , so they were forced to use paper as bandages . There were seven blocks where medical experiments took place , Bock 26 , 27 , 28 , 29,30 , 31 , and 32 . Between 1940 and 1942 many inmates weighed about 90 pounds . But some other inmates might have weighed only 60 to 80 , and the average time of survival at Mauthausen was about six months . Many of these prisoners were from the Spanish Republican Army , because they were defeated by General Franco 's Fascist Forces , they fled into France , and when Great Britain And France went to war with Germany , many Spanish men fought on France 's side . So when France surrendered to Germany , they were taken prisoners . In 1945 , Mauthausen became overcrowded and many were dead by the time US forces , under the command of Colonel Robert R. Seibel , came to liberate Mauthausen . At that time S.S. men had fled and left the local people in charge . But the locals wanted to surrender as quickly as possible . Mauthausen had been operational for seven years . Not long after Mauthausen was liberated , Sergant Abert J. Kosiek and his troops liberated the three camp at Gusen . 37,000 had died there . Of the 200,000 prisoners that passed through Mauthausen 's gates 119,000 died along with 38,120 Jews . Eva was born in Mauthausen on April 29 , 1945 . She and her mother were the only to survive in the family of 15 . Another well known survivor of Mauthausen is Mike Jacobs . He was a jew from a small town in Polland called Konin . He is the founder of the Dallas Memorial Center for Holocaust studies . He know lives in Dallas , TX . Martin Gilbert , a liberator of Mauthausen remembers a survivor from the central camp named Sidney Fahn , who had been broght from the Auchuwitz-Birkenau camp and had only weighed 80 pounds . He remembers that she was so weak that he could n't even greet the US liberators.Another man who survived Mauthausen is Leon Zelman . He is a journalist that was born in 1928 . He is the co-founder of The Jewish Welcome Service in 1978 , that helped jews return to Austria after they were forced to leave in 1928 by the Nazis in 1928 . a politician that survived Mathausen is Leopold Figl . He is the co-founder of the Austrian Peoples Party or OVP in 1945 . During 1959 he became First President of the Nationalrat . Also 1962 and 1965 he was the Governor of Lower Austria . Another survivor of Mauthausen is Captin J. D. Pletcher . He remembers the odor at Guskirchen , a subcamp to Mauthausen . It was a smell I will never forget , completely different from anything I have ever encoutered , it could almost be seen and hung over the camp like a fog of death . Mauthausen was very bad and killed many people just for being a different race or being a prisoner . It also changed many peoples lives very drastically . It was known so well because it was the biggest camp in Austria . Mauthausen was a camp that focused most of it 's energy on it 's reasonably large rock quarry .
