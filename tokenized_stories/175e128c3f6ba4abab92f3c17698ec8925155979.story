Published 2 years ago on November 12 , 2016 By Rajie Kabli Get Your FREE In Depth Numerology Reading Share Tweet The North Dakota Access Pipeline protests rage on . The Missouri is their main source of water and they are protecting the land , water , and air of ancient native burial grounds . Camps formed back in April and protests began in August . That is , corporate interests and profits taking precedence over the health and well-being of the people and the land . In the next few weeks we will be submitting a public records request to follow the money and determine who exactly was providing the police with all this highly sophisticated technology they are using on peaceful protesters . The people are fighting to be heard . To be recognized as having legitimate concerns . The bulldozing of the land is a metaphor for the bulldozing of the hearts of the people there . No longer can we allow the corporations to run rampant and do whatever they want , when they want , and who they want to . There must be more attention placed on this issue . This is one of the reasons why myself and another journalist from CE are going to Standing Rock this weekend . 1.67 million Here is where you can get involved if you can not directly come and be with us at Standing Rock . You can show your support and solidarity with the movement by donating , liking , and sharing our CE News Network . The same network that is trying to bring all these independent media outlets together . This is a real life example of the shifting consciousness from competition to cooperation , having all agreed to work together to present solutions to the Dakota Access Pipeline as a unified front . We at Collective Evolution have seen and spoken with the creators of technology that will truly change the world . It is clean energy that is so simple in its constitution that many can not even fathom its existence . But , I assure you the MTG -LRB- magnetic transducer generator -RRB- has the ability to supply energy to all of our homes , buildings , and vehicles without damaging the earth and greatly cutting costs , so we may enjoy life to the fullest , instead of being slaves to our utility companies . Remember , we are all in this together . It turned out to be one of the deepest and most important information we pulled out within an interview . We explored why things are moving a little more slowly with the shift at times , what is stopping certain solutions from coming forward and the important role we all play . Watch the interview here . As Robert David Steele explains , it deals with torture , ritual abuse , organ harvesting and much more . It 's a big issue that needs more awareness , and the ITNJ is taking action . Processing our emotions is key . Robert David Steele is a former Marine , CIA case officer and the co-founder of the US Marine Corps Intelligence Activity . These are the people we have to start listening to for truth . Only now are we seeing it creep up into the mainstream narrative , despite the fact that they continually try and shut it down . Because the owners and shareholders of these networks have been implicated in the activity discussed in this article . Beyond Simple Abuse In the video below , Robert gives a very brief outline of the issue , and how child trafficking goes far beyond the abuse of children . It goes into organ harvesting , children being bred for ritual abuse , born without a birth certificate , tortured , enslaved , mind-controlled and a much more . He claims that they are filled with 90 percent good people , with good hearts and good intentions , and that the 10 percent that controls these areas are wrapped up in in-humane activity , like child trafficking . Give the video below a listen to learn more , and you can check out more testimony from the International Tribunal on Natural Justice from others like Robert , police officers , MK Ultra survivors and many more who have knowledge of such activity . When this happens , action starts to take place , like what we are seeing at the ITNJ . Process any emotions that come from learning this information . This is how we will move through the states of consciousness that project a world that keeps this type of stuff occurring . Evolving beyond the need for it , is often about switching our perspective about it and processing the emotions . Free Franco DeNicola Screening : The Shift In Consciousness We interviewed Franco DeNicola about what is happening with the shift in consciousness .

Reflect On : Bigelow is just one person , but he is joined by hundreds of others with impressive credentials . These people have been telling the world that we are not alone for years , in a very serious manner . All of us have been engulfed in our own lives when the world is calling for us to be concerned about others . One big revelation hitting the mainstream right now is the fact that we are not alone , and that intelligent extraterrestrial life-forms have been visiting our planet for a long time , and still do . As unbelievable as this may sound , it comes from the highest ranking military personnel , academicians , intelligence agents , politicians , and private contractors from within the military industrial complex . No matter how much evidence for a given phenomenon , and no matter how obvious its reality , if it goes against the human mind and what we are willing to accept , it is usually ignored or greeted with ridicule . Bigelow has done work for multiple international space agencies and is currently in agreements with multiple nations to build space habitats and space stations . CEO Tom Delonge , along with several other people , including a recently retired director of Lockheed Aerospace , Steve Justice , a Department of Defense Scientist , Hal Puthoff , a senior intelligence officer from the CIA , Jim Semivan , a Director of National Intelligence , Louis Elizondo , the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in the Clinton and Bush Administrations , Christopher Mellon , and many more are all releasing official video footage and electro-optical data -LRB- radar trackings , returns -RRB- and letting the world know that these things -LRB- UFOs -RRB- are real . You can view the entire team and their credentials here . Perhaps hundreds , maybe even thousands of races have been catalogued by our governments worldwide . He gave an intriguing answer , with some interesting expressions on his face . It turned out to be one of the deepest and most important information we pulled out within an interview .

The mainstream is finally picking up on mind-body connection . Open-Label Placebo Experiment Time magazine recently published an article about a woman -LRB- now a 71-year old medical assistant -RRB- and her struggle with irritable bowel syndrome -LRB- IBS -RRB- . She tried everything , from drugs to changing her diet . It was a horrible way to live , she told the Times , as she was often huddled in a corner and keeled over in pain . She had never gone so long without an attack . This has been documented for centuries . The interesting thing about the study the woman decided to participate in , is the fact that patients taking the placebo pill were well aware that they were taking a placebo . Nearly twice as many people in the trial who knowingly received placebo pills reported experiencing adequate symptom relief , compared with the people who received no treatment . Not only that but the men and women taking the placebo also doubled their rates of improvement to a point that was about equal to the effects of two IBS medications that were commonly used at the time . So far , researchers have treated 270 patients and intend to treat approximately 100 more with IBV via their ongoing clinical trial . Some people argue that that the human body does not respond to treatment , but instead , the ritual of treatment . Other Examples Of The Placebo Effect Another example comes from a study published in 2002 by the New England Journal of Medicine which looked at surgery for patients with severe debilitating knee pain . This study divided people into three groups , for one group the surgeons saved the damaged cartilage in the knee . For another , they flushed out the knee joint by removing all of the material believed to be causing inflammation . The third group received a fake surgery , the patients were simply sedated and tricked into thinking that they actually had the surgery . All three groups went through the same rehab process , and the results were astonishing . The placebo group improved just as much as the other two groups who had the surgery . The placebo effect should be the subject of major , funded research efforts . If medical researchers could figure out how to leverage the placebo effect , they would hand doctors an efficient , energy-based , side effect-free tool to treat disease . -LRB- source -RRB- Studies examining non-physical healing go beyond the placebo .
