The new Republican president backed the Keystone XL and Dakota Access projects , provided American steel is used . The Obama administration in late 2015 halted Keystone , which would carry crude from Canada to Texas . The Army decided last year to explore other routes for the Dakota pipeline amid huge protests by Native Americans . In the White House on Tuesday morning , Mr Trump said both projects would be subject to renegotiated terms and conditions . More than just a pipeline - Analysis by Anthony Zurcher , Washington DC Over the course of the Obama presidency , the Keystone XL Pipeline became more than just another energy industry construction project . It grew into a high-profile proxy fight between environmentalists and oil-and-gas advocates ; liberals and conservatives ; pro-regulation activists and small-government true believers . On the campaign trail Donald Trump often cited the Obama administration 's reluctance to green-light the project as prima facie evidence of the Democratic Party 's anti-business attitudes . Now , with the swipe of a pen , he 's set make it much easier for the project to be completed - assuming the involved company still wants it . Perhaps of more immediate concern is Mr Trump 's move to fast-track approval of the Dakota Access Pipeline , which was the focus of vigorous protests from Native American tribes in 2016 . Unlike Keystone , that project has not been held in limbo for years . Mr Trump 's actions do not mean the end of the fight over US pipeline construction , however . Opponents will continue to argue that they jeopardise sensitive environmental areas and violate private property rights . Now , however , instead of appealing to a potentially friendly Democratic administration , they will take the battle to the courts . Campaigners have said the project will leave only a handful of long-term positions after it is built . Environmental groups reacted with outrage . But oil industry groups applauded the move . President Trump , who took office on Friday , promised during his White House campaign to support Keystone XL and fossil fuels , including the flagging US coal industry .
