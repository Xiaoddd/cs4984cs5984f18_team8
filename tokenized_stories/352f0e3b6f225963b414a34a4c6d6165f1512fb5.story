Vladimir Putin came in person to celebrate the deal to explore Russia 's vast , untouched oil resources in the Arctic . If any American company stands to benefit big from lifting sanctions on Russia , it would be Exxon . And with Tillerson being nominated as Trump 's secretary of state , the lifelong Exxon man may be in a prime position to make that case . The deal with the state-run Russian oil company Rosneft was no ordinary one . Plus , the sanctions posed a huge obstacle that stood in the way of Exxon developing prized assets at a time when the company 's older oilfields are getting depleted . Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson -LRB- left -RRB- attends ceremony with Russian President Vladimir Putin .

The Exxon man also has n't been shy about a desire to resume operations in Russia 's Arctic .

The 600,000 shares he 's sitting on can be sold or put in vanilla investment funds to avoid a conflict of interest .

Today 's low oil prices make it difficult to justify spending gobs of money to find and pump notoriously-elusive Arctic oil . But Oppenheimer 's Gheit argues that Exxon is playing the long game in Russia , not looking at today 's low -LRB- but rising -RRB- oil prices .

The importance of Exxon finding the next great oil frontier should not be underestimated . Oil companies are constantly depleting their own assets over time . Last quarter , Exxon pumped an incredible 2.2 million barrels of oil each day -- oil that eventually needs to be replaced with new finds somewhere . The Rosneft deal is also critical to Tillerson 's personal legacy at Exxon .
