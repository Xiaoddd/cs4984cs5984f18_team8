On a social level , abjection designates a degraded , stigmatized , or cast out status . In psychoanalytic parlance , this is the notion of Verwerfung -LRB- foreclosure -RRB- . Human treatment of the environment certainly falls under this definition . The project as designed would carry oil from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota and Montana across the Plains to Illinois . Protestors argue that a completed pipeline would desecrate spiritual ancestral lands , endanger the water supply , and unfairly burden the Standing Rock Sioux nation , which would also gain nothing from any economic development resulting from the project . I could have offered this person a rather simplistic reason that any pipeline potentially exposes people to the risk of leakage and environmental pollution , and that humanity already places a dangerous over-reliance on environmentally damaging fossil fuels that imperil us all . The situation and choice of location to place the proposed pipeline beneath the Missouri River are much more complex and much more intersectional . Originally , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers planned to cross the pipeline under the Missouri River north of Bismarck , North Dakota , but decided to reposition the route due to potential threats to the drinking water in the majority-white municipality of Bismarck . They have justified threatening to evict protestors from their lands , and to incarcerate and prosecute them . The placement of the proposed pipeline stands as yet another incident in the long and brutal track record of the dominant group inflicting physical and cultural genocide on the abject bodies who get in the way or challenge a patriarchal hegemonic imperative .
