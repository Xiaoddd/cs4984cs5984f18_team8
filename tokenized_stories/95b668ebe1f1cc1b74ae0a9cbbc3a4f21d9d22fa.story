Get short URL 18 13 13 Washington has boosted its military presence in Syria to ostensibly help local forces fight against Daesh , but former US diplomat and Senate adviser James Jatras told Radio Sputnik that the Pentagon 's latest deployment could see the United States get bogged down in Syria . I do n't think it 's a good idea . As much as anybody else I would like to see Daesh and other terrorist groups in Syria destroyed . It seems to me that could be done without an American ground deployment . Jatras emphasized that he did not mean that this strategy could not be successful , but warned that there are major risks involved . Using airpower commits the US to putting more special forces on the ground , which was already done under Obama and now is being expended by Trump . If we find ourselves involved in a much more direct and extensive combat than was anticipated , we could find ourselves in another ground war . The US has since then sent service personnel to Iraq and Syria to train and advise local fighters . Most recently , Washington deployed 400 Marines and Army Rangers to assist the Syrian Democratic Forces in their operation to free Raqqa , the capital of Daesh 's caliphate . This is not to say that there are no positive developments with regard to the ongoing Syrian conflict . In this context , Jatras mentioned Manbij , a Syrian city which made headlines last week when Russia and the United States tried to prevent Turkey from advancing deeper into Kurdish-held areas . Moscow brokered a deal between Damascus and the Syrian Democratic Forces , which administer Manbij . Under the agreement , the Syrian Arab Army created a buffer zone between forces taking part in the Ankara-led Operation Euphrates Shield and the Kurds . For its part , the United States moved its troops closer to Manbij to keep their allies at bay . So it seems like there is some effort to get some coordination on the same side , among forces that are suspicious of each other , but to direct their activity against Daesh .
