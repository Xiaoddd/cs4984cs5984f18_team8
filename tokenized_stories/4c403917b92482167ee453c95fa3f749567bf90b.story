Credit : Reuters This story was updated at 2.00 a.m. ET on February 16 , 2017 to reflect news events . Native American tribes have filed yet another legal motion seeking to halt construction of the Dakota Access pipeline . Legal experts said the attempt faces long odds but may be the tribes ' best hope for blocking the project . The motion , filed Tuesday by the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes , asks the court to reverse an easement for the pipeline that the Army Corps of Engineers granted . The tribes said the Corps ' actions violate the National Environmental Policy Act and the Corps ' responsibility to protect the tribes ' treaty rights . The move is the latest in a long and twisting legal battle and protest movement to block the project 's Missouri River crossing under Lake Oahe , which skirts the Standing Rock Sioux reservation . The tribe says the pipeline threatens its water supply and sacred sites . In the final weeks of the Obama administration , the Army Corps declined to issue the final easement for the pipeline , saying it would conduct an environmental impact statement and would consider rerouting the pipeline . One of Donald Trump 's first actions as president , however , was to order a reversal of the decision and swift approval of the project . Last week , the Corps issued the easement for the Lake Oahe crossing without producing an impact statement . The pipeline now may be just weeks away from completion . The tribes have had little success in their legal attempts to block construction , said Patrick A. Parenteau , a professor at Vermont Law School . But Parenteau said the motion contains the best arguments the tribes have put forward . Now you 're telling me you do n't . The tribes ' best hope may be that the Corps gave no substantive explanation for why it reversed itself , said Keith Benes , a former State Department lawyer who 's now a consultant and a fellow at Columbia University 's Center on Global Energy Policy . On Monday , a federal district judge denied a separate attempt by the Cheyenne River Sioux to grant a temporary restraining order after the tribe argued the pipeline could pollute water that it uses in religious ceremonies . While the judge decided not to halt construction , that case will proceed and the judge said he would rule on the merits of the challenge before oil begins to flow . The pipeline , which is being built by Energy Transfer Partners , has triggered ongoing protests led by tribal groups . While most demonstrators have left the site of the main protest encampment in North Dakota , a few hundred remain . Earlier this month , the Corps told tribal leaders that it would begin clearing the protest site because of safety concerns and the risk of floods . This week , as warm temperatures have prompted rapid snowmelt , state officials warned that flooding could contaminate nearby rivers with garbage and waste that protesters have left behind . On Wednesday , North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum ordered protesters to vacate the federal land by Feb. 22 . The easement being protested would cover a short section of the pipeline , most of which has already been constructed . This week 's filing represents one of the tribe 's last options for blocking the project . A ruling is expected quickly , but could be appealed . D'Angelo said that while he expects the judge to deny the motion , there 's little legal precedent for how and when a new administration can shift course on a decision like this .
