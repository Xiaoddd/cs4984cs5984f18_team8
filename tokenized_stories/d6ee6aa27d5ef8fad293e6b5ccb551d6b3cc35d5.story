Nah . When they came home , we hired someone to help my wife take care of the children . In our minds , she was a babysitter . She did not live with us . She did not spend the night there . She did not cook . She did not clean . She did not educate the children ; she helped my wife with the kids . She just helped take care of three newborns who eventually became three infants and then three toddlers . And , so confusingly , every evening she would leave her job and then , get this , return the next morning . But given his devotion to tax-related causes , this seems unlikely . Unfortunately , we rarely hear about the way under-the-table compensation damages employees as individuals and degrades their profession . A nanny , or any other type of domestic worker , paid under the table is ineligible for Social Security , unemployment insurance , and Medicare benefits . An unofficial status makes them less able to seek recourse for workplace harassment or mistreatment , as well . These are understandable positions to take , considering the high financial burden child care places on families and the low compensation many who do this work must budget their lives around . What would work is making sure everyone has access to affordable and high-quality child care . We need legislation to make this happen , but before that can happen we need those in charge to view care work as legitimate labor . This should be grounds for Congress to vote against his nomination . Sadly , it probably wo n't . Elissa Strauss writes about parenthood for Slate . Follow her on Twitter .
