The Emergency Management Assistance Compact allows for professionals of all types to be deployed to other states , according to a spokesman for the Indiana Department of Homeland Security . When other states seek assistance , officials in Indiana evaluate the request and seek help if possible , the spokesman said . The state making the request must decide whether to accept any assistance Indiana offers and agree to reimburse the cost . A total of 37 police officers from Indiana have been sent to North Dakota , including 11 from several Northwest Indiana departments , the spokesman said . Officials have said Indiana tried to respond to such requests , but the state never knows when it might need assistance in return . Protesters remain The Associated Press reported Saturday protesters were staying near their encampment , following two days of confrontations that resulted in more than a hundred arrests and a barricade of burned-out vehicles blocking a North Dakota highway . A handful of people walked along the highway amid cloudy , chilly weather early Saturday as campfires burned at the nearby camp where hundreds of protesters are staying . About half a dozen law enforcement vehicles were parked along the highway near Cannon Ball , a town about 50 miles south of Bismarck . There was no immediate word on protesters ' plans at the site , but an afternoon rally at the state Capitol in Bismarck was expected to feature landowners and community members encouraging supporters to take action however they can . Hundreds of people attended a similar rally in September . As many as 50 protesters gathered Friday behind heavy plywood sheets and the burned vehicles , facing a line of concrete barriers , military vehicles and police in riot gear . A small group of people , including some observers from Amnesty International , stayed into the evening after protest leaders asked people to return to camp . Standing Rock has waged a protest for months against the nearly 1,200-mile pipeline being developed across four states by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners . The pipeline is slated to carry North Dakota crude oil to a shipping point in Patoka , Illinois . The tribe argues that the pipeline is a threat to water and cultural sites . Protests encampments set up to support of the tribe have grown to thousands of people , with the effort drawing support from Native Americans and other people from around the country , including environmentalists and some celebrities . The protest escalated Sunday when demonstrators set up camp on private land along the pipeline 's path that had recently been acquired by Energy Transfer Partners , The Associated Press reported . On Thursday , more than 140 people were arrested as law enforcement , bolstered by reinforcements from several states , moved in slowly to envelop the protesters . Kirchmeier said tribal representatives were later allowed onto the private property to remove teepees . Officers arrested one person , but no details were released . Following Thursday 's eviction , some protesters worked overnight to create the two roadblocks . The camp cleared on Thursday was located just to the north of a more permanent , larger encampment on federally owned land that has been the main staging area for hundreds of protesters . Many returned to that site Friday to regroup and reunite with others who had been arrested the day before . There were no immediate plans to try to reoccupy the private land or to build a new camp elsewhere in the pipeline 's path , protest camp spokesman Cody Hall said . A federal judge in September denied the tribe 's request to block construction on the grounds that the Army Corps of Engineers improperly issued permits , and North Dakota officials say no culturally significant sites have been found in the area . But on the day the judge ruled , three federal agencies stepped in to order construction to halt on Army Corps-owned land around Lake Oahe , a wide spot of the Missouri River , while the Corps reviewed its decision-making . Meanwhile , construction has been allowed to continue on private land owned by the developer , with a goal of completion by the end of the year .
