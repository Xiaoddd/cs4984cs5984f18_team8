In September , I drove from my home state of Wisconsin to the Standing Rock reservation , land of the Hunkpapa Sioux . There were license plates from almost every state . In the morning air I smelled burning sage , the plant used during Native American spiritual ceremonies . A woman walked by with a shirt that read THIS IS OUR LAND , and a couple of kids on horses trotted past . Someone was giving directions to a communal kitchen and generators were humming nearby . I saw some flags flying upside down , the signal for distress . I could hear Sioux singers and the unmistakable thumping of drums . It sounded like a battle cry . Alexandra Hootnick I left my tent and started to walk around . At the center of camp , makeshift ceremonial grounds had been built , which reminded me of the Ho-Chunk powwows in Wisconsin that my mom used to take my brother , Miles , and me to when we were growing up . But neither my brother nor I remember very much from those trips . We were city kids . Our lives were basketball . Up above the valley where the Standing Rock camp sits , cars were speeding by on Route 1806 , the state highway that leads north toward Bismarck . The pipeline was originally supposed to run through the city , but the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rerouted it , in part because of concerns that it might endanger the local water supply . Just a few miles up the highway , a group of bulldozers were sitting on a hillside , waiting . In the distance , a helicopter flew by . Native leaders told me that the Dakota Access company was surveilling the camp . And then there it was . That familiar bouncing sound , echoing off the dirt . Someone was playing ball . I knew that September was going to be my last opportunity to join the protests before basketball season , and my senior year at Wisconsin , began . My brother , Miles , our good friend Clint Parks and I made the drive from Madison in 14 hours , with the flag of our Ho-Chunk tribe flying from our trailer . It was hard to describe . Way out there on the prairie , far from home , I felt a sense of comfort . As a college basketball player , I felt that it was the best way I could show my support for the protests . One of the greatest things about the game is that wherever you go , you can ball . There was supposed to be only one clinic , indoors at nearby Standing Rock High . I was surprised to find a group of 50 or so kids waiting for me at the outdoor hoop , ready to play . Some wore their hair in long ponytails , in the traditional Native American style . Some were wearing new LeBrons , while others showed up in beat-up old shoes . One kid was wearing a Julius Randle Lakers jersey . I told stories about my Final Four runs with the Badgers . I got asked a lot about the buzzer beater I had hit in the Sweet Sixteen last spring . At the indoor clinic at Standing Rock High , I was overwhelmed by the turnout . The gym was over capacity . The clinic went great , but the thing I remember most happened at the Q and A afterwards . The question really stopped me in my tracks . The drug abuse , the depression , the malnutrition , the suicide rates that are tragically high , above national averages . I felt my voice crack . It was a moment that moved me more than I expected . But I had come to help . Looking out at the kids , I was proud that they were seeing someone succeeding who looked a little like they did . Three years ago , on one of my first days in Madison , a man stopped me in the hall on the way to class . He introduced himself as Don Stanley , a professor of media and digital marketing . Students here know Professor Stanley as a huge Badgers sports fan , but on the day we met he started off by asking me about the Ho-Chunk wellness center in Baraboo , a town an hour east of my hometown of La Crosse . Of course I did . In fact , I had played a few basketball tournaments there when I was growing up . Then he took me by surprise again when he told me that he was member of the Oneida Nation , a tribe from New York , and that he now lives on land that used to be Ho-Chunk land . My knowledge of Ho-Chunk history had some gaps . Professor Stanley told me that in the 1800s , the Ho-Chunk were forcibly relocated from Wisconsin several times by the U.S. government . Years later , a small number of Ho-Chunks resettled in the state but many spread around the country . At Madison , I have sought out as many classes as I could that had to do with Native American issues . The man was a Vietnam veteran who returned from fighting for the U.S. government , only to find out that that same government was laying siege to his reservation . One day last year , our strength-training coach , Erik Helland , who was the trainer for the Chicago Bulls during the Michael Jordan years , told us a story . During a playoff game , Phil Jackson had used Native American imagery to hype up the team . He brought MJ and Scottie and the rest of the team together and had them hold hands . Then Jackson invoked the spirit of the Dog Soldiers , the legendary but little known Cheyenne fighters who were the most feared warriors of their time . The Dog Soldiers were known for their bravery in battle : They would stake out particular piece of land and defend it to the death . Over time , I opened up to Professor Stanley about my struggle to understand my own identity . Being a light-skinned Native American , with a white father and a mother who is Ho-Chunk , I told him how I often felt like a minority within a minority . Not Native enough . Not white enough . Like a stranger in two lands . Alexandra Hootnick After two days in North Dakota , it was time to get back for the start of classes . Driving back to Wisconsin , I remember thinking about Wounded Knee and the Dog Soldiers , and about the long history of my people . That night on the road , I wondered what the future would bring for the Standing Rock Sioux . Many Natives fear that critical supplies for survival , like firewood and food , will be blocked . This has the potential to be a traumatic replay of so much of our history . Then graduation and the NBA draft in the spring . Today , the target may be Standing Rock . Clean water is a precious resource . It belongs to all of us , whatever our heritage . We must all protect it . It was actually the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that made the decision , albeit for the same reasons . There were license plates from almost every state . A woman walked by with a shirt that read THIS IS OUR LAND , and a couple of kids on horses trotted past . Someone was giving directions to a communal kitchen and generators were humming nearby .
