At the time , officials believed the number to be approximately 176,000 gallons ; however , according to state environmental experts , that number is actually closer to 530,000 gallons of oil : approximately three times larger than what was originally believed . Belle Fourche Pipeline is located approximately 150 miles away from Standing Rock , and is owned by True Cos. , a Wyoming-based company that encompasses several other pipelines , as well as oil and drilling businesses . Spokeswoman Wendy Owen explained that once the company was able to start investigating the origin of the leak , they were able to get a better sense of how much oil had actually been spilled . NBC reports that none of the oil has seeped into drinking water , according to Health Department environmental scientist Bill Seuss . He also adds that there have not been any livestock or wildlife deaths that have been confirmed to be related to the oil spill . However , this leak is still hugely significant . As noted by EcoWatch , this is one of the largest spills in North Dakota 's history , and could potentially be the biggest spill in the state to have contaminated a body of water . The piles of snow resulted in the pipeline bending in two places , which caused it to tear . This is not the first time that North Dakota has dealt with the aftermath of an oil spill . In 2013 , a leak in the Tesoro Corp. pipeline caused 840,000 gallons of crude oil to be spilled . To this day , three years and six months later , that spill has still not been fully cleaned . Fears of an oil spill , and thus , contamination of the reservoir , fueled the protests . President Donald Trump 's administration recently greenlit finalization of the project , despite its construction being blocked by President Barack Obama late last year .
