Photograph : Christopher Thomond This article is the subject of a legal complaint by Malaka Shwaikh -LRB- also known as Malaka Mohammad -RRB- . Universities have been accused of undermining freedom of speech on campus after cancelling events organised by students as part of an annual pro-Palestinian event called Israel Apartheid Week -LRB- IAW -RRB- . An event called Quad Under Occupation at University College London was also cancelled because organisers failed to get the necessary approval in time . At Exeter , the Friends of Palestine Society were furious after the university banned students from staging a street theatre performance called Mock Checkpoint , in which some participants were to dress up as Israeli soldiers while others performed the roles of Palestinians . An appeal against the decision was refused . Almost 250 academics , including 100 professors , have signed a letter condemning attempts to silence campus discussion about Israel and its treatment of Palestinians . UK universities urged to tackle rising tide of antisemitism on campus Read more The letter criticises the universities minister , Jo Johnson , who recently wrote to Universities UK , the umbrella organisation for the higher education sector , demanding a crackdown on antisemitism , mentioning Israel Apartheid Week as a cause for concern . Facebook Twitter Pinterest University College London , where an event called Quad Under Occupation was cancelled . Last term , students were pictured wearing T-shirts with handwritten antisemitic and racist slogans at a sports club social event . An investigation was launched into the swastika and Rights for Whites notice at Exeter . Organisers of the Israel Apartheid Week at Exeter claim the university is conflating antisemitism with Palestinian activism . She is already a trustee of the guild which launched an investigation after tweets attributed to her by the Campaign Against Antisemitism -LRB- CAA -RRB- were revealed . Shwaikh has been contacted for comment by the Guardian . All of the tweets cited by the CAA have been deleted . In a statement to the Guardian , Shwaikh , 26 , said she had been subjected to bullying , harassment , threats and serious defamation of character . I should also point out that all of this will no doubt have an effect on my freedom of movement . Threats have already been sent to my family back home . She said the February 2013 tweets were not her words but the result of a hack and she removed the messages as soon as she saw them . Antisemitism is not tolerated . Even one incident of discrimination , racism , or harassment is one too many . Facebook Twitter Pinterest The University of Central Lancashire said it was working with students to enable such events to take place . A later statement to the Guardian said the event had not been referred to the authorities in a timely way and therefore could not go ahead . Ben Jamal , the director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign , said there had been coordinated attempts by pro-Israel lobby groups to pressurise universities into cancelling events as part of efforts to suppress activism for Palestinian human rights . This should have said UCLan . We also said Jo Johnson recently wrote to UK Universities . This should have said Universities UK . These errors have been corrected .
