LAUREN DONOVAN , TRIBUNE Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save This is Up and Down , where we give a brief thumbs up and thumbs down on the issues from the past week . Up Edwin Benson , 85 , died this month and many fear the Mandan language could die without him . Benson , Twin Buttes , was the last fluent speaker of Mandan . Benson devoted much of his life teaching the language to others . It was a responsibility he took seriously . Friends say being the only fluent Mandan speaker created a lonely situation for Benson and at times it was a burden . However , he continued to work hard to maintain the language . Down One of the staples of the Christmas season has been a program where law enforcement officers in Burleigh and Morton counties take disadvantaged children shopping and to a meal . Instead , the children will be given gifts . The officers changed the program because they fear Dakota Access Pipeline protesters might interfere and they are worried about the safety of the children . Up Jackie Buckley has spent 37 years serving the North Dakota State University Extension Service . The Tribune relied on her for advice and comments on everything from calving , the different threats posed by bad weather , crop conditions , FFA and 4-H events . She always seemed to have the answers . The good news , she still plans to coach the 4-H livestock judging team and help with the Morton County Fair . Buckley has worked with the children of the children she first instructed . The program provides wreaths to be placed on graves at the North Dakota Veterans Cemetery . First , an abbreviated program was planned because of the cold weather . Hopefully , the new date will fall on a warmer day and the full program can be restored . Up Those who have property at Lake Tschida received good news . Congress has passed legislation that allows them to stay at their lake homes and trailers after 2021 . The Bureau of Reclamation decided after the flood of 2009 that only recreational vehicles would be allowed on the lots after 2021 . Many families have enjoyed the lake as a getaway and developed their homes over the years . They were worried that they would have to dismantle all their work . The Justice Department says sending officers might escalate the situation . North Dakota law enforcement agencies sent a letter to President Barack Obama basically begging for help . They have been turned down . North Dakota has been left to deal with the protests and instead of federal help they get federal criticism . The federal government needs to step up and provide law enforcement assistance and help pay some of the bills . This can be removed when origin is fixed .
