Anibal Ortiz , Gazette-Times Buy Now Linda Richards , nonviolence trainer , speaks to a group about non-violent practices for protestors inside Westminster House in Corvallis on Friday , February 17 , 2017 . The local protest , billed as part of a nationwide general strike coordinated through Strike4Democracy , encouraged local residents and the city of Corvallis to divest funds from Wells Fargo Bank , which is one of several banks that provide financing to the group building the pipeline . The Corvallis City Council voted in October to approve a resolution in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline in front of a standing-room-only crowd . The protest began with a meeting on general strikes at the Westminster House , where participants were encouraged to demonstrate during a general strike by not working , not attending school and participating in nonviolent protests . Co-organizer Andrew Barton of ASAP said he hoped people would see the march and realize they are not alone in their frustrations .
