Left untreated , paraffin build-up can drastically decrease the efficiency of the entire oil recovery and transfer system including flow lines , pipes , tubing and of course the oil well itself . Whilst these build-ups can become serious enough to cause complete failure of the oil recovery system , fortunately paraffin wax fouling can be relatively easy to remove . Oil wells that suffer from wax problems are , in fact , usually experiencing other fouling as well . Almost any heavy organic deposit encountered in oil extraction is referred to as paraffin or wax . While paraffins are usually the major component in these deposits , it is most often actually a mixture of paraffins and asphaltenes . That is why it is important that any solvent used to remove these deposits is effective at removing more than just paraffin . Many chemical treatments for paraffin in use today require heat in order to be most effective . The application of heat into the system requires additional equipment , energy usage and expense so it is preferable to find a solvent effective at low temperatures . The final and most important consideration when selecting the best paraffin removal chemical is safety . Many chemical treatments require the use of caustic reagents which are hazardous to workers and can damage equipment . Many solvent based treatments contain toxic chemicals which increase risks to human health and the environment .
