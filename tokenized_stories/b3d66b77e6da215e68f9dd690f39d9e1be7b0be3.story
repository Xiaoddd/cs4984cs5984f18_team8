Usually that amounts to how heavy we want it , how much UV it sheds , and how water tight we want it . The price varies accordingly and buyers will look for the best price for those stats . That is how I decided on this tarp to cover my sailboat . That said , when I receive the tarp it should be what the description said it is supposed to be . What I do n't expect is to find grommet holes punched through rope around the seam and grommets mounted in multiple holes in the same area . That is the quality of tarp that I received . Several holes that should not have been in the tarp . Bottom Line :-LRB- Others have said the same thing so if your looking for good quality look elsewhere and pay a couple more dollars for it . February 21 , 2012 Size Name : 10 Feet x 20 Feet Verified Purchase I purchased this tarp less than 18 months ago . It has completely rotted and is hanging in shreds . Other tarps I have bought have not even come close to deteriorating this fast . Things should not rot this fast . Puts new meaning to built-in obsolescence . Give me a break ... Check out the photo I posted for this product . They should be on the right side of your screen . If you keep it out of the sun and elements it might work . Do n't be fooled by thinking you can save a few bucks . This product is only temporary at best . One star is 2 stars too many . I use it mounted horizontally -LRB- like a roof -RRB- on a wooden frame and secured in the center with furring strips , to prevent it from flapping in the wind . Installed October 2015 and it began developing small slits a few weeks ago . The slits have now grown to gaping holes making it ineffective , so it lasted a total of about 9 months . Price seems to fluctuate , but this tarp usually goes for around 30 bucks . If it lasts twice as long , that means I 'll have to take down the old one and put up a new one every 18 months instead of every 9 months , which is definitely worth the additional cost . It worked okay for the 9 months it survived , but if you are exposing this tarp to harsh conditions do n't expect it to last very long . For occasional use as an underlayment for a tent , for example , it would probably last for several seasons of use . The south Florida sun is absolutely brutal , even in the winter months . If you live farther north I suspect constant exposure to freezing temps and snow would have similar effects .

It took three hours for 3.5 feet of the back of the tarp to fray off and 7 large holes to wear down in the center . The material was cheap and thin . I have never had such issues with tarp before . I will stick to buying my tarps in store where i can feel the quality of them . the last tarp i bought before this lasted me 4 years and this one did n't even make 4 hours .

December 5 , 2016 Size Name : 10 Feet x 12 Feet Verified Purchase A pretty good design with the more heat reflective color -LRB- light gray -RRB- on one side and the more earthy color brown on the other side . The grommets are off-center by about 10 inches in the lean-too orientation along ends of the ridgeline , which makes the hanging tarp asymmetrical -LRB- not what I had anticipate or hoped for -RRB- . No clue why they did not space the grommets so that if you wanted to hang the tarp on the centerline between grommets , one panel would be equidistant on both sides of the center . The grommets are also pulling loose from the fabric along the ridgeline . The corners look adequately reinforced but not the grommets along the flats of the tarp edges . The material looks sturdy enough so I am guessing that the grommets were not closed with a enough force to prevent the fabric from pulling out from in between where the grommet halves come together during installation . If you purchase this tarp , do your due diligence in testing it while you have time to return it , in the event the grommets pull loose from the tarp fabric .

July 31 , 2017 Size Name : 20 Feet x 20 Feet Verified Purchase Tarps are going to fall apart . At least that 's been my experience . They are n't really substitutes for permanent shelter so this should n't be considered as such . keeping that in mind I have been relatively happy with this product . It also provided an immense boost in terms of insulation when trying to camp in freezing temperatures . It does a pretty good job of accomplishing those things , but It 's been up for about 9 months now and it 's definitely on it 's last leg . Wearing through in a couple places and getting brittle on the parts that get pounded by the sun . For 40ish bucks , I think it was well worth it . I might look into a more expensive canvas option in the future , but this was good for the first year . After noticing leaks inside I pulled the tarp back to find several areas that water had leaked in .

This one did not by any means . Was using it to cover things up in my backyard and there is already 2 huge holes in it . The tarp only last about 1 year if that . When something is marked X for best , I would expect it to last longer . i rated it at 5 starts only because it has no imperfections on first inspection and has UV ...
