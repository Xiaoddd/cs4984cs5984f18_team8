Share story By Lynda V. Mapes Seattle Times environment reporter Twenty-eight tribal leaders in Washington state have written President Obama insisting he stop and reroute the Dakota Access Pipeline after a night of violence in North Dakota in which police used fire hoses , rubber bullets and tear gas against pipeline protesters . Tribal leaders also said they were outraged at the tactics used by police against demonstrators , especially fire hoses used to soak demonstrators in subfreezing weather . In a report issued Monday , medical personnel at Standing Rock said 300 people were injured during the violence , including 26 people with more severe injuries taken to three area hospitals . The injuries included blunt-force trauma , eye injuries , internal bleeding and lacerations from rubber bullets and concussion grenades ; hypothermia ; loss of consciousness ; grand mal seizures , and fractures , according to the medics . Law-enforcement officials defended their tactics Monday . Police have arrested a total of 528 people since last August . The Standing Rock Sioux say the risk of a pipeline spill threatens their drinking-water source and those of many others downstream on the Missouri River . Yakama tribal member Marshall Lee , a 38-year-old father of two , has been at the Standing Rock camp since last August . Washington tribes have rallied to the cause of that Standing Rock even as they fight their own fossil fuel battles back home . Lee recorded the violence that unfolded Sunday night and posted live on Facebook for hours as demonstrators sought to open a blockaded bridge while police used tear gas and fires hoses to force them back . There were a lot of people getting hurt . I saw people standing together in prayer , getting sprayed by the water cannon . I saw people getting carried out on ATVs to medics . Washington state tribal letters wrote in their letter that as violence escalates and winter bears down on protesters camped near the Missouri River , it is time for Obama to step in . In their letter , Washington state tribal leaders said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers should deny the last easement needed by Energy Transfer Partners of Dallas to complete the more than 1,110 mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline . The Corps told the company last week it needs more time to study concerns raised by the Standing Rock Sioux before deciding whether or not to grant the easement . Dakota Access quickly sued in federal court , seeking a court order to declare that it already has the access it needs to finish the pipeline . That suit , and a suit by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to stop the pipeline , are both pending . The highway has been closed since an outburst of violence on a bridge on the highway in October .
