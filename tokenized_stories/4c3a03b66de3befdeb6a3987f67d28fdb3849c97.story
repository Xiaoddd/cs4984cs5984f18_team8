The Argentinian security minister , Patricia Bullrich , said the 389 kilos -LRB- 860 pounds -RRB- of cocaine were hidden inside luggage seized in December 2016 . The Russian-Argentines Alexander Chikalo , who is suspected of being in charge of the logistics , and Ivan Blizniouk , a police officer accused of providing contacts to jump through customs controls , were arrested on Wednesday . The investigation began after Victor Koronelli , the Russian ambassador to Argentina , and three members of the Russian federal security service told Bullrich of their suspicions about the diplomatic luggage found at a school annexed to the embassy . After authorities confirmed that there were drugs inside the 16 pieces of luggage , they devised a plan to catch the criminals , swapping the cocaine for flour and placing a GPS to track the luggage . The luggage was flown to Russia in 2017 . Bullrich said three Argentine customs officials journeyed to Russia to monitor the delivery , and that two men , Ishtimir Khudzhmov and Vladimir Kalmykov , were arrested when they went to collect the cargo . A suspect , whom Bullrich referred to only as K , was in charge of buying the drug and introducing it to the embassy in Argentina . He is still at large in Germany and is wanted under an international arrest warrant . The logistics were also coordinated by a former embassy official , Ali Abyanov , who was arrested in his Moscow apartment .
