My idealism did not prepare me for that experience Julian Brave NoiseCat I grew up believing that getting arrested for protesting was a rite of passage . The election of Donald Trump and the rise of rightwing populism have obliterated the facade of tolerance and equality , revealing the hateful face of the far right . Ahead lie political possibilities both promising and ominous . Among the marchers there is a small but growing community of refuseniks who consider civil disobedience and arrest as potential and even essential actions to further these diverse causes . I am among them . On a chilly Tuesday night two weeks after the election , I hustled up the street from my fellowship at the New York City housing department to join 1,500 demonstrators gathered in Foley Square as part of a national day of action to protest the Dakota Access pipeline . The police surrounded us . An automated announcement warned us that we faced imminent arrest if we refused to move . Our voices grew louder to drown out the machine . I was one of the last peeled from the pavement , handcuffed and escorted into the back of a paddy wagon . As a child , I valorized indigenous leaders such as Crazy Horse , Chief Joseph , Geronimo and others who fought to the bitter end for the just treatment and very survival of their people . As a young man in Oakland , I listened to older generations recount memories of the occupation of Alcatraz , the United Farmworkers grape boycott and the black freedom struggle . Hundreds of students more woke than I walked out of my high school after the extrajudicial execution of Oscar Grant . I came of age as millions of Americans lost their homes to gamblers on Wall Street . I felt the pain of loved ones lost to the despair of addiction . Professors , peers and books gave me the framework and vocabulary to speak to these deeply rooted injustices . As I entered the workforce and electorate in the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the history of the world , these realities felt increasingly outrageous and unacceptable to me . Marching up the street from my day job , I imagined generations of indigenous ancestors at my back . On that day , we had had enough . In the paddy wagon with my arms zip-tied tight behind my back , I felt guilt , regret and fear . My body was no longer my own . My time belonged to someone else . My mother was worried half to death . My future job prospects were diminished . I , an Ivy League graduate , now had assumed the guise of yet another young man of color with a criminal record . Very real consequences descended from abstraction into the land of hard facts . Down here they felt heavy . Inside One Police Plaza , the police shuffled us through the glacial bureaucracy of arrest intake : hand over your valuables . Give us your address . Take off your belt . Untie your shoelaces . Stand for your mug shot . Remove your necktie . Wait . No talking . Wait . With a dozen caged in each cell , we watched our arresting officers laugh about the latest viral videos on Facebook and Snapchat their love interests . Hours passed . The officers milled about , intermittently completing the forms that detailed our intransigence . More hours passed . Then two . Around 3 am , an officer pulled open our cell door and announced two names for release . Every 10 minutes he returned to spring a new pair of bondsmen . The cell felt increasingly austere as it emptied . My girlfriend , who faithfully waited up all night on the street outside the jail for my release , was exhausted and annoyed . she asked . I mustered a zealous response full of youthful conviction . But deep down , I was asking myself the same thing . Every morning , defendants and their families line up outside its doors 30 minutes before court opens session . At 9 am , security fires up the x-ray machines and metal detectors and the line slowly processes into the building . On the other side of the metal detectors , throngs of defendants , paper summons in hand , rush to and fro in search of their assigned lawyers and allotted courtrooms . We tracked down our defense attorney , Ronald Kuby , a former radio host with a silver ponytail , and headed for court room 130 . We took our seats on benches laid out in orderly rows like so many pews facing the judge . We were instructed to remove our winter hats and turn off our cellphones . We checked the spelling of our names on forms descended from those completed by our pizza-eating jailors , and waited in timid , contemplative silence . The judge emerged from her chambers in regal black robes . An officer fetched an inmate from a holding cell to her right . He faced charges of possessing crack cocaine . He was homeless . The public defender asked for time served . The assistant district attorney , a tall , slender white man in an ill-fitting gray suit described the defendant as a dangerous repeat offender . More men of color were paraded before the bench for their charges to be recited and their punishment to be determined . Most took plea bargains for misdemeanors . I rubbed my fingers across the rubbery remnants of bubblegum stuck beneath my seat . Court , I mused , is like church . Soon it was our turn . The judge called the protesters forward in groups of three to render our anticlimactic judgment : adjournment in contemplation of dismissal . The arrest would be wiped from our records if we stayed out of trouble for a year . That is , except for my case , which required special handling . I needed a clean record sooner so that I could apply to jobs and graduate schools without having to check the box . In exchange for expedited adjournment , the judge ordered community service . So , I had to return a week later , hustle up and down the stairs between clerk windows and courtrooms to track down the forms required to sign up for and complete my service hours . I pleaded with scowling court officers and bureaucrats for nearly two hours . Finally , a friendly bailiff delivered me to a hidden back office where I gave my name and docket number to an administrator in return for the necessary but elusive forms which emerged from an obscure file on a sprawling shelf . Proudly brandishing my form like a diploma , I marched down to the community service desk and signed up for the first available Saturday slot . It was a cold and snowy January morning . From 7.30 am to 3.30 pm , our official task was to pick up trash . This turned out to be easy . Located smack in the middle of designer-dog-and-juice-cleanse land in the West Village , Washington Square Park is perhaps the cleanest public space in all of New York City . Trash duty was not the real reason the court wanted us out here at 7.30 in the morning . But before long , we transgressors became friends . One by one , each divulged the crime that had landed us in community service . We wondered aloud whether the park supervisor was watching from the heated lodge and whether he gave a damn about our service . We took long breaks to run our ice-cold mittens under the hand dryer in the public restroom . Coffee break rolled around . And then lunch . By afternoon , our punishment felt more like the Breakfast Club than a chain gang . Around 3.30 he emerged to collect our equipment and sign our forms . With a quick scribble of pen on paper , my service was complete . Martin Luther King Jr , Ho Chi Minh , Vaclav Havel , Fidel Castro , Mohandas Gandhi , Nelson Mandela and countless other radicals were arrested and imprisoned then came out the other side even more powerful intellectuals and revolutionary leaders . But after my short time in handcuffs , behind bars , through the slow churn of courtroom bureaucracy and the disciplining labor of community service , I was telling myself to think and plan more deliberately before staring down the police and defying the law again . My experience was but a thin shadow of the harrowing struggles of the water protectors at Standing Rock . But any arrest comes with real consequences for your career , your wallet and your relationships . In trying times like these though , it seems inexcusable to do nothing .
