What began as a legal battle to halt construction has grown into an international movement headquartered on an 80-acre campground in Cannon Ball , North Dakota . Without a guarantee that the pipeline will be halted , the community plans to remain permanently , even with winter approaching . North Dakota became an epicenter of the recent United States oil boom after drillers began using relatively new fracking techniques to extract oil from the region in the late 2000s . Lacking any infrastructure to transport the oil , drillers proposed the Dakota Access Pipeline , which will carry more than 20 million gallons of crude oil daily from the Bakken region of North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa before connecting to an existing pipeline in Illinois . Pipelines are not without risks . Since 2010 , over 3,300 incidents of crude oil and liquefied natural gas leaks or ruptures have occurred on U.S. pipelines . They also released toxic , polluting chemicals in local soil , waterways , and air . Over 1,000 of these incidents occurred on pipelines carrying crude oil . However , in an SEC filing from earlier this year , oil from the pipeline is now slated for export . This reversal comes on the heels of the December 2015 Congressional agreement to lift the 40-year ban on exporting domestically produced oil . Situated in the Black Hills of North and South Dakota and along the Missouri River , the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation is the sixth-largest reservation in the U.S. by land area -LRB- 3,600 square miles -RRB- , with a population of 8,000 . The pipeline is being constructed by Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- ETP -RRB- and Houston-based investors Enbridge Energy Partners . From 1999 to 2010 , Enbridge was responsible for 804 oil spills , dumping 5 million gallons of oil into the environment , including the largest onshore oil spill in U.S. history . The tribe believes the Corps failed to conduct thorough cultural and historical reviews before granting federal approvals for construction . Here , the population is 75 percent American Indian , with an average per capita income 65 percent below the national average . Although the pipeline route does not directly cross the reservation , the tribe is voicing concerns about potential damage to recently discovered burial sites on land that has been taken away unjustly over the past 150 years . The pipeline also poses environmental risks , such as drinking water contamination in Lake Oahe and the Missouri River . The Missouri River is the longest river in the U.S. and forms the fourth-largest river system in the world . This effort started with only a few people and has grown into a global movement . with your friends and family and help spread the word . For the administration of funds , UpToUs has partnered with All It Takes and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . We also believe it 's a moral responsibility for businesses to actively help create a sustainable and socially equitable world that accounts for people , profits , and our planet . In solidarity , we 've donated a semi-truck of food and are helping organize this campaign with friends and partners .
