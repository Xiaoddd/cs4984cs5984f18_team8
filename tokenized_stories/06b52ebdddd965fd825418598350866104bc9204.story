Impeachment relates to the removal of a Government official due to crimes committed while that individual was in office . All civil Officers of the United States that are tried and convicted for crimes such as bribery , treason , misdemeanors , and high crimes are all subject to impeachment . It is important to note that impeachment is a power that is granted to both Houses of Congress . The House of Representatives is responsible to commence the impeachment proceedings . A member of the House can start the procedure by listing the charges against the official under oath or by asking for a referral to the appropriate committee of the House . In some cases , the impeachment process can begin by other officials outside of the Legislative Branch . However , the process to impeach will be carried out by the House of Representatives . Depending on the type of impeachment , the referral will be presented to either the House Committee on the Judiciary or the House Committee on Rules . If the impeachment resolution involves a particular individual , the referral will be presented to the House Committee on the Judiciary . However , if the resolution is to authorize an investigation regarding grounds for impeachment , it must first be referred to the House Committee on Rules , which will then be sent to the House Committee on the Judiciary . When the referral to impeach is received by the Judiciary Committee , a vote must be conducted . A majority decision must be reached to determine that grounds for impeachment exist . The Committee will then state and list those grounds in what is known as Articles of Impeachment , or an Impeachment Resolution . These are to be reported to the House of Representatives . The House of Representatives will then review and analyze the Articles of Impeachment . The House will vote on the Articles based as a whole or on each article presented therein , depending on the conclusion of the analysis . If the decision of the House is to impeach , then there are managers that are appointed to present the situation and case to the Senate . The managers have the responsibility of presenting the Articles of Impeachment before the Senate , which will then report back to the Senate regarding its own decision . In the case that the Senate decides that it will try an impeachment case , the Chief Justice of the United States is to preside over the trial in the case of impeachment of a President . Throughout history , there have been a number of Government officials who have been impeached , which include Presidents , members of Congress , Judges , as well as State Governors . However , in the history of the United States , only two Presidents have been impeached , Andrew Jackson and Bill Clinton . Richard Nixon would have faced impeachment had he stayed in office , but resigned his position upon the knowledge of impending impeachment .
