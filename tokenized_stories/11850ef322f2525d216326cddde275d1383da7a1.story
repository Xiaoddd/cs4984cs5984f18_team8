Nearly seven decades on , the predicament that mixes faith , law , and sociology is returning to haunt the politics of a changing State of Israel . In one case , Shabbat shook the system to its foundation . Ironically , the F-15s case was not typical , as there was no need to land the planes on a Friday . The typical case is about objective necessities . Ultimately , then-prime minister Ehud Barak ruled that since such shipments had been done on Saturdays for decades , the turbine would travel on Saturday , but that auxiliary parts which could be delivered separately would be trucked midweek . The ancient Jewish states faced no dilemmas concerning the delivery on Shabbat of electricity , water , public transport or highway safety . He suggested a sweeping rabbinical statement making this distinction . No Orthodox rabbi for now has followed this advice . Israeli law , however , has gone a long way toward Orthodox writ . And this legislation is at the crux of the current political brouhaha . At the same time , the law lists industries and services in which employers are allowed to assign work on Shabbat , ranging from security and hospitals to fire fighting and public order . That would have been the end of the affair , had it really been about legalisms . What matters to them is that their routine was disrupted by religious politicians , to whom the government surrendered . The large number of soldiers in the jams carries political weight that the ultra-Orthodox parties can ignore , but Netanyahu can not . It was a social transition that produced political cataclysm . The social wild card in all this is the post-Soviet immigration , a good one million people who are almost all secular . This electorate , which back in 1992 helped restore Rabin to power , eventually abandoned Labor in the wake of the second intifada , which it associated with the Labor-designed Oslo Accords . It is this electorate to which the Likud owes its current political hegemony . It is also the electorate that frequently feels humiliated and hassled by the Chief Rabbinate when it comes to getting married , divorcing or converting .
