Rob Cotton Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and other Senate Democrats found out that supporters of Bernie Sanders are not going away now that the election is over after 13 Democrat senators failed to vote in favor of an amendment proposed by Sanders to the 2017 congressional budget allowing the importation of prescription drugs from Canada to help reduce prescription drug costs for Americans . If the Democratic Party had expectations that Sanders supporters were going to simply jump on the anti-Trump bandwagon and fall in line behind Democrats regardless of their deeds , that thought was readily dismissed when Bernie supporters took to social media to criticize Booker and the others over their votes . The morning after the vote late Wednesday night , Bernie supporters on Facebook and Twitter were collectively focused on pointed attacks against Booker and the other senate Democrats who voted against the amendment : Maria Cantwell of Washington , Thomas Carper of Delaware , Robert Casey of Pennsylvania , Christopher Coons of Delaware , Joe Donnelly of Indiana , Martin Heinrich of New Mexico , Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota , Robert Menendez of New Jersey , Patty Murray of Washington , Jon Tester of Montana , Michael Bennett of Colorado , and Mark Warner of Virginia . Number three recipient . If Democrats want to win , maybe they should stop grandstanding when the cameras on and voting with the most GOP when nobody is looking . They need those Bernie voters to win future elections and the bad publicity that comes from defying the wishes of a highly active and engaged group of voters is anathema to any politician with ambitions beyond retiring after their current term . According to Paste Magazine , Berniecrats , as many Sanders supporters call themselves , took 44 out of 80 executive boards in the California ADEMs , winning 618 out of 1120 seats . This determines who gets to attend the state conventions in 2017 and 2018 and in many ways sets the tone for the future of the Democratic Party in California . And for those familiar with the trajectory of medical marijuana or garlic fries in the United States , what begins in California often has a way of spreading out over the entire country .
