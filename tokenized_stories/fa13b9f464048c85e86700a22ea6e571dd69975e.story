A Pipeline Battle Looms in Oregon By Don Gentry and Emma Marris March 8 , 2018 Image Water not diverted by dams flows back into the Klamath River near Keno , Ore. . Several dams are scheduled to be removed in 2020 , but a proposed pipeline has raised fears that construction and leaks could threaten a revitalized river . For millenniums , the Klamath , Modoc and Yahooskin Band of Snake Indians fished salmon from the lake and the river . After dams were built on the river starting in 1912 , the salmon were blocked . The Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline would run 229 miles from Malin to Coos Bay , Ore. , crossing underneath the Klamath River near the city of Klamath Falls . It would extend , via interconnections , the Ruby Pipeline , carrying natural gas from Wyoming to a huge planned storage and export terminal for sales to countries in the Pacific Rim . The company behind the pipeline , Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline LP , and the export terminal , Jordan Cove Energy Project LP , are both owned by the Pembina Pipeline Corporation , based in Calgary , Alberta . Now the companies are trying again , though the commission said they had failed to show there was market demand for the project . Image A protest in 2016 against Jordan Cove LNG and its plan to build the Pacific Connector natural gas pipeline in Oregon . If the pipeline gets built , the initial construction jobs will disappear as soon as it is done . As far as the Klamath people are concerned , this pipeline is a bad idea even if the price of gas were predicted to skyrocket . The Klamath people oppose this project because it puts at risk their watersheds , forests , bays , culture , spiritual places , homes , climate and future . If the pipeline catches fire or leaks , the Klamath River and its fish will be put at risk . The track record of fossil fuel pipelines suggests such a calamity is only a matter of time . Though natural gas generates lower greenhouse gas emissions than coal , it is still a fossil fuel . Leaks during extraction , transport and burning of gas all contribute to climate change . Notably , several state agencies do have the power to deny permits and stop the pipeline from being built . The Klamath Tribes , along with the Yurok and Karuk , hundreds of landowners , conservation groups , and concerned citizens , have registered as intervenors to have legal standing to dispute this pipeline . Just as the tribes along the river shared the salmon in the old days , those tribes will work together to protect their shared river today . As long as this proposal hangs over the river , the Klamath will stand in fierce , firm and unwavering opposition .
