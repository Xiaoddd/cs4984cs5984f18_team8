In March of that year , in an effort to register black voters in the South , protesters marching the 54-mile route from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery were confronted with deadly violence from local authorities and white vigilante groups . Voter Registration Efforts In Alabama Even after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbade discrimination in voting on the basis of race , efforts by civil rights organizations such as the Southern Christian Leadership Council -LRB- SCLC -RRB- and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee -LRB- SNCC -RRB- to register black voters met with fierce resistance in southern states such as Alabama . Visit Website In early 1965 , Martin Luther King , Jr. and SCLC decided to make Selma , located in Dallas County , Alabama , the focus of a black voter registration campaign . King had won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 , and his profile would help draw international attention to the events that followed . Visit Website Alabama Governor George Wallace was a notorious opponent of desegregation , and the local county sheriff in Dallas County had led a steadfast opposition to black voter registration drives . Ralph Bunche , who participated in the Selma to Montgomery March with Martin Luther King , Jr. , won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950 for his successful negotiation of an Arab-Israeli truce in Palestine a year earlier . Edmund Pettis Bridge On February 18 , white segregationists attacked a group of peaceful demonstrators in the town of Marion , Alabama . In the ensuing chaos , an Alabama state trooper fatally shot Jimmie Lee Jackson , a young African-American demonstrator . A group of 600 people , including activists John Lewis and Hosea Williams , set out from Selma on Sunday , March 7 . The brutal scene was captured on television , enraging many Americans and drawing civil rights and religious leaders of all faiths to Selma in protest . Hundreds of ministers , priests , rabbis and social activists soon headed to Selma to join the voting rights march . A Historic March Continues On March 9 , King led more than 2,000 marchers , black and white , across the Edmund Pettus Bridge but found Highway 80 blocked again by state troopers . King paused the marchers and led them in prayer , whereupon the troopers stepped aside . King then turned the protesters around , believing that the troopers were trying to create an opportunity that would allow them to enforce a federal injunction prohibiting the march . This decision led to criticism from some marchers , who called King cowardly . That night , a group of segregationists attacked another protester , the young white minister James Reeb , beating him to death . Alabama state officials -LRB- led by Wallace -RRB- tried to prevent the march from going forward , but a U.S. district court judge ordered them to permit it . LBJ Addresses Nation Six days later , on March 15 , President Lyndon B. Johnson went on national television to pledge his support to the Selma protesters and to call for the passage of a new voting rights bill that he was introducing in Congress . There is no Southern problem . There is no Northern problem . Because it is not just Negros , but really it is all of us , who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice . Some 2,000 people set out from Selma on March 21 , protected by U.S. Army troops and Alabama National Guard forces that Johnson had ordered under federal control . After walking some 12 hours a day and sleeping in fields along the way , they reached Montgomery on March 25 . Lasting Impact of the March On March 17 , 1965 , even as the Selma-to-Montgomery marchers fought for the right to carry out their protest , President Lyndon Johnson addressed a joint session of Congress , calling for federal voting rights legislation to protect African Americans from barriers that prevented them from voting . That August , Congress passed the Voting Rights Act , which guaranteed the right to vote -LRB- first awarded by the 15th Amendment -RRB- to all African Americans . Specifically , the act banned literacy tests as a requirement for voting , mandated federal oversight of voter registration in areas where tests had previously been used , and gave the U.S. attorney general the duty of challenging the use of poll taxes for state and local elections . Along with the Civil Rights Act , the Voting Rights Act was one of the most expansive pieces of civil rights legislation in American history . It greatly reduced the disparity between black and white voters in the U.S. and allowed greater numbers of African Americans to participate in politics and government at the local , state and national level .
