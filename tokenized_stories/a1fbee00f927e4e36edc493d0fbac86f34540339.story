Source : CNN Veterans Stand for Standing Rock The leaders of this effort are Michael A. Wood Jr. and Wesley Clark Jr. . Curious as to the background and capabilities of Michael A. Wood Jr. and Wesley Clark Jr. , I reviewed their background and some of the other initiatives they have supported . Mr. Wood was a member of the USMC and a Baltimore City Police Officer . He started seeking media attention in conjunction with the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore . He takes a hard-stance against his former colleagues at the Baltimore Police Department in numerous interviews with the press and became a minor celebrity in Baltimore with his timely allegations of police wrong doing . Your job is to fight crime , and these are the guys you do it with . This is the culture . He clearly admits that he did nothing to address his concerns while employed by the BPD and spent 11 years being part of the perceived problem . I especially would not be part of an operation that has declared that it will engage the local Sheriff and the U.S. Government as the opposition and the enemies of the people . I also find their support of numerous George Soros sponsored Globalist agenda items -LRB- global warming , gun confiscation , federalized control of police , etc. -RRB- suspect . Certainly most Oath Keepers would oppose the positions of that these individuals have taken with regard to the Bill of Rights , especially with regard to the 2nd Amendment . Lofty goals like saving the planet from climate change provide insight to these individuals thinking and politics . My personal opinion is that they are self-promoting grand standers that wait for a cause to help them promote themselves and then jump in . I scoured their writings and social media activity for any mention of the Dakota Access Pipeline BEFORE it became a media sensation and found nothing . The North Dakota veterans said even being in the area is adding to the conflict that exists and that goes against what they took their oaths for . Conclusion Follow these young men out the Standing Rock at your own risk . Based on their history , I can not imagine their efforts will improve the situation for either the Standing Rock Sioux or the people of North Dakota . 0 Navy Jack During my service I deployed on various platforms , including submarines , amphibious assault units and special boats . I participated in expeditionary and humanitarian missions to the North Atlantic , Iran , Beirut , Libya , and the Caribbean . I am a Patron Life Member of the NRA . I am an Oath Keeper Life Member . Protesting is one thing , but I take issue with his deliberate attempt at tarnishing the image of veterans , his waffling on what it is to keep his oath , and his promoting the falsehood in a connection between big oil and the climate . The hypocrisy floods from his mouth and his actions . RussL says : December 3 , 2016 at 1:17 pm His conflicted ideology is likely due to some girl he likes . Anyone choosing to be lead by this foolish young man , have tough life lessons ahead . The way people stood together , forcing Bureau of Land Management to retreat , was a great inspiration for those of us who love liberty and the Constitution . We who love liberty share a common problem with those on the left . But what each side sees as the solution could not be more diametrically opposed . The tribe completely failed to come to the table and negotiate or even discuss ANY alternative plans prior to construction , even though they were repeatedly given opportunities to do so . Had they been fighting this all along , it would have been one thing . By the time the first gallon of oil flows down the pipeline , that water intake will be shut down . So I have a hard time supporting the cause overall , let alone these two fools . Your concerns about the one-sided nature of the MSM coverage is accurate . We will be telling the rest of the story . It is more than we envisioned when we began investigating it . Having said this , he may be one of those rare opportunities to reach across aisles and find some common ground to work upon . I suspect there is more than grandstanding going on here . The whole idea of an unarmed resistance is quite comical to me personally . They are at a great tactical disadvantage and strategically inept . As someone on the Southern Border , it is of great importance to me to see this resistance stopped ASAP . I joined OK 2009 hoping that there was finally a group of people who would follow the rule of law , including Niitsitaapii natural , inherent rights to the land Creator gave us . Reparations have and should continue to be considered for these transgressions . It seems that OK adheres to the narrative that when in doubt blame Soros and than we do not have to look at the full spectrum of factors and conditions that need to come together to create a certain situation . Time to be sincere and acknowledge the legitimate grievances of other segments of the population . I have stated that many times . I also do not doubt the sincerity of most of the protesters at Standing Rock . The issue is the false narrative that generates the extreme emotions leading to violence . The issue is the instigators of violence imported to what always starts as a peaceful protest . I have thoroughly referenced this article . I have used their articles , statement and their published plans . The conclusions are accurate . Jeru says : December 4 , 2016 at 12:30 pm You have referenced the article with pieces that support a particular narrative and adhere to a particular agenda . That is not that hard to do in an situation where elitist corporatist entities are waging an all out offensive of false information to create a division in the citizenry . The globalist agenda is not that of the civil rights and environmental protection groups that you try to demonize as being mere Soros fronts . The globalist agenda is in essence that of the fossil fuel industry and the Wall Street banks that finance this pipeline . This is the power structure of the oligarchic corporatocracy that is the thriving force behind the disappearance of the American working class , the decline of the middle class and are the instigators of regime changes and foreign wars . All these oligarchs have the same agenda and you are misled if you do not see this is a class struggle of the wealthy elites against the rest of the population . The population have legitimate grievances but are being divided along lines of identity politics and so are people in the law enforcement and the military . All of the references regarding the use of Standing Rock and initiatives like this as a weapon against the future President also came from the promoters of the Standing Rock occupation and their parent organization . You have no argument . I will simplify this . Both of these premises are untrue . Both of these premises originated with Indigenous Rising Media . Without these two false narratives , this protest would have never attracted the participation of thousands . Without these two premises , the tribe has no legal standing or arguable case . This has already been through the courts . The answer is to use this protest as a prototype for future stands against what they see as an intolerable President . These are their words , not mine . This is their stated strategy in their publications and in their promotion of the Standing Rock event . Clean air and drinking water are the most valuable commodities we have as human beings . These necessities for life are what all of us should be working together to protect for our children and the generations to come . The transnational corporations and large financial institutions only care about their profit margins and will override the well being of the citizenry for motives of pure greed . If you want to believe the rhetoric of conspiracies and ulterior motives that is being created to discredit environmentalists and civil right groups to make you more comfortable with the self serving stance you have taken on these issues then that is your choice . Unfortunately it is not going to be bringing forth mutual understanding and will not protect our environment and our civil rights from the greed of the corporate state . The financial institutions on Wall Street are not serving the interests of the general population and we will unfortunately see a larger financial collapse than that of 2008 as a result of their unbridled greed . Let us remain confident we can all come together as brothers and sisters to work towards a healthier and sustainable future that protects the justice and equality of all citizens . Not just protect the interests of the upper echelon that is actually exploiting the citizenry . Unfortunately , the globalists do work through the environmental groups to achieve their goals . UN Agenda 21 and 2030 , both globalist frameworks , speak to the setting aside of vast amounts of land to be kept from the resident population . Having been an avid supporter of the work of environmental groups , disillusionment quickly set in when I learned that once such land was set aside , it immediately became off limits to the public and that corporate lumber , mineral , and fracking rights were negotiated and granted by the government . Hence , bury head in sand and go on with business as usual . Greg K says : December 4 , 2016 at 9:50 pm Glad you saw the light Jacqueline . Very rare indeed . I went back to college to get my degree in ESRP . Believe this ; I earned every bit of it . My whole premise was to get as close to the real science , and issues as possible , so that I could be a doer and not a spewer . In fact that is true today as it was 4 years ago . Heck , I just got rousted by the Game Dept. today . All because their sign was missing . manages . Thank you my relative , you are correct . I have relations on the ground at Standing Rock . Yes , movements get co-opted sometimes , but the movement continues , the reporting by MSM stops but the people on the ground continue . Perfect case in point is the Black Lives Matter group where a handful of opportunists like Deray Mckesson got himself hundreds of visits to the White House , a well-paying job , and fame . Meanwhile , DeRay now claims he is not a member of BLM , now that he and a handful of sellouts accomplished their goal of slowing down a powerful movement and dissuading more people from joining . What is happening at Standing Rock is a powerful , spiritual movement that has been ongoing since the Great Immigration . There were always groups of goodheart people like the Quakers , who united with our Native peoples and recognized and fought against the genocide of our people , as there are groups and elected officials that will do everything possible to prevent the unity of all races , creeds , identities from uniting . Those groups are the real danger to all freedom loving peoples . the brave warriors who joined him have done at Oceti Sakowin camp is the beginning of mending the Sacred Hoop . His mission to apologize and make amends for over 500 years of continuing genocide & our rights to live on the land Creator gave us to care for , is beyond precedent . M&T bank & the Go Fund Me site they used with held the monies donated to Wes & he & Mike Woods are working to straighten that out , but people are attacking them , NOT the banks & funding sites that kept the money . The peoples group or the one that sustains the global hegemony , sides with the oligarchs & multi-national corporations and fears unity of the masses , equality & justice for all . Time to call them out on their hypocrisy . pixels . file is empty . file is not an image . exceeded . error occurred in the upload . was a configuration error .
