There were mutinies ; the men were hungry , their enlistment terms were up , they were tired of fighting and wanted to go home . sunk ... to mere whining , complaining , seditioners , and mutineers ... When a 17-year-old soldier who had refused to clean up his food , and threatened his officer with a gun , was sentenced to death by a court-martial , Jackson turned down a plea for commutation of sentence and ordered the execution to proceed . He then walked out of earshot of the firing squad . Battle of Horseshoe Bend -LRB- Tohopeka -RRB- , Creek War . Image : New York Public Library . Jackson became a national hero when in 1814 he fought the Battle of Horseshoe Bend against a thousand Creeks and killed 800 of them , with few casualties on his side . His white troops had failed in a frontal attack on the Creeks , but the Cherokees with him , promised governmental friendship if they joined the war , swam the river , came up behind the Creeks , and won the battle for Jackson . When the war ended , Jackson and friends of his began buying up the seized Creek lands . He got himself appointed treaty commissioner and dictated a treaty which took away half the land of the Creek nation . It took land from Creeks who had fought with Jackson as well as those who had fought against him , and when Big Warrior , a chief of the friendly Creeks , protested , Jackson said : Listen ... The United States would have been justified by the Great Spirit , had they taken all the land of the nation ... . Listen , the truth is , the great body of the Creek chiefs and warriors did not respect the power of the United States . They thought we were an insignificant nation , that we would be overpowered by the British ... they were fat with eating beef , they wanted flogging ... We bleed our enemies in such cases to give them their sense . From 1814 to 1824 , in a series of treaties with the southern Indians , whites took over three-fourths of Alabama and Florida , one-third of Tennessee , one-fifth of Georgia and Mississippi , and parts of Kentucky and North Carolina . He encouraged white squatters to move into Indian lands , then told the Indians the government could not remove the whites and so they had better cede the lands or be wiped out . These treaties , these land grabs , laid the basis for the cotton kingdom , the slave plantations . Every time a treaty was signed , pushing the Creeks from one area to the next , promising them security there , whites would move into the new area and the Creeks would feel compelled to sign another treaty , giving up more land in return for security elsewhere . Here were the villages of the Seminole agents in their resistance to the Americans . Settlers moved into Indian lands . Indians attacked . Atrocities took place on both sides . When certain village refused to surrender people accused of murdering whites , Jackson ordered the villages destroyed . Another Seminole provocation : escaped black slaves took refuge in Seminole villages . Some Seminoles bought or captured black slaves , but their form of slavery was more like African slavery than cotton plantation slavery . Jackson began raids into Florida , arguing it was a sanctuary for escaped slaves and for marauding Indians . Florida , he said , was essential to the defense of the United States . It was that classic modern preface to a war of conquest . Thus began the Seminole War of 1818 , leading to the American acquisition of Florida . Jackson then became governor of the Florida Territory . He was able now to give good business advice to friends and relatives . To a nephew , he suggested holding on to property in Pensacola . To a friend , a surgeon-general in the army , he suggested buying as many slaves as possible , because the price would soon rise . Leaving his military post , he also gave advice to officers on how to deal with the high rate of desertion . Jackson suggested whipping for the first two attempts , and the third time , execution . This is not simply hindsight -LRB- the word used for thinking back differently on the past -RRB- . Under Jackson , and the man he chose to succeed him , Martin Van Buren , 70,000 Indians east of the Mississippi were forced westward . But the Sac and Fox Indians of Illinois were removed , after the Black Hawk War -LRB- in which Abraham Lincoln was an officer , though he was not in combat -RRB- .

Whites were encouraged to settle on Indian land . However , federal treaties and federal laws gave Congress , not the states , authority over the tribes . The Indian Trade and Intercourse Act , passed by Congress in 1802 , said there could be no land cessions except by treaty with a tribe , and said federal law would operate in Indian territory . Jackson ignored this , and supported state action . It was a neat illustration of the uses of the federal system : depending on the situation , blame could be put on the states , or on something even more elusive , the mysterious Law before which all men , sympathetic as they were to the Indian , must bow . The proper tactic had now been found . But if they chose to stay they would have to abide by state laws , which destroyed their tribal and personal rights and made them subject to endless harassment and invasion by white settlers coveting their land . If they left , however , the federal government would give them financial support and promise them lands beyond the Mississippi ... . As Jackson took office in 1829 , gold was discovered in Cherokee territory in Georgia . Thousands of whites invaded , destroyed Indian property , staked out claims . Jackson ordered federal troops to remove them , but also ordered Indians as well as whites to stop mining . The white invaders seized land and stock , forced Indians to sign leases , beat up Indians who protested , sold alcohol to weaken resistance , killed game which Indians needed for food . Food shortages , whiskey , and military attacks began a process of tribal disintegration . Violence by Indians upon other Indians increased . Treaties made under pressure and by deception broke up Creek , Choctaw , and Chickasaw tribal lands into individual holdings , making each person a prey to contractors , speculators , and politicians . The Chickasaws sold their land individually at good prices and went west without much suffering . The Creeks and Choctaws remained on their individual plots , but great numbers of them were defrauded by land companies . According to Van Every , just before Jackson became president , in the 1820s , after the tumult of the War of 1812 and the Creek War , the Southern Indians and the whites had settled down , often very close to one another , and were living in peace in a natural environment which seemed to have enough for all of them . They began to see common problems . Friendships developed . White men were allowed to visit the Indian communities and Indians often were guests in white homes . The forces that led to removal did not come , Van Every insists , from the poor white frontiersmen who were neighbors of the Indians . They came from industrialization and commerce , the growth of populations , of railroads and cities , the rise in value of land , and the greed of businessmen . Out of that frenzy the Indians were to end up dead or exiled , the land speculators richer , the politicians more powerful . As for the poor white frontiersman , he played the part of a pawn , pushed into the first violent encounters , but soon dispensable . By Bill Bigelow .
