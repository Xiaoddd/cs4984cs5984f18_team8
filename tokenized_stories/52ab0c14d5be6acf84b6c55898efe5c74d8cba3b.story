Photo : Avery White . Photographer Avery White has been embedded with the Water Protectors of Standing Rock , documenting the efforts to block the Dakota Access Pipeline . She has been sharing with us conversations she has had with those assembled there . This is her latest dispatch . Sarah Shomin was one of the first friends I made at Standing Rock . We met when she asked to hitch a ride with me to the casino , ten miles away from the main camp , Oceti Sakowin . The 20-year-old is finding a sense of purpose for the first time through the Standing Rock movement . Every time we talked , I was even more blown away by her wisdom and bravery . Sarah Shomin : Social media is what kind of kick-started it for me because you got to see in detail what was really going on out here . I was scrolling the Internet . One hour turned into three , three turned into six . For one , I can survive with no electricity . I did not know that . You know , I can chop wood now . I can do it . I grew up really culturally detached . I grew up a product of history , they really wiped us out . My parents are die-hard Catholics . I really like that . SS : You meet people from everywhere . I found my first love out here . Everyone helps each other out . People actually care . SS : It definitely kinda sucked . I did what I had to do every day . I went to work . Came home . Did my taxes . I felt like I was doing everything I had to do . I felt like it revolved around money a lot . So that was in the back of my mind too . I almost feel like I had no purpose before this . Yeah . Here I actually feel alive . AW : I can relate . SS : Yeah . I get up with my man in the morning . AW : Tell me how Standing Rock functions as a community . SS : Yeah , on my way here I was going through so many emotions . When I came out here , I felt like I kissed my family goodbye . I refuse to pass this down . We can fight this now , man . We can make it easier for them . This is way past us . SS : This is about the future kids . The youth , the animals , the plants . Mother Earth herself . SS : The friends . The round dances . The family everywhere now . Like when you get up , you go walk around ask people if they need help . This interview has been edited for length and clarity .
