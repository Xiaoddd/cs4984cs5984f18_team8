Mark Hand Twitter Aug 24 , 2018 , 8:00 am SHARE Facebook Twitter Email SMS WhatsApp Share Crews work on the construction of the West Virginia portion of Dominion Energy 's Atlantic Coast Pipeline . They grew even more determined to stop the pipeline construction in its tracks . Bowers is one of the leaders of Mountain Valley Watch , a group created to monitor construction of the pipeline . Residents have signed up to serve as volunteer monitors and scouts for what have essentially become citizen regulatory agencies . Mountain Valley Watch was formed earlier this year as was the Pipeline Compliance Surveillance Initiative -LRB- Pipeline CSI -RRB- , which is keeping a close eye on the the ACP . The mission of these all-volunteer oversight groups is to make sure laws are obeyed and no corners are cut during construction . And if the volunteers do their jobs well enough , they hope to provide enough evidence of violations to force regulators to issue permanent stop-work orders on the projects . The monitoring groups have put in place systems that allow rapid response by water quality experts . Residents who live near the pipeline paths , for example , can use websites to submit online incident reports or call into a telephone hotline about a potential construction violation . They also can view interactive pipeline websites if they need location information . Activists get big victories in fight against Appalachia pipelines Both the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipelines are meeting a wall of resistance . Earlier this year , the Allegheny-Blue Ridge Alliance , of which the DPMC is one of its more than 50 members , formed the Pipeline CSI , to ensure strict application of environmental laws and regulations during construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline . Planes , drones , and first-responders Groups such as the Pipeline CSI and Mountain Valley Watch use drones to monitor the pipeline routes . The cameras shoot straight down from the airplane every second . Volunteers are trained to examine the photos to determine whether a potential construction violation is occurring . The pipeline monitoring groups also have access to a network of water quality experts who go out and analyze potential construction damage to streams and other bodies of water using high-end instrumentation . Dominion is the largest economic force in the region and donates huge amounts of money to the Virginia General Assembly . A 70-mile expansion of the 42-inch-diameter pipeline into North Carolina has also been proposed as part of the project . In the latest concession by state regulators to the pipeline developers of the MVP , the Virginia State Water Control Board on August 21 voted to decline calls from environmental groups and landowners to reconsider important water-quality permits for the MVP and ACP , despite major environmental violations committed by the developers of the multi-billion-dollar projects . The lack of proper regulatory reviews by federal and state regulators is what many believe is allowing opponents of the two pipeline projects to find success in the courts . Earlier in August , FERC ordered a halt to construction on the ACP following a federal appeals court decision to reject construction certificates that had been approved . The agency issued a similar stop-work order earlier this month for the MVP . Both orders followed decisions issued by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit , based in Richmond , Virginia . According to the court , the National Park Service should not have issued a permit to allow the pipeline to tunnel under the federally owned Blue Ridge Parkway because the park service failed to explain how the pipeline fit with its mandate to conserve public lands . Dominion Energy and EQT Corp. , the primary sponsors of the two pipeline projects , did not respond to requests for comment from ThinkProgress at the time this article was published . Rick Webb , a retired senior scientist with the University of Virginia , serves as coordinator of the Dominion Pipeline Monitoring Coalition and committee chairman of the Pipeline Compliance Surveillance Initiative . CREDIT : Sandy Hausman Webb said the Pipeline CSI documented that about 7,900 feet of pipe was newly placed in the pipeline corridor between August 5 , when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit vacated the two construction permits , and August 12 , when FERC issued its stop-work order . Dominion Energy is arguing that it should be allowed to bury much of this pipe . For the MVP , the court on June 21 invalidated a water crossings permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and halted all construction in streams and wetlands in West Virginia . These were related to construction within the Jefferson National Forest . FERC ordered all construction to halt following that ruling . Staging area for construction of the West Virginia portion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline . The Virginia DEQ had not responded to a request for comment from ThinkProgress at the time this article was published . With on-the-ground monitoring and aerial surveys of the pipeline routes , volunteer groups have discovered potential violations they believe would have gone undetected if they had not volunteered to do the work themselves . Construction of the 303-mile Mountain Valley Pipeline entails clearing 125-foot rights of way along mountainous terrain and then digging ditches to bury the 42-inch diameter pipe . The terrain through which the developers are building their pipelines is steep and hard to reach . Through the years , state highway departments have refused to build roads through the region due to its rugged nature . For the MVP , the Virginia DEQ has used minimal staffing to inspect the project . Three full-time employees and three part-time contractors have been assigned to the portion of the MVP currently under construction , according to Bowers . Bowers spends much of his time traveling through western Virginia , training volunteer monitors . He meets with residents who have formed groups in opposition to the pipeline in Giles , Montgomery , Craig , Roanoke , and Franklin counties , Virginia . Bowers usually gets a big turnout for his training sessions . A deputy sheriff in Franklin County came to a session on his personal time because he wanted to learn how to spot erosion problems . So far , the efforts of Mountain Valley Watch have generated more than 150 reports of violations to state regulators in Virginia . Construction teams work on the Mountain Valley Pipeline in West Virginia . CREDIT : Appalachians Against Pipelines Both the ACP and MVP will be crossing hundreds of streams and waterbodies , a major concern for clean water advocates . So far , only tree-cutting has occurred in Virginia in preparation for construction of the ACP . But volunteers are already in place along the path of the pipeline once construction crews move from West Virginia into Virginia . When the volunteers find sediment runoff or other potential violations , they write up incident reports and send them to the appropriate government agency . When the complaints are filed , the volunteers cite the legal codes and regulatory requirements , making it easier to take legal action against the pipeline developers , if needed , in the future . Like their counterparts in Virginia , the group , called N.C. Pipeline Watch , will train the volunteers to spot environmental violations that could lead to fines or work interruptions . Almost 200 miles of the 600-mile-long ACP will travel through eastern North Carolina . Construction of the ACP threatens nearly 326 different waterbodies and at least 468 acres of wetlands in North Carolina , according to estimates by the Natural Resources Defense Council . The North Carolina Pipeline Watch is modeled on the Pipeline CSI , the Virginia program that uses volunteer observers and local residents to find suspected regulatory compliance violations . The other organizations involved in the North Carolina Pipeline Watch include Sound Rivers , Winyah Rivers Foundation , and Cape Fear River Watch . Sierra Club , Sound Rivers , Winyah Rivers and Cape Fear River Watch volunteers and staff will monitor the Atlantic Coast Pipeline construction activities for violations of environmental protections required by state and federal permits . In West Virginia , the MVP already has received four violations from state regulators regarding failure to implement erosion control solutions . With previous construction projects , inspectors with the Virginia DEQ would , as Webb described , apologetically tell pipeline construction crews that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was forcing them to keep close tabs on their work .
