The proposed Pilgrim Pipeline route . The Ramapough Lunaape tribe in the township of Mahwah , New Jersey are protesting the interstate Pilgrim Pipeline , a proposed 178-mile dual pipeline that would carry fracked Bakken shale oil from Albany , New York to the Bayway Refinery in Linden , New Jersey . While it is not yet finalized , the preliminary route crosses five counties and 30 municipalities in New Jersey and five counties and 25 municipalities in New York , as well as the Highlands region , where the groundwater and surface water are the direct source of water for more than 4.5 million people in both states , according to the Coalition Against Pilgrim Pipeline . The pipeline would also run through a portion of the Ramapo Valley Reservation . Similar to the Standing Rock Sioux , the Lunaape worry that a potential pipeline leak would pollute drinking water and sacred sites . The pipeline is capable of carrying 400,000 barrels of oil per day . The company , which announced the project three years ago , has not yet applied for the permit that would define their exact pipeline route . NBC New York reports that the Lunaape have displayed anti-Pilgrim pipeline signs alongside teepees that were initially erected to recognize the efforts of the Standing Rock Sioux , who are protesting the heavily contested Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota . The tribe has been hosting teach-ins about the pipeline at their encampment . Dozens of people have already attended . The protest , however , has hit a legal snag as the tribe has not yet obtained the necessary permits to camp out on land near the pipeline 's proposed route . Mahwah has issued a summons for their occupation , even though the town is officially against the pipeline and agrees that its route through Ramapo Valley Reservation is unacceptable . The coalition is calling on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to oppose the project . Cuomo 's position on the Pilgrim Pipeline is unclear , but New York state is ramping up its clean energy efforts under the governor 's goal of sourcing 50 percent of the state 's power from renewables . Cuomo and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation also denied a key permit to the Constitution Pipeline Project in April . Christie , however , is more of a wildcard . Although the Garden State is a solar power all-star , Christie is a fan of pipelines and a vocal supporter of the controversial Keystone XL .
