Pyramid Shades Arts Standing Rock : Battle of the Black Snake Share Tweet Good Idea or Nah . Since the beginning of time , man has coexisted with nature . He has connected to Earth and everything in it with a deep and profound reverence . We have lived , survived and flourished from the plants , animals and the rivers that flow through it . Everything we know has come from this planet . Due to colonial imperialism and colonization , that realization has been lost over the generations . We no longer depend on Mother Nature herself , but the exploitation of her resources . The conflict between Energy Transfer Partners and Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota embodies a dynamic battle for a better world where we can stand up to greedy corporations and marauding entities . We can replenish and nurture an Earth so badly exploited and stand up for the social injustices of the oppressed . The domestically produced crude oil Dakota Access Pipeline construction has broken the 1851 treaty with the reservation and has destroyed many sacred burial grounds . The pipeline , also known as The Black Snake is also scheduled to cross under the Missouri River and potentially threaten the water supply to the tribes and thousands of other Mid-Western residents . I served 5 years in the United States Army , two tours in Iraq and I took an oath to fight all enemies foreign and domestic . I stood on the front lines of history facing Riot Police , pepper spray , risking arrest , was almost ran over by DAPL workers driving full speed in a diesel truck at a peace line and stood toe to toe with those same workers swinging bats in intimidation like a baseball player walking up to the plate . Over the past few months , the battle at Standing Rock has intensified . Private Security from DAPL has released dogs on unarmed Water Protectors and the actions of the Police force has been excessive on peaceful protestors from mace , pepper spray , sound cannons , rubber bullets to water hoses being sprayed in below freezing weather . Being on the front lines at Standing Rock has been an emotional experience . I have seen the absolute worst in people but I have also experienced the best . It is a place filled with love and wholeness . From young Natives riding bareback , the vibrant and vivid sunsets setting behind a row of Teepees , the smell of sage and cedar , to the sounds of children playing , horses neighing and prayer chants echoing throughout the land , you know this is a sacred and special place . I have helped build and participated in sweat lodges , meditated at the sacred fire and have seen the powerful presence of Mother Earth as a Great Bald Eagle circled an intense standoff with Riot Police . During my time at Sacred Stone the son of President Kennedy , Robert Kennedy Jr. , visited and spoke at the camp . He stated the strategy of the Oil Company is to get the pipeline into the ground and operating -LRB- even against the orders of the Army Corp of Engineer -RRB- so investors have an interest in maintaining oil as our major resource for the next 30 years . Right now , even against the orders of the Army Corp of Engineers , Energy Transfer Partners and DAPL workers are continuing construction . They are wrong and the lawsuit will not succeed . The truth is , I have seen with my own eyes and even stood in a peaceful protest against DAPL workers as they were laying down pipe , that the amount of money it will cost them in fines for continuing construction is nothing in comparison to what they lose if they continue to build . Even the locals have had enough of the protest . I can assure you the protests have been peaceful and nothing but prayer circles and ceremonies . The lack of media coverage has raised much concern and what little coverage major news outlets have covered have bent the truth to make the Water Protectors look like violent , arsonist criminals . We as a people just want our voice to be heard and have come together to make a stand for new , alternative resources , blocking fossil fuel infrastructures , safer and cleaner energy , the protection of water , and the social injustice against the Natives . It is being done for a better way of life for generations to come . It is compassion and reverence for all walks of life and the Earth that we all share together . The world is seeing a major shift and transition . The older generations of destruction , corporate greed and deceit are dying out but not without a fight . But they ARE dying out . I have faith in the new generations to come . Regardless of what happens with the Dakota Access Pipeline , I believe with all my heart that we have already won . The world is watching the way we treat one another , the Earth , our greed and how it is destroying the world and how unified people can come together peacefully for a noble , worthy cause . I have hope . What better way than to leave you with a quote from Sitting Bull . Strangely enough they have a mind to till the soil and the love of possession is a disease with them . These people have made many rules that the rich may break but the poor may not . They take their tithes from the poor and weak to support the rich and those who rule . They claim this mother of ours , the earth , for their own and fence their neighbors away ; they deface her with their buildings and their refuse . The nation is like a spring freshet that overruns its banks and destroys all that are in its path . We can not dwell side by side . Only seven years ago we made a treaty by which we were assured that the buffalo country should be left to us forever . Now they threaten to take that away from us .
