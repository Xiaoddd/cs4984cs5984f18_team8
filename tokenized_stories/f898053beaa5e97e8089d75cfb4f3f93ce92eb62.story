Zeskind , a longtime friend and colleague , is an internationally recognized expert on white nationalist movements and a longtime activist in the battle for civil and human rights . He has testified at a British parliamentary subcommittee hearing , crisscrossed Germany speaking to anti-fascist activists , and received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship , a Petra Foundation Fellowship , the Paul H. Tobenkin Prize , and the Bayard Rustin Award . They will continue to push for secessionist-style white enclaves and might engage in militia-style violence . Others will attempt to widen their base , and carve out a larger niche among conservative Republicans . Without an electoral vehicle of their own , they will suffer from the vicissitudes of the Republican leadership . Their natural base , however , will be the five percent of white voters who told pollsters last summer that they would never vote for a black person for President . Leonard Zeskind : It became apparent to me that much of the received wisdom about white supremacists was simply wrong . And I wanted to write a book that did not just say what I thought was correct , but I wanted to show it through specific characters , scenes of action and analysis . These white-ists are not just a bunch of uneducated bumpkins down on their economic luck . And , these are not a string of disconnected organizations sharing only a common set of hatreds . Rather , this is a single movement , with a common set of leaders and interlocking memberships that hold a complete and sometimes sophisticated ideology . Further , the white nationalist movement today is organized around the notion that the power of whites to control government and social policy has already been overthrown by people of color and Jews , rather unlike the Klan of the 1960s which sought to defend a system of racial apartheid in the South . Many of the organizations and leaders look back to the Constitutional order prior to the Civil War , when the national-state was a whites-only republic . Others look forward to the creation of a new white nation-state carved out of the lands of North America . While these ideas were present in the movement from its re-inception in the mid-1970s , they only became dominant in the 1990s , after the end of the Cold War ushered in a new era . Across the globe , nationalism became a language of opposition to the New Global Order , and racial and ethnic nationalism became more salient than its liberal civic opposition . Books such as Blood and Belonging and Jihad vs. McWorld explored these issues globally . In the United States , racial nationalism meant white nationalism , and the old white supremacist movement was thus transformed into 21st-century white nationalism . LZ : Through a combination of factors . First , through the slow accretion of organizing week-in , week-out events : Klan rallies , Bible camps , survivalist and gun shows , white-power music concerts , etc. , many of which are described in my book . Second , when David Duke won a majority of white votes while running in two Louisiana statewide elections in 1990 and 1991 , he uncovered a middle-American constituency that supported at least a portion of his national socialist ideas . Third , a group of respected -LRB- if not respectable -RRB- ultra-conservatives broke with the Bush 41-era Republican consensus during the first Persian Gulf War and headed in the white direction . From this perspective , one of the most interesting Republican pieces of legislation languishing in Congress is a proposal to end birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to parents lacking the proper documents . If such a measure were enacted , it would run smack dab into the Fourteenth Amendment , which guarantees birthright citizenship and equality before the law . In this sense , the Republicans who signed onto this bill are proposing measures that the Christian patriots and Posse Comitatus-types talked about twenty-five years ago . It is important for us to be able to connect these dots . Nobody Really Knows .
