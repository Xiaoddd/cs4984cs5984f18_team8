Echo Through the Fog is a somewhat regularly updated comic blog by Cordelia . The mental barriers anxiety creates often appear insurmountable . But sometimes , when you really need to , you can break those barriers down . This week , with encouragement from some great people on the internet , I pushed against my anxiety and made some calls to members of our government . Here are a few I really like : Emily Ellsworth explains why calling is the most effective way to reach your congressperson . Sharon Wong posted a great series of tweets that helped me manage my phone anxiety and make some calls . Kelsey is tweeting pretty much daily with advice and reminders about calling representatives . Each call only takes a minute or so , but you might want to block off more time for your first call , so you can prepare your words & nerves . Scheduling is super important , otherwise you will perpetually delay calling . At the scheduled time , go sit somewhere quiet . Find out who represents you . It only needs to be a few lines , and there are lots of templates online that you can use . e.g. Thank them and ask them to keep pushing . Take a deep breath . You can do this . Do this : dial . Read from your script . And follow up with them next week , or even tomorrow , to make sure they keep these issues top of mind . It is okay if your voice shakes . It is okay if you feel awkward . For me , calling was enough outside my comfort zone to be stressful & scary , but not so far away as to use up all my energy . Do not beat yourself up about it . Support their work . Amplify their voices . Keep it up .
