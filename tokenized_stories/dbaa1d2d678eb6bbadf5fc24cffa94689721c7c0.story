In short , the Army Corps failed to uphold a December announcement it would complete a full environmental impact assessment as the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe had requested , and has instead abruptly sided with the Trump administration for Big Oil over environmental concerns and treaty rights . Court may be the last remaining option for those who oppose the pipeline . Several pieces of litigation over Dakota Access remain stalled in federal courts , but will not have teeth should ETP resume construction the moment USACE gives the official green light . We are a sovereign nation and we will fight to protect our water and sacred places from the brazen private interests trying to push this pipeline through to benefit a few wealthy Americans with financial ties to the Trump administration . The environmental impact statement was wrongfully terminated . This pipeline was unfairly rerouted across our treaty lands . While the federal government chooses to disregard the laws made to govern themselves , we will respect those laws and continue to legally resist the destruction of homes , people , and culture . It is clear that the coyotes which have been hiding in the shadows are taking advantage of this full lunacy . We will have to renew our fight and spend more of our precious resources resisting this onslaught yet again . Resources that would be better spent building institutions that preserve our culture , language , beliefs and way of life . With justifiable concerns regarding the safety of DAPL , thousands of Native American , Indigenous , and non-Native water protectors have visited camps near Standing Rock over the months since Camp of the Sacred Stones was erected for youth in April 2016 .
