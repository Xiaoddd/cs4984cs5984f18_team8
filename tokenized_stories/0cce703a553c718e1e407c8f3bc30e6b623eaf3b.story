Amid increasing awareness of genocide and centuries of exploitation and oppression perpetrated against Native Americans by the U.S. government , a feast slated for the problematic annual holiday could easily but needlessly be misconstrued . Wicks , who lived in an Alaskan Eskimo community in 1969 , wanted to ensure such a feast would be welcome and appropriate from an Indigenous standpoint , so she consulted with friend , Director of the Indigenous Environmental Network , Bob Goldtooth , for his opinion . Immediately she summoned a group of activists , chefs , and volunteers to join her in North Dakota next weekend , where the group also plans to lend a hand in the construction of a straw-bale community center , called Makagi Oti , and planned by tribal leaders . Fonda , in addition to joining the group , plans to donate four much-needed Mongolian yurts and five butchered bison . Water protectors , dedicated to remaining in several encampments near Cannon Ball , North Dakota , close to the banks of the Missouri River , face a potential humanitarian crisis with a winter predicted to be even harsher than usual . Wopila Feast volunteers plan to serve dishes with traditional ingredients , including squash , sweet potatoes , wild rice , ground corn , and cranberries , among other items . For her part , Jane Fonda has already participated in an arts education program at Solen Middle School in the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation earlier this year .
