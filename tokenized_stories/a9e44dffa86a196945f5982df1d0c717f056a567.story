Atchafalaya Basinkeeper , the Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association-West and other groups sued the Corps of Engineers in January for issuing permits for the Bayou Bridge Pipeline , a 24-inch-wide , 162.5-mile-long pipeline from Lake Charles east southeast to St. James , Louisiana . The proposed pipeline will connect with the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline , to bring oil to refineries along the Mississippi River for export . Construction began in January . At another hearing Friday , Judge Dick was to determine whether tree clearing and construction through the Atchafalaya must stop . Lead counsel Jan Hasselman , with Earthjustice in Seattle , sought an injunction in the Jan. 11 complaint , and on Jan. 29 asked for a temporary restraining order . Expert testimony Thursday from environmentalists and crawfishermen showed photos of trees already shredded to wood chips and discarded into slow-moving waters in the basin . Other photos showed old-growth cypress trees twice the size of a fishing boat , flagged for removal . One showed an old growth tree with a bicentennial marker and a flag beside it . Dean Wilson , executive director of Atchafalaya Basinkeeper , testified Thursday that though the Corps of Engineers claimed in its permit that just five old growth cypress trees stand in the path of the Bayou Bridge Pipeline and would need to be destroyed , he had personally counted 17 centuries-old trees last week , in what he estimated was just 10 percent of the area of the swamp . Wilson and others testified that Energy Transfer Partners is able to reduce each tree to a pile of wood chips in a matter of minutes , with a wood-chipping machine that starts at the treetop and quickly grinds the tree to the root . Chipping widens the channel , which allows more sediment to flow in , which stagnates the water , causing hypoxia , or areas of depleted oxygen . Wilson testified that once the cypress trees go , there is little to no chance they will come back . Jody Meche , president of Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association-West , agreed . Meche said crawfishing in hypoxic areas is impossible . The Corps of Engineers , represented by the Department of Justice , did not present many arguments Thursday . Neither the Department of Justice nor Energy Transfer Partners called witnesses . William Scherman with Gibson Dunn in Washington , D.C. represents Energy Transfer Partners . Scherman previously was general counsel for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , which was instrumental in transforming policy initiatives , including the Energy Policy Act of 1992 , which reformed the natural gas pipeline industry . Numerous spills , false statements in permit applications and improper erosion protocols have been alleged . In one instance , 2 million gallons of drilling fluid were spilled in Ohio wetlands , blanketing more than 9 acres under a slurry of diesel fuel-contaminated water and bentonite clay . In his closing arguments Thursday , Scherman said that the hearing seemed to be mostly about a bunch of trees . He urged Dick to dismiss the request for a preliminary injunction . He said the pipeline will not cause irreparable damage , and the Corps of Engineers has stated that the company must mitigate any damage caused by construction . After closing arguments , Judge Dick said that mitigation is not sufficient . The Friday hearing was expected to focus on the preliminary injunction itself . She said that 99.96 of the petroleum products transported through ETP pipelines have been delivered to their destination . Assuming that 0.04 percent of oil was spilled , that amounts to 400 gallons spilled for every 1 million gallons delivered . With 42 gallons per barrel of oil , that translates to 20 million gallons of oil pumped through the Bayou Bridge Pipeline each day . All rights reserved . Theme : ColorMag by ThemeGrill .
