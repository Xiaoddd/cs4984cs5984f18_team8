In addition to an OK from the Maryland Department of the Environment , the Maryland segment also needs approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the National Parks Service , among more than 40 required permits . The pipeline also would pass under the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park , where protesters have been camping out on many weekends this summer . The federal energy regulator is set to make its decision in January . If the project receives the necessary approvals , TransCanada expects to begin construction next April . The firm began public outreach last November and subsequently revised its plans , pledging to bury the pipeline twice as deep , 100 feet , in the section under the riverbed . Instead , she argued , the state should move toward green energy . The Maryland portion of the line may only be a few miles long and cross only briefly under a narrow stretch of the Potomac , but the natural gas would travel through connecting pipelines for 50 miles or more , much of it through karst terrain , Walls said . However , Castleman noted , a dozen TransCanada pipelines already cross under the Potomac River in Maryland . Hancock officials have no qualms with the project , he said . TransCanada representatives will continue to meet with all stakeholders and make adjustments where it needs to , Castleman said .
