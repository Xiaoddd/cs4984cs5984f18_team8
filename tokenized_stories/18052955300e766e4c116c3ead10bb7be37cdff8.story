And yet there is a common thread : American taxpayer money . For people living next to US-funded mines and power stations the impacts are even more starkly immediate . Guardian and Columbia reporters have spent time at American-backed projects in India , South Africa and Australia to document the sickness , upheavals and environmental harm that come with huge dirty fuel developments . In South Africa , another huge project is set to exacerbate existing air pollution problems , deforestation and water shortages . And in Australia , an enormous US-backed gas development is linked to a glut of fracking activity that has divided communities and brought a new wave of industrialization next to the cherished Great Barrier Reef . A heavy blanket of smog wraps around the industrial district and its residents . India map Sasan , an ambitious project by Indian energy utility Reliance Power , consumes coal incessantly from a nearby mine in the promise of lighting the homes of almost 300 million people in the country . But since it began operating in 2012 , the project has been caught in a storm of health and safety violations , environmental concerns and land disputes . The Sasan project was initially rejected by the bank for financing because of the extremely high carbon emissions from the coal-powered plant . However , over the course of five years , residents and activists in Singrauli concerns about the project have grown .

The towers of Reliance Power stood tall behind her , the lettering on the chimneys within sight of her mud-and-brick home in the village of Harrahawa . Flies and insects flitted in the well water . She pointed to the residual ash dumpsite of the Sasan plant , which is only a couple of metres from her doorstep . On a hot day , one can see ash dust blowing up from the ash pond in the direction of nearby villages surrounding the plant . The locals complain that ash from the enclosed reservoir is settling into the surface water of nearby regions , causing the wells to fill up to the top with impure water . The national green tribunal , a court that hears environmental cases in India , released a report by a committee of environmental experts in August 2015 , stating that the groundwater in Harrahawa next to the plant had high levels of mercury in it . Excess mercury in drinking water has been medically linked to severe nervous disorders and birth defects . Toxic coal dust was also found to have settled in the fields located next to the mines . In January 2010 , the Indian ministry of environment and forests declared Singrauli a critically polluted area . The coal is transported into the power plant through a 14 km long , blue , snake-like conveyor belt , saving Reliance Power the overhead costs of railroad transportation .

A layer of grey coal dust has settled on his impoverished eggplant and tomato farm , his main source of livelihood . The industrial pollution is taking a toll on Narayan and his family . Difficulties in breathing , stomach aches and joint pains are common . Narayan has been pleading with Reliance to remedy the situation for years , but nothing has happened . We can see the big boulders falling . Families settled almost directly underneath the noisy conveyor belt that brings coal to the plant have a similar tale to tell . Reliance only acquired a part of his farmland for the belt , leaving his house and well exposed to the pollution caused by coal transportation . Facebook Twitter Pinterest Impoverished villagers of Harrahawa and Siddhikhurd living in close proximity in to the Sasan power plant complain of polluted air and toxic well water . Photograph : Sidharth M Vhavle for the Guardian Sasan has also been hit by reports of accidents , harassment , fatalities and injuries . The police confirmed that 16 cases relating to the Sasan plant and coalmine have been investigated since 2012 , resulting from vehicle accidents , beam and tower deaths and electric shocks . Activist Awadhesh Kumar , who has been speaking to workers in Sasan and surrounding villages , believes the real number is larger . But the steps taken by Ex-Im to regulate Sasan are too little too late , according to people living around the thermal power plant and the coalmine . All points in the story have been raised with Reliance officials . They are yet to comment . Liquified natural gas plants , Queensland , Australia by Michael Slezak Alan and Ailsa Smith say setting foot on Curtis Island is like stepping back in history . The world-heritage-listed tropical island where they live sits just off the coast of Gladstone in Queensland , Australia , right under the Tropic of Capricorn . The couple own a small grocery store and bed-and-breakfast . But South End has a new neighbour that makes itself known at night , illuminating the clouds with its startlingly bright lights , and occasionally sending flames into the sky . Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ailsa and Alan Smith the owners of Capricorn Lodge , the only business on Curtis Island apart from the LNG plants . Their development has allowed a controversial fracking boom in Queensland , where about 6,000 coal seam gas wells have been drilled to deliver gas to be liquefied at the plants . Those estimates ignore the carbon emissions that will be produced when the gas exported from Curtis Island is burned . The two US-funded plants will produce up to 17.5 m tonnes of liquid natural gas each year . A week earlier there were a lot of flares that produced a lot of black smoke , he said . Facebook Twitter Pinterest Glimpses of the LNG Plants can be seen through the dense bush . As the sun sets , thousands of lights on the gas plants light up . To allow ships to dock to collect the liquified gas , the Queensland government conducted a huge dredging operation in the harbour . Around 25m cubic metres of earth have been scooped up from the harbour floor , with the Australian government giving approval for a further 19m cubic meters to be dug up . The wall failed , the dredge spoil leaked through it , and spread through the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area . Satellite analysis showed the plumes of mud that spread through the water stretched for 35 km into the Coral Sea , which would have degraded seagrass meadows that support endangered dugongs . As the dredging started , fishermen reported an outbreak of disease among marine life , which scientists said could have been caused by metals on the seafloor that were released into the water . Trevor Falzon used to catch fish in Gladstone Harbour , home to one of the largest ports in the world . He was the lead plaintiff in an unsuccessful case brought by 51 fishermen against the Gladstone Ports Corporation over the dredging . The development meant they lost an area that they used to fish in . South Africa map The vast structure on the ridge is clearly visible from the small settlement of Arbor , a huddle of shacks and huts on a narrow strip of land between a coalmine and railway sidings 10 kilometres from Kusile . It might mean jobs and development , or maybe sickness and drought . The structure Sibeko can see is what has so far been built of Kusile , which will be among the 10 biggest coal-fired power stations in the world , and is already one of the most controversial . Facebook Twitter Pinterest A man drives cattle near the Kendal power station in Mpumalanga province , South Africa . Delayed by decades and wildly over budget , Kusile is emblematic of a development model increasingly seen as outdated . The days of vast mega-projects with enormous financial , social and environmental costs , as well as the potential to transform economies , are over , some experts say . Instead , smaller and cheaper projects can bring change as effectively , supplying energy and other needs with minimal impact . But the loan was also very expensive . As local currency has lost value against the dollar the cost of repayments has soared . The project is immense . When completed Kusile will consist of six units with the ability to generate 4,800 MW , making it significantly bigger than any power station in the US except the hydroelectric Grand Coulee dam in Washington . Defenders say Kusile has been designed with advanced technology that will minimise its environmental impact , such as scrubbers to control sulphur dioxide and filters to reduce emissions of dangerous particulates . The plant will use an air cooling system to help conserve water and is designed so equipment to capture carbon emissions can be fitted in the future . The plan to build Kusile , and its twin Medupi , in Limpopo province , dates back to the immediate aftermath of the repressive racist apartheid regime . In recent years , South Africa has been hit by severe power shortages , leading to rolling outages . Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sibongile Sibeko with her children Linda , four , left , and Jabulile , eight , right . The Sibeko family live on the edge of the coal mine in Arbor . Projects this large are seen as transformational . They cost a lot . They employ a lot of people . Their effects are meant to be big . Both projects have been plagued by allegations of corruption . All concerned deny any wrongdoing . The impact on local towns and villages will be immense . It is not simply the power station itself , and the air pollution and traffic it will generate , but the vast coalmining operations needed to provide the estimated 17m tonnes of coal Kusile will require each year . Farmland and wetlands will disappear as new open-cast and underground mines are opened or , in some cases , reopened . Tens of thousands of impoverished labourers will swell some settlements . Others will have to be entirely shifted to new locations . Roads will be built , bringing access and jobs for some , but exacerbating environmental consequences . This is far from pristine farmland or wilderness , however . Central Mpumalanga is the site of a dozen power stations and a huge mining industry .

Photograph : James Oatway for the Guardian One of the major complaints of local communities is that local men are rarely hired by companies for anything but casual labour because already acute air pollution has , they claim , damaged their lungs . Mpumalanga is already designated as a zone of acute air pollution in South Africa . Locals complain of sinus infections , headaches and coughing children . She lives in a small three-roomed hut only a few metres from waste spoil marking the boundary of a major mine , operational for around five years . It has been operational since the early 1980s , is coal-fired and has a capacity of more than 4,000 MW . Then there is water . Among the impacts of Kusile will be the destruction of important wetlands around the plant . Massive infrastructure including pipelines and canals has been constructed to bring water for cooling to Kusile , but the plans were conceived in a period when water was more plentiful . South Africa is currently experiencing its worst drought for 50 years , which some blame on climate change . In all villages around Kusile , there are complaints of lack of water , deforestation and other environmental and social problems , ranging from higher crime levels to overcrowded schools , linked to the influx of workers . We had goats , cows and chickens and there was a white farmer and people here worked on his land . Another nearby village , cut off from the main highway by a strip of dry grass strewn with cider bottles and rusting cans , is often shaken by the blasting at the nearby mine .
