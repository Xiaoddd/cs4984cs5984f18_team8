Smoke rises from railway cars carrying crude oil after derailing in downtown Lac Megantic , Que. , on July 6 , 2013 . It spilled six million litres of crude oil , poisoning the land and waterways . It destroyed the town centre and traumatized a community . Article Continued Below Combining lives lost , environmental damage and physical destruction , this accident is , outside of wartime , without precedent in modern Canadian history . Sadly , no . Massive oil trains continue to run on increasingly overstressed tracks , sometimes at excessive speeds . Tank car fleets have until 2025 to fully replace these models with the newest tank car design , TC-117 . Consequently , the companies still , in practice , regulate themselves , compromising safety when it conflicts with costs . Article Continued Below Relations between Transport Canada and the rail industry continue to be shrouded in secrecy . Company risk assessments and safety management systems are hidden behind a veil of commercial confidentiality . Communication with municipalities about the nature of dangerous goods travelling in real time through their communities is still problematic . Non-industry groups continue to be marginalized from the rule-making process . The 2014 Transportation Safety Board report found regulatory breaches at Transport Canada and negligence by the company , Montreal , Maine & Atlantic Railway -LRB- MMA -RRB- . However , it treated Transport Canada surprisingly lightly , raising questions about the industry influence as well as departmental and political involvement in massaging its findings . Two House of Commons committee reports have not shed additional light on the underlying causes . The settlement of the civil suits has foreclosed an avenue for compelling testimony from those who so far have escaped scrutiny . Their demands have been ignored . The defendants , including the federal government , contributed to the fund in exchange for immunity from further legal action . The criminal negligence causing death trial against three front-line employees continues to be delayed by legal wrangling between the defence and Crown prosecutors . Feasibility studies drag on . The Commons Transport Committee has urged the government to accelerate the process . It should not only commit immediately to building the bypass , it should also finally admit its role in the disaster . Government and industry have worked over the last three years to restore confidence in the system , but the myth of corporate self-regulation is never fundamentally challenged . They want to ensure no other community goes through what they have gone through .
