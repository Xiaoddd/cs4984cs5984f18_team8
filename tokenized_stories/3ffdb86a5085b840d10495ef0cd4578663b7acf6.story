Monkeywrenching Security Zines Read . Distribute . Fallen Warriors Obituaries to fallen warriors . Journal . I went over and clipped my harness to the trunk . I yelled to alarm them they could kill me if they continued cutting . Undeterred , the MVP worker cut the top quarter of the tree trunk , which then fell on the activist . Despite a bloody wound , the activist had the presence of mind to know if the trunk fell on the worker then they both would be in dire straits over 60 feet from the ground . Ink has been up for roughly two weeks as part of a larger blockade resistance in the path of the proposed Mountain Valley Pipeline . As many as nine people have taken to the skies in Appalachia in the past three months . Six tree-sitters have come down under various circumstances , and the flames of resistance have spread at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains . Another activist known as Nutty was perched in a monopod at the top of a 50-foot pole from March 28 to May 23 . She came down after being blocked from receiving food and water by law enforcement in Giles County . Three aerial blockaders remain aloft at different sites along the pipeline route in one of the most elaborate environmentalist resistance efforts ever seen . For now , Ink remains in the sky . Another tree-sitter Fern MacDougal recently launched an aerial blockade further up the road that Nutty had been blocking two days before Nutty came down . As a result of this direct action , MVP still can not bring construction equipment up Peters Mountain . They are also blocked from bringing extraction equipment or or any drilling infrastructure up to the proposed drill pad site being blocked by Deckard . For people who want to get involved , there are a variety of tactics . Talk to your neighbors . One day there will be no trace that humans once dwelled on this planet , yet somehow I am here on this Earth sharing my existence with the rest of you .
