Most Medium tshirts fit well on my chest , but come up short . RB 's Medium shirts have both the fit and length I need . Not only does even shirt feel comfortable and the graphics are perfect and creative each item ships out incredibly fast . Look , I 'm no sophist ; I do n't really know the taxonometric break down of what makes a t-shirt a t-shirt , scientifically speaking . I 'm saying t-shirt . I loved everything about the product . It fits very well - is nicely cut , the fabric is nice quality and the print is clear and good quality . I have no negative comments and would recommend this product to others . Tessuto ottimo e stampa perfetta . Your shirts have a good fit and they wash and wear well . I 've spent big bucks on T-shirts that are n't nearly as durable as the quality shirts you offer . They have to be a light material , but not too light , and a slim fit , but not too slim . This tee ticks those boxes . Get a lot of compliments on it . The large fits nicely . I 'm 6 foot and have wide shoulders and no belly . Tees often are either too short or they fit over my shoulders and chest area but then are way too wide around my mid section . This fit really well all around . The print looked great and still looks great after a few washes . I will keep buying shirts from you guys . The product was well sized , the prints look great and they have stayed looking great after several washes . It said to get the size up for an oversized fit and that 's exactly what I got . The print quality is perfect also . They fit great , look good after multiple washes and are of super high quality . I love , love , love them . The individual designs are ao awesome . The fit was generous unlike some shirts which although ample length-wise seem to be very tight width-wise . It also did n't shrink in the wash like I thought it would . wish it was longer . They literally never disappoint . Although this request should be more specific as to which product you want me to review , each and every one was amazing . I probably should have ordered the XL . I was amazed at the quality of the design and the shirt itself . I washed it before I wrapped it and there was no shrinkage , stretching or fading . It 's a great quality design and shirt . The main issue is the fit , I found the shirt narrow in the shoulders with a wide neck opening . Just a large blob of color . The other on was ok , the the fabric is poor . It hangs and stretches under it 's own weight so looses shape . Would never order again . Would return but do n't want to pay for return shipping further spending money for a poor product . Customer service is really top notch . Would recommend to anyone looking for a good T and even greater service . The fabric felt thin between my fingers but I guess that 's what differentiates the classic T shirt from the premium quality T shirt . May put in extra coin next time to get the better quality one . It arrived quickly and in very cool packaging . Loved the little clothespin . I had gotten the wrong size and he needed to return it . We were both amazed and how quickly and easy the whole process was . Not to mention that he was asked to simply pass on his too-small T-shirt and was sent a replacement for free . I turned on another office mate to your website and she has started her Christmas shopping already . Soft and great fit . Exactly what I ordered . The process was mega-efficient - I was kept informed throughout and it arrived on time . I stupidly did n't check the sizing chart beforehand , so the first one I ordered did n't fit . However , Redbubble were incredibly helpful in getting a replacement to me , in the right size , as soon as possible and it is perfect . Thanks for a great product and being such a lovely company to deal with . Fantastic customer service , wrong size ordered as a gift , replacement sorted within days . Delivery was prompt and it was just as described in website . However I feel that a choice of heavier material would be good . do have to wash the tee shirts before wearing them as well , as there is a strong chemical-ish smell . It also arrived early . The shirts were high quality and online chat support was excellent . Could n't be more happier with purchase or customer service . Currently 16 and counting . Have had no problems at all . The print and the fabric quality has been great . No problems at all . Especially impressed with the great service -LRB- when I incorrectly ordered the wrong sizes first time around -RRB- . Super unique . And the fit was perfect . Not too short . I love the cotton shirts but wish they had a little bit of stretch to them . I like them better than the poly cotton blend ones that seem just a little bit thinner than I like . Fit is good . Not too tight on an average size male . The colour is vibrant and the print is crisp and clear . was good . T-shirt had good quality and fit . Quick delivery even to Europe and fair price . 5 stars . quality , great fit , nicely printed and good quality image . It has a nice soft stretch and the arms are a bit longer than women 's fitted . I have had one unravel but that was a fluke as all others are well made . Will keep buying unisex shirts because they are not too heavy and have a nice stretch . Soft and fit as expected . Love that the unisex comes in larger sizes as I am a plus size girl . Wish other shirt styles were available in larger sizes . fits just the way I like it , not too loose and not too tight . It 's hard for me to find one that I like . . the art on this one is so beautiful and meaningful . To attached fabric care rage was so funny , it made my day . The quality was superb as well as the print . The designs are always really high quality and printed on very well . I have one shirt I 've had for a year or two and it still looks brand new . I particularly am happy with this shirt and have already worn it a lot . Package reception was fine , arrived in France exactly on estimated schedule . There is no defect on printings , nor any sewing issue .
