The physicians and tribal healers with the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council call for the immediate cessation of use of water cannons on people who are outdoors in 28 degrees F ambient weather with no means of active rewarming in these conditions . As medical professionals , we are concerned for the real risk of loss of life due to severe hypothermia under these conditions . We call on the Morton County Sheriff 's office to immediately stop the potentially lethal use of these confrontational methods against people peacefully assembled . We request media support , medical support and observers to the area immediately . Police have formed a line with armored vehicles , concrete barriers , and razor wire . Water protectors are using a semi truck in an attempt to remove burnt military vehicles which the police chained to concrete barriers weeks ago to keep the bridge blocked on 1806 . Our media team is on the ground but currently unable to stream live . We need to stop this for the not only the sake of our people , but the american people . What is happening is out of the greed for money , they say that its in the past but just look at what they did to us tonight . November 20 , 2016 at 8:15 PM Anonymous said ...

President Obama could have ensured the safety of the water protectors in much the same way that Lyndon Johnson protected the Little Rock Nine . He could have simply said no to ETP instead of letting this ` play out ' for a few weeks . ACLU , Amnesty International , Code Pink , Human Rights Watch , any number of environmental groups etc. . All these groups were so quick to make tweets and ask for money following Trump 's election -LRB- fair enough -RRB- but their priority should always have been to stand in the front line to protect people .
