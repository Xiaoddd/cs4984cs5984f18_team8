Photo courtesy of Ryan Redhawk Bismarck Tribune on Mar 28 , 2017 Authorities used news footage and social media , but did not interview protester witnesses , when they charged three men with endangering and terrorizing an armed pipeline security worker on Oct. . During a preliminary hearing on Monday , Bureau of Criminal Investigations Special Agent Scott Betz repeatedly referenced a KX News video and Facebook posts as he testified in support of charges against Brennon Nastacio , 36 , and Michael Fasig , 46 . Fasig and Israel Hernandez , 22 , who waived his hearing Monday , are charged with felony reckless endangerment and criminal mischief . Nastacio is charged with felony terrorizing . The men pleaded not guilty , and the case was set for trial in October . Nastacio allegedly walked toward the man with a knife . No charges have been filed against the security worker , Kyle Thompson , who disguised himself as a protester with a bandanna over his face in order to take photos of burning equipment and carried a loaded assault rifle and handgun in his unmarked truck , according to Betz . He also apparently tried to raise money on a GoFundMe account for repairs . After he was charged , Betz interviewed Fasig over the phone . Fasig allegedly told him that he was not the one driving the car . Betz said he identified Nastacio from the KX News video , where he apparently holds a knife up by his head for one to three seconds as he walks toward Thompson . One protester sent in a statement about what he witnessed just north of the main Oceti Sakowin camp , but Betz said he was unable to reach him when he left one phone message . Though Betz did not interview any protesters about the incident , he talked to Thompson , who indicated he feared for his life . Thompson said he drove to Highway 1806 to check on burning equipment . During this time , two vehicles struck his car , disabling it . He got out of the vehicle with an assault rifle he had in the truck and walked toward the water where he was surrounded by some protesters with knives , he told Betz . Betz said Thompson had the gun pointed down and did not fire it , though a crime lab investigation could not be certain . Betz said Thompson did not indicate why he fled the protesters or walked into the water . Defense attorneys Tyrone Turner and Bruce Nestor indicated in their cross-examination of Betz that they would argue at trial that the men feared for their lives and the lives of others near them . Turner asked .
