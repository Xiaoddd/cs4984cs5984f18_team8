I feel like lead has filled my veins , cement my bones , and my heart struggles with each passing second to break vital life force through . To stand in our faces and hold over us his victory like a bully on a tuft of sand . Except , our rights are worth fighting for , our water , our land , our air , our animals , our lives , our friends , our people , our music , our art , our vibrance : the fight has so much life within it , so much creativity , so much beauty . Watching YOUR truths this morning streaming through all over , and coming in through the night I felt so much power . Yesterday we saw candle light vigils , people gathering in solemnity . These students are our future and they are activating just like we are , in fact the entire world is not going to stand by and idly accept a fate drenched with destruction . Videos that have been pouring in from DC have shown of course a different tune than what mainstream media would have you believe : you need to start telling your family and friends that they are watching the wrong sources . Some Were Met With Mace , Tear Gas , And More : -LRB- LiveStream -RRB- The Opposition is present as well and around the country it may be more of a battle than in Los Angeles .
