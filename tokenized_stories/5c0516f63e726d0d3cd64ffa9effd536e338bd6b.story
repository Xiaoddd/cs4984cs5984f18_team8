-LRB- We are not affiliated with any candidate , political party or organization . We received numerous honks , thumbs up , and shouts of agreement from passers-by as we stood across from Marathon Petroleum Headquarters on S. Main Street of Findlay , Ohio . If you 've never peacefully protested before , it 's not scary . You 'll find it to be an exhilarating experience . Besides receiving positive feedback from motorists and pedestrians , we also were interviewed by local radio and newspaper reporters . We stayed on message and shared the story of what is happening at Standing Rock . It is amazing how well-received it was and how many expressed a similar outrage at what Marathon Petroleum and others were doing there . Remember : Water is life , and all life on our small planet is interconnected . We stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters at Standing Rock and elsewhere whose right to safe , clean water and land are being abridged in the name of dirty oil and the fossil fuel industry 's obscene profits . I 'll share more of our story later , but I want to encourage you to share your photos and stories of your Day of Action for the Dakota Access Pipeline . We Stand with Standing Rock by Cindy A. Matthews We ca n't stand still for the atrocities happening at Standing Rock . It is time to make some noise . Not unorganized , cacaphonous , grating noise but a unified voice expressing our outrage at how our rights , our health , the safety of our very water and land are being taken away without our permission . The example we should follow is from the Civil Rights Movement , that is , civil disobedience . Green Party candidate Jill Stein performed a perfect act of civil disobedience at Standing Rock . She has been charged with misdemeanor vandalism and trespass . She received national news coverage and numerous newspaper stories she otherwise would n't have received . Yeah , I know that 's not a catchy phrase , but I 'm certain you can come up with a much better one . And I 'm even more certain you can come up with ways to demonstrate your anger against the tyrannical one percent . Global Weeks of Action against the pipeline run from now until September 17th . Visit the website at nodaplsolidarity.org and take advantage of the media and outreach materials and an excellent list of links to nonviolent direct action resources . On Tuesday , September 13 , there will be a nationwide Day of Action with events throughout the country calling on President Obama to revoke the permits for this pipeline . Go to this link and enter your zip code to see if there 's an event planned near you . If there is n't , please consider starting your own . Tell your friends , family and neighbors to sign up as well . If you 're not able to travel or get out in public , other ways to help the cause is to write letters to the editor of newspapers , tweet , email and make phone calls to the companies and individuals responsible for the Dakota Access Pipeline in the first place . You 'll recognize a lot of them -- CitiCorp , Goldman Sachs , Sunoco , Marathon Petroleum , Phillips 66 . You might even find one of their places of business in your city . Plan a direct action event there if you can . The main thing to keep in mind is to stay on message . The people of Standing Rock are staying on message . Eventually . In all honesty , probably not . But we will see some change in the hearts and minds of our fellow Americans . Together , we will realize a better world for all . I may not get there with you . We will get to the Promise Land . But first we must stand together and stand tall with the water protectors of Standing Rock . Update 7 PM , 9-9-16 : Joint Statement from the Department of Justice , the Department of the Army and the Department of the Interior Regarding Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v . In short , the Army told the Corps of Engineers to halt -LRB- for now -RRB- . We 're not out of the woods yet , so keep up the noise . Do n't let them forget we 're not stopping until the Dakota Access Pipeline project is shut down for good . According to Brand New Congress : Just today , a judge denied the tribe 's request to stop construction of the pipeline . Fortunately , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers replied to that , and refused to authorize its construction on Corps land , but the tribe 's lands are far from being safe . The permits for the pipeline need to be fully revoked . Below are some of the ways we can all pitch in : Donate money or supplies directly to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe . Contribute to the legal defense fund for Sacred Stone Spirit Camp . Contribute to the Sacred Stone Camp gofundme page . If you are unable to donate or send supplies , you can : Call the North Dakota Governor at 701-328-2200 . Let him know what you think of what he is allowing to happen to these lands . Call the Army Corp of Engineers at 202-761-5903 . Demand that they reverse the permit for the building of the pipeline . The vast majority of scientists tell us that climate change is real , it is caused by humans and it is already causing devastating problems . They say that if we do not aggressively transition our energy system away from fossil fuels toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy , the planet we leave our children will be a much less habitable place . As a nation , our job is to break our addiction to fossil fuels , not increase our dependence on oil .

Watch this Facebook video and see what I mean . He is the corp puppet and our people who are many children and women simply singing praying and trying to defend their land , water rights under the UN Declaration of Indigenous Rights as well as treaties being broken AGAIN for corporate profits . Call the Energy Transfer Partners in TX which is the parent shill corp. in charge and who dispatched the attack dogs last weekend . 214 981-0700 .

ReplyDelete A J September 10 , 2016 at 2:12 PM Think of how the native Americans have been treated over centuries , forced off the land they were ` given ' by various governments greedy for resources and land . It 's still happening today . Think also of how many people live downstream of this project , the Rivers Missouri and Mississippi which millions derive their water supply .
