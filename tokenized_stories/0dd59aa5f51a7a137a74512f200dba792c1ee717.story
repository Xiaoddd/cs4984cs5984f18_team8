Instead , the Corps will undertake an environmental impact statement to examine alternative routes . Assistant Secretary Jo-Ellen Darcy said she based her decision on a need to explore alternate routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing .

Dec. 2 , 2016 -LRB- Photo by Joey Podlubny -RRB- Darcy said that the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an Environmental Impact Statement with full public input and analysis . Her office announced on November 14 that it was delaying its decision on the easement to allow for discussions with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , whose reservation lies just half a mile south of the proposed crossing . The originally proposed route would have crossed the Missouri River north of the state capital , Bismark , North Dakota , but the city objected due to the potential for an oil spill that could contaminate drinking water . Tribal officials have expressed repeated concerns over the risk that a pipeline rupture or spill could pose to its water supply and treaty rights . The Dakota Access Pipeline is a 1,172 mile pipeline that would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Pakota , Illinois . The pipeline is 30 inches in diameter and is projected to transport some 470,000 barrels of oil a day , with a capacity as high as 570,000 barrels . The pipeline is nearly completed except for the section under the Missouri River that is at issue . The proposed pipeline route would cross Lake Oahe , a large reservoir behind Oahe Dam on the Missouri River . An Army Corps of Engineers project , Lake Oahe begins in central South Dakota and continues north into North Dakota .
