Nation Instead of solidarity , celebration : DC protestors respond to DAPL halt Lindsay Clark , a 5-year Army veteran and University of Maryland student , stands in front of the Capitol during a Veterans for Standing Rock protest Monday . However , instead of standing in solidarity , the group celebrated as news broke the day before that the Army Corp of Engineers had blocked the permit for construction of a major part of the pipeline a half mile north of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe 's reservation , saying it would be rerouted . Veterans for Standing Rock was formed in November by a group of concerned citizens to express their solidarity with the treatment of protesters in North Dakota , who had gathered to stop the construction of the 1,172-mile pipeline they said would threaten local drinking water and sacred land . The protests , which started peacefully , ended with police reportedly using water cannons , tear gas , pepper spray and rubber bullets on unarmed protesters at Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota , according to a November report from Vice News . In addition to support from people across the country , actress Shailene Woodley and Green Party candidate Jill Stein were also among the demonstrators who traveled to Standing Rock Reservation during the protests that began months ago . Clark also noted it 's important for the group to stay focused as President-elect Donald Trump , who publicly supports the pipeline , will have authority to overturn the U.S. Army Corps decision , but has not yet stated if he intends to do so .
