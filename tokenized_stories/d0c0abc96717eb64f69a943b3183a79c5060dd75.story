-LRB- 1 -RRB- North Dakota has had hundreds of spills and leaks already . Each year US oil pipelines spill an average of 11 million gallons . -LRB- 2 -RRB- Any leaks in the DAPL would dump crude oil into the Missouri River , poisoning the drinking water of the tribes and communities along the Missouri River Basin , potentially 18 million people . -LRB- 2 -RRB- There have been 220 significant pipeline spills already this year . So once again , Native land that was given to them in a treaty , when the US stole their other land , is being used for corporate profit with no regard for the Sioux tribe or their water source . -LRB- 3 -RRB- I would prefer all pipelines and fracking be stopped around the country and instead we turn to the many alternative energy methods that have been held back by the corporations who choose to continue to rape our world for profit . I am so awed by all those at Standing rock , those who show up for a day or two , those who are dedicated to remain there until the water and land is safe , with tribes coming together from all over the country and the world , some of them historically enemies . And yet , they and those supporting them , have come together in peace , harmony , cooperation , prayer , ceremony and respect for each other and the land . We met at the Army Corps of Engineers office , setting up in front of the office park . I enjoyed being around others again and everyone was respectful and cooperative . The police who showed up were peaceful and supportive as well . There are several petitions going around to stop the pipeline , to declare Standing Rock a National Monument , and other sites where you can donate food , money or supplies to support those preparing for a long cold winter at Standing rock . Sadly , this Standing Rock issue is just one of many across the country that are looking to put pipelines , toxic mines , etc. , on Native Land , attempting to steal the land , and bringing poison to the land , water and people . movement and all the other fights to protect Native land , ALL land . Making signs . More people showing up to get in place along the road . Many cars supported the rally with honks and cheers , both sides of the road . Peaceful music to hold a sacred space . People moved into the center of the office park , near the Army Corp of Engineers office , to listen to speeches , songs and drumming . People gathered for the rally . Two great hand made signs . There were 500 collected.The post cards expressed a request to shut the pipeline down and support for Standing Rock . Donations were collected as well , to be taken up to Standing Rock . I loved the feeling that these rallies were taking place , on the same day , all across the country . situation . I do my work in person and long distance . I also offer workshops to companies in wellness , stress release , diversity , team building , communication and more .
