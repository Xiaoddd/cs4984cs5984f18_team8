The Enbridge Tower is pictured on Jasper Avenue in Edmonton . The band government voted to not renew easement rights of way for the pipeline that runs from Superior east across Michigan . The band also called for the decommissioning and removal of the pipeline from all Bad River lands and the river 's watershed . Blanchard told the News Tribune that the action was taken at a council meeting Wednesday . Bad River Band officials have directed staff to begin planning for the Line 5 removal project development and the environmental issues and hazards that exist with removal of old pipeline , including a health study , pipeline contents recycling and disposal and surface restoration . According to the band , 15 individual grant of easement rights of way for Line 5 expired in 2013 . The two sides have been in negotiations since then over renewing the easements . The band owns interest in 11 of the 15 parcels of land within the grant of easement rights of way , roughly parallel to U.S. Highway 2 . Enbridge , formerly Lakehead Pipeline Co. , has leased an easement for the oil line since the pipeline was laid in 1953 . Enbridge has responded to the band 's requests for information and negotiated in good faith for the past three and a half years . In addition to working toward a mutually beneficial agreement , '' the company said in a statement . The company said it 's weighing its options . It 's not clear if the pipeline could be rerouted around the tribal land . That was an option considered in 2009 when the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa considered not allowing Enbridge 's Alberta Clipper pipeline to cross reservation land in Carlton County . The two sides eventually agreed on an easement fee , however , avoiding a pipeline route that diverted around the reservation . The action comes as the ongoing dispute over the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota settles into a cold winter standoff , with both tribal rights and environmental activists protesting both the potential environmental damage from any spill and the movement of additional oil , the burning of which climate experts blame for global climate change . The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa has about 7,000 members . The reservation covers about 124,000 acres east of Ashland where the Bad River meets Lake Superior . Enbridge 's Line 5 has n't received much attention in the Northland compared to other Enbridge projects but it has become a focal point of concern in Michigan . Critics fear the line could pollute the Great Lakes where a segment of the line runs underwater at the Straits of Mackinac , which link Lake Michigan and Lake Huron .
