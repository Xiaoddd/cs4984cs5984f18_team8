Over the last three months , thousands of Native Americans and allies have convened in Cannonball , ND to support the Standing Rock Sioux tribe as they resist the construction of the pipeline . Now at Citibank , organizers have delivered a letter and are chanting while holding banners and signs inside the branch , interrupting business . Supporters outside the branch are handing out fliers to passersby that explain how Citibank is profiting from the Dakota Access Pipeline and that the bank is putting profits before human life and the right to clean drinking water by bankrolling the construction costs . The Dakota Access pipeline will cross multiple water sources , such as the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers , transporting as many as 570,000 barrels of crude oil daily . 17 million Americans including 28 tribes depend on the Missouri River . This pipeline threatens drinking water and will contribute to global climate change . Energy Transfer Partners , the company that is building the Dakota Access pipeline , has bulldozed sacred burial sites in order to move forward with construction . Over the last six months , the indigenous-led resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline has been attacked by security dogs , pepper sprayed , and shot with rubber bullets . Those occupying the Chicago Citibank at 2555 N Clark St. demand that Citibank stop funding the Dakota Access Pipeline project in support of those on the front lines of the resistance . The pipeline would allow this oil to be exported all over the world from the Bakken Oil patch in North Dakota . Over 40 acts of civil disobedience in support of the NODAPL land protectors have taken place around the country .
