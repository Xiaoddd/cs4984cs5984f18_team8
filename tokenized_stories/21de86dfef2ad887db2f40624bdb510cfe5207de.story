Below you will find songs , scripture or poems , and a short message to frame and guide your time in worship . Each week by Friday I will be publishing a new worship outline . The scripture used generally -LRB- though not always -RRB- comes from the weekly Revised Common Lectionary , connecting the Friends tradition to other Christian traditions around the world . For some of you this worship space may be a place of sanctuary when you are away from in-person worshiping communities . For others , this worship space may help you prepare for your weekly Sunday or mid-week worship . I suggest that you open each link in a separate window and play through the beginning of the songs to get over any ads , preparing for your worship time . -LRB- Though you may want to first check to see if ads play while the songs are embedded in the post . You may also want to have a candle and a journal nearby . Since this worship is designed in the manner of Programmed Quaker Worship , it includes a period of waiting worship . There are several communities around the world that host online unprogrammed Quaker worship , for which I have included links . These communities worship together at certain times each day and week , so you may want to plan your worship around theirs . If you would like to set up a regular time to worship through this site or if you have specific prayer requests to be held by my home worshiping community , please contact me through this site . If you would like to leave a message on this page , perhaps a message that rises for you during your worship , please comment below . Messages are filtered to counter spam attempts and it may take me up to 24 hours to approve a comment . Thank you for joining me in this weekly online Quaker programmed worship . May your time in worship be deep and faithful . Water is Life Centering Silence : Take a few moments to center yourself . Perhaps light a candle , find a comfortable place to sit and put away any distractions . Take a few deep breaths as you center yourself for this time of worship . Feel your body relax as your breaths become deeper . Turn your attention to the presence of the Divine throughout your body and throughout your life . When you are ready let the following worship elements guide your worship . Scripture : The whole Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin , traveling from place to place as the Lord commanded . They camped at Rephidim , but there was no water for the people to drink . But the people were thirsty for water there , and they grumbled against Moses . Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile , and go . I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb . So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel . It was about noon . The fact is , you have had five husbands , and the man you now have is not your husband . You Samaritans worship what you do not know ; we worship what we do know , for salvation is from the Jews . Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth , for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks . Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman . They came out of the town and made their way toward him . They are ripe for harvest . Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life , so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together . I sent you to reap what you have not worked for . So when the Samaritans came to him , they urged him to stay with them , and he stayed two days . And because of his words many more became believers . From Exodus we read about the Hebrews wandering in the desert after escaping slavery in Egypt . Their doubts arise when their immediate needs of food and water are not met . Moses never experienced slavery in Egypt nor experienced the hardships of famine and thirst . For the Hebrew people will die in the desert without it . Perhaps too , Moses realizes that he also is thirsty , and his own life as well as the lives of his people depends on the water . So Moses goes before God and requests a miracle . God instructs Moses to strike a rock with his staff and water begins to flow . It is an answer to the prayer and needs of the people . It is God responding , responding to the Hebrews that their lives matter . And thus this is story of need . It is a story of conflict and argument , and it is a story of resolution . It is story of engagement , engagement of the people with their leaders , engagement with power , and engagement with life . In the gospel text , we read another story about water . Here too , the setting is in the desert . Samaria is located between Jerusalem and Jericho , on the main road . It is a place with extensive irrigation and need for water conservation . Trips to the well , like the woman is making in these story , would have been a daily event , simply for the survival of her community . This story about water , takes place at noon , a hot and sunny time of day . It is a time when most people would not have been going for a water run . It is a time when outcasts would have been allowed to draw water for their families . A woman perhaps without a family in a culture where family was central . Samaritans differ from Jews . They share some textual and cultural tradition but they reject most of the religious structure of Judaism . Samaritans were and are a minority who believe in the Pentateuch , the first five books of the Hebrew scriptures , plus the book of Joshua . They believe that Moses was the only prophet . Like Jews , they wait for the Messiah . Samaritans do not see Jerusalem with the type of importance that the holy city holds for Jews , Muslims and Christians rather they view Mount Gerizim as their holy place . There are around 700 Samaritans worldwide today . Samaritans have priests instead of rabbis , and the priesthood is hereditary . Each family has their priest , supervised by a high priest . The oldest male member of each family fills the role of priest and focuses his time on religious matters while the rest of the family economically and socially supports him . A woman living without a husband and without a family would have been very unusual and looked down upon by her community . So here the story is set , with Jesus speaking to a Samaritan , a social outcast , and a woman -LRB- for in Ancient Orthodox Judaism , men would never speak to a woman without her family present -RRB- . Jesus defies political and social expectations as he has a conversation with this unnamed woman . They talk about the very heart of everything : God and water . As you can hear in the musical selections for this week , there is much attention given to God and water . At the end of February , only a few weeks ago , the camps at Standing Rock were forcibly shut down and cleared . Almost eleven months of non-violent resistance was carried out on that land , by people from all over the world , led by the native people of the region and members of tribes from across North America . All those who participated in the Standing Rock resistance challenged the political and social powers in order to protect the health , future , and existence of people and the planet . In each person who stood up against the building of the pipeline , there stood Jesus . In each person who has experienced social , political and economic injustice there stood the Samaritan woman . An in each person who joined the Standing Rock resistance there was a well to the source : to the source of Living Water , the spiritual incarnation in each and every person ; to the source of power to protect the physical land and its waters ; and to the source of Life , each life individually , humanity , and the world . As you center into the waiting silence , feel the water in your veins moving through your body . Feel the Living Water of the Spirit flowing from your source through our live and to the world . Silence-Waiting Worship : This is a time for you to turn your attention fully inward . The songs and passages and the offered message have prepared you to listen deeply to the Divine . Spend at least 20 minutes in silence listening for that still small voice of God . You may want to join an online waiting worship community . A few links for these can be found below . Take a few minutes to journal these afterthoughts so that you can look back at them another time . Perhaps God is speaking to you through these partial messages and the fullness of their meaning will be revealed in time . Joys and Concerns : It is traditional in Programmed Quaker Worship to have a time for the sharing of joys and concerns . Take a few moments to write down in your journal a few things from this week that you are thankful for and a few things that you are holding in prayer . Feel free to post these in the comments below as well -LRB- though remember that it may take up to 24 hours for them to be available to others to read -RRB- so that others can include your requests in their prayers and celebrate your joys alongside you . Closing : Take another few moments of silence to close your worship time . Breath deeply and give thanks for your time in worship today . Fill me with your passion for justice and your strength to join the resistance . Bring my awareness to my thirst for your vision for a new world . Let the Living Waters flow in and through this hurting world , transforming and forming us into something new . Double-click here and select a page to feature its content .
