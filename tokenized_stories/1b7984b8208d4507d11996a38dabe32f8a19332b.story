The mining company , through a court order , has claimed these indigenous territories without prior consultation or consent from the affected communities , who have lived there for hundreds of years . The land allocated for the project covers over 41,000 hectares and the forced evacuation of other Shuar communities is expected . Since the August eviction , the county of San Juan Bosco has been militarized to quell protest . In November , several Shuar people attempted to reclaim the indigenous territory of Nankints within the San Juan Bosco county . Clashes broke out with police and military personnel guarding the mining camp , leaving several injured . The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador -LRB- CONAIE -RRB- , and the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon -LRB- CONFENIAE -RRB- , called for dialogue with the Government to avoid further confrontations but no resolution was reached . On Wednesday December 14th , a new confrontation took place in the mining camp , leaving one police officer dead and others wounded . After these events , the Ecuadorian Government announced a state of exception throughout the Morona Santiago province , stripping residents of the rights to freedom of movement , freedom of association , freedom of assembly and inviolability of the home , among others . The Government also deployed over 700 elite soldiers and policemen , military tanks , trucks and helicopters to San Juan Bosco to join the existing military presence there . According to witness testimony , army rifle blasts have caused women and children to seek refuge in the mountains . Military personnel and police are patrolling the streets in armoured vehicles . The community is in a state of terror . An online petition has been addressed to key decision makers in the Ecuadorian Government demanding : the demilitarization of San Juan Bosco and dialogue to avoid further confrontation and acts of violence . adherence to international law and the Ecuadorian Constitution , both of which forbid the presence of military personnel in indigenous territories and require prior , informed and free consultations before the implementation of mining or oil projects . Protests in solidarity with the Shuar people have been mobilized in cities across Ecuador . The film presents information about the Chinese copper mine and its potential impacts on the environment ; shows the biological and cultural diversity that is at risk ; and presents some of the perspectives of the local people and other Ecuadorians about the mine project .
