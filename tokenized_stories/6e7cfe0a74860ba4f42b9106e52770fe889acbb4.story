During my week-long visit to Standing Rock in January 2017 , I listened to many water protectors speak about the shady tactics used against them by private security contractors and local law enforcement to undermine their protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline . I heard stories about DAPL security companies trying to infiltrate protest camps and instigate rifts between activists . I heard about organizers being followed and indigenous activists seeing planes , helicopters , and drones above their camp , surveilling their protests and recording their movements and activities at all hours . I heard indigenous people describing their home being turned into a war zone . TigerSwan operates worldwide and specializes in armed conflict zones . According to the new revelations , the company utilized militaristic counterterrorism tactics against anti-DAPL protests not just in North Dakota but in several other states as well , including South Dakota , Illinois , Iowa , and Texas . The militarization of American policing has long been a problem , even before the protests in Ferguson when the issue captured national headlines . In these documents , we see irrefutable evidence of the deployment of private military contractors to suppress legitimate and peaceful protests and activities . While the new documents may not provide enough detail to determine whether TigerSwan has crossed the line of illegality , its operations and reports are ominous and should deeply trouble all Americans . Their collaboration with federal , state , and local governments requires a credible and independent investigation . Unfortunately , the current Department of Justice and Civil Rights Division , under the direction of Attorney General Jeff Sessions , has demonstrated a deep hostility towards police accountability and reform . Even the limited actions taken by the Obama administration to curtail the militarization of American policing are in real jeopardy . The working group called for a prohibition of state and local law enforcement agencies from acquiring certain offensive military equipment , like tanks and bayonets . It put policies in place that governed the use of things like drones and mine resistant ambush protected vehicles -LRB- MRAPs -RRB- . The militarization of American policing has also been internationally condemned by human rights bodies . Next week in Geneva , the U.N. special rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association will present a report on his 2016 visit to the United States , which harshly criticizes the militarized response of police to legitimate protests : The Special Rapporteur is also concerned that it has become commonplace for police to respond to peaceful demonstrations with military-style tactics , full body armour , and an arsenal of weaponry suited more to a battlefield than a protest . While the Special Rapporteur is sensitive to police concerns that they must be properly equipped to deal with potential unlawful activity , he is convinced that the widespread militarization of police needlessly escalates tensions and provokes equally aggressive reactions . Protesters are not war enemies and should never be treated as such . It is ill advised to use military equipment to manage activities so fundamental to democratic societies . They should make us all concerned about the future of militarized and private policing and the serious threats they present to our most fundamental freedoms and human rights .

Leave this field blank Not surprised The white man , and others , have been using these tactics against native peoples since the whitemans boats landed . The native man , who 's ancestors crossed the land bridge , have been subjugated to death or conversion ever since Jesus was introduced to America . I 'm not trying to make this religious , but the conquistadors priests led them carrying crosses for the Indians to fear and subject themselves to . Convert or die was the message , Jesus was the reason . Christianity is at fault for the downfall of native peoples , the United States whiteman just used the opportunity to continue destroying what was already being decimated . A free , relatively peaceful native man was slaughtered on his own land so the whites could farm and ranch preparing for the arrival of the rest of their invading species . The use of military equipment by the whiteman is not new and will continue until he realizes this is not what his Jesus meant . reply June 2 , 2017 7:42 PM JoewithaPHD Hatred runs deep with you . I suggest that you look at that in yourself before you call it out in others . That seems illogical to me . One of the things that is universally understood in history is that Christian missionaries in British North America helped prevent bloodshed between the colonists and the natives . Intermixing and religion -LRB- in the Spanish empire -RRB- further skew the numbers , but those reasons are in a small minority . Please read good scholarship on the history of Native American during the colonial period rather than listen to stories that have been passed down for a long time . For professional historians , their book is exceptionally readable for laypeople . What he is doing is trying to use length of time and false history to justify the invaders and killers of the Indian . Yes many of us died from diseases , but the vast majority were victims of relocation and ultimate genocide . The whiteman refuses to admit the lie . It 's holocoust denial . Do n't be bullied by their deitys , their money , their perceived power , or their false claims on your land . You are taking the whiteman money hand and fist in your Casinos . Be careful when they start complaining because they are becoming poor , they will try to shut you down . June 3 , 2017 6:23 PM Re : joe phd After 1815 , the United States intensified its efforts to expand . To do so , it adopted a policy , formally institutionalized through the Indian Removal Act of 1830 , of moving all Indians living east of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory -LRB- the modern states of Kansas and Oklahoma -RRB- . As measured by lives lost , Indian removal was far more destructive than the earlier period of war . Consider the three largest Indian nations east of the Mississippi , the Choctaws , Creeks , and Cherokees , each with approximately 20,000 people . During the removal process in the 1830s , approximately 2,000 Choctaws , 4,500 Creeks , and 5,000 Cherokees perished , mostly from intersecting factors of disease , starvation , exposure , and demoralization . Smaller nations north of the Ohio also suffered significant losses through removal . A reported forty-three Potawatomis in a group of eight hundred died as they traveled from Indiana to Kansas , while sixty Wyandots , mostly young children , in a group of seven hundred died from disease shortly after their arrival in the West . June 3 , 2017 7:27 PM Anonymous I 'm bound to catch flack for this . At best the are Warosapiens or Killosapiens or Hateosapiens . But not Homosapiens . Humans who act like humans are homosapiens . June 4 , 2017 8:45 PM Anonymous I 'm sorry . I 'm studying with my son what has been done and is still being done to the native people . I 've found the white mans account to be lacking and one sided but we are learning from the native point of view and I find our history more than appalling . Right now we 're studying the words of Joseph Medicine Crow and I will say the enlightenment is heart breaking . It was my grandparents that arrived from Germany and Norway long after the invasion but what has happened in my lifetime still sickens me . Fortunately in my community our tribes have very strong community support and they are an intrical part of planning the future of all of us together living as one community , protecting our environment and caring for each other as one but it did n't start happening until we , ` the white man ' , pulled out our head because without their knowledge of this land we would have killed it and fortunately some of us noticed that that was happening so again I say I 'm sorry but I 'm hoping my response gives you some hope and relieves a small part of your anger knowing that some of us are awakening .
