Construction will be stopped and the pipeline will not go under the Missouri River . -LRB- Full statement can be read below -RRB- . The corps had given permission to pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners , but in September it said more analysis was warranted in the wake of American Indian concerns . Jo-Ellen Darcy said she based her decision on a need to explore alternate routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing . Her office had announced on November 14 , 2016 that it was delaying the decision on the easement to allow for discussions with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , whose reservation lies 0.5 miles south of the proposed crossing . Tribal officials have expressed repeated concerns over the risk that a pipeline rupture or spill could pose to its water supply and treaty rights . The Dakota Access Pipeline is an approximately 1,172 mile pipeline that would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Pakota , Illinois . The pipeline is 30 inches in diameter and is projected to transport approximately 470,000 barrels of oil per day , with a capacity as high as 570,000 barrels . However , it was becoming increasingly clear he was punting this issue down the road . Roads , bridges , transmission lines , pipelines , wind farms and water lines will be very difficult , if not impossible , to build when criminal behavior is rewarded this way . In my conversation with Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy today , she was unable to give any legal reasons for the decision and could not answer any questions about rerouting the pipeline . I feel badly for the Corps of Engineers because of the diligent work it did on this project , only to have their Commander-in-Chief throw them under the bus . Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is praising the decision . Sanders says the country should not increase its fossil fuel dependence and accelerate the crisis of climate change . The pipeline still remains in limbo . The incoming administration already stated its support for the project and the courts have already stated twice that it appeared the Corps followed the required process in considering the permit . For the next month and a half , nothing about this project will change . For the immediate future , the safety of residents , protesters , law enforcement , and workers remains my top priority as it should for everyone involved .
