Petition Closed TD Bank : TD withdraw your investments from the Dakota Access pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- This petition had 133 supporters TD Scholars started this petition to Bharat Masrani and 1 other TD must withdraw its investments from the Dakota Access pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- , an unjust project that violates the sovereignty of the Standing Rock Sioux Nation . The DAPL would transport 570,000 barrels of crude oil a day across the Missouri River less than a mile upstream from Standing Rock Sioux territory . The construction of the pipeline would destroy Sioux historical and sacred sites , while the pipeline itself would put the drinking water of 18 million people at risk of contamination . This pipeline was originally routed through Bismarck , a predominantly white community , but due to concerns around drinking water contamination , it was re-routed to travel just upstream of Sioux territory , instead endangering the drinking water of Indigenous people , prompting many to call this an act of environmental racism . Although their protest has been peaceful , they have been ruthlessly abused by law enforcement officials . Militarized police have unleashed dogs on peaceful protesters . They have detained protesters in dog kennels , and used tear gas , rubber bullets , and strip searches . On November 21 , The Guardian reported that over 300 protesters had been injured after police deployed water cannons in freezing temperatures , with 26 people hospitalized due to bone fractures and hypothermia and one 21-year old woman facing possible arm amputation after police threw a concussion grenade at her . The United Nations and Amnesty International have both condemned the ongoing human rights abuses at Standing Rock . TD Securities has made one of the largest commitments to DAPL among major banks and financial institutions , contributing over 360 million dollars towards its construction . Given the injustices faced by Indigenous peoples in Standing Rock today , it is imperative that it translate its commitments into actions now and show leadership in defending social justice in the international community . Last week , TD completed a call for high school students from across Canada to apply for the Scholarship for Community Leadership . Water protectors in Standing Rock have called for peaceful actions in solidarity with their protest . We challenge TD to listen to the demands of the Standing Rock Sioux , issue a public statement to denounce the human rights violations taking place at Standing Rock , and withdraw its investments from the pipeline .
