Story TOpics Dakota Access Pipeline Little Creek Camp Indigenous Iowa Robert Rotter Christine Nobiss Vanessa Dundon , who goes by Sioux Z Dezbah , moved to the Little Creek Camp in Iowa after months of activism at the North Dakota pipeline protest . She was injured at the bridge standoff in November . But after the collapse of the Dakota Access protest in February , Christine Nobiss of the Indigenous Iowa blog returned to the Hawkeye State and founded the Little Creek Camp , a collection of tents and teepees dedicated to keeping the spirit of Standing Rock alive . Not all of those farmers are interested in their help . The 14-acre property is owned by Max Hilton , who lives elsewhere but agreed to allow Ms. Nobiss to set up the Little Creek Camp on his plot , which now houses as many as 20 activists . They are on the land with permission by the owner . Tents , teepees and campers are scattered throughout the woods . Other camps formed in the wake of Standing Rock have appeared in Oklahoma , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , South Dakota and Texas , with mixed results . The Crystal Water Camp in Florida has shut down . She and her two young children live about a half-hour away , but she is still in charge . Vanessa Dundon , a Navajo who goes by Sioux Z Desbah and whose right eye was injured during the Nov. 20 clash between protesters and police in North Dakota , said she is using Little Creek as a base from which to visit and speak at other camps . Her typical day is quiet . Still , even a small band of left-wing activists can cause a stir in Iowa County , a farming community of about 16,300 . In the November presidential election , 59 percent of county voters opted for Donald Trump . At the other end is Defend Iowa , a Facebook page that monitors the camp and has raised concerns about waste disposal issues , drones and drug use . A sign in front of the camp gives notice about ban drugs , firearms and alcohol . Defend Iowa has consulted with Nate Netizen , who produced a documentary about the impact of the Standing Rock protest on the Bismarck community . The group has pointed to posts from activists encouraging others to come to the camp , raising fears about crowds of protesters descending on the area . Standing Rock drew thousands to the wide-open North Dakota prairie , but Little Creek as configured would be lucky to hold 100 . In some cases , however , the activists have been their own worst enemies . Defend Iowa has posted videos from Little Creek that have fueled alarm , such as one in which an activist showed off his bulletproof vest . A fundraising plea from another asks for money for night-vision goggles . In another , Ms. Nobiss called Mr. Trump a terrorist . Raising funds Fueling suspicions was the vandalism this month of the Dakota Access pipeline in Ottumwa , about an hour south of Williamsburg . Authorities are still investigating . As with Standing Rock , the philosophy on nonviolent versus militant activism is fuzzy . The camp depends on fundraising , but so far crowdfunding on sites like GoFundMe has been slow . Before the Iowa Supreme Court is a lawsuit filed by 14 landowners challenging the use of eminent domain to build the underground pipeline through their property . The court ruled Thursday against an appeal by Dakota Access LLC to dismiss the case . One neighbor who has befriended the activists is Roxanne Larsen-Veigelt , who lives across from the camp . She said she took in two young women during a windstorm this year and recently came by on her Kawasaki four-wheeler to drop off marigolds and zinnias . In her opinion , the fuss over the camp has been overblown . Click here for reprint permission .
