There , thousands of Native American protesters have been encamped to stand in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and to rally against the construction of the pipeline on sacred tribal land . Dogs and handlers from Frost Kennels , based in Hartville , Ohio -LRB- down near Canton , close to Mount Union -RRB- became entangled with protesters on Saturday , September 3 , after protesters broke through barriers and the Frost dogs became aggressive , barking at and biting several demonstrators . Welch 's personal information was subsequently released by the hacktavist collective Anonymous , spurring a deluge of hate mail directed at Welch and at Bob Frost , who owns and operates the kennel . Frost said he and his crew returned to Ohio two days after the publicized confrontations at the pipeline . And he rejected the idea that his dogs were trained to be vicious toward protesters . That 's not gon na kill us , but our dogs are gon na bark when people run at them . That 's what they 're trained to do . But no children were bitten , he stressed . Frost said he was upset reading claims that he and his company were racist , particularly toward Native Americans . My father-in-law 's 100 percent . Kiss my ass ... In Ohio , private security firms must be licensed by the state 's department of public safety . Geoff Dutton , who oversees Ohio DPS 's Private Investigator Security Guard Services -LRB- PISGS -RRB- , confirmed that Frost Kennels is n't among the 800-plus companies licensed in the state . That has no bearing on work outside Ohio , but Frost Kennels currently is n't licensed in North Dakota either , at least not according to the current listing of license holders from that state 's Private Investigation and Security Board -LRB- PISB -RRB- .
