His latest hire is Don McGahn , right-hand man to corrupt former GOP House leader Tom DeLay Heather Digby Parton November 29 , 2016 1:03 pm -LRB- UTC -RRB- The news media finally seems to have caught up to the notion that Donald Trump 's international business dealings just might create a bit of a conflict of interest when he 's serving as president of the United States . It 's a very similar notion . The idea is that the president 's job is so unique that normal rules and laws do not apply . But in theory I could run my business perfectly , and then run the country perfectly . And I was actually a little bit surprised to see it . But I would like to do something . Trump clearly did n't listen . Of course , McGahn also had been the lawyer who advised him that the scheme was legal in the first place . In 2016 he joined the Trump campaign , and he will now be White House counsel . The idea that this man is going to give Trump guidance on how to deal with conflicts of interest in an ethical manner is laughable . His career has been spent counseling his clients on how to do the opposite . Like Steve Bannon , Michael Flynn and Jeff Sessions , it 's yet another example of Trump hiring the worst person in America for the job . It 's almost as if he 's trolling America , just messing with our heads for the fun of it . And like nearly all forms of trolling , it 's not funny at all .
