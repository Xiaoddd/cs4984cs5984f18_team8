You would expect her to sound exhausted , but on a recent December day , with freezing , punishing winds whipping across the plains and snowdrifts piling up around her , she was exuberant . Braun is a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe and a community organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network . That movement was a historic , sustained civil rights action that led to real change : On December 4 , the Army Corps of Engineers blocked the portion of the project that was near Standing Rock land by denying an easement requested by Energy Transfer Partners , the company behind it . ETP has been ordered by the Army Corps to seek an alternate route . The International Indigenous Youth Council for Standing Rock was founded by a young woman named Jaslyn Charger . Women led numerous demonstrations at the site , standing toe-to-toe against police from all over the country and private security hired by ETP . At the hands of law enforcement , they endured threats , tear gas , rubber bullets , freezing cold water from pressure hoses , mass arrests , and forced strip searches when being taken into custody on minor charges . The most serious injury sustained at Standing Rock was by a non-Native woman , Sophia Wilansky , whose family says police threw a grenade at her and nearly severed her arm . The pipeline was her time to stand up , she adds . Advertisement The fight was even more personal than land ownership for Allard . She has 18 grandchildren and gave birth to three sons .

That trip , she was also one of a group of demonstrators who were attacked by police with tear gas and water hoses on November 20 , in one of the ugliest incidents of this winter . Byars was teargassed , and still suffering from the after-effects weeks later . She tried to go for a run a few days after returning . I can still taste that chemical taste in my mouth and my nasal cavities . Byars says she and others suffered from chemical burns on portions of their skin that was exposed . This is real .

Advertisement Native women were also among the thousands of veterans who descended on the camp recently to support the water protectors . Marisa Van Zile lives in Michigan and is an enrolled member of the Sokaogon Chippewa band of Lake Superior Indians . She joined the Army as a 27-year-old single mom looking for a reliable way to provide for her family , and recently completed an eight-year contract . She visited Standing Rock on several occasions , traveling with both other Native women and other vets . When the news came , she had just finished bringing donations over to the Sacred Stone camp with a group of other women before breaking for lunch . I know what this feels like . She points to the Wisconsin-based Ho-Chunk nation , who have been fighting to keep their ancestral burial mounds intact even as mining companies try to destroy them to reach copper deposits underneath , or mining under the Menominee River , damaging the ancestral lands and water of the Menominee tribe . She sees them as a religious and spiritual struggle as much as a political one . LaDonna Brave Bull Allard -LRB- C -RRB- of Cannon Ball , North Dakota , talks with Maj. Gen. Donald Jackson of the Army Corps of Engineers during a demonstration against the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline outside the Corps headquarters November 15 , 2016 in Washington , DC . It can not go through the water anywhere . We have a lot of male allies who came and stood with us . So we still have a lot of work to do . Joye Braun , the community organizer , sees Native women as having an innate and spiritual connection to water that informs their environmental activism . In the midst of the fight against the now-defeated Keystone XL pipeline , Braun says her 22-year-old daughter , who suffers from tonic clonic seizures , had what their family consider to be a prophetic vision . And behind the children were the animals .
