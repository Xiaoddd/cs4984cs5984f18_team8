Photo by Joseph Zummo . Last week , Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault and the tribal council voted to disband the camps . On Tuesday , President Trump signed orders to try to fast-track not only the Dakota Access pipeline construction but also to restart the Keystone XL . Activists across the nation immediately protested . Journalist Jenni Monet , a member of the Pueblo of Laguna in New Mexico , has been covering the Standing Rock situation since last summer and has been at the camps since early December . I asked Monet to describe how the water protectors are taking this succession of events . The memos , while more symbolic than substantive , have helped set a tone in his administration , promoting a fast-tracked system toward implementation of such energy projects , as opposed to a thorough Environmental Impact Statement study and review process that is only beginning with regard to the Dakota Access pipeline . The tribe feels any violation of this step is unlawful and disregards treaty rights that have been acknowledged by the U.S. Army . Among the network of encampments , it was business as usual , with people chopping wood and cleaning up the massive amounts of debris that others have left behind . Perhaps two dozen people walked to the Backwater Bridge blockade to pray , a demonstration that lasted less than an hour . And by late afternoon , it appeared that several cities worldwide had heeded this call . As seen on Facebook , live streams captured mass demonstrations from coast to coast . In Los Angeles , Seattle , Chicago , Washington , D.C. , and New York , to name a few . And so , the tribe has been fully prepared for a Trump challenge . As early as the first week of January , Chairman Archambault along with state and environmental officials began expressing concern over a known flood plain come spring where the majority of water protectors remain camped out , including the Oceti Sakowin and Rosebud camps . Yet , the founder of the Sacred Stone camp and Standing Rock tribal member , LaDonna Allard , has said that she will keep her camp open . According to Allard , the entire encampment , where as many as 1,500 people have lived at one time , is held on lands owned privately by her and her extended family . You are welcome to come back and you are welcome to come stand with us . The tribe has been fully prepared for a Trump challenge . But it seems the majority of water protectors are seeking ways to stay . The 44-year-old California man arrived in August battling drug addiction . That must be a low point for morale and organization . I have seen this movement at its height , in terms of people power . And with the number of people who remain at the camps presently , I often find myself wondering whether the dynamics were similar to before the movement grew , in the early summer months . I can only speak to the fact that the winter months have brought a sense of survival I have not yet witnessed until now . Propane trucks arrive on Fridays and the lines are long to fill them up . People stand sometimes three hours or longer to wait to fill their small tanks to last them for the week . One delivery arrived in the morning and the supplies were gone within a couple of hours . Despite the executive memos and the call to leave , there are many people in the camps who are making plans to move elsewhere , either to Sacred Stone or onto private lands in the surrounding area . The notion is that as long as the DAPL crews remain , so too will the water protectors . No Paywall . No Ads . Just Readers Like You . You can help fund powerful stories to light the way forward .
