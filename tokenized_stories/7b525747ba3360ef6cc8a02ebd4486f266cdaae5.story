First is the wish for the well-being and a high quality of life for your grandchildren . The second is that my wife and I are closing our accounts with Citizens Bank . These two seemingly disparate subjects are related . For months , there has been a standoff between the indigenous people of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota and their supporters on one side , and those backing the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on the other . The Native Americans are blocking the pipeline with the goal of protecting their water and the water for millions of people downstream , their burial grounds and their land under their treaty rights . On the other side , the DAPL is buttressed by an enormous accumulation of wealth and political power . Now the Trump administration has jumped in with both feet on the side of the banks and oil companies . My wife and I are joining with people around the country who are withdrawing their accounts from the banks supporting the pipeline . Specifically , this pipeline is going through land that by treaty belongs to the Sioux . The U.S. has historically made treaties with the American Indian and then has systematically broken those treaties , taken more land and made more treaties which were again broken . We have used our economic , military , legal and police powers to abuse and marginalize these people . We want to be part of a country that treats all its people with respect , integrity and honesty . One way to do that is to oppose the pipeline . The Sioux are aware that pipelines break and leak . The native Americans rightly want to protect their water and the water for all the people living downstream on the Missouri River , but also implicit in their stand is the recognition that clean water is more important than oil . They are not just attempting to block a pipeline , but are sounding an alarm that the fracked oil these pipelines carry is an assault on the entire ecosystem that sustains all life . They are warning us that our present patterns of behavior put us on an unsustainable trajectory of destroying the interconnected web of life on which we are all dependent . The indigenous people have always had a sense of the sacredness of the earth and through that a closer relationship with other forms of life on the planet than we Caucasians have had . Their culture has recognized the relationship and interdependency of all forms of life . They have seen other life forms as being their brothers and sisters who need to be treated with care . In this time , when before our eyes , the climate and life on our planet is changing even more rapidly than the scientists predicted , these disrespected native people who have been pushed to the fringes of society , appear to be the ones with the wisdom and courage to sound the alarm and lead us toward a sustainable vision of life on our mother earth . However , as officers of a bank , these spiritual values may not be persuasive for you . So , in monetary terms , we are already paying for climate change . Extreme weather events that are intrinsically a part of global warming are already costing many billions . We are already paying for extreme weather events of larger and more powerful hurricanes , droughts , longer lasting and massive wildfires caused by droughts , microburst rain storms with heavy rainfall causing floods , and much more . With extreme weather events come extreme costs . One would hardly know how to estimate all the costs for abnormal weather events we have witnessed in recent years . Your children and grandchildren will see these events increase in frequency and intensity , and in one way or another will be paying for them . The profit Citizens Bank may earn from the pipeline investments will mean destruction and massive costs for the country and the planet . However much you love and want good things for your grandchildren , the investments that you are making through Citizens Bank in these oil companies are creating an unlivable world , undermining life on the planet and , subsequently , the life that you want for your grandchildren . Exxon , now Exxon Mobil , has known since 1977 that carbon dioxide from oil causes climate change . Yet Exxon executives covered that up and denied what they knew to be true . As the decision makers of Citizens Bank , I encourage you to choose a different moral path . Invest in industries that will heal the earth . Become a bank your grandchildren will be proud of . Be leaders you can be proud of .
