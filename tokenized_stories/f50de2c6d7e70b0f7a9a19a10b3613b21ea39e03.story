and Edward Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- . The lawmakers sent the missive after a federal appeals court on Sunday denied a request to halt construction , and the pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners vowed to continue building despite a request for a temporary moratorium from the U.S. Department of Justice . In addition to the risks the pipeline poses to Native American communities , Thursday 's letter continues , it also threatens the stability of the climate . The letter is published in full below . -- Dear President Obama : We are writing to respectfully request that you direct the Army Corps of Engineers to require a full environmental impact statement for the Lake Oahe crossing of the Dakota Access Pipeline that includes meaningful tribal consultation . In light of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to reject the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe 's request for a temporary halt to construction , the project 's current permits should be suspended and all construction stopped until a complete environmental and cultural review has been completed for the entire project . We applaud your administration taking action to deny the authorization of construction on Army Corps-owned land and under Lake Oahe pending a review of prior decisions under the National Environmental Policy Act and government-to-government consultation with the tribes . In addition , we appreciate the administration 's decision to reassess the way the federal government incorporates tribal concerns regarding permitting decisions more broadly . This is a longstanding problem , and these efforts must bring about long overdue , meaningful change . Unfortunately , the pipeline company , Energy Transfer Partners , is committed to completing construction , despite a request from the U.S. Department of Justice for a temporary halt to construction around Lake Oahe . Over the past several weeks , hundreds of Native American tribes have mobilized in unprecedented solidarity to draw attention to the pipeline 's encroachment on sacred lands . Nationally , there has been a groundswell of opposition to the project . The pipeline 's construction is not only a violation of tribal treaty rights , but has the potential to cause more damage to sacred land . Until there has been full and meaningful tribal consultation , all pipeline permits and easements should be revoked or denied . In addition , not unlike the Keystone XL pipeline , the Dakota Access will have a significant impact on our climate . All fossil fuels infrastructure projects of this significance must be subjected to a test to consider the long term climate impacts . As such , there must be a serious consideration of the full potential climate impacts of this pipeline prior to the Army Corps of Engineers approving any permits or easements for the Dakota Access pipeline . According to Oil Change International , the Dakota Access pipeline would have the same impact on the planet as adding 21.4 million more cars to our roads , or 30 new coal plants . We support the tribes along the pipeline route in their fight against the Dakota Access pipeline project . It is imperative that the Corps ' permitting process be transparent and include public notice and participation , formal and meaningful tribal consultation , and adequate environmental review . Until that occurs , construction of this project must be halted . If there is one profound lesson that indigenous people have taught us , it is that all of us as human beings are part of nature . We will not survive if we continue to destroy nature . Thank you for your consideration of this important matter .
