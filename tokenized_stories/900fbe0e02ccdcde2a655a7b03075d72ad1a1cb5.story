The flight departed this morning from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to Reagan National Airport in Washington , D.C. , powered by a 20 percent blend of the new , sustainable biofuel sourced directly from the Pacific Northwest . NARA is a five-year initiative that unites 32 member organizations from the academia , aviation , private industry , and the government , that came together under a USDA grant to demonstrate the viability of producing alternative jet fuel from forest residuals . Swissport fuel manager Jarid Svraka fuels an Alaska Airlines flight powered with a 20 percent blend of biofuel made from forest residuals in Sea-Tac Washington on Nov. 14 , 2016 . Gevo Vice President of Regulatory Affairs Glenn Johnston holds a sample of the biofuel , which the company made by converting cellulosic sugars derived from wood waste into renewable fuel . Flight 4 departed Seattle Tacoma International Airport at 8:20 a.m. on Nov. 14 , 2016 . NARA partners send off the first commercial flight powered by forest residuals .

The biofuel used on Alaska Airlines flight 4 comes from excess forest residuals collected from sustainably managed forests owned by Weyerhaeuser , the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe and the Confederated Salish Kootenai Tribes . The flight departed Sea-Tac Airport in Washington on Nov. 14 , 2016 . While traditional forest practices leave some of the harvest materials behind to replenish soil nutrients and provide cover , the excess forest biomass is usually is piled and burned . The biofuel used in this flight was made from excess forest residuals collected from both sustainably managed forests owned by Weyerhaeuser -LRB- OR -RRB- , the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe -LRB- WA -RRB- , and the Confederated Salish Kootenai Tribes -LRB- MT -RRB- , as well as rejected wood fibers from Cosmo Specialty Fibers -LRB- WA -RRB- . Using forest residuals for biofuel feedstock is exciting because it does not compete with food production ; air pollution is cut by reducing slash pile burning ; removal of residuals prepares the forest floor for replanting ; and the new industry of woody biomass collection and conversion helps create jobs in rural economies . Also , forest residuals are abundant and can be sustainably supplied from private lands . Sustainable alternative jet fuels reduce greenhouse gas emission by 50-80 percent over the lifecycle of the fuel - from growth of the feedstock , transportation to a processing facility and production . The actual emission reduction depends on the type of feedstock used . Alaska Airlines flew two more flights in June using a blend of biofuel produced from the non-edible portion of sustainable corn .

Ann Goos November 14 , 2016 Thank you Alaska Airlines for your commitment to research , collaboration , working with universities , and advancing green solutions to address global challenges . It gives me hope to see an Airline that truly cares about our keeping our beautiful earth clean for our children to be able to cherish . THANK YOU Rick November 14 , 2016 Good way to go aal . lyricsexpress November 15 , 2016 You should consider Hemp as your biofuel source . It is sustainable , provides a large amount of fuel at lower costs , and also provides other resources while providing soil Remediation in areas that may have radiation or need cleanup . You would be helping the world in so many ways if you would switch to Hemp . If you need information or access to qualified professionals in my industry , please contact me . Meki Cox Cannabis Integrity Authority junyong zhu November 17 , 2016 logistic of hemp is very difficult due to density . You just made this 75K very proud . junyong Zhu November 17 , 2016 I am very delighted to see my technology : from wood to sugar became reality . It is a home run for me abecause I was trained in aero engine combustion , but had a career change to forest product . PB November 17 , 2016 This is fishy . Once it is produced , it is nearly chemically indistinguishable from typical jet fuel . For stable combustion in air , you need aromatics in pertroluim . may be future , this ratio can be increase . jtfftj November 20 , 2016 Just curious . Possibly a State like Maine could also produce this fuel since they have since they have a lot of forest land also .
