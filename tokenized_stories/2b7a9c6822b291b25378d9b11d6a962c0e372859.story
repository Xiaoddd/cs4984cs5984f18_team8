That shift toward clean energy , which Archambault says began about a decade ago , involves change on the individual , community , and commercial levels . During the ceremony , indigenous leaders also acknowledged that while demonstrations on the ground at Standing Rock had ceased , many protesters are still facing charges . Two weeks after the executive order , Archambault was on his way to Washington to meet with William Kirkland , the White House deputy director of intergovernmental affairs , when he received notice that the Army Corps of Engineers had terminated the environmental-review process and would issue a permit for the highly contested Lake Oahe easement .
