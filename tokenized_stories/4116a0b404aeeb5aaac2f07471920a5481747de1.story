United States War and Imperialism History Facebook Icon Twitter Icon Email Icon Print Icon Remember the Massacre at Wounded Knee By Peter Cole On this day in 1890 , the US Army murdered as many as 300 Native American men , women , and children . A mass grave after the Wounded Knee Massacre at Wounded Knee Creek , South Dakota in 1890 . When a disagreement erupted , army soldiers opened fire , including with Hotchkiss machine guns . Within minutes , hundreds of children , men , and women were shot down . Perhaps as many as three hundred killed and scores wounded that morning . Few Americans now know that the deadliest shootings in US history were massacres of native peoples . Today is the anniversary of the largest such massacre . By 1900 , about two hundred thousand remained , nearly all consigned to remote wastelands in the interior west that elites considered worthless . Few US citizens or European immigrants lived in the vast interior until after the Civil War . Then , thanks largely to the US government , millions streamed westward aboard government-financed transcontinental railroad lines . They hoped to live independent lives and , just maybe , get rich . The government and citizenry considered the lands that Indians had lived upon for millennia to be the property of the United States . Plains Indians also were promised some money and food rations to replace their buffalo hunting and semi-nomadic lifestyles , which their entire culture was based upon . Most Indians despised these treaties and only agreed to them under the threat of violent extermination . The Great Spirit gave us hunting grounds , gave us the buffalo , the elk , the deer , and the antelope . After the Civil War , dozens of Indian nations found themselves trapped between destructive government policies and ongoing settler invasion . Not surprisingly , many Indians resisted . So throughout the 1860s , 1870s , and 1880s , the United States engaged in dozens of wars against the Arapaho , Kiowa , Comanche , Nez Perce , Bannock , Apache , Ute , Blackfoot , Navajo , and others . The most well-known such war took place between the United States and Lakota Sioux -LRB- with Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho allies -RRB- in the Dakota , Montana , and Wyoming territories . In response to settler incursions and to defend their homeland and lifestyle , the Sioux raided white settlements , intimidated federal agents , and harassed miners , settlers , and railroads . That can never be . This region must be taken from the Indian . -LRB- In 1980 , the US Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians that the taking of the Black Hills , in fact , had broken the Fort Laramie Treaty and awarded the Sioux compensation . When most refused , the Army dispatched troops to the Little Bighorn River basin in south central Montana . Shortly thereafter , Custer underestimated his Sioux and Cheyenne enemy , divided his too-few troops , and attacked a huge encampment of several thousand warriors . Stunned by this defeat , the Army redoubled its efforts to defeat the Lakota , committing thousands more troops to this war . One by one , bands of Indians were forced to surrender and confined to reservations . Sitting Bull , cleverly , relocated with his people to Canada , in 1877 , where the US Army could not follow . However , in 1881 , after years of hunger due to the steady extermination of bison , Sitting Bull and his people returned to the States and surrendered , the last Lakota band to do so . The Sioux ended up in Pine Ridge and four other reservations scattered across South Dakota , North Dakota , and Nebraska . And , now , they were starving . Many remaining Plains Indians , including Sioux , sought solace and answers in religion . As the Ghost Dance spread like wildfire , Army officials worried that this religious revival could lead to a Sioux uprising . To squash this possibility , the Army ordered the arrest of Sitting Bull , a rallying point of the Ghost Dance , where he lived on the Standing Rock Reservation . But Sitting Bull refused to go quietly , resisted arrest , so was shot and killed . The Army rounded up the starving and freezing natives , with Chief Big Foot suffering from pneumonia , and had them make camp at Wounded Knee . US soldiers , numbering perhaps five hundred , commenced disarming the Indians the next morning . One can imagine the tension , the Ghost Dance having sparked a renewed sense of pride and empowerment among the defeated Sioux . The Army was tasked with keeping the Sioux pacified and confined to reservations . Sitting Bull had been killed two weeks prior ; now , the Army sought to arrest and disarm another band of Sioux warriors . In the scuffle that ensued , a shot rang out . Instantly , US soldiers opened fire with their weapons including the four Hotchkiss machine guns . Among the most powerful weapons of the era , the Army had used these against Indians previously . Not only did the machine gunners target warriors scrambling for what weapons they could find , they also raked teepees full of children and women . Those running towards a nearby ravine also were cut down . Though the Indians mostly had been disarmed , some still possessed weapons or grabbed some from those already confiscated . While the machine guns mowed down the defenseless , people scattered in every direction . Soldiers , no longer following orders or discipline , chased down and killed any Indian , armed or not . Army general Nelson Miles visited this killing field a few days later . They were buried in mass graves . Twenty-five US soldiers died , too , many quite possibly from friendly fire . When I look back now from this high hill of my old age , I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw them with eyes young . And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud , and was buried in the blizzard . There is no center any longer , and the sacred tree is dead . It could be seen as the deadliest mass shooting in US history . The Shoshone were shot , stabbed , and battered to death . About 175 unarmed Blackfeet were murdered , the great majority children and women . These and other mass Indian killings remain unknown by the great majority of Americans . Wounded Knee -LRB- and Bear River , Sand Creek , and Marias -RRB- simply do not exist in the collective memory of non-natives . Native lives still do not fit into the larger narrative of US history . Of course , Indians have not forgotten . In 1973 , two hundred members of the American Indian Movement -LRB- AIM -RRB- , a militant civil rights organization partially styled after the Black Panthers , returned to Wounded Knee to demand the federal government live up to nineteenth-century treaty obligations . Two years later , another clash between AIM and federal law enforcement on the Pine Ridge Reservation left two FBI agents dead and Leonard Peltier found guilty of first-degree murder , though he always has maintained his innocence . Currently , his supporters including Amnesty International , which claims his trial was unfair , hope for clemency from President Obama during his final days in office . They walk or run nearly two hundred miles , from the location of the killings , now a National Historic Site , to the state capitol building in Denver . Unfortunately , many Americans do not know of Wounded Knee and other indigenous massacres . In fact , as Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz reminds us , Native Americans have not disappeared even if their role in US history is forgotten . During the past few months , the inspired and inspiring actions of the Standing Rock Sioux have compelled all Americans to acknowledge Indian existence and resistance . They also demonstrate what an indigenous-led , multiethnic social movement can look like . Sitting Bull would be proud of these water defenders , his descendants . Past and present , the Sioux and other American Indians have charted a path of defiance and independence despite genocidal efforts by European conquerors and American settlers .
