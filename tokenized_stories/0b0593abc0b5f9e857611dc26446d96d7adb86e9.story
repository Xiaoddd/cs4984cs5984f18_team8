-LRB- We are not affiliated with any candidate , political party or organization . Whether the stock market or worker productivity goes up or down , the vast majority of us are still scrambling to make a living , keep a roof over our heads , food in our stomachs , and once-in-a-blue-moon see a medical professional without filing for bankruptcy . It 's also death blind . It 's misery and starvation and destruction blind . It does n't see people or happiness or art or beauty . The country of Bhutan does n't measure Gross Domestic Product . It measures Gross Domestic Happiness . They focus on the welfare of their people and how content and taken care of they are . Her grandfather was African-American , and she never knew it . Only in a country where the color of your skin determines where and how well and how long you may live is this nugget a news story . It appears that without DNA testing people of color are given less than their due in the realm of making history as early explorer and leaders . A recent unveiling of a bust of what Queen Neferiti might have looked like shows she was a green-eyed , white chick instead of an Egyptian royal . Funny that . We are not as we appear . Going beyond race , which is often a code word for what we 're really wanting to discriminate against , we find in America that class does matter -- even while we pretend we have no class system . To put it simply , being poor kills . Being stressed out about being poor , becoming poor , dealing with poverty and fearing poverty kills . Yet we pretend to be a wealthy and prosperous nation , and we export movies and television programming full of successful and fabulously wealthy individuals as if this is the norm . They 're not buying it anyways . They 've seen the results . They do n't go bankrupt when they get a cancer diagnosis or suffer a car accident . It 's simply something that would never occur to people in other countries . And now the statistics show they live longer than us , too . We 're not as we appear . We need to stop pretending . We need to work on our perception of reality and then work on changing our ways to make them one and the same . For the better , that is . A place between being a slave to the corporations and being so rich you do n't care about anything but having even more . Something between keeping drug dealers , criminals and terrorists out of our country and building a multi-billion dollar wall . The rich always -- and will always -- use the politics of divide and conquer for no other reason than to keep us working for them and lining their pockets . The rich will take a stick and stir up different ethnic , religious and cultural roups till everyone is fighting and no one trusts anyone else . The rich can then do whatever they want and no one will notice . But the corporations do n't want you to pay any attention to that because , if you do , it might cut into their profits . They do n't care what it does to humanity or the planet . Do n't let them win . Do n't be part of the hate . There is no place in an informed society for racists , sexists or homophobes , but maybe make sure someone really is one of those things before you attack them for something they said . Ask them what they meant . Do n't just assume they were being evil . Let 's go back to the place in the middle . Rebuild our middle class . Quit thinking only in terms of black and white and start to explore the gray . Learn to not give in , but to be willing to compromise . BIO : Selina is Editor-in-Chief of Yard Dog Press and an author . Take Action with the Sierra Club Ohio state bills want to smear fracking waste fluids all over Ohio 's roads for deicer . Take action now State bills want to smear fracking waste fluids all over Ohio 's roads for deicer . Act now to stop it . Ohio lawmakers are working on yet another scheme to benefit the oil and gas industry at our expense with Ohio House Bill 393 and Senate Bill 165 . This means hazardous waste could be sold in stores and spread on our roads as a deicer by the Ohio Department of Transportation -LRB- ODOT -RRB- . Oil and gas waste is dangerous . Spreading it on roads and highways exposes Ohio communities and waterways to carcinogens and other dangerous chemicals . Tell your Representatives to vote NO on House Bill 393 and Senate Bill 165 . ODOT has been using processed oil and gas waste as a road deicer for years . Yet , no state agency has fully evaluated the effect this practice has on our health . Instead of protecting Ohioans , this bill takes away requirements for local government approval . The bill would even forbid Ohio 's Department of Natural Resources from ever making any rules to protect the environment and public health from these chemical concoctions . Oil and gas waste put Ohio 's public health , safety , and the environment at risk . Please act now to protect Ohio from fracking waste . Yours in protecting Ohio 's health and environment , Cheryl Johncox , Sierra Club Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign P.S. . After you take this action , help spread to your friends and followers on social media . As you know , a number of states -LRB- including my state of Vermont -RRB- have decriminalized or legalized the possession , use and sale of marijuana in recent years . Under the Obama Administration , the Justice Department took no action against these states or the people in those states . However , the Trump Administration has taken a very different stance with Attorney General Jeff Sessions threatening to prosecute . That would be a huge mistake and move us in exactly the wrong direction . Here 's why : Millions of Americans have had their lives impacted by the federal prohibition on marijuana - arrests , convictions and even jail time . Even when people do n't go to jail , the criminal record they receive makes it harder for them to find a job , get housing or go to college . It sure is . In 2016 alone , over half a million people were arrested for marijuana possession . These harmful impacts are felt far more acutely in communities of color and poor communities because enforcement of marijuana laws is much stricter there than in more affluent , white communities . Incredibly , African Americans are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana even though marijuana usage rates are basically the same across racial lines . Of course , marijuana prohibition is part of a larger failed war on drugs that has led to the great national crisis of mass incarceration . Some 1.5 million people were arrested for a drug related offense in 2016 - over 80 percent of which were for possession alone . We need to stop criminalizing addiction . We need to stop criminalizing recreational marijuana use . The criminal justice system is not the answer to drug abuse . Addiction is a health problem and we should start treating it that way . That 's absurd . We need to get our priorities right . And that starts with making our voices heard : Sign my petition if you agree it is long past time for the government to end its failed war on drugs and instead invest in programs that focus on treatment and prevention of drug abuse . This is an important issue that impacts almost everyone and we should all make our voices heard . This so-called war on drugs has led us to have over 2 million people in prison - disproportionately poor and from communities of color . Our incarceration rate is the highest in the world - higher even than authoritarian countries like China , Saudi Arabia , and Russia . Further , what is not often discussed is how the war on drugs and mass incarceration is impacting the essence of our democracy . People with felony convictions can not vote in many states . Today , for that reason alone , over 6 million Americans are denied access to the ballot . Uneven enforcement and the fact that people of color receive longer sentences for the same offenses than white defendants means more felony convictions in those communities . And that means - surprise , surprise - fewer voters . In other words , the war on drugs is robbing those minority and lower income communities of their political power . In Florida , Kentucky and Tennessee over 20 percent of voting age African Americans are disenfranchised because of felony convictions . It 's not too hard to figure out what 's going on here . The communities most impacted by these policies are systematically stripped of their ability in our democratic system to politically fight back . You know the reason . The sad truth is that some politicians benefit from people not being able to vote . All too often these are the same politicians who are trying to disenfranchise voters in other ways , such as restrictive voter ID laws or extreme gerrymandering . This has got to change . We need the highest voter turnout in the world , not the highest incarceration rate . We need to provide treatment for people with substance abuse problems , not lock them up . As a first step , we need to remove marijuana from Category 1 of the federal Controlled Substances Act where it is currently ranked alongside drugs like heroin . In fact , marijuana is classified more harshly than cocaine . That does n't make any sense . Let 's have states decide the issue of marijuana for themselves like they do with alcohol . More and more states are moving in the direction of decriminalization . Let them make those decisions without federal interference . Let 's invest in the prevention and treatment of substance abuse . Let 's reform our criminal laws and take other steps to dismantle mass incarceration . Among other steps forward we need to ban private prisons and create new federal policing standards . Let 's restore the voting rights of all Americans . If you share my goal of making these important reforms please sign this petition : Sign my petition if you agree it is long past time for the government to end its failed war on drugs and instead invest in programs that focus on treatment and prevention of drug abuse . This is an important issue that impacts almost everyone and we should all make our voices heard . Last year , over 50 bills were filed in state legislatures across the U.S. aimed at criminalizing protest . Two oil industry-sponsored bills were just filed this session , in Iowa and Ohio , that single out and target pipeline activists . Just days ago , a subcommittee of the Iowa Senate Judiciary Committee advanced legislation that would criminalize peaceful protesting of oil and gas pipelines . A similar bill in Ohio seeks to stop activists from using drones to monitor the progress of pipeline construction . We need to push back against these egregious bills designed to prevent people from speaking out against pipelines , and we want to know if you 'll join us . This is n't the only attempt to squash your civil liberties . These worrying trends mean that everything from tweeting to gathering together with other people to discuss your views about fossil fuels could be at risk . The oil industry is attacking our fundamental rights to speech and assembly . We have to fight to make sure legislative efforts to criminalize protest are stopped for good . Iowa and Ohio are merely a part of a broader program led by corporations that feel emboldened by the Trump Administration and are eager to protect their profits at the expense of our communities and environment . These new bills are being lobbied for by the oil industry , including companies like Energy Transfer Partners , Koch Industries , and the American Petroleum Institute . If we do n't stop this now , we could see our right to free speech further eroded across the U.S. Today the full Iowa Senate Judiciary Committee will gather to debate the bill , and we must double down in our resistance . Let your Governor know right now that the chilling of speech could mean the warming of the planet . We need your voice to be heard against these wealthy special interests . Fifty years ago this month , some 1,300 African American sanitation workers faced a pivotal moment when the tragic deaths of Echol Cole and Robert Walker helped spark the historic Memphis sanitation strike . Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. soon joined the AFSCME members in demanding recognition of their union , basic safety standards and a decent wage . Undercutting our right to organize exacerbates the racial wage gap and starves the unions that give communities of color a voice against corporate interests . They are asking the Supreme Court to strip our freedom to speak out together for fair treatment , better wages and safe working conditions . Before the end of the week , we need 20,000 people to speak out . Just one rule : Be polite . This means no profanity or cursing . No shaming or hate speech . No threats or silliness .
