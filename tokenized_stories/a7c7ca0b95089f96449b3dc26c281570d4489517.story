So when state regulators here said Monday that the project could proceed , their decision was initially seen as a hard-won validation for President Trump and the American laborer , and lamented as a grave threat to pristine farmland and the groundwater below . TransCanada , the pipeline company , later issued a short statement that did not say whether it would move forward with construction , leaving people on both sides of the issue unsure of how to react . Over the course of two presidencies , Democrats and environmentalists have stood against the pipeline at every turn , making it a potent emblem of a broader battle to stave off climate change and protect drinking water , an effort that included the mobilization of thousands of protesters last year to oppose a different pipeline in North Dakota . Just as persistently , Republicans , business groups and labor unions have long pressed the Keystone XL proposal as a proxy for wider goals of creating jobs and expanding the energy sector . The newly approved route for the pipeline is slightly longer and brings potential challenges for the company , which would need to negotiate new easements with landowners not along the preferred route . TransCanada had already paid many landowners along the preferred route for access to their properties . TransCanada officials declined an interview request . Later , President Barack Obama used a case pending before the Nebraska Supreme Court as a reason to delay deciding on a federal permit . Mr. Obama later rejected that permit , citing climate change , but Nebraska opponents remobilized this year when Mr. Trump resurrected the project . But supporters of the project have long touted its economic benefits , and seemed to win over the majority of the Nebraska Public Service Commission , the regulatory board that voted 3-2 to approve the alternate route . But in between , the alternate route veers east to follow the path of an existing pipeline , a switch that regulators say could make emergency responses to either pipeline more efficient . Opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline , including many farmers and ranchers , had packed the small hearing room on Monday for the announcement . When the vote was tallied , some landowners learned that their land would no longer be on the pipeline route and voiced relief . Others discovered that a path through their property had been approved . Even before the decision , some questioned whether there would still be enough interest among oil shippers to support the pipeline . But TransCanada reiterated its support of the project in early November . But now the company must consider the new route , the potential for new legal challenges and a different political landscape . Since then , smaller demonstrations have targeted pipeline projects in Minnesota , Wisconsin and Texas .
