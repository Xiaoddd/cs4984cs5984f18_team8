To every meadow be a shower of grace , to every tree the water of life ; be as sweet musk to the sense of humankind , and to the ailing be a fresh , restoring breeze . A ceremonial camp , intended to hold a prayerful intention for protecting the sacred waters and standing up to civil rights abuses both present and historical , it now holds thousands of people . The original camp , Sacred Stone , sits farther east , actually on reservation land . Once you pull into the main entrance -LRB- after smudging with sage -RRB- , you drive down Flag Avenue , where each indigenous nation and country has posted a flag . As far as I know , this is the largest gathering of indigenous people in American history , and the first time the seven bands of the Oceti Sakowin have gathered since the Greasy Grass Battle in June of 1876 . Oceti Sakowin Camp The first thing you really hear when you arrive is all the building . Tipis , military tents , and yurts are going up all over the place . Kitchens and mess halls are being extended and insulated . Compostable toilets and green shower stalls are being built . But when they come back they need food , a place to warm up , a place to get their wounds treated . People are needed to watch and stoke the sacred and council fires . A young guy came over and invited us to his tea yurt . Inside it was warm from an energy efficient stove , cozy with blankets and pillows and good conversation . This guy spends all day building in the camps , and at night he makes and serves delicious tea to anyone , and listens to their stories . If we hold enmity with life , we are ingrates , for our material and spiritual existence is the outward evidences of the divine mercy . Therefore we must be happy and pass our time in praises , appreciating all things . There are issues as there would be with any group of up to 5,000 people , particularly under such stressful circumstances . Even in the tea yurt we could hear a stream of ambulances and the constant low flying planes from DAPL security . Everyone has the same goal , even if some of the tactics are different . written by Husayn Allmart , a husband and a father of three -LRB- including twin boys -RRB- , creates content that explores our spiritual and material lives for the Office of the Treasurer at the U.S. Baha'i National Center . I too was struck by a real Baha'i feeling . All races , all ages , all religions , the inclusiveness was palpable . People working for the common good . 0 Reply Rosslyn and Steven Osborne Dec 10 , 2016 Thank you Husayn for this wonderful insight to what it is to feel and be amongst these desperate folk trying to save their very existence , yet again from destruction . I have encouraged family to support them through petitions . From watching the few video clips I felt it necessary to do this , as a Baha'i . We must stand together with each other and especially with our indigenous brothers and sisters of each country . Wonderful of you to describe the prayerful and comrade of all groups aiming peacefully for the same goals . 1 Reply Nancy Dinnigan Dec 09 , 2016 Thank you for being there . In the spirit of unity , there are many who would have gone if they could . I 'm really glad that you did . 1 Reply Pamela Hollows Dec 09 , 2016 Thank you for sharing your experience . I have n't heard any official Baha'i perspective on the protest and have wanted to know more about the spirit involved . It seems to be more than that . 0 Reply Husayn Allmart Dec 09 , 2016 You know I do n't know that we have a word to describe it in English . The founders refer to them as ` prayer camps ' , and that 's really what they are . Prayer is suffused in the daily life of the camp and informs all the actions taken . There have been ` direct actions ' to slow construction , but that does n't encapsulate all that has happened . I would have given anything to be standing with these People this time .
