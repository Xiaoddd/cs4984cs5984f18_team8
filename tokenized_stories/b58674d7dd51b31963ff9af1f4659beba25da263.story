This is what I know : art is power I just celebrated a decade birthday . I carry that awareness with me most days . And I want to be using my privilege to help others . During the height of the Dakota Access Pipeline demonstrations in South Dakota , I found myself painting ferociously . I struck and scratched and layered the canvas , expressing my deep concerns and frustrations in paint . I was thinking about these indigenous people of our country , demonstrating day and night , being brutally treated as they peacefully stood up for their land and water . Painting was one of my responses to their plight . I intend to go through with that plan . Classes started up again last month . I feel fortunate with the timing . Perhaps it will give you some solace as well . Here goes ... 5 ways to deal , through art There are always things that intrude upon our lives right , much of it stressful and disturbing . I wanted to offer a project that would be sensitive to this daily turbulence . The journal aspect is its responsiveness to changing emotions . The artwork itself can take the form of a book ; or discreet pages ; or canvases . It can take the form of pages that are placed into some kind of container or folder , or hung on a wall , or even one large piece that allows for emotional vicissitudes . It can be personal or worldly . You can write quickly , just allowing the words to come . No need for judging . The fears can be small or large . 2 . Make art about your fears After writing , take a bit of time to draw around those feelings . I used oil pastels since they can easily convey emotion in a stroke , but any quick medium will do . The best way to express emotion in your artwork is to embody the emotion while you work . Allow yourself to totally be in the fear and release it onto your page . Your work can be completely abstract or representational . Whatever feels right . Let judgment go . Breathe . Try this : 1 . I hope 2 . I hope 3 . I hope 4 . I hope 5 . I hope 6 . I hope 7 . I hope 8 . I hope 9 . I hope 10 . I hope 11 . As with your fears , your hopes might be personal ; about the greater world , or both , and can be small or large . You can use the same medium or any other you like . Embody your hopes , like you embodied your fears . Allow yourself to be hope . Express your emotions through line , shape , curves or imagery . This is just for you . A few of my responses to current events 5 . Write what you know We all know things . Your knowings may be large or small . Play whatever music you enjoy making art to . 1 . I know 2 . I know 3 . I know 4 . I know 5 . I know 6 . I know 7 . I know 8 . I know 9 . I know 10 . I know 11 . I really know Now take your time to draw about what you know deeply , in your heart and soul . Express your knowing in movement , shape , softness , boldness , shades of color , wild movement , purposeful sweeps ... Anytime is a good time for art making If you find that writing or art helps you deal with the stresses in your life , remember that . Keep them in your toolbox for dealing with life , and return to them whenever you need to . Art and writing are there for us always , and are a true path to solace . With warm regards , and hope for the future . - Lauren For more from Lauren , including classes , art coaching , and other helpful posts , please visit LaurenRaderArt.com .
