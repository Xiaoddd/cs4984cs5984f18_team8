I 've observed that the true political spectrum in our society does not range from right to left , but from top to bottom . This is how America 's economic and political systems really shake out , with each of us located somewhere high or low that spectrum . Essentially , it 's the continuation of America 's democratic revolution . It encompasses and extends the creation of a government that is us . Few people today call themselves populists , but I think most are . I 'm not talking about the recent political outbursts by confused , used and abused Trumpian ranters who 've been organized by corporate front groups to spread a hatred of government . Rather , I mean the millions of ordinary Americans in every state who 're battling the real power that 's running roughshod over us : out-of-control corporations . With their oceans of money and their hired armies of lobbyists , lawyers , economists , consultants and PR agents , these self-serving , autocratic entities operate from faraway executive suites and Washington backrooms to rig the economic and governmental rules so that they capture more and more of America 's money and power . You can shout yourself red-faced at Congress critters you do n't like and demand a government so small it 'd fit in the back room of Billy Bob 's Bait Shop , but you wo n't be touching the corporate and financial powers behind the throne . In fact , weak government is the political wet dream of corporate chieftains , which is why they 're so ecstatic to have Trump out front for them . But the real issue is n't small government ; it 's good government . This is where populists come in . You would n't know it from the corporate media , but in just about every town or city in our land you can find some groups or coalitions that , instead of merely shouting at politicians , have come together to find their way around , over or through the blockage that big money has put in the way of their democratic aspirations . Also , in the process of organizing , strategizing and mobilizing , these groups are building relationships and creating something positive from a negative . This is the historic , truly democratic , grassroots populism of workaday folks who strive to empower themselves to take charge economically as well as politically . With the rebellious spirit and sense of hope that has defined America from the start , these populists are directly challenging the plutocratic order that reigns over us . It 's necessary to restate the solid principles of populism and reassert its true spirit because both are now being subverted and severely perverted by corporate manipulators and a careless media establishment . These debasers of the language misapply the populist label to anyone who claims to be a maverick and tends to bark a lot . That 's not populism ; it 's rank hucksterism , disguising plutocrats as champions of the people . And it is important that we call them out on it . Nobody Really Knows .
