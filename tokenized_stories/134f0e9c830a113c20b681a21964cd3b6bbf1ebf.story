Subscribe to tune in every week . The Government Quietly Just Approved This Enormous Oil Pipeline Four reasons why people are outraged . Subscribe to our free newsletters . The Bakken Pipeline is only seven miles shorter than Keystone XL would have been . It took seven years of protests , sit-ins , letter writing , and , finally , a presidential review to prevent the Keystone XL oil pipeline from being built . According to the firm , the Bakken Pipeline will transport up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil per day . The US Army Corps of Engineers gave its blessing at the end of July , clearing the final hurdle for the massive infrastructure project , which is slated to be operational by the fourth quarter of 2016 . Not so fast , says professor David Swenson , associate scientist in the Department of Economics at Iowa State University . Swenson crunched the numbers himself and came to a much more modest conclusion : 1,500 jobs total per year in Iowa for the course of construction . And given that most of these jobs are skilled , Swenson expects many of the hires will be from out of state , as Iowan contractors specializing in large-scale underground pipe-fitting and welding are scarce . The long-term forecast for job creation is even bleaker . The Des Moines Register reports that there will only be 12 to 15 permanent employees once the pipeline is completed . It also runs through sacred Native American lands -LRB- more on this below -RRB- . Enbridge Inc. , a stakeholder in the Bakken pipeline , has a speckled track record on spills . In 2010 , an Enbridge pipeline spilled 1.2 million gallons of crude into the Kalamazoo River , one of the worst inland spills in American history . These projects are subject to environmental assessments every five years . ETP asked the Iowa Utilities Board to grant it the powers of eminent domain , the process by which a government can repossess private property for public use even if the private property owner does not voluntarily sell . The IUB , a three-person committee appointed by Republican Gov. Terry Branstad , granted ETP that right for its for-profit private pipeline , a practice that is not uncommon , in order to purchase 475 parcels from resistant landowners . This has led to numerous pending lawsuits , with the Des Moines Register reporting that the issue may make it all the way to the Iowa Supreme Court . In May 2015 , ETP was embroiled in scandal after a contracted land agent , working on behalf of the Bakken Pipeline , allegedly offered an Iowan landowner a teenage prostitute in exchange for voluntary access to his property . DisRezpect : The pipeline will cross through sacred lands and pass under the Missouri River twice . For the Standing Rock Sioux , the Missouri provides drinking water and irrigation , while its riverbanks grow innumerable plants of cultural import , including sage and buffalo berries . Now , even though the Corps has given the go-ahead , the tribe has not given up the fight . They recently filed suit against the Corps in federal court . The acts appeared to be intentional incidents of monkeywrenching . The police ultimately broke up the demonstration , resulting in at least five arrests .
