Activists Are Concerned By Laura Hankin Jan 23 2017 Share Those protesting the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline have been worried for some time now that the Donald Trump administration would reverse President Barack Obama 's order to block construction . On Monday , it looked like those worries were well-founded . The White House confirmed in a press conference with Press Secretary Sean Spicer that President Trump is moving forward with the Dakota Access Pipeline . It 's good for economic growth , it 's good for jobs , and it 's good for American energy . Protestors were thrilled back in early December , when the Department of the Army announced that it would not continue with construction as planned for the controversial pipeline . But with Spicer 's comments , the environmental and cultural victory seems likely to be short-lived . The reversal is not surprising . Trump had previously said that he supported finishing the construction of the pipeline . Trump reportedly has owned stock in multiple companies that are building the pipeline . Yet it is unclear how much of that stock he has sold off . Rick Perry , Trump 's nominee for energy secretary , also sat on the board for two energy companies developing the Dakota Access pipeline , although Perry told ethics officials that he had resigned , and would be divesting from the stock he still owns in the companies within three months of his confirmation . All in all , it 's not looking good for those concerned about the environmental and cultural effects of the pipeline . But if the past is any indication , the activists and protestors wo n't give up anytime soon . protesting the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline have been worried for some time now that the Donald Trump administration would reverse President Barack Obama 's order to block construction .
