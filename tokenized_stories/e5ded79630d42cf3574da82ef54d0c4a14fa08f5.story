Vandals cut hydraulic hoses and electrical lines , broke windows and spray painted messages on backhoes and bulldozers , though the pipeline itself did not appear to be damaged , said sheriff 's spokesman Lonny Cavalier . Supporters say it will be a safe , necessary and lucrative way to bolster Louisiana 's energy economy , while opponents have argued that it has already destroyed wetlands and threatens to leak oil and endanger drinking water once complete . A federal judge previously halted work in the Atchafalaya Basin , though an appeals panel overturned the decision . He said deputies are still investigating , though the company has blamed environmental extremists based on some of the spray painting . Company officials declined to say what was spray painted on the construction equipment . Local environmental groups have fought Bayou Bridge in court and once held a demonstration not far from the vandalism site . During the earlier protest , three pipeline opponents sat on a portion of pipeline , briefly blocking work but causing no damage . Both sides have accused the other of hypocrisy . Pipeline builders argued that damage to equipment or infrastructure can actually harm the environment , though they did not delve into whether that was at issue in the recent case . Rolfes fired back that if Energy Transfer Partners , which owns Bayou Bridge , cares so much about the environment it should bring down the number of spills the company reports .
