Don Pollack , an Evanston artist whose cross-country bicycle trip brought him face-to-face with Standing Rock and its people , is gathering and delivering supplies to keep them warm and fed . Pollack , an adjunct associate professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago , has partnered with northwest suburban Trickster Art Gallery to collect blankets , winter gear and nonperishable food , which he will load in a cargo van and drive to North Dakota in early January . Native Americans , environmentalists and veterans have joined forces to stand against a project that would bulldoze sacred sites and put the Missouri River at risk of contamination , should the 1,172-mile pipeline leak . Many of them view the Army Corps ' December permit denial as a temporary victory at best . I 'm not going anywhere until I see the drilling equipment leave . Pollack led a team of scientists , teachers and other artists on a two-month , 3,000-mile bike ride from Chicago 's Indian Boundary Park to Cape Disappointment , Wash. , in 2015 . A wound on the land is a wound to our body and our emotional state as well as a scar on the Earth . One of his fellow bicyclists was Mark Cleveland , a musician who is part Cherokee and a board member at Trickster , a Native American-owned and - operated art gallery in Schaumburg . Cleveland connected Pollack with Trickster CEO Joe Podlasek , who 's been raising money to purchase tents and other supplies for the folks camped out at Standing Rock . -LRB- Podlasek shuns the term protesters . Podlasek is collecting wool blankets , hats , gloves and coats , as well as nonperishable food , at his gallery .
