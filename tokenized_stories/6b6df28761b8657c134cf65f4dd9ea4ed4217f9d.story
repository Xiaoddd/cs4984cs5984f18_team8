Share story By Lynda V. Mapes Seattle Times environment reporter As winter bears down on the Great Plains , a showdown also looms as thousands of veterans from around the country head to North Dakota vowing to be human shields between police and opponents trying to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , which leases the lands for grazing , has also ordered the camp closed to all public access as of Dec. 5 . Both explained that the threat of winter to public safety required their action . However , if campers stay , it is at their own risk , officials say . Winter temperatures can plunge into single digits during the day and below zero at night . Snow and cutting wind also arrived this week . About the DAPL protest The Trump administration has advanced the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipeline projects . And here 's what we 're reading related to the controversy . March 28 : What the completed Dakota Access pipeline means for key players . Feb. 22 : Preparing to leave , Standing Rock protesters ceremonially burn camp . Feb. 1 : Hundreds rally as the Seattle City Council considers divesting from Wells Fargo because of its role as a Dakota Access Pipeline lender . The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says it will push back . Emergency services to the camp will not be guaranteed per the evacuation order from Gov. Jack Dalrymple , unless approved on a case-by-case basis by the state Highway Patrol or the Morton County sheriff . Protesters vow to stay , and some 2,000 veterans are expected to arrive Sunday to join the fight by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its allies against the Dakota Access Pipeline . Developer Energy Transfer Partners of Houston has yet to obtain the easement it needs from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to cross under the river and finish the project . No construction or drilling work is under way on either side of the river , said Gary Sanders , sheriff for Emmons County , across the river from the protest camp . The only people on site now at the drilling pads are security , as Dakota Access waits for the easement to let it get drilling under the river , Sanders said . Opponents want to stop the project altogether . Some fear more violence , even death , as confrontations have escalated , most recently on Nov. 20 when police clashed with demonstrators , sending 26 people to the hospital . Some 300 people were treated for chemical contamination and hypothermia after being tear-gassed , hit with pepper spray and rubber bullets , and sprayed with fire hoses in freezing weather . Lonnquist said she fears worse to come . But being on that bridge and watching them purposely give us hypothermia not once but for six hours , I would grab a patient by the jacket and just crunch through a sheet of ice . Veterans Stand for Standing Rock will take its direction from tribal elders , said Marshal Hunter of Seattle , who coordinated veterans scheduled to leave from Seattle on Friday night in a convoy to North Dakota . A Navy veteran , Hunter , 53 , works at Boeing as a computer-systems administrator , and lives in Edmonds . There is not an issue with peaceful protest . But Hunter said the show of force against demonstrators is way out of line . The leader of Washington State Veterans for Standing Rock is Jim Petersen , 60 , a Navy veteran from Bellingham . He had been thinking about going to Standing Rock for some time , but the Nov. 20 clash , where police used water hoses , pushed him over the edge . So many veterans around the country have volunteered for this trip after the national call went out that another is already being organized for Dec. 10 . The effort may become a rolling deployment as long as the Standing Rock Sioux want the help . Veterans participating are instructed to bring no weapons or ammunition and to remain nonviolent no matter what comes . In the past , it has called in reinforcements from Indiana , Louisiana , Minnesota , Montana , Nebraska , Ohio , South Dakota , Wisconsin , and Wyoming in addition to cities and counties throughout North Dakota to defend the pipeline project . Meanwhile more support from Washington tribes , fighting fossil-fuel projects of their own , continues to pour into the camp . A delegation of tribal leaders , drummers and singers from the Quinault Indian Nation , including tribal president Fawn Sharp , is to arrive Monday .
