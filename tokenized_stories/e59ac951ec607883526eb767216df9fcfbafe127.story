All rights reserved . NS first announced their target for a wind-powered train fleet back in 2015 , but they 've hit their target a year earlier than planned - way ahead of their 2018 goal . In 2015 , NS partnered with Dutch electricity company Eneco . Their goal was getting NS 's entire electric train fleet wind-powered by January 2018 . Half of the fleet was already wind-powered , but in order to get the entire system away from fossil fuels , they needed to either build more local wind farms or buy in wind energy from neighbouring countries , such as Denmark . But thanks to an increase in the number of wind farms around the country , and off the coast of the Netherlands , the collaboration has achieved that target early . According to a joint NS and Eneco website , around 600,000 passengers every day are now travelling thanks to wind energy . But now the nation is using more sophisticated wind turbines to generate electricity . The collaboration now hopes to reduce the energy used per passenger by a further 35 percent by 2020 compared to 2005 . And if global trends are anything to go by , it should n't be that hard . Just last year , Costa Rica was able to go 250 days without burning any fossil fuels , largely thanks to its hydro , geothermal , and wind energy . Scotland was also able to generate more wind electricity than the entire country could use on a particularly windy day in 2016 . And Denmark got 42 percent of its national electricity from wind power in 2015 , despite having two of its biggest wind farms offline . So , the planet might still be heating up , but we 've finally passed the point where renewable energy has more power generation capacity than fossil fuels for the first time . And thanks to countries like the Netherlands , there 's no turning back now . 5 days ago Politics & Society Semi-Automatic Rifles Really Are More Deadly , New Study Clearly Shows Numbers do n't lie . 6 days ago Politics & Society To Save Ourselves It 's Time to Rethink Our Economic System , Warn Scientists The market is killing the planet . 6 hours ago PHYSICS Single Hydrogen Atoms Could Form Eerie ` Ghost Bonds ' With Nothing , New Study Shows It should n't be possible . 17 hours ago SPACE SpaceX Has Announced The First Tourist to Go to The Moon - And Take Other People With Him Such a wild project .
