The letter , from the Office of Refugee Resettlement -LRB- ORR -RRB- , told state resettlement officials that they may not deny benefits and services to refugees based on their country of origin or religion . The letter went on to say that the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on race and national origin in all programs that receive federal financial assistance . The letter came after more than two dozen governors , mostly Republicans , announced they would resist efforts to resettle Syrian refugees in their states in light of the November 13 terrorist attacks in Paris , and fears that ISIS militants could use the controversial program to infiltrate the U.S. . In the House , lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a bill last week improving screening for Iraqi and Syrian refugees . The bill requires comprehensive background checks of every refugee from Iraq or Syria before they can be admitted into the United States and certification that each does not pose a threat . The Obama administration says that the vetting process is already thorough and can take two years to complete . Roughly 2,200 Syrian refugees have been allowed in over the last four years . Obama has outlined a goal of bringing 10,000 more Syrian refugees to the U.S. during the current budget year . The Associated Press contributed to this report . All rights reserved .
