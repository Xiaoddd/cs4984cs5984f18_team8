Declared a superfruit just a few years ago , this red , slightly sour berry grows on shrubs on and around Indian reservations in the Dakotas . Black Elk , an ethnobotanist , takes her students at Sitting Bull College to the confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri rivers in North Dakota every autumn to harvest buffalo berries . But now those stands are gone , bulldozed and replaced by a dark gash through the earth . In February , the government gave Energy Transfer Partners the final go-ahead to finish its construction of the Dakota Access pipeline . But to Black Elk , fighting the pipeline is about more than berry bushes and science . The water protectors camped out near Cannon Ball , North Dakota , on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and on nearby land owned by the Army Corps of Engineers . Black Elk spent the freezing North Dakota winter visiting the makeshift community of Native Americans , veterans , and water protectors from across the country . In February , Governor Doug Burgum issued an evacuation order , and by the end of the month , police had forcibly removed or arrested anyone who remained . It has also lifted up the long history of violence against indigenous peoples at the hands of the government . DAPL construction may be underway , but the water protectors remain powerful in the example they have set . Communities should , by law , have a say in what dangerous projects come to town . The Clean Water Act requires the Army Corps to issue permits , and as part of that , the agency must seek public comment . But the Corps has been getting around more intense environmental scrutiny and public review by chopping large projects like DAPL into much smaller ones . After government officials met with tribal leaders late last year to see how to better communicate with the tribes during the permitting process , agencies agreed they must consult more closely with tribes before projects move forward . What , exactly , that means is still pretty murky , says Maranda Compton , an attorney who represents tribes and tribal councils . Some agencies write letters to the tribes before issuing a permit , while others publish ads in local newspapers as a means of notification , but the government should now give tribes more of a chance to give feedback . Of course , support for such collaboration is not universal . President Trump fast-tracked DAPL once he took office , thwarting further environmental review . In January he also signed an executive order that effectively speeds up pipeline projects by allowing governors to say a pipeline is a national priority . By doing so , he is suppressing public input and limiting environmental review . The American Energy Renaissance Act would not only increase drilling on federal lands , but also limit public review , eliminate environmental review , and do away altogether with any considerations of how projects might contribute to climate change . If anything we need more input , she says , not less .
