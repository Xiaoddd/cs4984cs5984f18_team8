The problem for Canadians is that the centre is the only viable path . B.C. Premier John Horgan is threatening to block the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion . The three main leadership candidates for Ontario 's Progressive Conservative Party are promising to dump the party 's pledge to adopt a carbon tax . Story continues below advertisement All of that is a mounting challenge to Mr. Trudeau 's formula . He had staked out the political middle by promising Canadians they could have both things at once : He 'd get resources to market , approving at least one new oil pipeline , but also act on climate change , including putting a price on carbon . Pipeline advocates keep screaming that Ottawa must do more to knock back B.C. 's threat to block Trans Mountain . But since B.C. has n't done anything yet , nor said what it will do , the only thing Ottawa can do is to declare it will intervene if the province oversteps . The critics kept screaming . In an era of increasingly divisive politics , where politicians build support by riling an angry base , Mr. Trudeau might find it hard to hold the middle . But he is right that the majority wants both energy development and climate policy . If Ottawa does n't try to advance both at the same time , both will be stymied , and Canadian policy is doomed to swing unpredictably . The Conservatives have no substantial proposal to constrain greenhouse gas emissions , so their energy policy is a mess . The NDP 's energy policy amounts to keeping oil in the ground . Neither is politically tenable . The Liberals can be derided for a lot of squishy Goldilocks positioning between Conservatives and New Democrats over the years , on topics from public spending or national security , and fantasy-land efforts to please all , like declarations they oppose selling arms to countries with poor rights records while doing just that . Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement But on pipelines and climate change , Mr. Trudeau 's Goldilocks policy is the only practical option . The Canadian public now wants climate policies . Ontario 's Progressive Conservatives , under ex-leader Patrick Brown , promised a carbon tax because his advisers thought it was necessary to win over the political middle and take power . The federal Conservatives under Andrew Scheer do n't really have a climate policy , either . Of course , having a climate-change policy does n't mean it 's easy to get a pipeline built . Local opposition over fears of spills make it hard to push a pipeline through almost anywhere , in New Jersey , or North Dakota , or B.C. . But climate change now drives the broader opposition . Ask federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh . He 's stuck between Mr. Horgan and another NDP Premier , Alberta 's Rachel Notley . He ca n't settle on a policy even within his own party . So the federal NDP insists it is not against all pipelines , while in practice it is against each one . And since Canadians do n't accept a keep-it-in-the-ground policy , it 's like having no policy at all . Story continues below advertisement Mr. Trudeau 's climate-and-pipeline policy might be Goldilocks politics , but it 's far more realistic than the fairy tales of his opponents .
