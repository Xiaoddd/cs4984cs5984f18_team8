The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe 's water intake system is moving further down stream - plans that were in place even before the Dakota Access Pipeline project - which means if a spill does occur , oil will have to travel much further to reach the tribe 's water source . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe 's new water intake plant is located 40 miles south of Fort Yates . Construction of the facility began because the river channel is deeper further south , not because of the Dakota Access Pipeline project . Smaller water intake systems will still service Fort Yates , but having the main plant further south means any spill will have to travel further in order to have an adverse impact . The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration will regulate the Dakota Access Pipeline , and the agency also oversees another 37 crude oil pipelines that have water crossings . With new technology , spills are a lot less likely to occur , but accidents can never be completely eliminated . DAPL is responsible for having emergency clean-up crews and equipment on standby around the clock . percent . That means for every 10,000 barrels handled 9,999 are transported safely .
