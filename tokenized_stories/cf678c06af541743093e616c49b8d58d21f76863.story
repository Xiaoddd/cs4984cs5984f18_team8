The oil-sopped parcel of land , about the size of seven football fields , is no longer usable for planting at present . Jensen discovered the spill while harvesting wheat on Sept. 29 , 2013 , on his farm near Tioga . It was almost two weeks after Jensen reported the spill that state officials told the public what had happened , and only after The Associated Press asked about it . Tesoro blames a lightning strike for causing the rupture . The 35-mile long pipeline was restarted last November . The pipeline now has leak-detection equipment installed , and frequent aerial and ground inspections are being done . Jensen blames the company for not detecting the leak . Some 20,600 barrels of oil were determined to have spilled . A barrel is 42 gallons . The state Health Department , which is monitoring the cleanup , said no water sources were contaminated and no wildlife was hurt from the spill . Dave Glatt , chief of the agency 's environmental health section , said Tesoro has not been sanctioned for the incident . Cleanup crews have recovered about 6,000 barrels of oil , though more than 14,000 barrels are lost , officials said . Crews initially burned oil from the surface and later used vacuums to recover it . That proved ineffective after the oil seeped far underground , officials said . Tesoro now is using a thermal desorption process that involves excavating contaminated soil and heating it before being replaced . University scientists from North Dakota are studying the soil and plan to plant a test crop there next year , state and company officials said . Jensen is optimistic that he 'll be able to farm the land someday . Produced in the field and neatly organized by topic , from spring prep to post-harvest .
