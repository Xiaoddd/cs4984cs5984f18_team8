The now enigmatic jurist , in a verbose 91-page opinion , has ruled that some parts of the approval of the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- did not meet the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act -LRB- NEPA -RRB- and that there needs to be further environmental review . The wily jurist , with oh so many tricks up his sleeve , still will not shut down DAPL in the interim . A lot if you are a judge who favors powerful oil corporations . Boasberg has entered the realm of the opaque . So far ETP is right , as the oil flows on . In cases such as this , where a permit is judicially ruled to be incomplete but has already been issued , the permit is pulled . In this instance that would mean shutting down the pipeline so that no more oil would flow while the matter is being further litigated . But if the review shows the pipeline would violate environmental law , harming the public interest , then the pipeline would be permanently shut down . But , lo and behold , our esteemed judge has turned the legal procedure upside down . He rules that the pipeline approval violated the law , which renders the approval illegal , but allows the illegality to continue . Oil flows at the rate of 540,00 to 570,000 barrels a day . So far Boasberg has ruled against the tribes at every turn . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe -LRB- SRST -RRB- and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe -LRB- CRST -RRB- had previously come before this same jurist to assert claims under the National Historic Preservation Act and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act . The first favorable ruling came under the National Environmental Policy Act on June 14 . In addition to the Standing Rock Sioux and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes , the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Yankton Sioux Tribe are now parties in the lawsuit . They had filed separate complaints against the United States Army Corps of Engineers -LRB- USACOE -RRB- that were lately joined with those of the other two tribes . At this conference the judge set up an elaborate briefing schedule . The schedule runs from July 17 to August 28 , and orders everything but the kitchen sink : the submitting of opening briefs , responses to briefs , more intervenors , more consolidations , more replies and sur-replies on different dates . The disingenuous jurist should have shut down the pipeline pending completion of another review or ordering an Environmental Impact Statement -LRB- EIS -RRB- . They are obviously in no hurry as long as the oil is flowing . A shutdown would sure prompt a speedier than usual review by the Corps . So far , the Corps has not sent any notice to the Federal Register setting up a review schedule . My opinion is that the judge purposely waited for the oil to start flowing before he issued his partially favorable decision sending mixed messages . If Boasberg had rendered his ruling before the oil started flowing there is no lawful way that the pipeline would have become operational . Keep in mind the we live in apartheid USA where there is rampant inequality at all levels of the so-called justice system . What is dangerous to European Americans is foisted on Native Americans . For Natives , there were not just objections but massive demonstrations with tribes from all over the country . Countless supporters from countries around the globe in stood up the face of gratuitous militarized police violence -LRB- war crimes , if you will -RRB- committed against the water protectors . Tear gas , water cannons in sub-freezing temperatures turned on men , women , the elderly . Rubber bullets targeting peaceful , non-violent , praying demonstrators . Limbs nearly torn from bodies , eyes shot out , and brutality that amounted to outright torture and yet the pipeline goes through . Let us all remember , and never forget , that we live in apartheid USA . Remember , that American jurisprudence is so malleable that it can be manipulated at the bias of a given judge to reach the most unconscionable results . The DAPL case so profoundly illustrates that in capitalist society the law protects property , enforces social and economic inequality , and the rule of the propertied , exploitative classes . Judge Boasberg is an excellent example of the utilization of the law for unconscionable , even genocidal results . The issue is what can be done to keep this struggle on the road to justice .
