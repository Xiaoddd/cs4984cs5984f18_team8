However , one high-profile case involving a Denver woman accused of firing shots at officers during a protest clash recently was transferred from state court to federal court . Meanwhile , several pipeline protesters are suing Morton County , the city of Mandan and North Dakota law enforcement officials in federal court in Bismarck , saying their civil rights were violated during a clash with authorities earlier this month .
