On Nov. 19 , protest walks against the planned Atlantic Coast Pipeline will be held in three communities in Eastern North Carolina that would be affected by the project . On Tuesday , the West Virginia Supreme Court ruled that developers of the proposed Mountain Valley Pipeline , which would carry fracked natural gas from West Virginia 300 miles to southern Virginia , ca n't survey land for the project without landowners ' permission . The ruling upheld an August 2015 decision by a Monroe County circuit judge in favor of Bryan and Doris McCurdy , county residents who claimed that allowing the pipeline company onto their property without their consent violated their rights . The pipeline would supply little if any gas to Monroe County residents or other West Virginians . The Mountain Valley Pipeline is a joint project of Pennsylvania-based EQT Midstream Partners ; NextEra US Gas Assets , a wholly owned subsidiary of of Florida-based NextEra Energy ; WGL Midstream , a subsidiary of WGL Energy of Washington , D.C. ; and Vega Midstream , a subsidiary of Houston-based Vega Energy . EQT Midstream Partners would operate the pipeline and own a majority interest . The pipeline would be up to 42 inches in diameter and require about 50 feet of permanent easement and 125 feet during construction . It would also require three compressor stations , which are planned for the Wetzel , Braxton , and Fayette counties in West Virginia . The pipeline needs approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -LRB- FERC -RRB- before construction can begin . In North Carolina , a threat to an Indian tribe Meanwhile , protests are mounting against the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline , which would run 550 miles from the gas fields of West Virginia to North Carolina . The companies behind the project are Dominion Resources of Virginia , North Carolina-based Duke Energy and Southern Company Gas , a subsidiary of the Atlanta-based Southern Company . There have been numerous protests against the project in Virginia , and this week they 're spreading to eastern North Carolina counties that the pipeline would traverse , with three protest walks planned for Saturday , Nov. 19 : In Cumberland County , pipeline protesters will gather at 9:30 a.m. in front of Cape Fear Regional Theater in Fayetteville and walk a mile for a rally at Market House . The event is sponsored by Cumberland County Caring Voices . In Nash County , protesters will meet at 10 a.m. at Ennis Recreation Park in Red Oak and walk 9 miles to the county courthouse in Nashville , with shuttles available to carry participants back to Red Oak . Nash Stop the Pipeline is the action 's sponsor . And in Robeson County , protesters will meet at Pembroke Town Park across from UNC Pembroke at 1:30 p.m. and walk 2 miles for a rally and prayer circle at the corner of Prospect Road and Highway 72 . The event 's sponsor is EcoRobeson . The three counties hosting protests this week were all hit hard last month by Hurricane Matthew , an extreme weather event that scientists have connected to climate change . Pipelines often leak , and natural gas is mostly methane , a powerful greenhouse gas and significant contributor to global warming . Other groups involved in the North Carolina protest walks include Sustainable Sandhills , Clean Water for North Carolina , NC WARN , Appalachian Voices and Climate Times . Planning is also underway for a two-week protest walk to be held next spring along the entire 165 miles of the pipeline 's planned route through North Carolina . ` A shortsighted industry ' There are growing concerns about the proposed pipelines ' impacts on the environment and public safety . The evidence shows that pipeline accidents are not that rare . And a consortium monitoring oil and gas industry accidents in Louisiana released its latest report this week , documenting six pipeline accidents in that one state over a two-week period . There were incidents involving pipelines operated by big companies including Exxon and Shell as well as smaller companies . Rolfes noted that the industry claims it 's motivated to prevent pipeline accidents in order to avoid product loss . But she said that in her 20 years of studying oil and gas industry accidents , she has found little evidence to support that . Instead , she sees an intense focus on quarterly profits , which are depressed by investing in upgrades . But one area where the natural gas pipeline industry has been eager to invest is politics . database . That total includes contributions from individuals and political action committees as well as money to outside political groups not affiliated with campaigns , with 83 percent of that going to Republicans .
