Seven Native Americans face felony charges , while hundreds of others still face lesser charges for their role in the fight against the Dakota Access pipeline . He is the first person to be sentenced to serious prison time for his role in the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline . His legal team hopes that he will be released after eleven months to a halfway house . According to Assistant U.S. Attorney David Hagler , Little Feather was officially identified as one of the individuals that set fires that obstructed law enforcement during the last raids of the camp . The Water Protector Legal Collective explains that many of the defendants facing charges in relation to the events at Standing Rock take plea deals because a trial will mean facing a hostile jury pool . Although the big media outlets gave some coverage to the DAPL protests during the height of the movement , they have been notably silent since the last camps were raided fifteen months ago , despite the fact that seven Native Americans have been indicted for federal felony crimes and hundreds more have faced lesser charges . The state of North dakota has prosecuted 835 state criminal cases related to the DAPL protests , of which 325 have been dismissed or acquitted at trial and 235 are ongoing .
