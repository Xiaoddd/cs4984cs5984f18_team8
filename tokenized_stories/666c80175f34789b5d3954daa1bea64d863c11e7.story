The right to peaceful protest is a basic freedom codified in our Constitution and a necessary component of a healthy democracy . That is why Young Evangelicals for Climate Action -LRB- YECA -RRB- is appalled by the images and stories of violence coming out of the Standing Rock camp this week . As the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Water Protectors have continued to exercise their constitutional right to peacefully demonstrate in order to protect their water , air , and land , the highly militarized police force monitoring the demonstrations has become increasingly hostile . Over the last several days , this police force has simply gone too far , firing rubber bullets and concussion grenades on the peaceful crowd and training water cannons on demonstrators for hours on end in sub-zero temperatures . This kind of violent escalation from the police is unacceptable . It must cease immediately and it must be condemned in the strongest terms and at the highest levels of authority . YECA will continue to stand beside the Standing Rock Water Protectors and their allies in the work of creating a present that is marked by justice and self-determination for minority communities , and a future that is marked by clean water and a safe climate for all .
