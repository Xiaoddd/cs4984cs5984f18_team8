WASHINGTON , DC - OCTOBER 16 : Sen. John Hoeven -LRB- R-ND -RRB- answers questions as he arrives for a meeting of Senate Republicans on a solution for the pending budget and debt limit impasse at the U.S. Capitol October 16 , 2013 in Washington , DC . Sen. Hoeven 's new job is ironic because he has repeatedly opposed causes that Native Americans support . The Dakota Access Pipeline is the most recent example . Military veterans and Native American tribal elders stop for a ceremonial prayer during a march to a closed bridge across from the Dakota Access oil pipeline site . The same month , Hoeven criticized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ' reluctance to grant an easement that would have let the pipeline 's builders burrow under Lake Oahe , a section of the Missouri River . Incongruous though it may seem , Hoeven 's new position as chairman for the Indian Affairs committee is in keeping with most of the appointments made leading up to Donald Trump 's presidency .
