They celebrated the beginning of a new front in the financial assault against the oil and natural gas industries . Aided by 350.org and the Sierra Club , these crowd-sourced divestment campaigns are popping up in San Francisco , Los Angeles , New York City , Raleigh , and even Berlin . Starting , of course , with the pointless nature of divestment itself . Oil and natural gas companies -LRB- and projects -RRB- are critical to the health , economy , and security of our country . As such , they make great investments . When one set of investors choose to sell their stocks in these companies -LRB- or in the banks that earn great returns on lending to these companies -RRB- , these stocks are immediately purchased by other investors . Divestment actually ends up hurting those who rely upon the returns from financial investments , whether they are students , pensioners , or taxpayers who must subsidize politically-based financial decisions .
