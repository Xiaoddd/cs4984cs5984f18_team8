Researchers have discovered a planet that matches the description of Planet Vulcan , Spock 's home planet , that Star Trek 's original creator Gene Roddenberry gave almost 20 years ago . Of course , it 's not the exact same planet from the fictional franchise , but it is a real-life rock with very Vulcan-like properties . In collaboration with astronomers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , Roddenberry declared back in 1991 that if Vulcan really existed , it would likely orbit the real-life star 40 Eridani A , Science reported . Because 40 Eridani A is a few billion years old , Roddenberry theorized that a planet orbiting that star would have had enough time to develop a civilization as advanced as the Vulcans . 40 Eridani A is an orange dwarf about 16 light years away from Earth , and it is sometimes visible in the night sky . The planet , officially dubbed HD 26965b , is about twice the size of Earth and has a year that lasts only 42 days , Space explained . The Dharma Planet Survey 's findings are due to be published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in October . That 's what three female Facebook users found when looking for work on the social network , a new complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Tuesday alleges . The complaint is backed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Communication Workers of America and could be the first step toward a lawsuit against Facebook . The complaint specifically cites 10 employers found to have tailored their ads to a certain age and gender . Meanwhile , gender-based ads were outlawed in newspapers decades ago , the ACLU noted in a blog post . Past investigations found advertisers could tailor ads to people of a specific race or sexual orientation , and Facebook subsequently shut down those targeting options . Still , gender - and age-based targeting persists , the ACLU maintains . And if this EEOC complaint does n't convince Facebook to clean up its gender-biased act , USA Today suggests the company could face a lawsuit .
