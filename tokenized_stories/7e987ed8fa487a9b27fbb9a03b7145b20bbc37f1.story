Following several reports of potentially unlawful surveillance , EFF sent technologists and lawyers to North Dakota to investigate . We collected anecdotal evidence from water protectors about suspicious cell phone behavior , including uncharacteristically fast battery drainage , applications freezing , and phones crashing completely . On social media , many reported Facebook posts and messenger threads disappearing , as well as Facebook Live uploads failing to upload or , once uploaded , disappearing completely . To try to figure this out , EFF also sent more than 20 public records requests to federal , state and local law enforcement agencies that have been sighted at Standing Rock or are suspected of providing surveillance equipment to agencies on the ground .
