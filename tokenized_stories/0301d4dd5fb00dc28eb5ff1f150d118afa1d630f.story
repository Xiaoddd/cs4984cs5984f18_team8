It may have to shut down its recently opened Dakota Access pipeline while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reconsiders the potential impact of an oil spill . The ruling came down from a federal judge last week . Energy Transfer Partners investors can only hang their heads at this point , too tired of the roller coaster ride to even argue in favor of ETP stock . The good news is , the make-or-break line in the sand for the shares is pretty well defined . The quick recap of the Energy Transfer Partners story goes like this : The company has been run through the wringer over the past couple of years . The prospect of establishing an underground pipeline from North Dakota to Illinois helped fanned the flames of the rally leading up to that high . The project was up-ended before it was completed and turned on , however . Once in office , President Donald Trump put the project back in motion , which was completed last month and opened for business this month . Now it may be turned off just as quickly as it was turned on . To remedy those violations , the Corps will have to reconsider those sections of its environmental analysis upon remand by the Court . Indeed , Energy Transfer Partners has seemingly been unaffected by weak oil prices . ETP Stock Itself Holds the Key You read that right . The graph below tells the tale . Take a look -LRB- below -RRB- . A closer look reveals that the shape of the chart since 2012 is an upside-down cup-and-handle pattern . The stock could just end up kissing that floor and then explode up and off of it . Bottom Line for ETP Stock Further clouding the issue of an already-uncertain future for ETP stock is that regardless of what happens to its price , the company is almost certainly going to continue paying a healthy dividend .
