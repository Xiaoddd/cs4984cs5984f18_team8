LAUREN DONOVAN , TRIBUNE Facebook Twitter Email Print Save McKenzie County Sheriff Gary Schwartzenberger was placed on interim suspension Wednesday night , pending his removal from office , by Gov. Jack Dalrymple . The governor ordered the interim suspension based on a recommendation from Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem after McKenzie County requested the sheriff be removed under a process available in state law . The county commission had voted in support of the petition for removal . In a recommendation dated Wednesday , just short of the 30-day window to make his findings on the petition , Stenehjem said the allegations were investigated by the Bureau of Criminal Investigation and he recommended following through on removal . Stenehjem said an assigned prosecutor will draft a formal complaint and once filed , a special commissioner will conduct a removal hearing within 30 days . Larry Clock . The suspension was enforced by BCI agents , who tracked down Schwartzenberger late Wednesday while he was working near Cannon Ball on the Dakota Access Pipeline protest enforcement , according to the Williston Herald . The county decided to go through the process of stripping Schwartzenberger of his job and badge after hearing a report from a firm it hired to look into a growing number of complaints about the sheriff from his employees and others in county departments . The Village Business Institute found grounds to remove the sheriff based on harassment and intimidation amid concerns that he fostered a quasi-military environment . Schwartzenberger also is scheduled for trial on charges he illegally used the department credit card for personal expenses . Your notification has been saved .
