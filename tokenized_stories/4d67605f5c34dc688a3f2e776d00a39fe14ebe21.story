Having witnessed the police state brutality inflicted on Native Americans attempting to protect sacred land and natural resources , the former service members feel compelled to stand with the Standing Rock Sioux . Rep. Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii , a combat war veteran , will be joining the act of resistance , according to the Facebook page Veterans Stand for Standing Rock . As Task and Purpose notes , federal government ignored their duty under the National Historic Preservation Act to consult the Standing Rock Sioux before approving DAPL . While federal government abandoned Native Americans once again , law enforcement are acting as militarized protection services for Energy Transfer Partners , the Texas-based company behind the 1,170-mile pipeline . State and local governments are set to reap millions in taxes once the oil begins flowing . The main man behind it all is Wes Clark , Jr. , son of Gen. Wesley Clark , a former Supreme Allied Commander who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004 . Clark Sr. called for action on climate change , and this motivation is also driving his son to fight against DAPL . Clark and Wood say they are prepared to take a bullet for the cause , and they are going in well-prepared . The veterans will don old military uniforms and be equipped with body armor , ear plugs and gas masks . A packing list virtually mirrors the ones issued to soldiers preparing to deploy to the field -LRB- minus the weapons -RRB- . But there are also parts of the document that read like a revolutionary manifesto . With a group of possibly 500 veterans and other brave souls , they will lock arms and cross the Missouri River to non-violently confront militarized police armed with rifles , mace , batons and dogs . Traditional Sioux war songs will be played as they attempt to peacefully surround the drill pad from which the pipeline will be bored under the river . Winning this battle is as simple as choosing to abstain from the violent corrupt old system and participating in the new and peaceful system that hands the power back to the people . We feel that PIVX is this system . PIVX takes the control the banking elite has over money and gives it back to the people . It is the ultimate weapon in the battle against the money changers and information controllers because PIVX is the only cryptocurrency in existence that allows for completely anonymous storage while simultaneously paying interest .
