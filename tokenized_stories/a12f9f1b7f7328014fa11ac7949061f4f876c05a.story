In deciding to send members to Standing Rock , we found that it was necessary to show support and true joint-struggle solidarity in this time of native resilience . As indigenous people , we know what it is like to face settler colonialism , genocide , displacement , relocation , and environmental destruction to our own homeland . In addition , violence against both Native people and the environment is something that affects us all ; water is a source of life , we all depend on water for our survival . Therefore , we must continue to stand together with our Indigenous siblings in the fight against corporate greed and the settler colonial state . This matter affects us all , after all , water is life . PYM is partnering with the Arab American Civic Council and Active Labs to send a Palestinian and Arab delegation to Standing Rock . We are committing to being at the camp from November 19 , 2016 , through January 5 , 2017 . In this period of time , we want to show our indefinite support to stopping the pipeline and our commitment to stand with sovereign nations . We are asking people to join us for at least a week at a time . In addition , we hope during the last three weeks we will have a consistent presence of PYM members , other Arabs , Palestinians and people from the SWANA region -LRB- South West Asian and North Africa -RRB- from our communities , and the organizations we work with on a local level .
