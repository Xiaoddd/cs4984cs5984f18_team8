Just 10 days ago , DNB warned it might withdraw funding for construction of the contentious pipeline if concerns raised by the Standing Rock Sioux were not addressed promptly . The bank will therefore take initiative and use its position to bring about a more constructive process to find a solution to the conflict . News of the asset selloff follows the delivery of a 120,000-signature petition by Greenpeace Norway and other advocates to DNB urging it and other financiers to yank all funding for Dakota Access . We now expect DNB to also terminate its loans for the project immediately . All financial institutions with a stake in the pipeline must quickly realize that financing this project is toxic . It would be smart for them to get out ahead of the growing movement of customers looking to divest from banks that finance the destruction of our planet and ignore Indigenous rights and sovereignty . Indeed , a movement initiated in solidarity with Dakota Access Pipeline opposition and Indigenous water protectors suggests individuals withdraw money and close personal and business accounts with financiers of the project . That delay , while a definitive victory for the tribe , constitutes a double-edged sword with time quickly running low before decidedly pro-Big Oil President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January . In its announcement , the Army Corps stated it would work with the Standing Rock Sioux on a timeline for that consultation , but no further statement of an agreed deadline has yet been made . Undoubtedly , the exploding grassroots campaign of solidarity with water protectors is squeezing the vise-grip on Dakota Access Pipeline investors , as police use of excessive force and gestapo-like tactics against Native Americans has conjured the specter of past atrocities against Indigenous peoples by the U.S. government . State-sponsored , corporate-approved law enforcement ferocity in this matter have soured even the apathetic to this pipeline . It appears at least doubtful the Standing Rock Sioux will see their ultimate goal of permanently halting the pipeline come to fruition ; but , if the Army Corps refuses to grant the necessary easement under Nationwide Permit 12 , Energy Transfer Partners would be faced with a formidable obstacle to complete Dakota Access . Winning this battle is as simple as choosing to abstain from the violent corrupt old system and participating in the new and peaceful system that hands the power back to the people . We feel that PIVX is this system . PIVX takes the control the banking elite has over money and gives it back to the people . It is the ultimate weapon in the battle against the money changers and information controllers because PIVX is the only cryptocurrency in existence that allows for completely anonymous storage while simultaneously paying interest .
