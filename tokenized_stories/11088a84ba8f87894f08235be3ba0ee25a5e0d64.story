A federal judge on Friday denied the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe 's efforts to halt the construction of a pipeline skirting the northern edge of the reservation on Friday ; on the same day , the government ordered a the pipeline company to pause its work .

By Heather Brady PUBLISHED January 25 , 2017 President Donald Trump signed executive orders early this week that restarted the effort to complete the Keystone XL pipeline across the Great Plains -LRB- see a map of the route -RRB- and the Dakota Access pipeline in the northern plains . The critically endangered whooping crane is at risk of flying into new power lines that would be constructed to keep oil pumping through the Keystone XL pipeline , the National Wildlife Federation has said . The Keystone XL pipeline route would go through most of the remaining locations of the swift fox , a tiny canid about the size of a house cat . There are nine threatened , endangered , and candidate species in the areas that the Dakota Access pipeline would run through , according to an environmental assessment by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published in May 2016 . The assessment concluded that the pipeline does not pose a specific threat to any of their habitats . 2 . How the Pipelines May Impact Oil Production If the Keystone XL pipeline is built , about 830,000 barrels of heavy crude oil per day will flow from Alberta , Canada , to the refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast , which are built to handle the kind of heavy crude oil that comes out of the tar sands . Those refineries need crude oil in order to function and to support the people who work there , and places like Mexico and Venezuela , which typically export oil to the U.S. , are beginning to run out of it . Their father bought the motel in 2003 but has been in the hotel business since the early 1970s .

The center hosts regular social gatherings for residents and offers social services . His parents bought their first motel , in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles , in 1979 . These steps are intended to help minimize the harm of an oil spill if one happens . The alternative to a pipeline also presents concerns . The State Department estimated that as of January 2014 , 180,000 barrels of Canadian crude oil per day is being transported by freight trains . If no pipeline is built , that number will rise . Using trains to transport oil to refineries in the U.S. poses a safety concern because explosions can occur , killing people and damaging habitats nearby . The Dakota Access pipeline project was meant to address the growing amount of oil being shipped out of North Dakota by freight trains . 3 . What the Pipelines Mean for Climate Many climate activists have opposed the pipelines on the suspicion that they may increase our reliance on , and use , of fossil fuels , and further delay investment in more renewable technologies . But the State Department said in a 2014 assessment that the Keystone XL pipeline would have no additional impact on greenhouse gas emissions because the oil would be extracted from tar sands in Canada at the same rate anyways , regardless of whether or not the pipeline was built . The EPA contested that finding , saying that extracting oil from the tar sands generates more greenhouse gases than extracting oil through more conventional methods and therefore contributes to a greater amount of greenhouse gas emissions over time . If more pipelines are built , more oil could theoretically be extracted at a faster rate , meaning greenhouse gases would actually be released more quickly . The volatile market also does not guarantee that demand will make the high cost of extracting oil from the tar sands worthwhile . But the protesters remain . Here , they camp near Cannon Ball , North Dakota . Using trains slows down the process of getting the oil to refineries and ultimately to market , so it is better long-term for the environment , the groups said . No environmental impact report has been created for the Dakota Access pipeline , though the U.S Army Corps of Engineers said they would conduct an environmental impact survey when they halted the project in December 2016 . The Dakota Access pipeline project has encountered fierce opposition in part because the threat of an oil spill and poisoned water sources could impact the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , whose reservation is immediately downstream of the point where the pipeline will cross the Missouri River . Many tribe members are also concerned about burial grounds being disturbed during construction of the pipeline . Bulldozers have already removed some topsoil on ground that the tribe considers sacred . Both pipelines would create jobs during their construction . If the pipeline is not built , it could eventually endanger jobs at those refineries . Energy Transfer Partners says the Dakota Access pipeline would create up to 12,000 jobs during its construction . It would create around 40 permanent jobs .
