Sarain Carson-Fox an Anishinaabe artist , activist and the host of the RISE series . Transcript This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form . The War and Peace Report . Sarain Fox is with us . She is an Anishinaabe artist , activist and host of this film series called RISE on Viceland . In fact , she was a star on Paradise Falls , which was a soap opera years ago . And , Michelle , I was really interested in this . But I want to go back in time to you being a soap star . MICHELLE LATIMER : No , I was actually playing a bisexual goth . I wanted to be seen as an actress and not be pigeonholed as only being invited to play Native roles . And it was hard , because I wanted to identify , but I was also advised maybe not to . I got pigeonholed to play Native roles . I played the love interest of Adam Beach in a TV series in Canada called Moose TV . MICHELLE LATIMER : No , actually , I did . I was on another show called Blackstone , and I also considered that show very positive and whole , absolutely . AMY GOODMAN : And talk about that shift and what this means , how the two of you , with Viceland , conceived of this series . And there was high rates of suicide because of that , and depression and substance abuse . And it made me want to tell the stories from my own community . Vice actually called me . And it was like a dream come true . AMY GOODMAN : So talk about this . But you go so deeply into it , back centuries , looking forward and talking to the people involved . And resistance meaning that it can take many forms , you know , but , obviously , the most obvious one being occupation and literally putting our bodies on the line to stop these infrastructure , fossil fuel industries , mining , that kind of thing . And so it gave us that ability to go deeper . SARAIN CARSON-FOX : The first piece being Oak Flat . Yeah , so that was our very first episode that we went out on , and it was very interesting because the Oak Flat movement actually became a lead-in for many other issues . But what we saw there was a land grab . Give us the context of what happened with Oak Flat in Arizona . So there was only an hour for everyone to read the entire bill , and it was slipped in . And that rider essentially gave away the land to Rio Tinto , a mining company . SARAIN CARSON-FOX : So , basically , it has to do with copper . SARAIN CARSON-FOX : Well , the Apaches are basically left to deal with the aftermath . They were not told that this was happening . And when they were notified , it was far too late to have any ability to do anything . So , the Apache people were an afterthought for this decision . SARAIN CARSON-FOX : Well , Senator McCain has a very complicated history with the indigenous people , especially in Arizona , because he was appointed to represent indigenous people and to be a part of negotiating their voice within the state . AMY GOODMAN : So describe the resistance that you document in RISE . SARAIN CARSON-FOX : Yeah , so , with the Apache Stronghold , we see a really grassroots movement of indigenous warriors who are coming together to occupy . So , that occupation is a really simple but powerful tool . So , simply by occupying land and putting their bodies on the line , they are reminding everyone that this is the land that is sacred to them . SARAIN CARSON-FOX : Roy Chavez , former mayor of the neighboring town of Superior , is one of the many non-indigenous supporters of Oak Flat . He opposes the mining methods Resolution is proposing , and has offered to show me what will happen to Oak Flat if the mine goes through . ROY CHAVEZ : Good . SARAIN CARSON-FOX : Good , good . My family worked in the mines and such . Serving as mayor , I actually got involved politically here when the mine first shut down , the Magma Copper mine , in 1982 . Magma Copper laid off between 1,200 and 1,400 employees here at the Superior mine in one day . So , I have something to show you in reference to the project . This is the subsidence area . ROY CHAVEZ : Subsidence is the cave-in of the surface , two-and-a-half miles wide , a thousand feet deep . The Eiffel Tower would fit at the bottom of this , and you could see the tip of it from the outside areas here . The rest is waste . One percent is the profit . The rest of this has to be placed somewhere . We used to put this back underground . One-point-six billion tons of toxic mine waste will be produced . ROY CHAVEZ : Yes . ROY CHAVEZ : Sure . But I agree with you . The fight has just started . No one wants to lose Oak Flat . Senator Flake also has an interesting history when it comes to mining in Arizona . MICHELLE LATIMER : And water , yeah , absolutely . And it was interesting , because at that time when we were filming , Bernie Sanders stepped in to introduce a sister bill into the Senate . So we had bills in the Congress and bills in the Senate that were trying to stop what was happening to Oak Flat . MICHELLE LATIMER : Yeah . Sorry , I should have mentioned that . Yeah , he was a lobbyist for Rio Tinto before he became the senator . MICHELLE LATIMER : Yeah , Rio Tinto is one of the greatest human rights abusers in the world for resource companies . You know , I was in a small airport in Northern BC , and I saw an office for Rio Tinto . MICHELLE LATIMER : Yeah , absolutely . There are so many men coming in to mine and to live in these man camps that , you know , I think it helps them to facilitate these people coming through the airport . AMY GOODMAN : Now , talk about the overall resistance , from this area of Arizona , from Oak Flat , to the standoff at Standing Rock , which you have two of your documentaries about . SARAIN CARSON-FOX : So , one of the most amazing things , as we traveled the world last year and met with these front-line communities , is that you often saw that every single front-line community was connected . So , Oak Flat resisters were also in Mauna Kea , so when we went to Mauna Kea , we had met with people who were connecting in that way . So , we really saw a collective response at Standing Rock . And so , you saw all of the front-line warriors come together , protectors come together at Standing Rock . The people of North Dakota in other places , like in Mandan , in the capital , Bismarck , have said no to it . And he has , Michelle . I mean , at the time we were filming , Donald Trump was the keynote speaker at an oil and gas conference in the state capital of Bismarck , North Dakota . Yeah , yeah . He was invested in the pipeline , up until a certain point . Rick Perry , the former governor of Texas , as soon as he stepped down , within two weeks , he was on the board of Energy Transfer Partners . MICHELLE LATIMER : Yeah . AMY GOODMAN : There are a lot of close ties right now . MICHELLE LATIMER : I think , for me , that was the biggest sort of eye-opening thing about making this series , was the absolute pervasive levels of corruption that we witnessed everywhere , from Brazil to Canada to America , and then also seeing how the state is enforcing this kind of behavior by having militarized police , by having the National Guard there . For years , it was considered the least valuable land , but as more and more resources were found under it , it may well be the most valuable land . Colonization is based on privatization . They work as collectives . As soon as you privatize , you can fracture community . And then that causes a fracturing in community . SARAIN CARSON-FOX : Yeah . And so , for me , the fight for water has been very , very close to home . And for indigenous people , water is our most sacred being . When we give birth , when we carry life , we carry life in water . So , for me , traveling all over the world , that came up in every single community . Water is at the center of all of these fights . And indigenous people have never had the thought to own land or to own water . It is our job to protect those things . So , for me , it has just reminded me of how important it is to continue to do this work and to continue to make choices that are uncomfortable and inconvenient , to make way for water and for our land to be protected . SARAIN CARSON-FOX : The Navajo have always been renowned for their fighting spirit . As Navajo men , both Chris and Bronson have connected to their ancestry through modern ways of combat . REGGIE MITCHELL : I love driving through Navajo land . Reggie is bringing Bronson to the canyon , not only to train , but to perform a cleansing ceremony that will rid him of any negative thoughts . These kinds of rituals are ones that warriors have been undertaking for centuries to prepare for battle . REGGIE MITCHELL : It is important for us to be able to do these things so that we maintain and hold on to our traditions . We have to have the discipline . Some webs shining around . REGGIE MITCHELL : Oh , yeah . Only left with goodness , beauty and power . REGGIE MITCHELL : All right , son . And , you know , Michelle , this is Michelle . So we saw people arriving just to tell this story as a news story . AMY GOODMAN : Sarain Fox , you did a documentary on youth suicide , indigenous youth suicide , called Cut-Off . It was last spring that we went in . It was also about water . And I thought it was very interesting that those two became connected . But we asked Justin Trudeau if he would join us in a First Nations community . And so , we flew him in to a remote community , and he did join us for an entire day on Shoal Lake 40 , and we allowed the opportunity for the community to talk directly to him . So we delivered water door to door . He got to see the way that the infrastructure is affected there . So , in Shoal Lake 40 , they have been physically removed from the rest of Canada . And so , their land base was cut off from the mainland so that an aquifer could go in to deliver water to Winnipeg . And by doing so , they lost all the ability to connect to regular infrastructure , and the Canadian government did not take care of that . Everything was going good this morning . But then , before lunchtime , things started occurring on Facebook , social media . People were posting their problems about suicidal thoughts , of trying to attempt to kill themselves , I guess . And it was pretty hectic before you guys showed up . And I was pretty much involved looking for some of them . And everybody took action trying to look for these kids that were doing that on Facebook . Everybody was overwhelmed by it , sad . And I was , too , and very worried . SARAIN CARSON-FOX : The suicide epidemic on reserves might be something that people are talking about right now , but suicide has been an issue within First Nations communities for a long time . In Manitoba , 62 percent of First Nations children live below the poverty line . And then you have some communities that just keep getting put in the hole . They just keep getting put in isolation . AMY GOODMAN : That was a clip from the documentary Cut-Off . SARAIN CARSON-FOX : So , we looked at youth suicide in Cross Lake , which is also a remote community . We can talk about all the political backstories . AMY GOODMAN : And explain what you mean by residential school . SARAIN CARSON-FOX : Residential schools were schools that the government used to forcibly remove children from their homes and to assimilate them into what they called society . But what it did was it removed all of their culture . Children were taken from their homes . They were put in boarding schools . Their hair was cut . They were forbidden to speak their language . And they were abused , and there was rampant sexual abuse . And many children also died at the hands of nuns and priests in these schools . All my aunties , my grandmother went to residential school . So , for us , there is no disconnect between the youth suicide and who we are . It is not something that we talk about that is separate from us . Suicide rates in indigenous communities are some of the highest in the country , if not the world . And we are all deeply affected by it . So , for me , suicide is so close to home that I can almost see it as the blanket of grief that has to be removed before we can rise up as indigenous people . AMY GOODMAN : And , Michelle Latimer , you did a separate film about youth suicide . MICHELLE LATIMER : Yeah . AMY GOODMAN : An animated film . MICHELLE LATIMER : An animated film . And that film was animated because I was actually going to make a documentary about youth at an indigenous school in my community . They live billeted often with white families , separated from their own community , their own family . And they go to this school . And I noticed that the art class there was doing really innovative , politically charged work , and I wanted to show those kids . So I made it into an animated film that looked at that . And they want to know why . So I had an amazing support team . He turned to drugs and alcohol , like many indigenous people do , to deal with his pain . And so , I had to completely relearn who I was from that side . And as soon as you see someone like that , you remove all of the anger , and you remove all of the judgment . And so , for me , doing this work is a direct way for me to recover , continuously recover , and change the narrative as an indigenous person . AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask you , finally , about Leonard Peltier and what he represents . MICHELLE LATIMER : There was a lot of hope that he would be granted clemency . But we are resilient , and we will continue moving forward . But Leonard Peltier represents basically hope and a will to move forward , because he continues to speak out . He continues to give messages of hope to the front-line protesters , protectors . SARAIN CARSON-FOX : I just want to add that I think indigenous people have always been given just enough from the federal government to feel that they had a place to stand . And the real truth is that the American people are terrified of an indigenous uprising . AMY GOODMAN : Well , I want to thank you both for being with us . Sarain Fox , Anishinaabe activist , artist , dancer , journalist , the host of this eight-part documentary series for Viceland called RISE .
