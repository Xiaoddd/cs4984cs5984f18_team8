This state executive order is a menacing action meant to cause fear , and is a blatant attempt by the state and local officials to usurp and circumvent federal authority . The USACE has clearly stated that it does not intend to forcibly remove campers from federal property . The Governor cites harsh weather conditions and the threat to human life . If the true concern is for public safety than the Governor should clear the blockade and the county law enforcement should cease all use of flash grenades , high-pressure water cannons in freezing temperatures , dog kennels for temporary human jails , and any harmful weaponry against human beings . This is a clear stretch of state emergency management authority and a further attempt to abuse and humiliate the water protectors . The Chairman called on the Army Corps to affirm their previous statement regarding no forcible removal .

Previously , he served as editor of the Native News Network . He is a resident of Grand Rapids , Michigan . I have made a donation to the NODAPL fund . I was planning on coming to North Dakota on December 4th to join the U. S. War Veterans in solidarity with your protest . I am not used to snow storms and would only be using a tent as a shelter . BTW - I am a retired R. N. I no longer have active licenses , but feel that I can be of service to you if first aid is needed especially with the roads being blocked by the USACE . Respectfully , Kind Sir , please respond to my inquiries when you have time . I am keeping all of you in my prayers and close to my heart . Gene 2 years ago Dave is not in control of the camps . Start checking Bismarck , ND 10 day AccuWeather Forecast online . Winter camping requires knowledge & special gear . Clothing , tent , sleeping bag , stove & heating system gets expensive . If there are any health conditions such as respiratory , heart , etc. , then consider finding a hotel & getting a rental car . Kavika 2 years ago Enid , the advice that Gene gave you is exactly correct . Winter camping is not for the inexperienced . A hotel and rental car would be much safer for you . The link he gave is the best way to get the needed information . Chairman Archambault is , IMO , correct as to the reason that the governor has issued this emergency order . It is to cause fear , and to give them a reason to become even more aggressive in policing . Enid Lessne 2 years ago Kavika , Thank you for your input as well . I may only have a Baccalaureate Degree in Nursing , but I have an IQ of 264 , AND MOST IMPORTANTLY - I am one ornery FEMALE , JEWISH , NEW YORKER . In all seriousness , I am incensed by the blatant disregard shown to ALL OF OUR SOVEREIGN NATIVE AMERICAN NATIONS by Our Government . It is way past time to put this issue to rest - The United States Government must adhere to the treaties already signed into law . The NODAPL matter is the catalyst for bringing this travesty to its conclusion . As for my going to N. D. , I just found out that the Veterans planning on going to N. D. can not get their GoFundMe money released from the bank . I have connected Mr. Woods , Jr. -LRB- one of the original organizers -RRB- to see if I can buy plane tickets or rent buses for all of the Veterans already slated to go to N. D. Enid Lessne 2 years ago Kavika , I have just emailed the following message to both of My State Senators and My District Congressman . I suggest you do so as well . Tomorrow I will be placing a call to the SCOTUS -LRB- 1 202 479 3211 -RRB- in Washington , D. C. to request that they deliver a warning to the State of North Dakota as to overstepping their authority in regards to the laws governing Native American Indians , Native American Lands as well as Native American Treaties - all of which are on record in Our Constitution already , but not being upheld . It is the job of Our SCOTUS to uphold Our Constitution . I also contacted the lawyer for the Cherokee Nation and suggested he make it a class action suit on behalf of ALL THE SOVEREIGN NATIVE AMERICAN NATIONS , AND BRING IT BEFORE SCOTUS . Senators and Congressman , Congressmen Grijalva & Huffman have written a letter to POTUS Obama asking to meet with him and discuss the DAPL situation in North Dakota . I am writing to urge you to call the two Congressmen and join them at that meeting . Thank you for your time and assistance in this matter . I am planning on coming to the Oceti Sakowin camp , near Standing Rock Reservation on December 4th . I would like the list of the information you stated above . I have some medical conditions that at your suggestion would point me to staying at a motel . I know Bismarck is 50 miles from the Campsite . Thank you again . Robyn Blanpied 2 years ago The governor has no juristiction over Federal land . The eviction letter was sent by the local Corps commander , not the Corps . Another Comey red herring . Check your facts . TribalMember and Proud of it . 2 years ago Dave , David Archambault II , very well said response to the further negligence and disrespectful attitudes by the local L.E. I so much admire you as a fellow Native American . I have stated that numerous times , across several forms of media , in the hopes that one would reach your eyes and ears . A person , who prays daily and nightly for your people and you . As we are all connected through the tragic suffering of our Ancestors . Still , WE ALL HONOR THEM by carrying on in life and SHARING THE TRUTH . That is where we will find the peace of mind we need right now . Like how their pipeline can be a huge target during our next world war or even just a single terrorist attack . Then where will we all scurry to to get our fresh water when our lives depend on it . Jane Peacock 2 years ago As A citizen who lives just outside of Washington , DC , and is a citizen of Mother Earth I support your cause greatly . My Grandfather who was a lawyer in Oklahoma in the early 1900 represended many diverse tribal members of the Oklahoma Reservation . He taught me a lot about how you believe , live and should be honored as the first people to life on this continant . At age 10 , I had the great , honor to meet the Chief of the Creek Tribe at their tribal Pow-Wow . My grandfather and my family had been invited by the Chief for representing the tribe in a legal action over their rights to tribal lands . The Creek Tribe won in court against the Department of the Interior . One of the most exciting memories of my life was the exchanging of small gifts between The Chief of the Creek Nation . I gave him a gold handled hunting knife and he gave me snd each of my sisters a beaded , turquoise necklace . I still have that gift that reminds me of Creek Nation pride and kindness ; which I cherish today at age 59 . My thoughts as to why President Obama and the Democratic Party are not responding to The Peace Keepers , requests for a meeting ; is to wait until President-Elect , Donald Trump moves into office . Then he and the Republican s will be held at fault for not responding to the Oil Pipeline Issue , your tribal land treaties and equal human rights . President Obama will either wait until the last minute of his term you meet with your representitives . Or he will not meet at all as a way to postpone dealing with The Standing Rock Land Treaty and Native human rights issues , like safe , clean , drinking water and wildlife protection . A very poor move for his reputation on civil rights and 1851 Native Land Treaties All currant politicians will probably wait until President-Elect Donald Trump becomes President . You will need to start lobbying Donald Trump , any and all Congressmen or Senitor who will meet with you ; plus the Department of the Interior -LRB- who President Trump would like to appoint his youngest son -RRB- over the Standing Rock Issues . My thought is the longer you peacefully draw out , rejecting the Oil Pipe Line Company , The Builders and Government . The more time this negociation takes the more money it will cost The Oil and Development Companies . The more likely they will either move the pipeline a different direction or will give up because this project is costing to much money . But you have to keep putting out international news releases . Unfortunately , USA new releases will not get you the press you require to wait out the Oil and Building Companies . Natives were the first peoples on this continent . You understand our Mother Earth better then those who came from Europe . You deserve the honor and respect of caring for the USA . We pray for Mother Earth , Standing Rock , Sioux Tribe and all other Natives Tribes volunteering to help . Including non-native volunteers . Please let our family know so we can help . Sincerely , Jane Peacock Enid Lessne 2 years ago Jane , I feel the same way that you do . If you or anyone else can get their email , please forward it to me . I also donated money to the Sioux Nation GoFundMe account . Enid Help support Native News Online by clicking on our sponsors ' advertisements .
