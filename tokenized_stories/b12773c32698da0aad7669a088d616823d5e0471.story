Kirchmeier , who has led the police response to the Dakota Access oil pipeline , is a law enforcement lifer , a veteran of the North Dakota State Patrol and National Guard before being elected to his first term as Morton County sheriff . They said they have a right to remain on land where they have been camped for months . Their tactics , however , have drawn criticism from Standing Rock 's tribal leader as well as protest organizers and celebrities . Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault said he and Kirchmeier have met many times and each meeting has been tense and unproductive . In the most recent clash between police and protesters , which was near the path of the pipeline and happened last week , officers used tear gas , rubber bullets and large water hoses in freezing weather . Organizers said at least 17 protesters were taken to the hospital , some for hypothermia and one for a serious arm injury , and one officer was injured . Archambault called the confrontation an act of terror against unarmed protesters that was sanctioned by Kirchmeier . But Kirchmeier , who has the backing of the state 's Republican governor and attorney general , defended officers ' actions . He and other authorities said officers were assaulted with rocks , bottles and burning logs . He retired from the North Dakota Highway Patrol as a captain after 29 years , and had served in the National Guard for four years . The protests are demanding : Kirchmeier has n't had a day off since August , routinely working more than 12 hours a day . The 34 deputies in his department are pulling similar shifts , he said , even with help from more than 1,200 officers from North Dakota and nine other states . Some officers have been targeted online by protesters , Kirchmeier included . He said someone recently posted the location of his father 's grave , which he took as an effort to intimidate . President Barack Obama raised the possibility of rerouting the pipeline earlier this month , and construction on the last remaining large chunk , which is on federal land near the reservation , was halted by the Corps for the time being . But Kelcy Warren , CEO of pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners , told The Associated Press the company wo n't do any rerouting . Kirchmeier , like many other of the state 's elected officials , blame the Obama administration for not stepping in . With winter looming , the Corps has decided to close the land north of the Cannonball River where the Oceti Sakowin protest encampment have flourished on Dec. 5 , also citing the confrontations between protesters and authorities , according to a letter Archambault said he received . The agency says anyone on the property north of the Cannonball River after Dec. 5 will be trespassing and subject to prosecution . Protest organizers said Saturday that they do n't intend to leave or stop their acts of civil disobedience .
