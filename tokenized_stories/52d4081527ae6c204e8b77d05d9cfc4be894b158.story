The penalty followed a public comment period . On around Jan. 17 , 2015 , the pipeline split at a weld and oil began spilling into the Yellowstone , just upstream from Glendive . Around the same time , residents of the town began reporting a bad taste and smell from drinking water . The community switched to bottled sources . Benzene , a carcinogen , was detected in the drinking water at a level three times the limit for long-term exposure risk , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . Oil was detected in fish captured near the leak site . Ice covering the river made recovery and containment difficult , at times halting the effort . Much of the oil traveled downstream under the ice , according to the DEQ . Oil sheens were reported as far away as Williston , North Dakota . Crews recovered less than 10 percent of the oil . The busted line was the responsibility of Bridger Pipeline LLC , which is one of many companies operated by True Oil out of Casper , Wyoming . The business had a history of 30 spills and a number of fines by the time of the Glendive incident . Prior to the penalty on Thursday , Bridger Pipeline paid for spill response , cleanup and site management work by the DEQ , according to department spokeswoman Jeni Flatow . A separate environmental assessment will continue , which could lead to more fines for Bridger Pipeline . In October , the Montana Department of Justice announced it would seek compensation for damages caused in the spill . It 's still in the planning stages to determine the scope of the assessment , said Beau Downing , environmental science specialist at the justice department . The assessment will determine what should be paid for the spill 's damage to the ecosystem . It 's different from the DEQ penalty announced Thursday , which deals with remediation projects for the future . That includes plant , animal and environmental resources , he said . There is no timeline for its completion . In 2011 , Exxon 's Silvertip Pipeline leaked 63,000 gallons of oil into the Yellowstone River near Laurel . The penalty will go toward environmental restoration .
