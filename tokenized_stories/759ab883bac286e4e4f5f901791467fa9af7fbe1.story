This Dec. 10 , 2016 photo provided by the North Dakota Department of Health shows an oil spill from the Belle Fourche Pipeline that was discovered Dec. 5 in Ash Coulee Creek , a tributary of the Little Missouri River , near Belfield , N.D. . The discovery of the pipeline spill in western North Dakota has drawn heightened attention because of the battle over the Dakota Access oil pipeline being built across the state . While the spill was on a different pipeline , the Standing Rock Sioux and its supporters say a spill on the Dakota Access pipeline could threaten the tribe 's drinking water , which is drawn from the Missouri River . About 176,000 gallons of oil spilled , with about 130,000 gallons that flowed into Ash Coulee Creek . A photo released by the North Dakota Department of Health shows the brown muck on the creek 's surface , and another photo shows what appears to be the pipeline break with oil oozing out . As of Wednesday , about 46,000 gallons had been recovered . Regulators do n't expect the cleanup to be completed until spring . It appears no oil got into the Little Missouri River , and no drinking water sources were threatened , according to Bill Suess , an environmental scientist with the health department . The creek was free-flowing when the spill occurred but has since frozen over . The spill was in a remote area of the southwest part of the state , far from any major population centers . It fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway . A landowner spotted the spill Dec. 5 . Electronic monitoring equipment failed to detect the rupture , but it 's not clear why , according to Wendy Owen , a spokeswoman for Casper , Wyoming-based True Cos. , which operates the pipeline . The pipeline was shut down as soon as the leak was discovered . Owen said erosion of a hillside might have ruptured the pipe , but the cause is still being investigated . It 's sizeable , but there have been much larger oil spills in North Dakota . In September 2013 , a Tesoro Corp. pipeline break spilled more than 840,000 gallons of oil into a wheat field near Tioga . That spill is still being cleaned up . True Cos. has a history of spills in North Dakota and Montana , including a January 2015 pipeline break into the Yellowstone River . That 32,000-gallon spill temporarily shut down water supplies in the downstream community of Glendive , Montana , after oil was detected in the city 's water treatment system . It 's much smaller . The 6-inch steel Belle Fourche Pipeline , built in the 1980s , is mostly underground but crosses Ash Coulee Creek above ground . It 's one of a network of thousands of miles of similar pipelines that crisscross western North Dakota 's oil patch to pick up oil from wells and carry it to collection points , where it ultimately moves into larger pipelines or railroad tankers destined for refineries across the U.S. . The Dakota Access pipeline is a 30-inch steel pipeline that will carry nearly 20 million gallons of North Dakota oil daily through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois . It is largely complete except for a segment , blocked by the federal government , that 's near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation , where it would be buried 90 to 115 feet below Lake Oahe . Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners says the line will have modern leak detection equipment , and that workers monitoring the pipeline remotely could close valves within three minutes if a breach was detected . The Standing Rock tribe argues that putting the pipeline under the lake imperils drinking water for more than 8,000 tribal members and millions downstream . ETP and other pipeline advocates maintain that transporting oil through pipelines is safer than shipping it by truck or train . appears no oil got into the Little Missouri River , and no drinking water sources were threatened , according to Bill Suess , an environmental scientist with the health department . spill was in a remote area of the southwest part of the state , far from any major population centers . pipeline was shut down as soon as the leak was discovered .
