Energy Transfer , which operates the 1100-mile -LRB- 1770-kilometre -RRB- pipeline , has begun filling the line with crude and could reach full operating capacity by late April , based on industry estimates . Energy Transfer was not immediately available for comment . BNP said it made the decision after a review of the project and consulting with all of its stakeholders . After the pipeline was approved , lingering protestors cleared the encampment occupied since August at the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation near Cannon Ball , North Dakota . Some protesters have turned their focus to divestment campaigns targeting banks with a stake in the pipeline . Cities such as Seattle and San Francisco have divested from Dakota-invested banks .
