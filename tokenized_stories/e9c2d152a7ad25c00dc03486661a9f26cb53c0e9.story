Photo by Elizabeth Hoover Since April , thousands of Indigenous people and their allies have converged on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and treaty lands , to support the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in their opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- , slated to cross under the Missouri River directly upstream from the reservation . Some people come for the weekend , others have quit their jobs and made resisting this pipeline their full time work . They spend their days building infrastructure at the camp , chopping wood , sorting donations , praying and singing at the main fire , and putting their bodies on the line between the land and an energy company determined to drill through it . Dedicated volunteers at the Oceti Sakowin Camp , the Sacred Stone Camp , and the Rosebud Camp , all clustered at the edge of the Cannonball River , spend hours a day focused on exactly that . I had the opportunity to visit Oceti Sakowin from November 17-28 , and to work in and visit some of these kitchens . Inside the Main Kitchen . Photo by Brian Yazzie I started out in the Main Kitchen , in the upper portion of Oceti Sakowin camp , since this is where my friend Chef Brian Yazzie had been working during his visits , and he wanted me to check and see how they were doing . But by the time I arrived Conan , a vegan chef of Afro-Euro-Asian-Indigenous Caribbean ancestry from the Netherlands , had softened a little . He described how he had once worked for a collective of vegan chefs , cooking in refugee camps in Greece for 8,000 people a day . He described the reactions of the refugees as similar to the Native people he was cooking for here . They needed a traditional soup to feed them all . In one hour . In this way , through a constant series of improvisations , everyone is fed . Photo by Elizabeth Hoover Since the founding of that Main Kitchen , other kitchens have split off , to serve their own style of cuisine or their own distinct communities . Winona Kasto , from the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe , arrived at the Oceti Sakowin camp in August with a pup tent and two pairs of clothes , and has been back and forth ever since . Which people are happy to do , in exchange for the food that she offers freely . Her kitchen has received donations from her tribe -LRB- Cheyenne River Sioux -RRB- , as well as buffalo from the Northern Cheyenne Araphao tribe , and lots of eggs and potatoes from Organic Valley Farms . In the week and a half I was there , this camp and kitchen changed by the day , as new tents went up to house produce , dry goods , and a new dining hall . In the background is the water truck that came around every day to deliver fresh drinking water to camps . Photo by Elizabeth Hoover Winona shelling dried sweet corn .

Rachel , who works along side fellow head chef Maria in this kitchen , has been at Oceti Sakowin camp for two months . To be a good relative we receive people and welcome you . Whatever we have , we can offer . The shelves , the pots , even the floors , extra storage . People whose friends have eaten in her kitchen seek Rachel out , and she welcomes them all in . Diane Hart and Pat Joseph in the California Kitchen . Diane is from Bishop Paiute tribe in California , and her tribe , as well as the Seven Council Fires , has provided much of the infrastructure for this camp . Everything else comes from donations , which were constantly streaming in the door . She retrieved what she could from the wreckage , although was disgusted to report that many of her things were torn apart and urinated on by police , and had to be discarded , and that one of her big tents was destroyed by a bulldozer . She gathered what was left and moved her kitchen back down to the Oceti Sakowin camp . They currently feed hundreds of people a day out of this kitchen , planning the menu on the fly each day depending on what meat is thawed and which donations have come in . Dan set to work pawing through it and pulling out a number of ears to prepare . We then rinsed the corn , and set it aside to add to a wild rice and hominy salad . We never got a photo of the finished product becuase we ran to the front lines of the action on the bridge on Sunday night -LRB- November 20 -RRB- , before the salad was finished . We were working in California kitchen when a man rushed in and declared all able bodied people needed to rush to the front lines because the camp was under attack . tear gas , launched at water protectors . photo by Elizabeth Hoover icy water sprayed on water protectors . photo by Elizabeth Hoover icy water sprayed on water protectors . photo by Elizabeth Hoover But some did stay behind , to finish the meal , and make sure cold and injured water protectors had hot food to come back to . Grandma Diane had recounted the night that all of the Main Kitchen staff were arrested on the front lines , which then meant all of the other kitchens had to step up to feed everyone . Now to prevent this , she makes sure some stay behind to do the important work of keeping everyone fed . Oglala -LRB- Wounded Knee -RRB- kitchen Southwest camp kitchen Two Spirit camp kitchen New kitchen being built at Sacred Stone camp . Photo by Elizabeth Hoover All of these kitchens are powered through donations , some of which go directly to the individual kitchens , and many of which go directly to the Main Kitchen to be stored in the army tent pantries . By November , the white rice had formed its own mountain , along side bean mountain . Most of the food was good ; some arrived years expired , or in unlabeled home canned jars with mysterious contents . Rice mountain .

Photos by Elizabeth Hoover AIM chapter out of California delivering food supplies to the Main Kitchen . Becuase Brian had cooked at the camp before , he knew what to bring . People came from various kitchens across camp to collect fresh fruit and produce , cooking pots and pans , cutting boards and knives , and other necessary camp supplies . Brian Yazzie handing off produce to Winona . Photo by Elizabeth Hoover Shark meat and venison tacos made by chef Brian Yazzie . Shark meat from California was one of the more unusual food donations , along with 2,000 lbs of alpaca meat donated by a couple from Oregon , that Winona turned into stew .

Hasty photo by Elizabeth Hoover -LRB- before stuffing them into my mouth -RRB- In addition to much needed fresh produce , there have also been efforts to bring traditional indigenous foods to camp to feed water protectors .

Dried red chile , Green chile , Elk meat , Deer meat , Buffalo Meat , Tamales , Pueblo pies , Pueblo Cookies . Frybread being made at Pueblo Camp . They were later rescued by a group of veterans , although they have been rendered unusable . Photo by Elizabeth Hoover In addition to fueling bodies with traditional foods , the methods and tools used to procure them are being repurposed to the fight . He lamented how those canoes had gone out hundreds of time to gather traditional foods , and were now intended for his daughters to learn this skill . Undeterred , the Cold Water Rescue Team is procuring new boats . Canoes being used to ferry water protectors over to Turtle Island , the day before they were stolen and destroyed . Photo by Elizabeth Hoover The action on Turtle Island was happening at the same time as Native chefs back at camp were coordinating an epic Thanksgiving dinner . Jane Fonda and Shaylene Woodley coordinated with cafe owner Judy Wicks to cater and serve dinner to water protectors at the Standing Rock High School . People at the camp had mixed feelings about Thanksgiving . Thanksgiving was a holiday that appropriated Native peoples and she refused to take part in it . She and others were going to have their big meal the next day instead . People were not celebrating a fabricated scene between Pilgrims and Indians , they were there celebrating life and unity , and praying for the protection of their camp and the water . Native elders , then women and children and then men were served first . Then non-Native people were invited into the dome to eat . Thanksgiving Dinner in the geodome . There were bean salads , maccaroni salads and green salads . There were also a number of wild rice dishes , cut up fruit , pies , and fry bread . Serving Thanksgiving dinner inside the geodome . Photo by Brian Yazzie Prayerful march to Turtle Island on Thanksgiving Day . Photo by Elizabeth Hoover I want to conclude just by saying how I continue to be amazed with , and touched by these food providers . I was impressed with their generosity of time , spirit , and food . The determination with which they approached each morning and each meal . The absolute fierceness with which they loved each person who came into their kitchens , and each person who went to the front lines for this movement . On December 4th cheers erupted around the country when it was announced that the Army Corp of Engineers was denying DAPL a permit to drill under Lake Oahe . But many people at this camp , including the chefs , are skeptical and not packing up yet . As I write , Winona is currently coordinating an emergency kitchen at the Casino Pavilion for people who are being evacuated from Oceti Sakowin during a blizzard . The movement continues . Winona Katso and her immense soup pot . On the evening of the Nov 20th bridge action , Winona was cooking soup until 3 am , making sure that each cold and wet water protector who came back to camp had a hot meal .
