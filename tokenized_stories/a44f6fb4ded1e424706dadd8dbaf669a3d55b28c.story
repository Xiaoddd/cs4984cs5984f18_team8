After the Obama administration denied the company a key permit to finish construction , Native American activists warned that the win was only temporary and that Trump , an investor in the pipeline corporation , would seek to quickly advance the project next year . Some indigenous advocates and environmental groups have focused their efforts to hurt the pipeline company 's profits on an approaching 1 January deadline that the operator , Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- ETP -RRB- , cited in court records . Protesters march along the pipeline route during a protest against the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in St. Anthony , North Dakota , U.S. November 11 , 2016 . Shippers contacted by the Guardian either did not respond to inquiries or declined to comment on the terms of their contracts with Energy Transfer . Regardless of the significance of the January date , opponents of the project argued that the continuing suspension of the project is already having a big impact on the ETP 's bottom line . Earlier this month , the Swedish bank Nordea said it would not back the pipeline if the corporation violated the demands of the Standing Rock tribe . Tim Donaghy , senior research specialist with Greenpeace , which has petitioned banks to abandon DAPL , noted that reports of extreme police violence against Native Americans have further fueled the divestment efforts . Police use a water cannon on protesters during a protest against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation , near Cannon Ball , North Dakota , U.S. November 20 , 2016 . Global oil prices began to collapse in 2014 after shippers committed to DAPL , and production in the Bakken Shale oil field has fallen , which has created major hardships for drillers , according to the recent Ieefa report . That means the existing pipeline infrastructure may be adequate to handle regional oil production , and that if the contract deadline does expire , shippers could be eager to pull out or renegotiate favorable terms . Dallas Goldtooth , organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network , who has been a leader on the ground at Standing Rock , said a permanent cancellation of the project could have long-term implications for the industry . The company should not be trusted , she said , noting that the construction site was being monitored to ensure that DAPL workers do not start drilling under the Missouri river , which provides the tribe 's water supply .
