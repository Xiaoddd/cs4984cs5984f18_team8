I emailed to see if she was ok . There were photos of the types of dogs on the walls and piss stains on the floor . They also did n't read me my rights or even say I was under arrest . She told me they were bussed to a facility where they were kept in dog cages with urine stains on the floor , pictures of dogs hung on the walls . She went on to tell me they were strip-searched . After a day in jail , they were charged with class C felony for tampering with and damaging public services . If you want to know what you can do about this , just use less .
