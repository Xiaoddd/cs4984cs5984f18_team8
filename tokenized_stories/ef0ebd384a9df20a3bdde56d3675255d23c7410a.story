As many arrows banded together we are strong and powerful , our Indigenous family with people with good hearts from across the world showed it . This is a very important battle won , but we know the war will go on . For now let us celebrate that we are on the side of truth and justice . We shall not abandon our defense of our Earth Mother and protection of our precious waters . By Chili Yazzie Censored News -LRB- Sat . Dec. 3 , 2016 -RRB- Dine ' Warriors for Standing Update : our Warriors are on the way , they left late , one of the drivers got lost on the Rez , ydl . After a ceremony to send them on their way with good blessings by the Rez wide NAC members who just happen to be meeting here , we are all feeling strong and proud . They will not get into Denver until 9-10 pm . They will have late supper and a rest break at Hillcrest Christian Church , 3000 S. Race St. , Denver . Area relatives come out and greet them . There is room on the bus . So if you have the time and commitment , pack some warm clothes and join our Warriors . It 's been good . I 'm feeling tired but happy . And oh yeah , a large bald eagle visited us at Shiprock Chapter to see off the Warriors . Dark forces intervened and halted plans for Navajo Veterans to charter a plane to Standing Rock . Navajo Veterans will come by bus , leaving Saturday morning , and invite others to join the caravan for a water protectors caravan . I want to thank Beverly Maxwell , Angie Barney-Nez , Eunice Begay , Redawn George , Anthony Aspaas , Anderson Tullie , Ray Daw and others for recruiting Vets to go and figuring out the logistics . It was not easy and we put our best effort to it in spite of the missed communication , miscommunication , limited networking and governmental restrictions . But we were able to bring together a strong and proud group that will represent us well at Standing Rock . Everyone who is going including the vehicles that will follow the buses will leave Shiprock after briefings and prayers , departure time is 11:00 this morning . The route will be over Wolf Creek Pass and onto Denver where the group will have supper at the Hillcrest Christian Church . The roads all the way should be good and the plan is to get to Cannonball by Sunday afternoon . Even with our hectic efforts to fill the buses , we still have room and the invitation is open to all who want to go , you can get on the bus and we will work out the details in Shiprock . The lead persons for the buses are Beverly Maxwell and Anthony Aspaas , you can call Anthony at 505.860.0742 for questions . Standing Rock Camp at night . Photo by John Heminger . As of noon yesterday we were ready to fly first-class , by 3:00 that came crashing down . My contact from the Veterans Stand for Standing Rock group called and said the plane deal fell through . For some moments my world unraveled then I started giving it some analysis . My thought is that some dark force put the screw to the plane company ; perhaps there is a corporate relationship between the plane company and the dark forces pushing the pipeline . That may or may not be case but that is fine , they can have their damn plane . You also have to think , why should we be flying first class when the relatives are living in bitter cold up there . Shortly after the devastating phone call I got another call from Ari with the National Nurses United and after talking with her awhile it became apparent that they were the ones who were paying for the plane . We worked it out to have the funds transferred to a local 501c3 who will channel the funds for us to pay for buses and whatever else we need for the trip . So we are regrouping and we will lease 3 buses instead of 2 . Thinking it through , the buses are a better way for us to get there ; we travel on our own terms , no unnecessary restrictions and we can pack mutton and blue bird flour . We will take as many Veterans as we can and open up the rest of the seats to non-Vets . This is also a call-out to all Water Protectors to join up with their vehicles and make it a real caravan . I say we are blessed because we are true to our Earth Mother . We will leave Saturday morning , the beauty of the buses is we can have one run to Window Rock , Chinle and Mexican Water and another can run from Albuquerque to Gallup to Shiprock to pick up people . I will post a new update at noon today with the schedule , pickup stops , travel routes , etc. . The caravan will get to Denver by supper time , ideally to be received by family in the area to provide food and a place to rest for a couple hours . Denver area relatives , can you pull that together . We will continue into the night up 85 and then east on 94 . Anyone who can help accommodate the caravan along the way and advise on road conditions , please inbox Redawn George . We will roll into Cannonball Sunday afternoon to rest up at the Cannonball Community Center . We will be ready for some strong days of prayer , camaraderie and Solidarity with our Standing Rock family . U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii , herself a decorated veteran , will be joining with the Veterans Stand for Standing Rock mobilization to support the protectors and help raise public attention to the growing human rights emergency that has emerged at the protest site in the face of increased attacks . The NNU donation will assist a delegation of Navajo veterans from Arizona and New Mexico who will join the veterans gathering this weekend . Concurrently , NNU is dispatching its third delegation of RN volunteers Saturday to stand in solidarity with the water protectors and their supporters . One protester , 21-year-old Sophia Wilansky , has faced the loss of an arm after being hit with a police concussion grenade , according to the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council . NNU volunteers will also be on hand this coming weekend . Why must we continue to put our human waste -LRB- poop , urine , etc -RRB- , into the very element we are wanting to protect .

People are carpooling where they can which is helping cut down on some of the cost . I 'm sure some people are wealthy enough to be able to afford electric cars . They 're doing the best they can with what they currently have . December 2 , 2016 at 9:23 AM A'aniinin said ... smh December 2 , 2016 at 9:26 AM Linda West said ...

My prayers and my heart and spirit are with you . This is a war that will not be won or lost with one battle . Anonymous is correct that there is much we need to do to protect our water . However the stand off is not MAKING money for them , it is in fact losing profits . We must stand strong and we must realize we are in this forever . We will continue to fight for Mother Earth as long as there are those who are willing to harm her . December 2 , 2016 at 10:02 AM Anonymous said ...

It is important in so many ways for the vetrans to get there . December 2 , 2016 at 10:30 AM Porzitski said ... Everyone who might support this cause , Water Is Life , and all it entails must be ready to sacrifice SOMEthing for the cause . Americans , we can not continue living the way we live and expect ANYthing to change . Think about what you can live without . Think then about what you WILL live without , because clean water , or justice , or ridding ourselves of our dependence on the poisoners , is so important to you . You can do it . If we do not , all our lofty feeling and empathy is neither of these , it is just hot air . December 2 , 2016 at 10:41 AM lakotawinyan said ... No one should be trying to fly first class . Take a comfortable bus . I have been funding my own trips to Standing Rock even though I struggle financially . This is a sacrifice we make and I hate when some groups think they can get first class travel and as a veteran , I find this selfish . I am an elder and yet I feel obligated not to milk limited funds . If they could give me some gas money , fine , but I do n't expect first class travel . Cripes . My Chippewa tribe in ND has more veterans than the rest of the North Dakota tribes combined but we do n't ask for special treatment and we are a poor tribe with little resources . December 2 , 2016 at 10:49 AM Hygeia Halfmoon said ... Check street corners of every city , because that is where you will find cold and hungry homeless veterans holding their little cardboard signs in the hopes of some food ... would make their day to actually be able to serve a Nation that is serving everyone for the highest good of all concerned . It is blatant disrespect for the charter plane to jack up the price when they found out where and why the plane was flying . This company should be boycotted too , along with Ace Hardware . I have the utmost respect for our veterans for standing beside the Water Protectors and thank you for serving , so that we may enjoy the quality of life that we live .

Divine intervention perhaps , as you were being protected . December 2 , 2016 at 12:40 PM Anonymous said ... People confuse stopping the pipeline and oil.the oil is not intended for the USA and the pipeline is being built to save the company money moving the crude oil through the US . The pipeline endangers us and does not make any jobs . The only work is making is temporary until built . Love & Respect . Praying for safe journey and safe return .

I wonder why you are not more offended that an oil company csn use Emanent domain for their own personal use . We as Americans should all heed the call to stand up and call fowl . You are losing you rights and dont even see it . Its ok to you that concussion grenandes are being thrown at peaceful water protectors and one woman lost her arm . Its tine to stand up and wake up ... this is Selma ... 2016 versio . I pray for your enlightenment December 2 , 2016 at 7:52 PM Victoria Love said ... Considering how much money the US government and the private company that is installing the pipeline Have spent trying to take what is not theirs to have , they could 've spent it rerouting it to the alternate version which would have taken the pipeline away from the water supply and the burial ground . But no , nobody thought about that . That would be too easy . So it was rerouted to go through where it is now , and ruining drinking water for 18 million ppl down the Missouri river , to the Mississippi , to the Gulf . Wakonda works things for the good and takes care of us , so if the bus is how He wants it done , so be it . The water protectors and veterans are prayed up daily , and taking the bus worked out for the better . Best wishes from australia . Our elders come with their own personal challenges . Their presence will speak in many ways to the importance of Standing Rock . Time to put out our welcome mat and nia weh at this time . December 2 , 2016 at 9:25 PM walk with heart in hand said ... Many prayers and blessing sent for your safe travels . I 'm sure the comradely will be enjoyed and will create a lifetime of friendships as well .

This is a national disgrace : a continuation of colonial aggression and violence extending back more than 500 years . That we are here yet again , forcing indigenous people at gunpoint to accept something the -LRB- mostly white -RRB- population of Bismark refused to accept , because they were concerned the pipleline might endanger their water supply , breaks my heart and makes me very angry . All proceeds go directly to help the tribe and not one cent goes to me . Please watch , share , and contribute to Standing Rock as you are able . - I could use a refresher myself .
