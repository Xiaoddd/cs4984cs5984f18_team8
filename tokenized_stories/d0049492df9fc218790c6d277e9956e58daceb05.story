The cattle farmer from Burgettstown in Washington County picked up a rock twice the size of his fist from the earth that covers the Rover natural gas pipeline where it cuts through the rolling hills on his property . He angrily threw it to the ground . According to Bentrem , Rover Pipeline LLC has not held up their end of the agreement . He feels they have left too much deep soil and rocks on the surface of his meadow , which will negatively affect the quality of the grass Bentrem feeds to his cows . The Rover pipeline , owned by Energy Transfer Partners , will transport natural gas from Western Pennsylvania to Ohio and Michigan . Bentrem was speaking about the June 7 explosion of a TransCanada natural gas pipeline near Moundsville , West Virginia . Although the ensuing fire was visible for miles , there were no injuries or reports of property damage . Columbia Gas Transmissions , a subsidiary of TransCanada , told federal regulators that a landslide appears to have caused this rupture and explosion . Once the pipelines are in operation , there are risks of ruptures and explosions . On its website , Shell states unequivocally that safety is the top priority in the construction of this pipeline . It will be buried at a minimum depth of 4 feet , and it is rated for nearly twice the expected operating pressure . Kayakers at the Allegheny River demonstrate against fracking and the petrochemical industry in front of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center where a conference of the petrochemical industry is being held . However , the DEP could block construction by denying Shell the permits it needs to cross bodies of water . To explain his fear of losing the reservoir , he pointed to recent problems with another pipeline , the Mariner East 2 . 58 violation notices in two years The Mariner East 2 is 350-mile-long pipeline currently under construction by Sunoco . It will transport natural gas liquids like ethane and butane from Western Pennsylvania and Ohio to Marcus Hook near Philadelphia . From there , the liquids will be shipped to the Gulf Coast and refineries in Europe . Most of the violations are related to bentonite spilling into the soil and bodies of water . Bentonite is a fluid used when contractors bore horizontal holes for the pipeline . When the drilling goes as planned , the contractor recovers all the bentonite from the borehole . However , the bentonite often escapes through cracks in the soil during drilling . On June 25 , 2018 , contractors are working on a sinkhole at Lisa Drive in Exton , Pa. that was caused by drilling for the Mariner East 2 pipeline . It exposed an existing pipeline that had to be taken out of service . The contractor is trying to fill the hole with grout . Her company is following a DEP-approved contingency plan designed to prevent spills and minimize their adverse impacts . Bill Godsey , a consultant with 20 years of experience advising pipeline companies and serving as a pipeline inspector for the Texas Railroad Commission , believes the severity of these spills is overstated . He is skeptical because bentonite is a non-hazardous material . He believes the volume of bentonite used in the drilling process at any given location is too small to affect the reservoir . Kirk Jalbert , a scientist with FracTracker , strongly disagrees . Jalbert , who is currently employed by Arizona State University , points to a loophole in the current pipeline approval procedure . Because the Falcon and the Mariner East 2 do not transport natural gas but rather natural gas liquids , they do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission . Because of this , they do not have to go through a full environmental impact analysis . Instead , the pipeline companies only have to provide environmental impact analysis to the state DEP for the areas where they need water crossing permits and sediment permits . The pipeline companies only have to provide environmental impact analysis to the DEP for areas where they need water crossing permits and sediment permits . Friedman , who lives with his family near the Mariner East 2 , claims there are dozens of schools in Pennsylvania where children are at risk because they are located close to pipelines . Pipes are laying ready in Chester County , Pa. to be put in the ground as part of the Mariner East 2 pipeline . Subsidence , the sinking of the ground under the pipe , was the cause of this incident . The Middletown Coalition for Community Safety retained Quest Consultants Inc. to perform hazard calculations associated with the accidental release of ethane from the Mariner East 2 at a point near Glenwood Elementary School . Quest Consultants used computer modelling to describe two worst-case scenarios for a rupture . If the gas ignited immediately , it could produce a fireball with a blast radius up to 1,100 feet . In the case of delayed ignition , the combustible vapor could migrate 1,800 feet in three minutes and then create a fire that would trace back to the leak . Quest Consultants did not calculate the odds of such a worst-case scenario happening . Godsey , the consultant from Texas , thinks the risk of any pipeline catching fire or exploding is very small . On average , for every 10,000 miles there are 1.2 incidents per year involving injury , death , substantial property damage or spillage . Both Sunoco , the owner of the Mariner East 2 and a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners , and Shell , which plans to construct the Falcon pipeline , claim to have excellent safety records for their pipelines . Friedman , the Middletown community safety advocate , said that Sunoco has had 300 pipeline accidents since 2006 . FracTracker , the organization Jalbert works for , claims based on data from PHMSA that Shell is responsible for 194 pipeline accidents in the United States since 2002 . In Pennsylvania , contractors have to call 811 three days prior to any excavation to determine whether it is safe to dig . And indeed , on May 21 , a contractor installing a water main hit a section of the Mariner East 2 in Middletown . Sunoco had informed the contractor that the pipeline , not in operation yet , was buried 9 feet deep . Threats to real estate values Whether its risks are real or overstated , the Mariner East 2 has already upset the real estate market in Delaware County . Alec Schwartz , a real estate broker with Coldwell Banker Preferred in Ambler , Pennsylvania , calculated that home prices in the Middletown catchment areas that feed into the Glenwood Elementary are lagging . Horizontal drilling caused a mud blowout in Middletown , Pa. . Instead of coming back through the borehole , the drilling fluid -LRB- non-toxic bentonite -RRB- escaped to the surface and destroyed a lawn near an apartment complex . A report from the Philadelphia Inquirer presented several cases of people having regrets about buying houses in Delaware County when they learned the previous owners had signed an easement allowing Sunoco to place the Mariner East 2 in their backyards . Pictures do n't lie Doug Bentrem walked across his property where the Rover pipeline was buried and meticulously took pictures with his cell phone at every location where he was unhappy about how his field was restored .
