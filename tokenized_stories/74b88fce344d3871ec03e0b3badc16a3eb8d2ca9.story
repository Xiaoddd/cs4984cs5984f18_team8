A protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- gathered outside the New York Public Library at 1 pm on Saturday where activists made speeches and said prayers before marching to Trump Tower . The project was shelved during the Obama administration , but restarted after President Trump signed an executive order to fast track it shortly after he took office . The pro-Trump rally quietened down just as the Standing Rock protest arrived outside Trump Tower on 5th Avenue . Several NYPD vehicles blocked the road . The two groups were separated by a heavy police contingent . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota say the project passes through sacred Native American land and threatens their primary source of drinking water . The event has been widely publicized on social media gaining thousands of shares . All rights reserved . This website uses cookies . Read RT Privacy policy to find out more .
