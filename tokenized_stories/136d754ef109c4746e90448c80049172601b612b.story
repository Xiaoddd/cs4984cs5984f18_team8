But the effort to build a lawsuit began in earnest in January . TigerSwan personnel were tasked directly by lawyers working for ETP with fulfilling information requests , according to two former contractors .

The firm also compiled descriptions of movement leaders and individuals arrested by law enforcement , and tracked donations to DAPL-related GoFundMe accounts .
