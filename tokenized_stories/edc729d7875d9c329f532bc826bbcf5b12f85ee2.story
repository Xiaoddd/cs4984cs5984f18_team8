Leak discovered by passerby The chairman of the South Dakota watchdog , Chris Nelson , confirmed that there was a spill from Keystone , and that state environmental officials were overseeing the cleanup . In a brief phone interview , he told National Observer that a member of the public may have been the one that discovered the spill . If confirmed , this would mean that the company 's leak detection system failed to identify the incident . Nelson also said that the company gave the commission an early estimate of the amount of oil that was spilled . But he added that there would not likely be a firm number available until the company digs up and excavates the line . In Canada , TransCanada 's proposed Energy East project , expected to generate thousands of construction jobs , would be able to ship more than one million barrels of oil per day from Alberta and Saskatchewan to refineries in Quebec and New Brunswick . The Energy East project would also be designed to allow major new exports of Canadian oil from tankers leaving Atlantic Canada . Energy East is now under review in Canada by the National Energy Board -LRB- NEB -RRB- . Keystone is a new pipeline that was approved by the NEB and U.S. regulators before it began commercial operations in June 2010 . It was shipping about 500,000 barrels of heavy crude per day from Hardisty , Alberta to Cushing , Oklahoma . The pipeline was expected to be the first phase of the Keystone XL pipeline expansion project that would have eventually linked Alberta 's oilsands producers to refineries on the Gulf coast of Texas . But Keystone XL was rejected by U.S. President Barack Obama last November . The company said it would provide regular updates to government agencies as it continues with clean-up efforts near the site in Hutchinson County , South Dakota . The line is expected to remain closed until Friday , CBC News reported . The weekend oil spill is not the first incident on Keystone . In Canada , TransCanada reported 21 incidents during the first year of operation , mainly small quantities of oil being spilled near pump stations and later cleaned up . One of the affected sections of the line suffered a 97 per cent loss of metal , near the Mississippi River , leaving a remaining wall thickness of 0.012 inches , the U.S. agency had said in a notice .
