Ome Tlaloc walked through the North Dakota hills with a flashlight and a walkie-talkie , scouting for police in the prairie dark . Now he was doing reconnaissance . The barricade was meant to stop the cops , or at least to slow them down . In late July , the Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners informed the Standing Rock Sioux that in five days its subsidiary would begin construction on a section of the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- next to the reservation . Their encampments of teepees , tents , and RVs were mostly ignored by the media until private security guards set dogs on protesters and a few journalists were arrested , sparking a national conversation about tribal sovereignty , environmental racism , and police brutality . A leak or spill , activists believed , would poison the drinking water of as many as 10 million people , nearly all of them on Native American reservations . If the protesters were removed before then , Dakota Access would complete the 1,172-mile pipeline that would transport up to 570,000 barrels of crude a day . Off in the distance was the trench holding the lengths of 30-inch metal pipe . Back at the barricade , men in camo fatigues sipped cowboy coffee and waited . Pup tents formed a circle around a pit fire . Resting his cowboy boots on a soup pot , he told us about his participation in the 1973 standoff between members of the American Indian Movement and law enforcement agents in South Dakota that ended in the deaths of two Native American activists . His future son-in-law , he said , was bringing him a rifle . On Sept. 3 , security contractors turned dogs on the protesters . Not long afterward , Standing Rock Sioux tribal Chair Dave Archambault II asked the Justice Department to investigate civil rights violations against activists . Cops fired rubber bullets at protesters and blasted them with earsplitting whines from Long Range Acoustic Devices . More than 1 in 4 Native people live in poverty . Native unemployment levels are nearly double those of the overall population ; their youth suicide rate is the highest in the nation . An early proposal to route the Dakota Access Pipeline through Bismarck , 45 miles north of the reservation , was rejected by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers because of concerns that it could harm the municipal water supply . In May 2015 , the coastline near his reservation was ravaged by the rupture of an oil pipeline . Young protesters with red bandannas over their faces dragged tree trunks onto the highway and set them on fire . A heavyset teen stood before the flaming barricade , his back to the police . He paused and looked at his feet like he might cry . Someone else picked up the chant . The scene underscored the conflicts within the anti-pipeline movement . Some activists , led in part by a group of protesters who lived in a compound called Red Warrior Camp , were committed to stopping the pipeline through direct action . While many Standing Rock Sioux were out on the front lines , Archambault was also lobbying Washington in hopes of a legal victory . In early November , Red Warrior Camp was asked to leave Standing Rock for promoting tactics that the tribal leadership thought were too extreme . There were also tensions between white-led environmental groups like 350.org , which focuses on climate change , and Native activists , who believe the larger issue is one of tribal sovereignty and the unfinished struggle for Native American rights . I quit . Allard , a Sioux woman , was hosting a protest camp on her land ; she was accompanied by her husband , Miles , who had called for nonviolence at the barricades a few days earlier . Construction resumed on the pipeline , whose North Dakota section was roughly 95 percent complete . Allard recalled the life of her great-great-grandmother , Nape Hote Win , who as a 9-year-old survived the 1863 Whitestone massacre , an attack by the U.S. Army 50 miles east of Standing Rock . She was held in a prisoner-of-war camp for seven years . That battle paved the way for the Standing Rock Sioux to be confined to their current reservation . In mid-November , the Army Corps of Engineers stepped in and said it would not allow completion of the pipeline until there had been further review of its environmental impact . Reaffirming that decision in early December , the Corps said it would consider alternate routes for the pipeline . I did nothing wrong . He had gone back to Montana , feeling bitter and defeated . Adams-Zavalla , however , was in great spirits . That afternoon , the Seven Council Fires had been lit for the second time since 1862 , a ceremony in which the seven branches of the Dakota Sioux demonstrated their unity . Around us , protesters were chopping wood , battening down tarps , and getting ready for the long Dakota winter . On a hill overlooking the camp , DAPL roughnecks labored away .
