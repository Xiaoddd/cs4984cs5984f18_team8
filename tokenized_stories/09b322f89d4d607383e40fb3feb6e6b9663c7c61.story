The president had been expected to take the action by invoking a provision in a 1953 law that governs offshore leases , as CNBC previously reported . The law allows a president to withdraw any currently unleased lands in the Outer Continental Shelf from future lease sales . There is no provision in the law that allows the executive 's successor to repeal the decision , so President-elect Donald Trump would not be able to easily brush aside the action . Trump has vowed to open more federal land to oil and natural gas production in a bid to boost U.S. output . U.S. Outer Continental Shelf The lands covered include the bulk of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas in the Arctic and 31 underwater canyons in the Atlantic . The United States and Canada also announced they will identify sustainable shipping lanes through their connected Arctic waters . Canada on Tuesday also imposed a five-year ban on all oil and gas drilling licensing in the Canadian Arctic . The moratorium will be reviewed every five years . The action potentially tees up a battle that touches on hot-button issues : environmental protection , energy independence , climate change , and the scope of executive power . Bear Glacier is the largest glacier in Kenai Fjords National Park . Like other efforts by the Obama administration to advance environmental protection through executive action , it could also be challenged in the courts . It could get tied up there throughout much of Trump 's four-year term . The Republican-controlled Congress could also try to change the law . The provision , contained in the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act , has been invoked in the past to set aside smaller portions of the Outer Continental Shelf , such as coral reefs or natural habitats . Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton used the provision to block drilling in much of the Outer Continental Shelf , but for limited periods . The Obama administration 's action marks the broadest use of the statute ever because it would be far-reaching in terms of the lands it would protect and come without an expiration date . Momentum to use the provision has been building this year . In May , a coalition of environmental groups circulated a fact sheet that highlighted the authority provided under 12 -LRB- a -RRB- . In September , Democratic Congress members Frank Pallone , Jr. and Jared Huffman sent a letter to Obama urging him to exercise that authority . The letter was signed by 74 lawmakers , almost all Democrats , and contained quotes from representatives from some of the groups that produced the fact sheet in May . Environmentalists say drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic puts the waters at immediate risk , for oil and gas that would not come online for years , after a transition to cleaner energy sources could be under way . Industry groups acknowledge that offshore projects come with long lead times , but they say deepwater oil will be critical for meeting the country 's future energy needs . API said it believes Obama 's action can be overturned and said it looked forward to working with the Trump administration . To be sure , any drilling in the affected waters already faced significant challenges in the coming years . Energy companies have pulled out of Alaska 's Arctic waters , where conditions can be perilous and weather conditions allow drillers to operate for only a few months of the year . In light of more than two years of weak oil prices , drillers could not justify the costs and risks of exploration there . Last month , the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management did not include any blocks in the Atlantic , Arctic or Pacific in the latest five-year plan to lease offshore land controlled by the government . Trump could scrap that plan and develop a new auction schedule for the 2017 to 2022 period , but it typically takes two to three years to put together a new program . Drilling in the Atlantic has also faced challenges from a number of other sources , including coastal states that could be affected by a spill , as well as the Pentagon , which said drilling in the Atlantic could disrupt naval exercises . Fifty-nine percent of voters surveyed in September said they would support blocking leasing in the Arctic and Atlantic , according to a study from Hart Research Associates that was paid for by the NRDC and the League of Conservation Voters . The survey polled 1,103 registered voters by phone and had a margin of error plus or minus 2.9 percentage points . In response , the pro-drilling Arctic Energy Center conducted a survey of 511 Alaskans that found 76 percent supported drilling in Arctic waters . The margin of error was plus or minus 4.4 percentage points . Alaskans receive a cash disbursement from the state every year that is underwritten by oil revenues . In his statement , Obama said significant production in the Arctic will not occur in the current low oil price environment , citing the Department of the Interior analysis . He said Arctic communities must focus on economic diversification . Download the latest Flash player and try again . We want to hear from you . All Rights Reserved .
