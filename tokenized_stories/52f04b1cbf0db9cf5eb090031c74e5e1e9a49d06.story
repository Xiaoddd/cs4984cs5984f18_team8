Dan Hein , a 43-year-old Ohio man who has been living at the camp since September , was packing Tuesday to go home . But Gena Neal , 43 , who came from Oklahoma , said she was staying , even if protests remain subdued . Trump on Tuesday signed an executive action ordering the Army Corps of Engineers to quickly reconsider its Dec. 4 decision to stop the construction to allow time for more environmental study . Before the project can be finished , builders need permission to lay pipe under Lake Oahe , a Missouri River reservoir from which an American Indian tribe draws its drinking water . The tribe at the center of the protests , the Standing Rock Sioux , says the pipeline threatens its water and cultural sites . Developer Energy Transfer Partners disputes that . The Oahe segment is the last major piece of the four-state pipeline designed to move North Dakota oil to a shipping point in Illinois . It was not clear when the Corps will act on Trump 's memorandum . Local law enforcement agencies geared up for a possible resumption of protests after Trump 's action , but no major incidents materialized , the Morton County Sheriff 's Office said Wednesday . Clashes and arrests tailed off dramatically in recent weeks after the tribal council told the protest camp to disband because of the Dec. 4 decision , the harsh winter weather and the need to get the area cleaned up before spring flooding . At the camp 's peak , several thousand people were packed into a half-mile square , living in teepees , tents , buses , motor homes and semi-permanent wooden structures . One occupant set up a portable radio station . Others established a school for children in a large tent . Today , fewer than 300 people remain on the federal land along the confluence of the Cannon Ball and Missouri rivers . The school and radio station are gone . The site is now dotted with abandoned tents , and many of the teepee tarps have been taken down , leaving only bare frames . The ground is covered with ice and several feet of snow that have buried abandoned vehicles and piled up against buildings that were left unfinished . Even with its diminished population , the camp remains under constant surveillance from law enforcement officers and National Guard soldiers perched on nearby bluffs and in aircraft making regular flyovers . Hein still believes in the cause but is resigned to leaving . Not everyone feels that way . The tribe is planning to focus on a court battle in distant Washington , D.C. , against any reversal of the Dec. 4 decision . Within hours of Trump 's announcement , two leading pipeline opponents issued pleas on social media to maintain a presence in the area and for other supporters to come . But in interviews both LaDonna Brave Bull Allard and Chase Iron Eyes said they were not advocating a return to the large-scale protests of 2016 . Allard , who operates a separate camp on her own land , said she plans to convert it into a summer camp to teach people how to respect the land , culture , history and traditions . Iron Eyes said he advocates maintaining a presence in the area , but that anyone who comes should not expect a large camp that can provide for them . That group and others have since called on pipeline opponents to spread out around the country . Stay Informed Subscribe to our politics newsletter . Email Address Zip Code See our Privacy Policy .
