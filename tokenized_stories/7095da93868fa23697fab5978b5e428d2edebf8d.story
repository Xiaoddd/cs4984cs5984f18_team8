But on Sunday night , even as they celebrated , for now , no one at Standing Rock was going anywhere . When the announcement went out that the pipeline was being blocked , a huge roaring cheer went up from the crowd at Oceti Sakowin , the main encampment of water protectors . People prayed , wept and sang . Some lined up for a procession on horseback . A few hours later , after the sun went down , fireworks streaked across the sky . People had reason to think that Energy Transfer Partners , the company behind the pipeline , planned to keep drilling in defiance of the order . And sure enough , ETP issued a furious , aggrieved press release around 11 p.m. , along withsubsidiary Sunoco Logistics . As stated all along , ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe . Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way .

Despite temperatures threatening to drop into the single digits this week , many people seemed resolved to stay . Castaneda is an artist and photographer originally from the Salt River community near Phoenix , Arizona . He first arrived at Standing Rock in October , and stayed through most of November before returning home for a spell . He returned this week . Cunningham and a friend , social worker Kyla Ferguson , had been here since mid-November . All three noticed a sudden absence of law enforcement drones hovering over the camp on Sunday . The peace and quiet , they pointed out , coincided with an influx of media and celebrity supporters , not to mention thousands of veterans who arrived to support and defend the water protectors . All three worried that ETP and law enforcement were merely behaving themselves for now . Castaneda watched as tipis and tents were destroyed . People were sprayed with rubber bullets or dragged from where they were praying in a sweat lodge and arrested . Some 140 people were taken into custody in all . It was a scene he found hard to forget . The water protectors and veterans , he said , would go when the Standing Rock Sioux asked them to , and not a moment before . She turned back to her children .
