The Sierra Club rallied against electric lines running across the avian migratory path of the Rio Grande . Each short video began with a Vote Energy ad paid for by API featuring a wholesome mother and child or young woman smiling and saying how important it is to continue using fossil fuels as we develop renewable energy . This seemingly innocent logic is a sneaky way of brainwashing the public into thinking we have to continue sucking the earth dry of all its fossil fuels and despoil the planet . Mexico runs head-to-head with the United States and Canada in terms of shale gas resources . Now that PEMEX has been deregulated , the American oil and gas industry can frack in Mexico on a large scale . Once Mexico taps into its vast shale resources , companies like Energy Transfer Partners could profit from transporting natural gas back up the Trans-Pecos Pipeline to the U.S. once our resources are no longer profitable enough to extract . The construction of the Trans-Pecos Pipeline is not vital to the Mexican people because there are currently natural gas pipelines passing into Mexico and new ones under construction . At this very moment , Oneok Partners is burying the Roadrunner pipeline from San Elizario , Texas , near El Paso , to Mexico . The Trans-Pecos Pipeline alone will pump an additional 1.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas to Mexico per day . The existence of the Trans-Pecos Pipeline along with the Roadrunner and others are not contingent upon the energy resource needs of Mexico ; they are entirely dependent upon the continuing ability to make surplus fracked natural gas available to foreign markets . In a conference held in London on October 29 , 2014 , Pemex lured investors with plans to export liquefied natural gas to Asia as part of a Transoceanic Corridor project . Fracking activities have been toxic to the environment and human health . Leaks of the high-powered greenhouse gas methane abound . Water sources all over the state and the world have been contaminated , and the disposal wells have been linked to earthquakes . Natural gas may burn cleaner but producing it is dirty business . As pipeline corporations build more and more pipelines faster and faster to compete for profit , the number of pipeline accidents increases . Recently , Cuero , Texas , experienced another fire at a pipeline compressor station less than a year after the last pipeline fire in Cuero . In April , the Texas Eastern pipeline in Salem , Pennsylvania , ruptured injuring one man and damaging several homes . On June 23 , a pipeline leaked 700 barrels of crude oil into a canyon in Ventura , California . Pipelines are NOT safe and their environmental impact is massive . A pipeline explosion from a gas conduit the size of the Trans-Pecos Pipeline could clear a swath of land a mile wide . Many families live less than a mile from the Trans-Pecos Pipeline path . The constant winds blowing down the Toronto and Sunny Glen canyons could fan the flames of the explosion into the fastest spreading wildfire that community has ever known . Fire from mere train trestle sparks in Toronto Canyon is a constant threat to this community . In 2011 , the Gage Holland Fire burned 6,000 of acres and nearly consumed several homes before it was subdued . In that same spring , the Schwartz Fire burned 30,000 acres and the Iron Mountain Fire burned 15,000 acres . The Trans-Pecos Pipeline will cross underneath of FM 1703 , effectively cutting off the only entrance and exit for almost 200 homes in the Sunny Glen and Sunny Acres communities . Lives and property may be lost , as will many populations of endangered and threatened species . Unfortunately , destruction from the Trans-Pecos Pipeline is not merely a matter of future risk . Devastation of the Trans-Pecos region is happening NOW . Construction of the Trans-Pecos Pipeline is underway , clearing a 143 mile , 1-mile wide swath with bulldozers and trenchers . Preserving the Big Bend , an icon of the cultural and environmental heritage of Texas , is worth more than the Trans-Pecos Pipeline . Join in the fight against the Trans-Pecos Pipeline .
