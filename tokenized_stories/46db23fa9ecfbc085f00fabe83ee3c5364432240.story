In the Western world , Aristotle , for example , had attempted to find a harmony of colours . The Chinese strove toward similar interpretations , and between the 4th and 2nd century oriented themselves on the same pentatonic scale that dominated their music . Accordingly , they accepted that in its entirety colour harmony comprised five basic colours : the four cardinal points are defined by red in the south , standing for summer and fowls and poultry ; green lies to the east and represents spring , wood and the dragon ; black is to the north and stands for winter , water and the tortoise ; white is placed in the west and represents autumn and the tiger . Yellow , on the other hand , is allocated a special place and is therefore discussed in more detail . There are no laws for the Chinese ; only models . This distinction is central if Chinese culture is to be understood in the West . At the same time , the Western concept of a spirit separate from matter is inconceivable to the Chinese , to whom the universe is merely a system of behavioural entities which draw no distinction between spirit and matter . Equivalents are fundamental to Chinese thought , and because there are so many , cataloguing is essential . This also means that areas which to the Chinese are closely associated are subject to strict separation in Western thought : cosmic and social order , philosophy and medicine , geography and nutrition , art and the seasons . To a knowledge oriented towards equivalents , the idea of analogy is of great significance : contrasts are preferred to opposites . In the Chinese tradition , colours are thus to be taken as being part of a latticework of equivalents based on five fundamental elements and their products . In the illustration , the five basic colours of the Chinese tradition are arranged according to their equivalents : Red : fire , reaching upwards , corresponds to the south as dictated by the traditional Chinese cardinal points , and coincides with the warm season of summer . Black : water , delving into the depths , is in the north . Green : wood , is in the east and relates to spring . Green , the colour of spring , is also the colour of the world of plants . Incidentally , contrary to Western colour-systems , black and white are part of the same circle in Chinese colour-systems . Yellow : earth . In the code of the five elements , the earth has a carrying , supporting function , and thus also assumes the function of primary source and nutrition : the plants sprout from the earth , from where fire , too , breaks out ; metals are extracted from its mines , and water flows from its wells . Mankind as the yellow race , the inhabitants of this world , stems from this equivalent . Two options for interpreting the large illustration are shown in the smaller drawing . One is concerned with the Principle of Generation , and the other with the Principle of Dominance . In Chinese tradition , servants are assigned an important function , since they combine and therefore influence the elements . The servant of the generation principle is Cheng , and the servant of the dominance principle is K'ev . The System of Generation is explained in the lower illustration . With this servant as an aid , each element becomes the procreator of its follower and the offspring of its predecessor -LRB- and is thus mother or father , and son or daughter -RRB- . In the system of equivalents , each colour , each animal or each season creates the next , while sustaining the essence of its predecessor . The armoured animals like the tortoise , which correspond to the north , water and the colour black , procreate the scaled animals like the dragon , which are always green , since these belong to wood and are located in the east . The scaled animals in turn create the fowls and poultry , to which the south and the colour red are ascribed . The feathered birds in turn create the fur-covered animals , such as the tiger or the horse , which are associated with the west , the metals and the colour white . Water brings forth wood , and wood nourishes the fire . Fire -LRB- ash -RRB- fertilises the earth , and the earth brings forth metals . Metal creates water . The Principle of Dominance is shown in the upper illustration . According to this principle , each element dominates another : the earth sucks up the water ; water extinguishes fire ; fire melts metal , and metal splits wood . The sequence can no longer be continuous , as is the case with the principle of generation , but merely alternating . For a more complete understanding of the traditional Chinese system of colours , one principle element is still missing , and this is the Chinese term Ts ` ing . Ts ` ing describes a particular condition of colour , more specifically of two colours : green and blue . In Chinese , the single term Ts ` ing refers to both blue and green . Parallel to this term are two further ones : Lu for green and Lan for blue . Naturally , the Chinese have no difficulty in distinguishing between green and blue , although the term Ts ` ing could indeed be misconstrued in this respect . Ts ` ing means something more sophisticated , namely a specific blue and a specific green , in a specific season under a specific sky . Ts ` ing is the green and the blue found in sprouting nature ; it is a green-blue that relates to wood and therefore , simultaneously , to the east and to springtime . The quality of Ts ` ing relates to that part of the system which connects the elements , the cardinal points , the animals , the parts of the human body and so forth . Ts ` ing provides the idea of purity and lightness , and signifies everything that is tender , bright , clear and fine . When related to colours , the quality of Ts ` ing signifies their dynamic element , while Lu and Lan represent the static aspect of green and blue . Ts ` ing is motion , while Lu and Lan describe a purely geometrical arrangement of colours . The five colours also contribute to the organisation of the world and its place within the harmony of the cosmos . In line with their chosen sequence , the relationships between the five colours can be portrayed in varying ways , and the resultant figure will either be a convex or a star-shaped pentagon . Here , the question will also arise as to whether the terms for intermediate chromatic hues are known to the Chinese language . Those that do exist are evidence of an historical deterioration in the perception of the material world in favour of a concentration around the five basic colours . In addition to green , yellow also corresponds to the Ts ` ing . The placing of Ts ` ing -LRB- green-blue -RRB- on an equal footing with sodium -LRB- yellow -RRB- marks the place , as an intermediate point , where the exchange is completed . The double line of sodium and the dual value of Ts ` ing unite and separate at the same time , and thus become driving forces . The four elements fire , air , water and wood both form and characterise each season . A specific element is strong during its season , growing weaker in both the adjacent seasons to become minimal during the opposite season . During the seasonal cycle , however , the earth remains constant . Its purpose is to overcome the inertia of each of the separate elements when they are at their minimum . When wood , for example , is very weak in autumn , and must strengthen in order to reach its maximum in the coming spring , and when its procreator , namely water , can not help , because water is likewise in the phase leading up to its maximum , the earth will intervene to stimulate wood until the winter solstice arrives . This is why yellow can also be seen as the median colour in the symbolism of China .
