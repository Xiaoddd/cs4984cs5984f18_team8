Sen. John Hoeven is an odd choice for a job dedicated to helping Native American communities . Has oil ties with investments in 68 oil fields . This is a joke . Udall , a democratic senator from New Mexico , went on to say that he and Native American people from his state understood the importance of the protests . That is one reason many New Mexicans are among the protesters at Standing Rock . This includes land management and economic development , in addition to other issues .
