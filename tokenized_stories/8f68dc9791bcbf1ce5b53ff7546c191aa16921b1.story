Nation Feb 15 , 2017 11:46 AM EDT On Feb. 8 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reversed course and issued an easement allowing the installation of the Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe in North Dakota . That means , unlike the voices of thousands who joined the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in protest against the pipeline , the next chapter of this fight will be argued by a few lawyers in the pin drop silence of a federal courtroom . Then in 1993 , Congress enacted the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act -LRB- RFRA -RRB- , which requires that the government demonstrate a compelling interest and use the least restrictive means to achieve that interest if its actions will substantially burden religious practice . In other words , even if approving the Dakota Access Pipeline served a compelling governmental interest , RFRA may require the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to show that the pipeline easement under Lake Oahe would have the least impact on tribal religion . Both the Corps and company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline argue that the risk of spill from the pipeline is minimal and that the tribes failed to raise these religious concerns in a timely manner . In addition , the Corps contends that , consistent with the Lyng case , governmental action on federal land should not be restricted because of religious concerns raised by local tribes . Thus , resolution of the case will turn upon whether the court recognizes the legitimacy of the tribal religious concerns and broadly applies RFRA or , instead , chooses to prioritize federal authority over federal land to the detriment of those concerns . The parties will argue whether the religious freedom issues support an injunction on February 27 . Before reversing course in February , the Corps refused to issue the easement last year in order to further understand and analyze those treaty rights . Importantly , federal law generally allows courts to set aside arbitrary or capricious agency decisions .
