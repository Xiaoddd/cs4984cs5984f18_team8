16 , 2017 , photo , debris is piled on the ground awaiting pickup by cleanup crews at the Dakota Access oil pipeline protest camp . They are n't deterred by the threat of flooding , nor by declarations from state and federal authorities that they must leave by Wednesday or face possible arrest . They 're determined to remain and fight a pipeline they maintain threatens the very sanctity of the land . Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners began work on the last big section of the pipeline this month after the Army gave it permission to lay pipe under a reservoir on the Missouri River . The protest camp is on Army Corps of Engineers land nearby . The protests have been led by Native American tribes , particularly the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux , whose reservation is downstream . They say the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites . ETP disputes that . Faced with the prospect of spring flooding , some protesters are considering moving to higher ground , though not necessarily off the federal land . Some may move to the Standing Rock Reservation , where the Cheyenne River Sioux is leasing land to provide camping space even though Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault has urged protesters to leave . On Monday , North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum talked with Archambault on the telephone about efforts to clean up and vacate the protest camp , Burgum 's office said . Burgum and Archambault both stressed the importance of keeping lines of communication open , including a one-page flyer that the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs will distribute in the camp , reminding protesters that the main camp will be evacuated at 2 p.m. Wednesday and re-entry will not be allowed , Burgum 's office said . Archambault said Monday he continues to ask that there be no forced removal of remaining campers .

Ryan Hignight . One concern is that floodwaters could wash tons of trash and debris at the encampment into the nearby rivers . Many in camp think authorities are exaggerating the flood threat and trying to turn public sentiment against them .

The Corps and the governor say they would rather there were no arrests . This is a space where subscribers can engage with each other and Globe staff .
