The French politician who inspired the European left with his radical campaign for the presidency in 2017 won more than seven million votes . Both are , of course , older white men leading a resurgent left in their respective countries . This was encapsulated by their 2017 manifestos . Likewise , Corbyn promised a constitutional convention as part of his quiet political revolution . Both seek to distribute power to the people . Shifts in political power will , however , achieve little without an attendant transfer in economic power . The resurgent left is based above all on one thing : the return of class to politics . As Corbyn put it in a speech last month , Labour is back as the party of the working class . Both would repeal restrictive trade union laws , move to protect people from precarity and rebuild national industry following the ravages of neoliberalism . Socialist projects in the UK and in France aim to reverse the waves of privatisation pursued by right and left parties since the 1980s . Water , rail and energy are slated for nationalisation . In offering regional public water companies and community-run energy systems , Labour is recognising that the historical conditions for statist social democracy no longer exist . This is the political space TWT occupies , building power on the ground while transforming Labour . As parties across Europe , including the PS , suffer from Pasokification , a resurgent Labour demonstrates the need for a strong , socialist alternative to a decaying neoliberalism . It is a sign of a rising internationalist left building socialism from the grassroots . In learning from and debating with one another , as TWT allows us to do , we can help build a world for the many , not the few . Angus Satow is an organiser for The World Transformed .
