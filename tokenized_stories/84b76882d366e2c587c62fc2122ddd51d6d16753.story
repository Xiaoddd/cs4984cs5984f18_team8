Two girls recorded the encounter on their phones as a crowd looked on . Among them were indigenous , Appalachian , and immigrant activists , each performing the attacks and defense of their communities and environment . Their scene represented the most potent symbol of contemporary American racism : a young black man being brutalized by a cop . Peoples Climate March demonstrators march down Pennsylvania Avenue , April 29 , 2017 . The only major coal plant currently being constructed in the country today , it would be the first large-scale plant to use the energy-intensive Carbon Capture and Storage technology -LRB- which gasifies the coal , captures the carbon emissions , and stores them in the ground -RRB- . This kind of data has largely been eclipsed by the numbers trumpeted by the climate movement : limiting atmospheric carbon emissions to 350 parts per million , and capping global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius . As extreme weather grows more frequent , vulnerable communities will become yet more vulnerable . The Carver Terrace hosing project sits next to an oil refinery in west Port Arthur , Texas . Yet , for Katherine Egland , climate change and environmental pollution are civil-rights issues , just like criminal justice or education . Yet race has remained a consistent blind spot in the environmental movement . This has begun to change as public attention alights on Native communities along the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines . But without directly addressing how environmental injustice impacts poor communities of color disproportionately , racial and economic inequality is likely to deepen as climate change grows more disruptive . At least 68 percent of African Americans live within 30 miles of a coal-fired plant , compared with only 56 percent of the white population . But subtler environmental changes are also wreaking havoc around the country . Elsewhere in the United States , coastal retreat poses an existential threat to communities with identities connected to the land . Already , a matrix of pipelines and canals carved into the wetlands by the oil industry are exacerbating erosion , but Energy Transfer Partners is still planning to build the final leg of its Dakota Access pipeline , the Bayou Bridge , across 11 parishes , including the freed-slave community of St. James . Still , their culture is under threat even if they remain : Some claim that the oil canals are cutting off oxygen to the crawfish in the Atchafalaya Basin . asked Foytlin . The basin is the only place in the state where crawfish are still caught in the wild . Edgar Franks , an organizer with Community to Community , a Bellingham grassroots organization for food sovereignty and immigrant rights , recalls them talking about getting nosebleeds and passing out from the 115 degree heat . Cooler climates awaited them in Washington , but the large industrial farms remain , as do the threats of ICE raids on the workers keeping the agricultural industry afloat . These corporate factory farms are big contributors to climate change , from the petroleum-based chemical fertilizers to the fuel and refrigeration required to transport the produce across long distances . Tribes are shoring up their sovereignty in similar ways , said Tom Goldtooth , executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network . Reverting to traditional ways of agriculture might entail a return to seeds that preexisted the arrival of white settlers -LRB- not to mention genetic modification -RRB- . These would have naturally evolved to thrive in local ecosystems , and would lead to greater biodiversity than our current food system allows . The Indian Wars , which accompanied the largest land-grab in US history , were intended to secure farmland and natural resources for white settlers , and were carried out through the mass displacement , genocide , and confinement to reservations of Native people . Many at the Standing Rock encampment saw their treatment by Energy Transfer Partners and local police -LRB- who deployed dogs , tanks , flash grenades , and sound cannons against the water protectors -RRB- as just its latest iteration . But this is not the only component of the Sioux resistance against the fossil-fuel government . A row of law-enforcement officers faces Dakota Access pipeline protesters along North Dakota Highway 6 , south of St. Anthony , North Dakota , on October 10 , 2016 . This came about after a series of failed attempts by outside developers to harness the muscular prairie winds for a share of the profits . The result was the first tribal public power authority in the United States , an independent , nonprofit entity to construct and operate renewable energy resources at a local scale , and for the benefit of the community . Owned and controlled by the tribes -LRB- Spotted Eagle is on the advisory council of elders -RRB- , the agency is designed to distribute surplus revenues back to the tribes for use in local development . And it also provides affordable clean energy to tribal ratepayers , helping to weaken the stranglehold of the fossil-fuel industry , and shoring up their self-reliance and sovereignty . Community-owned renewables are not only a rural or tribal phenomenon . They exist in cities throughout the United States -LRB- including Los Angeles ; Seattle ; and Chattanooga , Tennessee -RRB- , with residential customers of public power utilities paying average electricity rates that are 14 percent lower than for investor-owned utilities . In the Brooklyn neighborhood of Sunset Park , home to a sizable Latino and Chinese immigrant population , the community group UPROSE is working on three solar projects that will be community-owned and - governed , and will lower electricity costs for local subscribers -LRB- low-income households will be prioritized -RRB- . But these solar projects are only one part of their larger vision for neighborhood development . As in other gentrifying neighborhoods , skyrocketing housing costs are already pushing many low-income residents out of Sunset Park . But reserving that waterfront space for green manufacturers -LRB- and possibly offshore wind turbines -RRB- would not only slow this process but also provide local green jobs . There was also groundwater contamination , an abundance of freeways bordering the Murder Dubs , and a lack of fresh food . Once the funds began rolling in , the communities chose how their allotments would be spent : trees to break up the concrete jungle , affordable housing to combat gentrification , bus passes for seniors , and free solar panels . This in turn created local jobs in solar installation , energy efficiency , and public transportation . Critics argue that cap-and-trade , like fining small-scale drug dealers to curb organized crime , fails to address the root of the climate crisis : the limitless economic growth and endless consumption that lie at the heart of capitalism . -LRB- These critics include Pope Francis -RRB- . Others believe that , short of ending capitalism tomorrow , a just transition to renewables will require redistributing wealth from polluters to the most polluted communities -LRB- through policies like SB 535 and New York Renews -RRB- . Either way , the grassroots campaigns agree that the fossil-fuel era must end . The day was balmy , and her Black Lives Matter contingent seemed to be hosting an impromptu party near the head of the march . Audrea LimAudrea Lim is a journalist in New York City .
