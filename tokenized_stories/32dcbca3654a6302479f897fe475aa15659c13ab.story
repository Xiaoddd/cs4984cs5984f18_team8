If completed , the 1,886 km Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- would transport a half million barrels of fracked crude oil from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to Illinois , crossing multiple waterways including the Missouri River , that serves as the drinking water source for millions of people . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe 's organised resistance to the pipeline , which began in April as a small prayer camp , has swelled to thousands and drawn support from some 300 tribes , representing the largest Native American gathering in a generation . The uprising has been joined by climate and social justice activists . The tribe is determined to peacefully resist the pipeline 's current path , which runs within less than one kilometre of their reservation and , they argue , endangers their sacred cultural sites and water supply . The conflict inflames a long , brutal and disgraceful history of Native American dispossession and the elevation of private and corporate rights over indigenous ones , and overlaps with urgent efforts to curb fossil fuel dependency .
