The state 's Department of Environment and Natural Resources says the April 4 spill was relatively small and was quickly cleaned up , and it did n't threaten any waterways . The agency posted a report in its website 's searchable database , but it did n't take any other steps to announce it to the public , despite an ongoing lawsuit by four Sioux tribes seeking to shut down the pipeline . Brian Walsh , an environmental scientist with the agency , said Wednesday that the state does n't issue news releases on spills unless they threaten the public 's health , a fishery or a drinking water system , and that no such threat existed in this case .
