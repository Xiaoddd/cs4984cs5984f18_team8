Oil producers in Canada and North Dakota are expected to benefit from a quicker route for crude oil to U.S. Gulf Coast refiners . But going ahead with the pipelines would mark a bitter defeat for Native American tribes and climate activists , who successfully blocked the projects earlier and vowed to fight the decisions through legal action . Trump campaigned on promises to increase domestic energy production . Even though Canada is already the biggest source of U.S. crude imports , boosting the flow from a close ally is seen in Washington as a way to improve U.S. energy security . TransCanada Corp said it would resubmit an application for a permit for Keystone XL after Trump signed an order saying the company could re-apply . The application will be reviewed by the U.S. State Department , which has 60 days to reach a decision . The orders look set to undo victories won by protesters in North Dakota against Energy Transfer Partners , which has nearly completed construction of the Dakota line . Despite the advanced phase of the project , the Obama administration in December denied the company a permit to tunnel under the Missouri River . At one point , nearly 10,000 people had flocked to federal land in North Dakota , including 4,000 veterans after protests turned violent at times . The main protest camp has dwindled to several hundred after the Standing Rock tribe asked activists to leave when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied the easement .

About 1 million barrels a day are currently produced in North Dakota . The more than 800,000 bpd Keystone XL pipeline would bring heavy crude from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast . The project was conceived nearly a decade ago , but since then the U.S. shale revolution has redefined oil flows , with domestic refiners finding themselves awash with supply and needing fewer imports . Environmental activists campaigned against the Keystone XL pipeline for more than seven years , eventually winning a victory when Obama rejected the project in 2015 . TransCanada shares closed up 2.7 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange . Trump said on Tuesday in Washington that Keystone XL would create 28,000 jobs , but that figure is at odds with a 2014 U.S. State Department environmental study that said the project would create 3,900 construction jobs and 35 permanent jobs . U.S. President Donald Trump holds up a signed executive order to advance construction of the Keystone XL pipeline at the White House in Washington January 24 , 2017 . The Army Corps earlier this month said it would begin an environmental assessment that could delay the project further . In Cannon Ball , North Dakota , protesters , many of whom have stayed at the camp for months , said they would continue fighting to protect the environment .
