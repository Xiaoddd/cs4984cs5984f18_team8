The Corps cited the oncoming winter and increasingly contentious clashes between protesters , who believe the pipeline could harm drinking water and Native American cultural sites , and police . VETERANS TO STAND WITH STANDING ROCK PROTESTERS Standing Rock tribal members believe the land in which the encampment is on is owned by the Sioux through a more than century-old treaty with the U.S. government . On the unseasonably warm Saturday , people were chopping wood and setting up tents at the encampment , which is more than a mile from a Missouri River reservoir where the final large segment of the pipeline is yet to be completed due to the Corps consulting with the tribe . Authorities had set up a staging area about a mile away on a hill overlooking the site . Representatives from the Army Corps of Engineers did n't immediately return multiple messages Friday or Saturday seeking comment and verification of the letter . Last month , the Corps said it would not evict the encampment , which started as overflow from smaller private and permitted protest sites nearby and began growing in August . President Barack Obama raised the possibility of rerouting the pipeline in that area earlier this month , something Kelcy Warren , CEO of Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners , told The Associated Press is not an option from the company 's standpoint . The Corps ' letter , according to Archambault , said that those who stay on the land after Dec. 5 may be prosecuted , and that there 'll be a free speech zone south of the river . Archambault said Saturday that he does n't believe the Corps will forcibly evict people from the camp , adding that the tribe is working to provide protesters protection from the elements on its reservation , which is south of the Cannonball River , but offered few details . It 's the federal government 's job to peacefully close the camp because it allowed people to stay there in the first place , Gov. Jack Dalrymple said in a statement Saturday . That sentiment was echoed by Morton County Commission chairman Cody Schulz , who said county and state leaders have been seeking federal law enforcement help for months . Republican U.S. Sen. John Hoeven and Democratic U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp said the protesters need to move for public safety . All rights reserved . All market data delayed 20 minutes .
