Previously , he served as editor of the Native News Network . He is a resident of Grand Rapids , Michigan . These two senators which are ranking members of the Senate committees on the Environmental & Public Works and Energy & Natural Resources get some answers as this is now a very hard up hill battle against the DAPL and the Trump administration with their oil cronies . I applaud MR. Levi Rickert , the publisher and editor of Native News Online , for this article and previously other writings about the DAPL and keeping the message alive in the press . Bill Smith 1 year ago John Marchese , you need only look at the USACE environmental assessment -LRB- download from Omaha USACE website -RRB- . President Obama , simply because he could , enter the DAPL arena in a pure political nature . There was absolutely no reason to block or stop the DAPL . The Standing Rock Tribe has known of this new water intake for at least three years . Lionel Boyer 1 year ago I find it ironic that the president trump made the decision to react to the chemical bombing in syria when he made a similar decision to allow the DAPL to continue . The concern of the Standing Rock Sioux Nation is for the future of the Tribal members as well as the total communities that the Country will be affected similar to the chemical bombing should a spill occur . That will poison the aquifers and the existing water flows surrounding the pipeline . Families , their children , communities , the environment will be totally affected and possibly destroyed as the chemical bombing . Download and read the USACE Environmental Assessment . The senators wrote to MR. Semonite , who is the chief of engineers at the Corps , that the permitting process of the Lake Oahe portion of the pipeline appears suspect . The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the Yankton Sioux Tribe all continue to battle Energy Transfer Partners and the U.S. government in vfederal court on multiple legal fronts . Also that federal records indicate that the company , a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners , has had more hazardous material leaks than any other company . Here is a vital part as a MR. . . The senators further asked the Corps to clarify its well-reported lack of tribal consultation on this matter . The DAPL is not being rammed thru any modern day tribal lands . The information I have presented is publicly available . All you have to do is read it . Help support Native News Online by clicking on our sponsors ' advertisements .
