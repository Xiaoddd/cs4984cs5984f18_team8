The reported use of water cannons for crowd control in sub-freezing temperatures is excessive and unnecessary , and I urge you to take action to protect the First Amendment rights ofprotestors , and the physical safety of all involved parties . Video of the incident appears to show that the water cannons were not simply being used for fire control , or even crowd control , but were often directed at small crowds or even individual protesters .
