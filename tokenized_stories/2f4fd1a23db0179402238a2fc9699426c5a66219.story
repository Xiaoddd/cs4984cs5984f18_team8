While pipelines are generally regarded as safe , critics blame insufficient oversight and old pipes for the hundreds of accidents that occur every year . We explain how pipelines fail . 911 received an urgent call . A gas station had just exploded and a fire with flames reaching 300 feet was raging through the neighborhood . The explosion was so large that residents suspected an airplane crash . But the real culprit was found underground : a ruptured pipeline spewing natural gas caused a blast that left behind a 72 foot long crater , killed eight people , and injured more than fifty . Over 2,000 miles away in Michigan , workers were still cleaning up another pipeline accident , which spilled 840,000 gallons of crude oil into the Kalamazoo River in 2010 . As Obama begins his second term he will likely make a key decision on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline , a proposed pipeline extension to transport crude from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico . Construction on the southern route is already underway , sparking fierce opposition from some landowners and environmentalists . The problem , protesters say , is that any route will pose hazards to the public . While pipeline operator TransCanada has declared that Keystone will be the safest pipeline ever built in North America , critics are skeptical . Critics of the Keystone proposal point to the hundreds of pipeline accidents that occur every year . They charge that system wide , antiquated pipes , minimal oversight and inadequate precautions put the public and the environment at increasing risk . Pipeline operators point to billions of dollars spent on new technologies and a gradual improvement over the last two decades as proof of their commitment to safety . Pipelines are generally regarded as a safe way to transport fuel , a far better alternative to tanker trucks or freight trains . The risks inherent in transporting fuel through pipelines are analogous to the risks inherent in traveling by airplane . Airplanes are safer than cars , which kill about 70 times as many people a year -LRB- highway accidents killed about 33,000 people in 2010 , while aviation accidents killed 472 -RRB- . But when an airplane crashes , it is much more deadly than any single car accident , demands much more attention , and initiates large investigations to determine precisely what went wrong . The same holds true for pipelines . Based on fatality statistics from 2005 through 2009 , oil pipelines are roughly 70 times as safe as trucks , which killed four times as many people during those years , despite transporting only a tiny fraction of fuel shipments . But when a pipeline does fail , the consequences can be catastrophic -LRB- though typically less so than airplane accidents -RRB- , with the very deadliest accidents garnering media attention and sometimes leading to a federal investigation . While both air travel and pipelines are safer than their road alternatives , the analogy only extends so far . Airplanes are replaced routinely and older equipment is monitored regularly for airworthiness and replaced when it reaches its safety limits . And while airplanes have strict and uniform regulations and safety protocols put forth by the Federal Aviation Administration , such a uniform set of standards does not exist for pipelines . In many cases , critics argue , pipeline accidents could have been prevented with proper regulation from the government and increased safety measures by the industry . As existing lines grow older , critics warn that the risk of accidents on those lines will only increase . Winding under city streets and countryside , these lines stay invisible most of the time . Until they fail . Since 1986 , pipeline accidents have killed more than 500 people , injured over 4,000 , and cost nearly seven billion dollars in property damages . Using government data , ProPublica has mapped thousands of these incidents in a new interactive news application , which provides detailed information about the cause and costs of reported incidents going back nearly three decades . Unforeseen natural disasters also lead to dozens of incidents a year . From Bay Head to Long Beach Island , falling trees , dislodged homes and flooding caused more than 1,600 pipeline leaks . All leaks have been brought under control and no one was harmed , according to a New Jersey Natural Gas spokeswoman . But the company was forced to shut down service to the region , leaving 28,000 people without gas , and it may be months before they get it back . One of the biggest problems contributing to leaks and ruptures is pretty simple : pipelines are getting older . More than half of the nation 's pipelines are at least 50 years old . Last year in Allentown Pa. , a natural gas pipeline exploded underneath a city street , killing five people who lived in the houses above and igniting a fire that damaged 50 buildings . A fire rages through Allentown , PA , after a gas line explosion in Feb. 2011 Not all old pipelines are doomed to fail , but time is a big contributor to corrosion , a leading cause of pipeline failure . Corrosion is also cited as a chief concern of opponents of the Keystone XL extension . And in fact , none of the 14 spills that happened in the existing Keystone pipeline since 2010 were caused by corrosion , according to an investigation by the U.S. Department of State . The National Academies of Science is currently in the middle of study on dilbit and pipeline corrosion , due out by next year . In the meantime , TransCanada has already begun construction of the southern portion of the line , but has no assurance it will get a permit from the Obama administration to build the northern section . The agency only requires that seven percent of natural gas lines and 44 percent of all hazardous liquid lines be subject to their rigorous inspection criteria and inspected regularly . The rest of the regulated pipelines are still inspected , according to a PHMSA official , but less often . The inconsistent rules and inspection regime come in part from a historical accident . In the 60 's and 70 's , two laws established a federal role in pipeline safety and set national rules for new pipelines . For example , operators were required to conduct more stringent testing to see whether pipes could withstand high pressures , and had to meet new specifications for how deep underground pipelines must be installed . That pipeline , which burst open along a defective seam weld , would never have passed modern high-pressure requirements according to a federal investigation . But because it was installed in 1956 , it was never required to . So older pipes were essentially grandfathered into less testing , he said . A GAO report estimates that of the roughly 230,000 miles of gathering lines , only 24,000 are federally regulated . Because many of these lines operate at lower pressures and generally go through remote areas , says the GAO , the government collects no data on ruptures or spills , and has no enforced standards for pipeline strength , welds , or underground depth on the vast majority of these pipes . Driven in part by the rising demands of hydraulic fracturing , operators have built thousands of miles of new lines to transport gas from fracked wells . Despite the fact that these lines are often just as wide as transmission lines -LRB- some up to 2 feet in diameter -RRB- and can operate under the same high pressures , they receive little oversight . However , Andrew Black , the president of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines , a trade group whose members include pipeline operators , said that a one-size-fits-all approach would actually make pipelines less safe , because operators -LRB- not to mention pipelines -RRB- differ so widely . Allowing operators to develop their own strategies for each pipeline is critical to properly maintaining its safety , he contended . The agency has funding for only 137 inspectors , and often employs even less than that -LRB- in 2010 the agency had 110 inspectors on staff -RRB- . According to the report , between 2001 and 2009 the agency reported a staffing shortfall of an average of 24 employees a year . Given the limitations of government money and personnel , it is often the industry that inspects its own pipelines . The agency has adopted , at least in part , dozens of safety standards written by the oil and natural gas industry . Operators point out that defining their own standards allows the inspection system to tap into real-world expertise . Adopted standards go through a rulemaking process that gives stakeholders and the public a chance to comment and suggest changes , according to the agency . Questions have also been raised about the ties between agency officials and the companies they regulate . Before joining the agency in 2009 , PHMSA administrator Cynthia Quarterman worked as a legal counsel for Enbridge Energy , the operator involved in the Kalamazoo River accident . One such measure is the widespread installation of automatic or remote-controlled shutoff valves , which can quickly stop the flow of gas or oil in an emergency . These valves could help avoid a situation like that after the Kalamazoo River spill , which took operators 17 hours from the initial rupture to find and manually shut off . Operators use these valves already on most new pipelines , but argue that replacing all valves would not be cost-effective and false alarms would unnecessarily shut down fuel supplies . The CRS estimates that even if automatic valves were only required on pipelines in highly populated areas , replacing manual valves with automatic ones could cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars . A worker on the Kalamazoo river , helping to clean up an oil spill of almost a million gallons from a ruptured pipeline in July 2010 Other measures focus on preventing leaks and ruptures in the first place . Last January , Obama signed a bill that commissioned several new studies to evaluate some of these proposed safety measures , although his decision on extending the Keystone pipeline may come long before those studies are completed .
