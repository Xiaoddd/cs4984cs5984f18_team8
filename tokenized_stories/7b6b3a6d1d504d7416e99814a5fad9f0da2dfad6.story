The camp stands directly in the path of the Dakota Access pipeline . Tipis and sweat lodges were destroyed . Vehicles were set ablaze . More than 140 protesters were arrested . More than 140 protesters were arrested . The county sheriff is claiming the water protectors were violent and that police were stopping a riot . But hours of live video feed from people caught in the confrontation showed instead a military-style assault on unarmed people : police beating people with batons , police with assault rifles , chemical mace , guns firing rubber bullets and beanbag rounds , tasers . Dave Archambault II , chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe , has maintained that its citizens and supporters are engaging in peaceful , nonviolent expressions of their opposition to the pipeline . Tara Houska , national campaigns director for the Native environmental group Honor the Earth , and Thane Maxwell , an organizer with Honor the Earth , have been at the camp for months . They describe what is happening : Law enforcement from at least six other states have been involved in the assaults in North Dakota . Tell me about the law that allows this . The troops from other states -LRB- Wisconsin , Indiana , South Dakota , Minnesota , Wyoming , and Nebraska -RRB- are sent here through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact , which was designed for natural disaster situations . DeSmogBlog did an excellent , in-depth piece on this . I -LRB- Thane -RRB- am from Minneapolis , where Hennepin County Sheriff Richard Stanek has sent 30 Special Operations forces to Standing Rock . We encountered them here on the front lines on Thursday and documented their brutality against us . Tara shot footage of Hennepin County officers violently beating a man with batons that they had pulled out of the crowd . Honor the Earth has a substantial constituent base in Hennepin County , so we and our allies have pushed hard to demand the sheriff withdraw the troops . Thousands have signed petitions and attended rallies at government offices this week , and many elected officials , nonprofit leaders , and faith leaders have issued public statements calling for immediate withdrawal . But so far , we have not won . We encourage people in other jurisdictions sending troops to demand their elected officials put an end to this violence . Over 400 people have been arrested . Some are still in jail from the mass arrests on Thursday , as law enforcement makes it extremely difficult to track people , so an exact count is unknown . Yes . Elders and children have been bitten by DAPL private security attack dogs , pepper-sprayed , shot with rubber bullets , and beaten by police . One member of the International Indigenous Youth Council suffered a broken wrist from a strike with a police baton , and just a few days later an officer saw the cast and intentionally twisted her wrist to reinjure her . Arrestees have reported numerous experiences of abuse and torture while in police custody . Folks have been strip-searched for misdemeanor charges , and there are reports that women have been left naked in their cells and harassed by male guards . Others have had hoods placed over their heads , been incarcerated in dog kennels due to lack of cell space , or marked with numbers on their skin . Water protectors who locked themselves to construction equipment have also reported the use of waterboarding and pain compliance techniques such as zip-tying people in contorted positions for hours at a time . These are internationally recognized as methods of torture . I heard police are targeting medics and journalists . Yes . Journalists are often targeted during confrontations because they possess and disseminate evidence of police brutality and human rights violations . Medics are also targeted because they make it possible for protectors to continue fighting the Dakota Access pipeline on the frontlines . Arrestees have reported numerous experiences of abuse and torture while in police custody . These are recognized combat tactics , and if it were actually a war , clear violations of Geneva Convention humanitarian rules . Clearly identifiable medics have been shot in the back with less-lethal ammunition while attending to patients . On Thursday , several people saw police use batons to hit two medics who were sitting on the back of a vehicle , slowly retreating from the police line . They also pulled the driver out of the car while it was moving , and it continued into the crowd . Luckily , a bystander jumped in the car and stopped it before it hit anyone . Yes . On Thursday , I saw the police shoot many rubber bullets at a horse at point blank range . Police in ATVs also chased horses in full gallop herding buffalo towards the confrontation , and shot them with both rubber bullets and live ammunition . One horse did not survive . Arrestees have had a huge range of experiences , and it keeps getting worse . Some have been bonded out for a reasonable amount of money in just a few hours . Others have stayed in for days and been tortured and abused . Many have faced trumped-up charges and inflated bonds . This is partly an intimidation tactic by Morton County and partly an attempt to seize as many of our financial resources as possible . Almost all of the estimated 142 people arrested on Thursday are facing felony charges . Currently , a team called the Red Owl Legal Collective consults with people while in custody and prioritizes bond for those with medical conditions , immigration issues , proximity to structural violence . They bond people out as quickly as possible , and sometimes represent arrestees at bond hearings where a judge may or may not reduce the inflated bond . Hopefully none of these charges will stick , but it puts an incredible burden on the movement . At that point , a plea is entered and the defendant is expected to return again for either a pre-trial conference or a trial . All of this is of course very taxing for people who live far away and , in many cases , in poverty . We are both members of The Freshet Collective , which raises money and manages the Sacred Stone Legal Defense Fund . We work closely with the legal support team on the ground at the encampment , operating with support from the National Lawyers Guild , and we are currently seeking additional attorneys experienced in this line of work . Many other groups on the ground here support this effort , as expressed in this solidarity statement . Any remaining funds will be used in civil cases against Dakota Access , law enforcement , or other parties responsible for human and civil rights violations . Well , the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 clearly affirmed all of this land as sovereign , unceded territory belonging to the Great Sioux Nation . But according to the current laws of the occupying colonial forces , yes , the treaty camp was on Dakota Access land and the main encampment is on Army Corps land . The Obama administration could intervene any time . So far , they have taken measured steps of delay , such as the suspension and review of Army Corps permits related to this project . But no firm answers have been given and construction of the Dakota Access pipeline has sped up . The Obama administration could intervene any time . The U.S. Army Corps has still not sent the final easement to Congress that is required for DAPL to drill under the Missouri River . We at Honor the Earth recently teamed up with the Sierra Club and the Indigenous Environmental Network to submit a letter to the Army Corps spelling out the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historical Preservation Act in this situation . Since DAPL intentionally destroyed sacred sites to circumvent their protection , the Army Corps can not legally issue any more permits . All we can tell you is that we will be here until the end , and we will do everything in our power to protect this land , this water , and all the beings who depend on it . We can not express to you the courage , dedication , and passion in the hearts of the people . You are seeing the videos and images and hearing the stories , but you really have to be here to feel it . This is a war . People are willing to die for this .
