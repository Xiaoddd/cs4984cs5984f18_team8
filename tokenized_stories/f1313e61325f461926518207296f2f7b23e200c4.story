A federal appeals court , however , has now put a stop to that . First Nations have been protesting the pipeline expansion project , which would triple the amount of tar sands oil flowing from Alberta to British Columbia , for months . Advertisement The Squamish Indian Band , Tsleil-Waututh Nation , Coldwater Indian Band , and Squiala First Nation are among the plaintiffs on the case the three-person court heard . The case is a combination of nearly two dozen cases against the crude oil pipeline , according to the Globe and Mail . Other plaintiffs include the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby . The court ruling requires the board to conduct a completely new review that considers the voices of the indigenous people the pipeline expansion would affect , as well as the how the expected increase in marine tanker traffic would impact the environment and marine mammals . First Nations are already celebrating this victory , which has the potential to kill the project for good . Developer Kinder Morgan already abandoned the project following intense opposition from indigenous communities and climate activists . The federal government intervened in May as a last-ditch effort to revive it . The duty to consult was not adequately discharged . Prime Minister Justin Trudeau likes to talk about indigenous reconciliation , even launching a cabinet dedicated to just that Tuesday , but his actions speak louder than words . So . Much . Oil .
