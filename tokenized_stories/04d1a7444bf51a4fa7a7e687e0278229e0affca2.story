That could now play into lawsuits over global warming . John H. Cushman Jr. ` script ' , ` twitter-wjs ' -RRB- ; Apr 5 , 2018 Scientists working for Shell warned the oil giant decades ago about the climate change risks posed by fossil fuels , new documents show . Subscribe here . Internal company documents uncovered by a Dutch news organization show that the oil giant Shell had a deep understanding , dating at least to the 1980s , of the science and risks of global warming caused by fossil fuel emissions . They show that as the company pondered its responsibility to act , Shell 's scientists urged it to heed the early warnings , even if , as they said , it might take until the 2000s for the mounting evidence to prove greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were causing unnatural climate change .

The documents were unearthed by the journalist Jelmer Mommers of De Correspondent , whose investigative article was published on Thursday in Dutch . Many of the documents , along with explanatory notes , were released on the Climate Files website , where researcher and climate advocate Kert Davies maintains extensive archives . To get their work before a broader audience , they shared embargoed copies of the documents . The accretion of evidence complicates the industry 's position as Big Oil defends itself in a broadening array of climate-related litigation . On Wednesday , Dutch environmentalists said they plan to sue Royal Dutch Shell to force it to cut its oil and gas investments and production . Responding to the litigation , Shell said that it has long embraced climate change science and strongly supports the Paris climate agreement aimed at limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius or less . But it said that meeting that target is a complex social challenge , that energy is important to the global quality of life , and that the issues should not be tackled in court . Rather , it called for sound government policy and a cultural shift toward green energy . Shell is already a defendant in other court cases . The key legal question in much of the litigation is whether the companies understood risks of global warming well enough , and early enough , to be held accountable for damages that are already occurring and are likely to grow . ` Major Social , Economic , Political Consequences ' The Shell documents released so far do n't address in significant detail questions of liability or whether Shell was properly disclosing risks to shareholders . Two tables broke the data down . By then , Shell had to be acutely aware of the growing political repercussions of its contribution to the climate problem . After all , the 1988 document was circulated just as NASA scientist James Hansen testified in Congress that global warming had already arrived and had to be dealt with urgently . Shell 's What-If Scenario : East Coast Hurricanes Over the decades , Shell spent considerable effort generating what-if scenarios to help it grope its way forward . How Shell 's Thinking on Climate Changed Shell 's documents of the era , like papers from Exxon at the time that were published in 2015 by InsideClimate News , are full of passages about the uncertainties that surrounded the emerging science . A nuanced reading suggests that Shell , then as now , gave more attention to the need for global action on climate , and did so earlier , than Exxon . To this day , the company opens the door a bit wider to a more responsive approach to the climate crisis . But its current thinking continues to generate debate over whether its vision is ambitious enough . The Dutch archives trace the evolution of the company 's thinking over years of considerable climate policy turmoil . For example , Shell participated in the work of the Global Climate Coalition , founded in 1989 to fight the Kyoto Protocol , only to leave it 10 years later over irreconcilable differences over the protocol 's emissions targets , which Shell embraced . All the while , concentrations of carbon dioxide moved inexorably upward . Children born since that time have never lived through a year in which the world 's climate was cooler than the previous average . One passage from 1988 , even though written in a dry corporate style , reads now like an evocation of this perspective across the generations . In other words , it said you might not see the results of your decisions , but your children and grandchildren might . -LRB- The figure Shell predicted for the eventual emissions peak is equivalent to 36.4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent -LRB- GtCO2e -RRB- . The next year , as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was publishing its second major assessment of climate science , Shell found itself in a delicate balancing act between accepting the scientific consensus and arguing that there was still too much uncertainty to dictate aggressive action . ` An Evolutionary , Not a Revolutionary Process ' In hindsight , it 's possible to say that this ambivalence would prove costly . It 's not so much that any one document contains a smoking gun . It 's rather that the steady accumulation of documents , which is bound to continue , will build up the weight of the evidence . Editor 's note : This story has been changed to convert Shell 's 1995 forecast of eventual peak greenhouse gas emissions from gigatonnes of carbon -LRB- GtC -RRB- to gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent -LRB- GtCO2e -RRB- , a standard conversion , for purposes of comparison to the International Energy Agency 's current data .
