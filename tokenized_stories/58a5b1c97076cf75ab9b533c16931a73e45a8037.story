It would be very wrong for the tribes and Water Protectors and their allies to abide by this eviction as it sets a dangerous precedent for controlling and nullifying protests . Prayer is very important but it is not enough in this case . There needs to be a large non-violent show of support against the oppression . Between December 4-7 , nearly 2000 US Veterans , in a specially assembled military unit will arrive at Standing Rock to protect the Native Americans from the rogue militarized police force which have been used against the peaceful Water Protectors . Stand along side them , in peace . This is a test case . If the government and corporate interests succeed , our country will change forever . Our ability to protest any injustice will be curtailed by militarized law enforcement and free speech zones . The Standing Rock tribe being forced to accept an unneeded pipeline that could destroy the future of their clean water will be a standard which will be used to determine the outcome of other forced injustices and environmental issues . It is honorable and admirable that the tribal leadership are taking a position to stand against such unethical threats and actions through a non-violent stance . Especially when treaties and promises have been broken for hundreds of years . And it is because of this they have garnered international support , despite the relative blackout of their plight on mainstream media . If it can , it will be a victory for everyone in the United States against a corrupt leadership . Notify me of new posts by email .
