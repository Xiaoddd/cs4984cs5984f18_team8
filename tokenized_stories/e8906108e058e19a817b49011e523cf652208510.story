Fonda will serve dinner and contribute five butchered Bison and four Mongolian yurts to the Oceti Sakowin camp near Cannon Ball , North Dakota , the Dakota Dispatch reported . She 'll be part of a delegation of roughly 50 people from around the country who are traveling to Standing Rock to serve a hot meal to roughly 500 activists , indigenous people and their allies who are protesting the pipeline that will disrupt sacred lands and threaten the Sioux water supply . A two-time Academy Award-winning actor Fonda has been an activist for many decades . She supported the Civil Rights Movement and opposed the Vietnam War in the 1960s . Judy Wicks , a local food advocate and former owner of White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia , explained she decided to organize a Thanksgiving meal with a 50-person delegation that includes Fonda . However , Wicks decided to bring a Thanksgiving meal to Standing Rock after Tom Goldtooth , the Director of the Indigenous Environmental Network , told her that his friends at Standing Rock celebrate the American holiday , Civil Eats reported . This year , the meal will include pasture-raised turkeys which will be spit-roasted , and dishes made from native ingredients including squash , sweet potatoes , wild rice , corn and cranberries , Civil Eats reported . Here 's a photo of Stanton with beef , not turkey , which will be spit-roasted and served on Thursday . But the idea of an idyllic meal is false to begin with . He said in grade school , he was only taught about the generosity of the Native Americans and the misfortune of the Pilgrims . Jimerson grew up on the Seneca territories of Allegany and Cattaraugus in Western New York and attended public school . Though Jimerson opposes romanticized views of Thanksgiving , the holiday is n't completely worthless in his eyes . He said he 'll be surrounded by loved ones , learning how to make coveted family dishes and cherishing his day off from graduate school . He enjoys making candied yams , a dish his grandmother taught him to prepare . Sort of . Jimerson explained acknowledging that native people have a rich history of plant breeding is one way to honor their food culture . But honoring America 's relationship with indigenous people should n't be limited to one day a year , and neither should the Thanksgiving ritual of showing gratitude , he noted . All rights reserved .
