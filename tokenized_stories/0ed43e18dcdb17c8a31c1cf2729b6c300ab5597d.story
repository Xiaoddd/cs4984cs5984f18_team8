Credit : Reuters Michael Wood Jr. , a Marine Corps veteran and former Baltimore police officer , is leading a group of 2,000 veterans to North Dakota this weekend to join ongoing protests against the Dakota Access pipeline . Wood , 37 , made headlines last year for speaking out in a series of tweets against what he viewed as wrongdoing within his police department . He spoke out after Freddie Gray died from a spinal cord injury after being taken into custody by Baltimore police and is a prominent supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement . The group , Veterans Stand for Standing Rock , had to end the sign-ups after 2,000 veterans signed on . Thousands of protesters , mostly Native Americans , have camped since August just north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation where the largely completed pipeline would cross the Missouri River . The standoff escalated on Nov. 20 when law enforcement used fire hoses , tear gas and stinger grenades on protesters who were trying to clear a roadblock at the end of bridge on a public highway . Last Friday , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers notified the Standing Rock tribe that the public will no longer be allowed at the campsite , which is on federal land . On Monday , North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple ordered an emergency evacuation of the camp . The Standing Rock tribe said the land is part of their ancestral treaty lands and that they will not leave . Michael Wood Jr. : I think a lot of us are doing this for different reasons . For Wes , he is very focused on ecological protection of the planet . If you are a conservative , you are watching hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on state-sanctioned agents of violence . If you are a libertarian , you care about property rights and freedom . MW : Personally , I want to go across the bridge and take the whole site . But as a whole group , the goal is to bring attention to it , that Native lives need to matter in our systems just like black lives need to matter in our systems . This is that moment in history where there is a change in the tide . MW : If we were to create systems and institutions that protected black lives , then we would n't have systems and institutions that allow the oppression of Native American lives that you are seeing right now and throughout our history . MW : It really got to the point where it was just too much . A lot of credit goes to those protesters who are up there now who have created the attention that opened our eyes to understand that we need to get up there . MW : We 're not going to be there for three days anymore . We 've set up a new roster where we already have 500 people ready to stay there for the next shift . MW : We 're not releasing everything that we 're doing , we do have some support missions , which we think can make a difference on their own . I want to do it with negotiations . I want to talk to everybody there . That is what we need to do to make sure that we protect our planet , stand up for Native American people , protect black lives , protect native lives and protect the Earth . I will go there personally myself . These cops do n't want to do this . If we ca n't break the system , we can break the hearts and minds of those officers so they realize what they are doing . Hopefully with an entire battalion of people from around the nation who are vets and protecting this country , there is no way around it . There is going to be every race , every religion , every nationality , every geographic region of people that have served this county and stood on that wall . If they are willing to come after us , then that 's fine . We 'll take that brunt , but that is how you create 10,000 of us next time . MW : You 're always going to have some naysayers . They think we were going to be scared , because they do n't want to be out there in this cold . We 're prepared for it . They 're not . MW : No way at all . It 's a bluff . I really do n't understand why they think that is going to matter . ICN : A recent video shows law enforcement putting up additional razor wire . MW : That 's fine . I do n't intend to win by force , I intend to win by rational negotiation . MW : We will not use force . They will use force . ICN : You previously said one issue the police are going to face is that your level of planning and coordination is vastly superior to theirs . I do n't mean that as an insult . We are going to stay calm . We are going to be disciplined . We are not going to be the one that is going to break across the line . They will . They have been doing it the whole time . There is no reason to believe anything else will be any different .
