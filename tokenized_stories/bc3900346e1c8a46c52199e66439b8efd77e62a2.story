It has been taking over social media , with protesters taking action against the plan that is disrupting the people and environment of Standing Rock . There have been social media campaigns against the pipeline , as well as peaceful protests that are being held on-site and now a music campaign has come to the fold . Enter Mr. Carmack and Djemba Djemba , who are coming to aid with their charitable Rekindling EP . Some may ask why this is such a debated topic , but the answers are simple . First , the pipeline could potentially spell disaster for the region if something goes awry during , as well as after , the construction process . With thousands of barrels of crude oil set to be transported through this pipeline every day , there are major health and safety concerns for the local communities . Furthermore , the Sioux are stating that they were not properly a part of the pipeline 's approval process . This disregard for the native people 's power and authority over their own land is blatantly disrespectful , and goes against the very fabric of our democracy . Construction of the pipeline goes right through their land , with recent bulldozing already disturbing a sacred burial ground . We are a community of global changemakers committed to making a positive impact in society . Your email has been sent . I love Electric Family and thought you would too .
