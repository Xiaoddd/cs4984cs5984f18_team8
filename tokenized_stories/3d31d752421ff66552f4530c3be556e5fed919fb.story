` Medicaid for more ' could be the reality . Yet all the most-hyped 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are on board with the idea , including the Medicare expansion 's biggest champion , Sen. Bernie Sanders -LRB- I-Vt . -RRB- . The idea in concept is simple : Allow states to open up their Medicaid programs to anyone regardless of income . Those people could buy in to the social safety net and have access to Medicaid 's provider network and benefits . The groundwork for expanding the program for low-income Americans has already been laid to some extent as 34 states have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act . and Kirsten Gillibrand -LRB- N.Y. -RRB- . But the real efforts are happening at the state level where legislatures all over the country are seriously considering the idea . Heather Howard , a lecturer at Princeton University who also helps states with their health-care systems , said many plans are in their infancy , but that 14 states across the country have made moves to , at minimum , weigh the benefits and challenges of shifting Medicaid to a publicly available health insurance option . That 's because Medicare is operated at the federal level so any major changes to it have to be decided in Washington . Medicaid , on the other hand , is run by the states , so they have more discretion over how the program is set up . There are real critiques of Medicaid as it now exists , such as low reimbursement rates for doctors and uniform access to care . To offer it to everyone would require responding to those criticisms as well as new questions such as the cost to states , whether states have to apply for federal waivers to alter the program and whether a public option lives on or off the ACA exchanges . This week stakeholders across New Mexico met with President Obama 's former Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Andy Slavitt to begin some of those conversations . Earlier this year , New Mexico 's state legislature passed a bill to create a committee to study a Medicaid buy-in program . Medicaid is popular there ; one-third of New Mexicans are enrolled . Yet 230,000 people remain uninsured in the state , according to Kaiser Family Foundation data , and proposed premium rates for 2019 for those who do n't qualify for ACA subsidies are increasing anywhere from 9.2 percent to 18.5 percent . Slavitt is the board chair of a new group , United States of Care , which has an impressive roster of bold-faced names leading it from investor Mark Cuban to former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau to former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords -LRB- D-Ariz . -RRB- and her astronaut husband Mark Kelly . In the absence of Washington leadership , the group is working with states on ways to improve health care . But even if Democrats win the House majority and make gains in the Senate , President Trump has said Obamacare is unsustainable and his administration has worked persistently to chip away at it . It 's the type of proposal , he reasons , that could peel off moderate Republicans in a way that a national Medicare program never could . It 's true that Medicaid is a favorite GOP punching bag . The Trump administration is urging states to add work requirements to their programs and the GOP playbook has long included capping how much the federal government pays each state to administer Medicaid . Yet 34 states , including many with Republican governors , expanded the ACA under Medicaid to include more low-income residents , and several more red states are on the precipice of following them . It 's a program that has endured and grown for 53 years . Sparer has written extensively on the topic and told me his support for expanding Medicaid is heavily influenced by the political viability of focusing on the program for low-income Americans versus the one covering seniors -- meaning states do n't have to wait for a new president to do something meaningful .
