Russian ownership of a large portion of a U.S.-based oil company would be unprecedented , according to experts contacted by CBS News . Those experts also emphasize that the White House has the power to block the deal -- either on national security grounds or simply by leaving in place Obama administration sanctions against Russia . In fact , credit rating agency Fitch reported in January that a default at PDVSA is probable . Kumar , whose research focuses on energy finance , said a default would leave the door open for Rosneft to seize the promised stake in Citgo , a company whose U.S. holdings include three refineries and three pipelines . The players involved make the deal particularly newsworthy , said Philip Jordan , an oil , gas and mineral law partner at the Dallas-based firm Gray Reed & McGraw . The Rosneft lien was included as an exhibit in a federal lawsuit for alleged unpaid debts filed by ConocoPhillips , another oil company , against PDVSA . ConocoPhillips added Rosneft to the lawsuit after the Russian oil company and PDVSA agreed to the loan . He and other experts said PDVSA has been siphoning money from its American company to the Venezuelan government , which for more than a decade has used oil profits to subsidize social commitments . Just over 50 percent of Rosneft is owned by Rosneftegaz , a Russian state agency run by Sechin , the Rosneft CEO . A 19.5 percent stake in the company was purchased in December by a consortium of investors that include the Anglo-Swiss commodities producer and trader Glencore , the Qatar Investment Authority and anonymous investors based in the Cayman Islands . View note Representatives of PDVSA , Citgo and Rosneft did not reply to requests for comment on this story . However , as a candidate for president , Donald Trump expressed an openness to relaxing those sanctions , which include a ban on business transactions with dozens of companies and officials , including Rosneft and CEO Sechin . Page and Russian officials have denied the meeting occurred . Mr. Trump said in a January interview with the Times of London that he would consider removing sanctions as part of a nuclear arms reduction deal . It is not clear which sanctions were discussed and Flynn resigned on Feb. 13 , following media reports about the call . The New York Times later reported that in early February two Trump business associates met with a Ukrainian politician about a plan to lift Russian sanctions as part of an effort to solve the violent conflict simmering between Ukraine and Russia . Ponomarev noted that although Venezuela and Russia have long-standing friendly ties , it is unusual that they would agree to a deal involving U.S. assets . When foreign companies make major investments in American properties , each side is expected to voluntarily file a notice with the White House committee known as CFIUS , a collection of nine Presidential Cabinet members who review the national security implications of foreign investments in U.S. companies . Its chair is the U.S. Treasury Secretary . Mikhail Metzel CFIUS has never previously had so many members with ties to the oil industry . Tillerson , the former CEO of ExxonMobil , was closing in on an oil exploration deal with Rosneft reportedly worth in the tens of billions when the Obama administration announced the Crimea sanctions . Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross purchased through his investment firm hundreds of millions of dollars in energy debt in 2016 , according to the Wall Street Journal . Energy Secretary Rick Perry has been on the board of directors of two pipeline companies . All three have left their previous positions and taken steps to divest their business interests in the energy industry . Experts interviewed by CBS News said companies involved in CFIUS reviews are not told if a committee member with potential conflicts has recused himself . In 2014 , the most recent year for which data are available , CFIUS reviewed 147 filings , rejecting one . Another 12 filings were withdrawn during the review process . While rejections are rare , there have been cases in which foreign state-operated companies have withdrawn their bids due to political pressure . Every expert contacted by CBS News predicted the Rosneft transaction would meet similar , if not fiercer opposition . All Rights Reserved . Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes .
