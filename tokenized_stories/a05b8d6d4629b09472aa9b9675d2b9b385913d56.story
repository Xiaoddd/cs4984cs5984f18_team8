All Opinions Are Local A battle is brewing as pipeline companies prepare to break ground in Virginia Signs mark the route of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline in Deerfield , Va. . A smaller project , the Mountain Valley Pipeline , is planned through much of Southwest Virginia . Protesters have been active for about four years . But now the pipeline companies have most of their permits and have begun some limited tree-cutting to clear rights of way . Protesters are adamant about stopping the projects , which they believe are fire and explosion hazards , harm fauna and flora , threaten water and air supplies and ruin visually appealing landscapes . One question is whether protests could become violent , as some have against the Keystone XL pipeline and other projects in the Dakotas , among other areas . Those protests are so strong and vivid that they have attracted international attention . A real possibility is that what has happened on the prairie could be replicated in the Piedmont . A judge ruled against a temporary injunction sought by the pipeline firm to force the squatters from their tree stands near Union , W.Va . In Virginia , protesters complain that private security companies hired by pipeline firms have harassed and intimated them by photographing them and their car license plates when they attend state regulatory hearings concerning pipeline permits . The Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League has sent letters to the governors of Virginia and North Carolina asking them to intervene . She says that the private security people seem to work in concert with the Virginia State Police and security from Dominion Energy , the Richmond-based utility that is the lead firm in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline . In another case , Ponton says her group was protesting peacefully in front of Wintergreen , a popular mountain resort south of Charlottesville . It indeed gets interesting when different law-enforcement agencies are placed on opposite sides of the dispute . I asked Corinne Geller , chief spokesperson for the Virginia State Police , about special training for pipeline security . Training and awareness are good ideas . The event turned into a violent melee that left three dead and dozens injured . Poor law-enforcement planning was help partly to blame , investigations of the situation found . The pipeline conflicts are understandably emotion-packed given that they involve massive and questionable projects that stand to destroy the private property of many . It is wise for police to train for them , as long as it does not impede the right to lawful protest , promote intimidating surveillance and subject protesters to harassment by stamping them as radicals .
