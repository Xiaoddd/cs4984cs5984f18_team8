Since April , the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota has been protesting the completion of an interstate oil pipeline that would go through its reservation , which is sacred land . Protestors are also worried that the pipeline could leak and contaminate the Missouri River , which is the tribe 's main water source . Noah brought up one of the biggest issues with the pipeline : It was originally to go underneath the city of Bismarck , which is predominantly white , but when concerns were raised there about potential leaks , it was rerouted to go beneath the Standing Rock reservation .
