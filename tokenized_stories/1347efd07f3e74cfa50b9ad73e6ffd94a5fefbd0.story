Photo by Trevor Mack An oilpatch lobby group paid Facebook to boost an online poll that skewed the level of support for Kinder Morgan 's Trans Mountain expansion . But the group wo n't say why it did it and Facebook did n't flag the activity as breaking any rules . The Texas giant 's pipeline has sparked a fierce battle between the neighbouring provinces of Alberta and British Columbia , with new threats surfacing from Alberta Premier Rachel Notley to send B.C. 's gas prices soaring . While the post remained on the page , the lobby group appeared to stop paying for the advertising a few hours after National Observer asked what it was doing . CAPP declined to answer that question . Ultimately the poll , run by the Oak Bay News on Vancouver Island , was liked on Facebook thousands of times and by April 18 , 2018 nearly 80 per cent of those who participated voted in support of the pipeline . That kind of support is a departure from scientific polls that show more divided opinions among British Columbians . On Friday , April 6 , 2018 , Canada 's Energy Citizens sponsored a Facebook post urging people to vote in favour of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline expansion . Screenshot image Sponsoring posts on social media is a common and accepted practice to boost the visibility of a message through advertising -LRB- in fact , this publication pays to boost posts on Facebook regularly -RRB- . But this ad is only one example of the style of online warfare that has pitted fossil fuel supporters against clean energy advocates in a battle to win the social media newsfeeds of the nation . Programming automated messaging can promote fake social media profiles to share and repost desired messages , ensuring that people see them while creating a sense that an opinion is popular and held by many people already . But researchers find bot activity on other issues , too . And it can be difficult to narrow down where bots originate , in terms of where the people who put them to work live in the real world . The oilpatch lobby group says it does n't engage in bot activity . It describes the role of Canada 's Energy Citizens as a voice for members of Canada 's oil and gas community . The Facebook page for Canada 's Energy Citizens works like a newsfeed for its followers , now numbering more than 220,000 , increasing online traffic for articles , videos and opinion pieces that promote the oil industry . Each post shared can get dozens , or even hundreds , of shares from this following . Those numbers matter because the more likes and shares a post gets , the more likely it will show up in someone else 's newsfeed . In the end , oilpatch marketing tactics , plus the marketing tactics of environmental detractors , plus the activities of bots add up , drowning out some people 's voices and making it difficult for the average person to evaluate facts . It also is n't always easy to identify bots -LRB- or who is programming them , or why -RRB- , though there are some clues . Researchers are still grappling with what effect automated , bot-like behaviour online can have on how people talk and think about big political problems . Interviewed by National Observer , he asked not to be identified , acknowledging that his tactics were also trying to game the system . Greenpeace communications officer Jesse Firempong , seen here in Vancouver on February 9 , 2018 , said suspicions about the newspaper polls were stirred because of unusual voting patterns . Photo by Mike De Souza Greenpeace flagged the possibility of bots swinging the results when two Vancouver Sun polls asking readers about Kinder Morgan started getting thousands of votes each . The number of participants seemed outsized compared to how many people normally vote in such polls , and pro-pipeline votes dwarfed anti-pipeline votes , contrary to a series of scientific polls that showed people were split on the matter . In the case of the online poll promoted by the oilpatch lobby group , CAPP was directing its fanbase to a Vancouver Island newspaper 's poll on the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline expansion . These activities are just examples of how the online conversation around the troubled oil pipeline is , increasingly , being taken to extremes by actors on both sides of the debate . In these fights , messages can be spread faster and the debate can become more polarized with sponsored ads and automated bots . Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers spokeswoman Chelsie Klassen speaks during a news conference in Ottawa on Feb. 26 , 2018 . In Canada , users can see lists of sponsored posts as part of a Facebook experiment to enhance transparency . She declined to share the cost of urging people to vote in an Oak Bay News poll or explain why the post was sponsored . The ad was posted before noon eastern time on Fri. . April 6 , and was no longer on the citizens ' group 's list of purchased ads at 2:45 p.m. the same day . Only the Oak Bay News link appears to have been sponsored .

On the right , the results of the poll on Mon. . April 9 , 2018 . Whereas the recent online newspaper polls show a great deal of support for the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain expansion , scientific polls indicate a range of more nuanced positions . As examples , one Angus Reid online poll of 2,501 Canadians showed people are mostly split on the pipeline debate , while another , of 2,125 Canadians conducted in mid-April , showed 34 per cent of British Columbians feel environmental risks outweigh economic risks and 35 per cent feel the opposite . Angus Reid pollsters found about 30 per cent said the pipeline 's risks and benefits are about equal . They also found that 54 per cent of British Columbians supported the pipeline expansion now , compared to 48 per cent in February . Meantime a Forum Research telephone survey of 1,061 eligible voters in B.C. showed 43 per cent of respondents believe the pipeline will be good for the economy , and 50 per cent believe it will be bad for the environment . And an online Abacus Data poll of 900 adult British Columbians found a wide expanse of wiggle room between those who absolutely oppose the pipeline -LRB- 22 per cent -RRB- and those who absolutely support it -LRB- 23 per cent -RRB- . These polls do n't just show diverse opinions among British Columbians , they are transparent about how people are surveyed , how a sample of respondents compares to the wider population , and what the likelihood is of findings reflecting the positions of the broader public . Depending on their authors ' intent , a simple bot strategy on Twitter might be to re-post messages of interest , making it look like there are many people who hold the same position , or actively working to bully and drown out contrary voices . Such tactics have been used for multiple political campaigns around the world , including the recent scandals involving tech firms that used personal data to sway voters in the recent U.S. elections as well as the Brexit referendum in Europe . But bots are n't a Twitter-only issue . Gray noted they can also be found at work on Pinterest , Instagram , dating apps and other online platforms . They also are n't inherently bad : a company might build a chat bot into its website for customer service , for example . In that case , when you make a complaint online , a window might open and you 'll be asked a series of standard follow-up questions before you are connected to a real person . The order of questions and pre-set responses are written by a person . If you say you want to cancel an order , the bot can be programmed to ask you why . Depending on what you say , the bot will provide you with additional information , or ask you more questions according to a script . That , he said , puts public opinion at risk of manipulation . In the news In December , someone who specializes in computer security research tried their own bot out on a Vancouver Sun poll and shared their results with Greenpeace . As his automated anti-pipeline votes ticked up , pro-pipeline votes appeared to increase in response . In the end , more than 20,000 people weighed in -LRB- most on the side of the pipeline expansion going through -RRB- . Screen capture of a Vancouver Sun poll on Kinder Morgan , taken on Feb. 22 , 2018 Sun editor-in-chief Harold Munro noted that the company they use for their daily polls , Poll Daddy , tracks users ' IP addresses and cookies to prevent people from voting more than once . Special interest and advocacy groups on both sides of an issue often share a link to a poll with their members and like-minded groups , urging them to vote . The Sun 's daily polls often ask readers to respond to news of the day , and generally seem to net just a few hundred votes . In May of last year , when the Sun asked about a Vancouver Aquarium decision to ban new dolphins , whales and porpoises from captivity , nearly 14,000 votes were cast -LRB- about 46 per cent of respondents in favour of the ban , 54 per cent against -RRB- The outliers that Greenpeace picked up on were published on Dec. 9 , 2017 and Jan. 31 , 2018 . Munro did not respond to follow-up questions about whether his newspaper is worried about or looking into bot interference in its online polls . Canada 's Energy Citizens started to expand rapidly in 2014 , when Canadian pipeline operators such as TransCanada and Enbridge were aggressively trying to promote pipeline projects such as Energy East , Keystone XL , and Northern Gateway . A leaked TransCanada strategy document at that time revealed details of a plan to attack the reputation of critics and build an army of online activists to promote the company 's messaging on Energy East . Following the leak , TransCanada confirmed that it had solicited the strategy but said that it had never fully been deployed . Bot activity new normal , but impacts untested At the University of Ottawa , the Vancouver Sun poll numbers are no surprise for Elizabeth Dubois , an assistant professor in the department of communication . Dubois and Concordia University assistant professor Fenwick McKelvey recently analyzed the effects of Twitter bots in Canada 's 2015 election . So far , they have found people writing scripts that put bots to work amplifying and silencing messages , but how influential this work is remains to be seen . Looking toward the 2019 federal election , Dubois cautioned real people do write the programs that put bots to work . Kennedy Stewart , the NDP MP for the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South and a professor of public policy on leave from Simon Fraser University , easily dismissed the newspaper polls , comparing them to a radio station that asks people if a hockey player should be removed from their team roster . Last month , Stewart and May were both arrested alongside others blockading Kinder Morgan 's pipeline terminal in Burnaby , B.C. To date , nearly 200 people have been arrested at the site ; last week a B.C. Supreme Court judge suggested that those arrested under civil charges for violating a court injunction should face criminal charges . Investigative journalism has never been more important .
