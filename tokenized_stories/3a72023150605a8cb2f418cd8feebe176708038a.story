After President Donald Trump signed two executive orders to continue the construction of the Keystone XL and North Dakota Access pipelines , military veterans are redeploying to a front line of their choosing : Standing Rock . One of the veterans involved in this mission is Michael Wood Jr. , founder of Veterans Stand , who sent a team of associates to Standing Rock to see what the conditions on the ground were before initiating a plan . Wood has previously claimed that the biggest misunderstanding about his group is that they seek to be aggressive in their defensive of indigenous tribes . Instead , nonviolence is part of his strategy as his team attempts to aid the tribes present at Standing Rock . The Standing Rock Sioux tribe has been asking protesters to leave the reservation since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers agreed to do an environmental review in December . This month , when the Bureau of Indian Affairs -LRB- BIA -RRB- sent law enforcement to remove protesters , tribal leaders clarified that did not want anyone arrested or removed by force . The casino Woods is referring to is the Prairie Knights Casino and Resort , located roughly 16 miles from the Standing Rock Tribe , where some of the press conferences and activities related to the North Dakota Access Pipeline have been held . In addition to making the point that the state is utilizing violence against protesters , he said that he wanted make the point through their actions that the federal interference at Standing Rock impacts everyone . Veterans Stand plan to provide assistance to the Sioux Tribe and have set up a GoFundMe page in order to prepare for mobilization and operation fees , helping stranded volunteers , and their need for camp supplies .
