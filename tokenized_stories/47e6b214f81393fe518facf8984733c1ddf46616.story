Above photo : From Yes Magazine I have returned from Standing Rock with my mind blown , my heart broken and my spirit troubled with foreboding of a deepening tragedy . Volunteering as a legal observer with the Water Protector Legal Collective I witnessed several confrontations between Water Protectors -LRB- WP -RRB- and law enforcement : national guard , sheriffs and private security -LRB- LE -RRB- . Tear gas canisters and rubber bullets -LRB- rubber bullets are regular bullets covered in rubber -RRB- were used against unarmed WP who had been singing and praying . I observed national guard chasing WP off the Backwater bridge , firing at people running away . I heard people choking and gagging from tear gas . I saw access to the WP medic vehicles being blocked . I spoke with medics and WP who described bullets penetrating flesh and causing terrible injuries , including to one media person who nearly lost his finger when his camera was targeted . I talked with a media person and was told of 4 media people on the bridge that night , 3 had their recording devices shot and the 4th , his hand . I saw a photo of a sheriff aiming a rifle directly at a media woman who was standing apart from the crowd . I heard testimony of the back of the medic pickup truck being awash in blood after evacuating wounded . I watched , and then , inadvertently became a part of , WP being forced off the bridge by national guard who were hiding behind WP vehicles parked along the road and firing rubber bullets at fleeing people . Many people were shot in the back , the neck , the head . When LE fired at people at close range , many were shot in the genitals or in the face . There are some young warriors , who , without the support of their elders , many who want the camps cleared to mitigate the economic and social damage being suffered by the local community in having the bridge closed , have vowed to not leave the camps or to let the last section of pipeline be built . Last night an indigenous website live streamed reports of drilling and construction noises coming from the drill pad . Without the eyes of a free press these attacks and trespasses continue , with the human rights and sovereignty of indigenous peoples denied . The UN Committee on Transnational Corporations and Human Right Abuses was in Standing Rock this week to take testimony of the many transgressions against people : crop dusters spraying poison pesticides and fertilizers on the camps ; hair samples indicating the presence of these chemicals ; people who have been injured , beat up , arrested , strip searched ; media and medics being targeted by snipers ; -LRB- one medic told me he stopped wearing his Red Cross vest due to medics being targeted -RRB- ; praying people being attacked and the refusal of DAPL and our government to abide by the Rule of Law . We need to stand up for our brothers and our sisters , for their way of life and , I believe , for our social contract as a democracy which is now threatened . The press that meets the eyes and ears of most Americans is far from free . It is controlled by moneyed businessmen and mega corporation so the news media covering banks and oil interests is going to look the other way .
