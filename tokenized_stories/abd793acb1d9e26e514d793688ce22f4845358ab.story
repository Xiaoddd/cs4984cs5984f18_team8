The hourlong demonstration against the Dakota Access oil pipeline led to a 4-mile freeway backup after protesters stopped traffic just south of the Lakeway Drive exit on Feb. 11 . The state patrol said the blockade led to a five-car rollover accident that left one person injured . The agency began investigating the protest the following day , soliciting information from witnesses to bring charges against participants . Though a handful of state patrol troopers were able to respond to the scene during the protest , no arrests were made at the time , prompting criticism from people outraged by the demonstration . The agency , which only had three troopers on duty at the time , scrambled to send troopers from Skagit and Snohomish counties to the scene , but they were still outnumbered by protesters , which made arrests impossible , the state patrol has said .
