Two very different philosophies and lifeways are at issue , one deeply connected to spirit , to the sacred beauty of Mother Earth and to the vast universe that sustains us , the other utterly disconnected , regarding the material realm as nothing more than an economic resource , and holding nothing sacred except money and profit . Then , on 2 December 2016 , I meet Cody Two Bears , District Representative for the Cannonball Community on the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Council , and finally get the picture clear . Cody Two Bears -LRB- right -RRB- with Graham Hancock . It first appeared in that form in 1640 in the writings of the French-Canadian explorer Jean Nicolet . Later , around 1760 , it was abbreviated to Sioux and adopted into the English language . The ancient and traditional keepers of the land have again and again found themselves in conflict with industries and agribusinesses hungry for profits and backed by the power and authority of the US government . Such spills happen surprisingly often with oil pipelines , and when they do they can cause immense damage . That was just 150 miles north of Oceti Sakowin , proving the point of the protestors that no pipelines are safe or can be guaranteed foolproof against spills . Photo : Santha Faiia Photo : Santha Faiia Photo : Santha Faiia Oceti Sakowin , by the way , as well as being the name of the protest camp , is also the correct name for the people commonly known as the Sioux . In this he sees great significance . As well as being the year of the Standing Rock protests , 2016 marked the 140th anniversary of the battle of the Little Bighorn in which General George Armstrong Custer and the Seventh Cavalry were famously annihilated by a confederation of Native American tribes led by Chief Gall and Crazy Horse , both of the Lakota Sioux . When we gather in our traditional cultural ways , our leaders would come together and pray and have ceremony and seek guidance from The Creator on how we need to go about our battle with the US Government . We had ceremony before anyone even came . We set up that Council Lodge north of where the Oceti Sakowin camp is today . We set that there before any people came and gathered . Instead the more southerly route close to Standing Rock was chosen , despite posing an equally severe threat to the water supply there , presumably on the mistaken assumption that the Sioux would put up less of a fight than the mainly white inhabitants of Bismarck . So they decided to reroute it . Two months later , they rerouted it a mile north of my community in Cannonball . Standing Rock reservation . They came and saw our people shortly after that . I was there at that meeting . This is our original treaty territory land . There may have been Acts of Congress , but legally that land is still ours . Yes it is . By the time of my visit on 1 and 2 December 2016 , more than 90 per cent of DAPL had already been laid along the more southerly route transgressing sacred lands and threatening the Sioux water supply . The company recently informed investors that it would take from 90 to 120 days to complete the pipeline after it receives its necessary easement from the Army Corps of Engineers to cross the Missouri River , which would push completion of the pipeline well past Jan. 1 . The broader economic context for the project has changed radically since ETP first proposed it , in 2014 . Global oil prices began to collapse just a few months after shippers committed to using DAPL , and market forecasters do not expect prices to regain 2014 levels for at least a decade . As a result , production in the Bakken Shale oil field has fallen for nearly two consecutive years , creating major financial hardships for drillers . There , however , in knee-deep snow during my visit in early December 2016 , thousands of Oceti Sakowin protestors continued to confront the bulldozers having faced five months of violence in which Mace , tear gas , water canon rubber bullets and attack dogs had been deployed against them by private security services working together with militarised police forces from North Dakota and neighbouring states . During my visit , though there was no overt violence , these heavily armed and armoured para-militaries were highly visible at several points overlooking the camp . Their manoeuvres , and watchful , hostile bearing , seemed deliberately designed to threaten the protestors with further harm . Jo-Ellen Darcy said she based her decision on a need to explore alternate routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing . Her office had announced on November 14 , 2016 that it was delaying the decision on the easement to allow for discussions with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , whose reservation lies 0.5 miles south of the proposed crossing . Tribal officials have expressed repeated concerns over the risk that a pipeline rupture or spill could pose to its water supply and treaty rights . ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe . It is not only the language of the statement that is bizarre but the ideas behind the language . I am writing this in December 2016 soon after President elect Donald Trump announced that his nominee for Energy Secretary is to be none other than Rick Perry , a Board Member of Energy Transfer Partners . Barring some miraculous change of heart , therefore , it looks certain that the Trump administration will find a way to grant the easement and allow the pipeline to proceed . The gold rush , however , prompted the US to extend its boundaries to the Pacific Ocean and impelled many poor whites from the eastern states to trek across Sioux territory on their way west where they not only transgressed Indian lands but also slaughtered the buffalo herds upon which the Sioux depended for much of their traditional livelihood . The Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 was intended as a response to this demand . When the document was returned to Washington , however , the U.S. Senate refused to give its approval to the long-term financial arrangements , and unilaterally amended the treaty by cutting the appropriation from fifty to just ten years . In this form , the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 was finally ratified by the U.S. Senate on 24 May 1852 , but the amendment was not sent to the tribes until 1853 . In 1861 gold was discovered near the headwaters of the Missouri , making Lakota territories on the west side of the river a target for prospectors . Thereafter matters , from the Indian point of view , continued to go from bad to worse and in 1862 the Santee , a Sioux tribe , began active resistance , attacking a military post and causing large numbers of white settlers to flee . Generals Henry Sibley and Alfred Sully therefore entered Sioux territory in force in 1863 on a punishment mission in which hundreds of Indians were killed . Continued traffic through Sioux lands transgressed the crucial buffalo ranges in the Powder River area , causing great hardship , and increasingly disrupted the culture and way of life of the people . The Sioux repeatedly objected and demanded government recognition and enforcement of their rights granted under the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty . Absent any response , the Indians were left with no choice but to take matters into their own hands and retaliate directly against the trespassers . For an overview of what happened next I take the liberty here of quoting at length -LRB- sections of text reproduced in italics below are quotations -RRB- from teaching materials , created to fulfill the requirements of the North Dakota Studies Curriculum . Historically the federal government has had a poor record of honoring treaties negotiated with Indian tribes . As the need for land or resources developed , the federal government simply moved to change the provisions of previous treaties . Treaties are legal documents the United States government , as a sovereign nation , negotiates with another sovereign nation . Initially , treaties with tribal nations sought to define the relationship that existed between the U.S. and a tribe , but as time went on , the U.S. used treaties as a way to extinguish Indian rights to ancestral homelands . And so when Sioux treaty lands were overrun with goldseekers , the U.S. simply sought to modify rather than honor the existing treaty . Then , in 1866 , the US government began to build military forts along the Bozeman Trail . This direct violation of the 1851 Treaty was rightly seen as an outrage and further treaty talks ended abruptly . Chief Red Cloud delivered a speech about white betrayal and treachery and led the Sioux delegation north vowing to fight all who invaded their territory as set down in the 1851 Treaty . Through 1868 Red Cloud and his warriors denied the Bozeman Trail to virtually all incomers . Army supply trains had to fight their way through , and soldiers were bottled up in their forts . The Indians had little need to negotiate a treaty and so ignored all government overtures to do so . Finally in 1868 the soldiers abandoned their forts along the Bozeman Trail as a way to restart treaty negotiations . The 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty was the result . This treaty proposed to : Set aside a 25 million acre tract of land for the Lakota and Dakota encompassing all the land in South Dakota west of the Missouri River , to be known as the Great Sioux Reservation ; Permit the Dakota and Lakota to hunt in areas of Nebraska , Wyoming , Montana , and North Dakota until the buffalo were gone ; Provide for an agency , grist mill , and schools to be located on the Great Sioux Reservation ; Provide for land allotments to be made to individual Indians ; and provide clothing , blankets , and rations of food to be distributed to all Dakotas and Lakotas living within the bounds of the Great Sioux Reservation . In return , if the Sioux agreed to be confined to this smaller land area , the federal government would remove all military forts in the Powder River area and prevent non-Indian settlement in their lands . The treaty guaranteed that any changes to this document must be approved by three-quarters of all adult Sioux males . Red Cloud seemed to have won his point since the forts along the Bozeman Trail were abandoned so , in good faith , he signed the treaty . Those Lakota and Dakota who lived south or east along the rivers also signed the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty because they were already living within or near the bounds of the newly established Great Sioux Reservation . However , three-quarters of the Sioux males did not sign this treaty . Most of the Lakota living north of Bozeman Trail including the Hunkpapa and Sihasapa bands , did not sign . In particular , Sitting Bull , a Hunkpapa , rejected all overtures to sign this treaty . This would be accomplished by replacing Indian spiritual tradition , cultural values , and lifeways with those of mainstream American society . In fact , as a way to encourage Christianization of the Indians , the federal government assigned various religious denominations to administer the reservations beginning in 1869 . By 1870 Standing Rock was run by Catholics . Those Lakota living off the reservation in the un-ceded territory complained bitterly when the federal government permitted the Northern Pacific Railroad survey crews into this area in direct violation of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty . Forts dotted the Missouri River near Indian settlements and treaty lands . Near the Grand River Agency , Forts McKeen and Abraham Lincoln joined Fort Rice along the Missouri River . The federal government continued to openly violate the 1868 Treaty throughout designated Sioux territory . The most famous and well-documented violation of Sioux rights was the 1874 Black Hills expedition of geologists and soldiers under George Custer , who were sent in by the federal government to explore the Black Hills and report on the extent of gold deposits . The Dakota and Lakota angrily protested the direct violation of the 1868 Treaty . Although the government admitted this expedition was illegal , it justified the survey stating it was only to gain information about mineral wealth in the Black Hills . Almost at once geological reports of gold in the Black Hills leaked to the general public and a stampede of miners poured into the area . By law these goldseekers were trespassing in areas defined as Sioux country in the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty . Half-hearted attempts by the military to keep miners out of the area were unsuccessful , and by the spring of 1875 the Black Hills were overrun by prospectors . This time the government proposed to purchase the Black Hills . The Grand River Agency representatives to this council were highly irritated at the invasion of the Black Hills and initially refused to attend the council meeting . Today , as the maps below show , the original Great Sioux Reservation has been whittled away by such manoeuvres to a tiny rump of its former self : 1868 Treaty : Establish Great Sioux Reservation Act of 1876 : Annex Black Hills Act of 1889 : Partition the Great Sioux Reservation Further lands totaling around nine million acres that had formerly been part of the Great Sioux Reservation were annexed in 1910 and sold off to white settlers and corporations . The map below details this and other annexations and shows the current extent of the reservations that remain within what was once the Great Sioux Reservation : Kmusser , CC-BY-SA-2.5 Little wonder then that the Sioux dug their heels in at Standing Rock in 2016 . Viewed against the background of almost two centuries of deceit , dispossession and theft , the passage of the pipeline through lands that they had never formally ceded to the US , and across burial places and ancient ceremonial sites of great cultural significance , was simply the last straw . Despite the fact that Mack had tenure the university wanted him gone because of his unorthodox views on the UFO abduction phenomenon , but with Sheehan defending him Harvard lost the case . Graham Hancock -LRB- right -RRB- with Daniel Sheehan . What happened was that in 1849 , when gold was discovered in California , a whole bunch of these private wagon trains were bringing people out to California . A lot of those wagon trains were coming through . When they crossed the Missouri River , they had already gone through the territory of the Dakotas and the Nakotas . On the west side of the Missouri River were the hunting grounds for the buffalo . They were killing buffalo and just leaving them to rot , taking the hides and their tongues , leaving the rest to rot . They were destroying the hunting grounds . So the Sioux called a meeting of all seven council members of the Teton Group , all seven bands . We discuss the 1851 treaty and its subsequent amendment by the US government without consultation with the Sioux . Then they went on to say that the United States government has the authority to exercise eminent domain in places , so they were going to treat this as though it were an exercise of eminent domain . To the person , they refused to accept a single penny . You can see the sneaky lawyers working behind the scenes . In the United States , there are 3030 counties . Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shore , the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society . From the sixteenth century forward , blood flowed in battles over racial supremacy . We are perhaps the only nation which tried as a matter of national policy to wipe out its indigenous population . Moreover , we elevated that tragic experience into a noble crusade . Indeed , even today we have not permitted ourselves to reject or feel remorse for this shameful episode . Our literature , our films , our drama , our folklore all exalt it . Arguably since they were never used for a public purpose , eminent domain does not apply and they should be returned to their traditional owners and keepers . And number three you have the issue of fossil fuel contaminating the water supply . It rusts out and all the poison that goes in there will just spread into the aquifer . They just cap it and leave . Mussolini wrote all the essays on fascism . Then guys like Henry Lewis who was a fascist , Henry Ford was a fascist , John D. Rockefeller was a fascist . Private security companies hired by the Dakota Pipeline are a subsidiary of Blackwater , and DAPL , as you already know is just a front for Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco , and one of the big financers of the project is Wells Fargo Bank . In mid-December major protests were held at four separate bank branches in New York City to demand that Wells Fargo , Citibank and TD Bank divest from the pipeline . They are the biggest corporations that support the Dakota Access pipeline . Mni Wiconi . Water is sacred . This is life . Without it , nobody can survive . All we wanted was peace and to raise our families and to know the power of peace . The call to divest is being heard far and wide . Also in mid-December , Seattle City Council voted unanimously to discuss legislation that would see the city break ties with Wells Fargo over its financing of the pipeline . They have been bitten by attack dogs , pepper-sprayed , subjected to mass arrests , including for praying . But they have courageously stood strong and shown that when we build organized movements willing to fight , we can win . Elected officials nationwide owe it to the activists to stand with them . Meanwhile at Oceti Sakowin camp , Sioux elders extinguished the seven council fires , which had been burning for months , and young Native water protectors lit a new fire , dubbed the All Nations Fire , as a further symbol of continued resistance . And so we approached the elders , and they told us how to conduct ourselves and to build a new fire . I talk to a lot of elders and a lot of spiritual leaders . We had to keep our ceremonies secret . We had to keep our stories a secret for so many years to preserve that . Because the government was fearful of what we had and who we are as a people . The laws will tell you that . They thought we were casting spells , when all-in-all we were trying to keep the balance with the Earth and the Stars . I ask Cody to elaborate and he points to a map of North America on the wall , and to our location on it . We are Star People . When you say national security and national interest of this country , we gave three trillion dollars of gold to this country through our people . We gave hydroelectric power . We had to rebuild , lost all our land . We had to do that . Our people had to sacrifice for that . I call it historical trauma from all the atrocities and genocides that happened to our people over the years . The many , many wars that have been waged not just against our tribe , but against every tribe . Whatever the government decides they can take , we have to come back from that on our own . We have people coming into this country that all of a sudden are successful overnight . Because we still have a history of that trauma that we carry with us . Because we are a people still trying to heal . We all know how it feels when we have a death in the family but we have suffered that feeling for five hundred years . Everywhere I go and speak , I tell the people this . Our youths were the ones that started this movement from Standing Rock . We were always afraid of them . Today people are not afraid any more , and they know how important our resources are . Chief Sitting Bull knew this was coming . I never understood that . None of us did . Habits and lifestyles can be changed . We do not have to be amongst those who always take the largest portion and claim it as their right . We can choose to live in the world with love and without fear , not taking from others but seeking to offer nurture and support to all beings . So , yes , at one level Standing Rock is a Native American struggle with its immediate focus on stopping the wasteful , potentially polluting , historically disrespectful and ultimately superfluous Dakota Access Pipeline . At another level , however , what it is really all about is how human beings wish to live in the twenty-first century . We preserved it and kept it for safekeeping where they tried to get rid of us . They tried to exterminate our people . But we had a Spirit that was so great , and we understood the meaning of protection . We are protectors of this Earth . We always have been . Because they knew there was going to be a time when more people migrated here and the population grew and was going to overtake the world . So we were given from The Creator a powerful spiritual message that has come today to be preserved for you guys , for everyone . We are teaching the world a culture that has been preserved for everyone . And the more you start to learn , the more you start to understand how important Water is . Some eighty to eighty-five per cent of our bodies contain water . We were never materialistic . Culture is richer than anything . We need to share our stories now . We need to come out of the box . This was all talked about seven years ago . Our spiritual leaders came together seven years ago , and said we need to start coming out now with our stories . xviii . So much Gratitude . This was from Facebook a few weeks ago . Seemed relevant to share here . Finally at this late date semi-decisively halting the current route of construction on the Dakota Access Pipe Line . To me , this is a simple equation . Because that value does not end with those people , there is where it begins . The cultural and psychological value is to US . The outsider , the powerful , the comfortable , who chooses Peace and Respect not because we have to politically or economically or in response to shame , but because it is the truth of our Heart , and this is how we show our kids and make it a driving principal of their Hearts . This is a test if we truly are a democratic society where the voice of the many drives the actions of our appointed representatives because all people have acquired the civil rights outlined in our nations founding documents , or if we are still learning to be free . Freedom is a form of consciousness , not a gift to be given or a range of actions to be allowed . As above , so below . I am most warmed and grateful to know how it affects those who did not yet have the hope or assurance of The Force behind our hearts . Yet , I can not celebrate . What drives us is not stopping this pipeline . It is healing the world view that says we must have more pipelines . This is the first days of this New Thing , and this New Thing will not be allowed to grow freely , Standing Rocks will not be left alone and allowed to cast accurate shadows . Seeds will not be left alone to root . Thanks to everyone supporting the cause of a forgiving harmonious humanity . Love and Gratitude . Your timing could not have been better.I think that we -LRB- all humans alive at this time -RRB- are on the verge of a massive lesson in priorities . We need clarity of issues above all . I Love your work Graham . This I affirm . My thanks to you , Mr. Hancock , for your dedication and passion for this cause and for all that you offer the emerging consciousness of our time . A lot of useful details to expand on , work out solutions , and very interesting points of view of the news making interviews ... . In a way , it seems that there were several angles of negotiation not entered into the greater development . Somehow , another treaty broken with indigenous folk does not sit well . Those who might have energy resource solutions to benefit all parties within these sovereign borders on this matter now would be a good time to introduce yourself as this general scenario is not likely to go away . Coastal storm surges , drought , population relocation , infrastructure dystrophy , to name a few increasing concerns , will need answers sooner than later , probably , on a much bigger scale and like those few named circumstances listed above they have similar requirements and associated legal ramifications . Not to mention a lot of action required in a shorter time frame . Some say the Chinese built a vacant city to relocate an occupied city . Perhaps . Only the Chinese know for sure . With a few tweaks and efficient transportation that city can be occupied since many of the buildings already line the cityscape . They notably built high or upward instead of in an expanding sprawl . It has become a learning process in no small way . Thanks Graham . I feel like I just attended class while you and your wife , Santha , did all my homework . As a former Employee of one of the largest pipeline companies in the world , I know for a fact that their concern has nothing to do with the good of the people , the planet , or any other good thing under heaven . It is greed for more power and material gain . No matter what harm may occur . They will even tell themselves self-deceitfully , look at how much good came from making energy easier to ship . Look at how much more industry was able to flourish . Few of us realize the sins we used to support in the name of earning a living . I for one seek atonement . I actually bought into their lies for many years . Thinking that pipelines were the less invasive means of transportation . But after 25 to 50 years or when they simply find a more viable means of getting their oil . They bury them . Inspections cease , and a toxic catastrophe is ticking like a bomb . God knows how many are ticking now on some of the most beautiful lands on Earth . Please visit us here in Ecuador . 25th December 2016 at 3:09 pm Swish says : Thank you Graham for putting together a great article on this very important time at Standing Rock . Love your work . 26th December 2016 at 3:47 pm Linda S Shepherd says : Thank you . With such an excellent and flawlessly researched article , the criminality of the DAPL and indeed the U.S. Government should be obvious to all . Whether or not that makes a difference in the outcome of Standing Rock remains to be seen . What a horrible feeling that is . 27th December 2016 at 8:25 pm Vivienne Tobassa says : Dear Graham I applaud this article as the most comprehensive , well researched and clearly communicated background of the pipeline situation . I resonate with the comments above on your article . Over a decade ago Arvol and Paula were planning and discussing with me the set up of their PEACE institute through Wolakota Foundation . But they could not get permission to build and implement on their own lands a vital hub for heritage and culture preservation , social development , disaster recovery and adaptive survival resilience . People vote for social values but the governments are not administrating for the people who voted -LRB- employed -RRB- them . Instead they are obeying or aligning with corporate interests who have tax shelters in other countries , do not contribute to the social tax system but promise token kick backs that have personal impact . All want the money to buy freedom from that wheel and live with ease and comfort , but there is never enough to get off the roundabout again . Further , those who are subjected most to the threat should be free to publicly state their case and grounds without threats and harm . It does so through holding the might of material destruction through weaponry and financial control . Read the UN reports . Our non deluded reality is that if we are not in the middle of the storm we do not believe it is happening . But we all know when a storm is coming . That storm has been coming for some time now but will intensify rapidly . The new Atlanteans . It just takes the wisdom of Mother people to know this without being deluded by the Carnival glamour that our current world numbs and consoles the masses with . The consumer drug is highly addictive . I do have knowledge that I could suggest adds very much to your theory , and pretty much perfectly dovetails into many ideas you have and have talked about on Joe Rogan . I have a very good idea of how to deliver a anti-virus into the amnesiatic mental state of the species , and its business idea that would make every lots of wealth . I am ex investment analyst , that made quite a lot , and quit , for some reason I now understand . But I did have a genius ability in economic and advanced finance theories in school , and pretty much can disprove the validity of all those ideas , which essentially is what the world economic engine is fundamentally based upon today . I would like to get in contact and share ideas . Every book Lots of books , it consumed for 10 years . Its a very mathmatically exhaustive process , but is not done in the universal language of origin , which is geometric symbolism thats left all over the place to be re-interpreted , when we start waking up . 5th January 2017 at 6:45 pm Scott Inglis says : I heard the premonition of the bee hive symbol in the masonic and egyptian glyphs . I have a theory . I will give them , and forgo any license of authorship . 5th January 2017 at 8:38 pm John Brown says : I became aware of the extermination of the Native Americans when I was eleven years old , it took ten more years before I learned the full extent of the American governments genocidal history . I think it is fair to say that what our ancestors did to the Indian nations was so terrible that the ripples of this travesty will ring perpetually through time without end . 13th January 2017 at 8:10 am Michael Freed says : There is probably no issue that shows how much we need to change OUR way of thinking about our society than this one issue . You are ALL avoiding the reality of the situation . The oil companies do not build oil pipelines without government permits and government permission . The police do not authorize THEMSELVES to come in and bash their fellow humans . Donald Trump did not approve fracking or authorize pipelines . And yet not ONE criticism of our system of governance appears here or anywhere else in the criticisms of this issue . Just as in the case of Flint Michigan , ALLOWING these things to BECOME issues requires several levels of government approval . If you are going to accept the written rules of people IN government as if they were unquestionable edicts of the Gods , then you are already defeated . But you as people simply refuse to believe that this affects the decisions of those in government . You think of your system of governance as an entity that cleanses all immoral motives from those IN government and ignore reality . STOP treating your system of governance as some idealized larger-that-life knight on its white horse . They are just people . Nothing more than people . Unless you decide to take away the control to make such decisions away from the PEOPLE who now control them , NOTHING will CHANGE . Nothing CAN change . And nothing can change THAT by merely ignoring the fact that the people IN government consciously DO this over and over . I have an idea that can get rid of ALL fracking : ALL GMOs , ALL chem trails and indeed , ALL corporate polluting . If anyone has the BALLS to actually challenge government , please reply . Thank you . indeed trump means it is our govt which it is and the army core of engineers protects alas doesnot allow the encroachers wasici then all of us are the ones capable of taking back to our selves and respecting earth and ourselves as the brave native americans we should continue to align our culture back in kind.Thank you to graham Hancock . If you want to talk fascism look at Obama and his green energy schemes , principle among corporate operators is General Electric . With regards to fracking , the technology has taken a leap forward with microwave fracking . This technology is to come online this year , 2017 . The bi-product is clean water , no wastewater disposal . The technology opens up the Green River Formation in Colorado which contains three to four trillion barrels of oil shale , about half of which is recoverable by microwave . That amount is five and a half times the proven reserves of Saudi Arabia . 17th January 2017 at 4:39 am Karito Paora says : Love your work Mr Hancock , may I say the prayers and support of the Maori tribes of Aotearoa NZ are with the Oceti Sakowin . Thank you for sharing your views and research on the matter and its background . 17th January 2017 at 10:30 am Rob Sand says : Thank you for the well documented article . One item I suggest may be inaccurate . You were told , or understood , that the first council lodge was north of the Oceti Wiconi camp . I understood that it was at the original Sacred Stone Spirit Camp . A sad day again with impending doom on the horizon . 1st February 2017 at 11:42 am Musti says : Hi Mr Hancock . These are called Wandjina -LRB- sky-beings -RRB- . Thanx for the great work and being a persistent advocate of an alternative perspective for the roots of humanity . I am fascinated by his theories of lost ancient civilizations and furthermore I am really curious what his position on the anunnaki astronauts -LRB- ancient aliens , celestial mentor -RRB- is . 7th February 2017 at 2:43 pm OGK says : I was curious why this is making so much noise , considering there already are two existing gaslines built in 1982 , running the same path . According to this , DAPL is laid on land that was excavated many times before , parallel to existing lines , at a much greater depth , and using modern technology . Additionally , there were multiple route deviations and adjustments to reduce environmental risks . At the end of the day , pipelines are the safest way to transport oil , gases , or other fluids . Let me know what you think . 7th February 2017 at 2:36 pm shaw lee says : Mr. Graham Hancock : thank you for your attendance and support for the spirited water supporters during their stand-off with the powerful DAPL at Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota . That so many environmental conscious protectors stepped up to the plate to involve themselves in a cause that will also affect them and their future generations is heartening ; my prayers are with them . shaw 10th February 2017 at 9:17 pm Comments are closed .
