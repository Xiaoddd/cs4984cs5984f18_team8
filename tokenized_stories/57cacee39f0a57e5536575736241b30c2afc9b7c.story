Protesters trying to push past a long-blocked bridge on a state highway late Sunday and early Monday were turned back by authorities using tear gas , rubber bullets and water hoses . At least 17 protesters were injured severely enough to be taken to hospitals , said Dallas Goldtooth , an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network . Goldtooth said the fires were set to warm people soaked with water . Keller said the American Red Cross set up an emergency shelter in Fort Yates for any protesters needing help . One person was arrested . Rema Loeb said he was forced to retreat from the bridge because he feared being doused with water on the freezing night . Others , he said , needed medical treatment after being hit with tear gas . The 1,200-mile , four-state pipeline is being built to carry oil from western North Dakota to a shipping point in Illinois . They also worry that construction could threaten sacred sites . Pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners has said no sites have been disturbed and that the pipeline will have safeguards against leaks , and is a safer method of transport for oil than rail or truck . The company has said the pipeline is largely complete except for the section under Lake Oahe , a Missouri River reservoir in southern North Dakota . On Friday , ETP Chief Executive Kelcy Warren said the company is unwilling to reroute the pipeline .
