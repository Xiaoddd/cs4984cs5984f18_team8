These are initial edited excerpts from a report and working document recently prepared by the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Communist Party , USA that contain some points on strategic perspectives , orientation , and plans for the coming period . They have been edited for wider publication and accessibility . Read more I . At the same time , fascism is an even more grotesque and openly murderous form of this same system , representing horrors for humanity and the planet , beyond what this system already inflicts every moment . The communist revolution aims to get rid of the capitalist-imperialist system and replace it with a radically different economic and political system , socialism . As a form of rule , fascism resolves the contradiction between the essence and appearance of bourgeois democracy by exercising this class dictatorship of the bourgeoisie in its naked form . The capitalist-imperialists can enforce their system and its dominance through either bourgeois democracy or fascism , even as they may differ sharply as to what is the necessary and desirable means at a given time . They have advanced fascist mass mobilization around these themes . For many years now , Bob Avakian has pointed to the rise of fascist trends and a definite fascist movement in U.S. political life . Bob Avakian -LRB- BA -RRB- is the Chairman of the Revolutionary Communist Party , USA . He is the architect of the new synthesis of communism , a whole new framework for human emancipation on a thoroughly scientific foundation . For more , we encourage readers to read and engage THE NEW COMMUNISM , by Bob Avakian and other works of BA , along with the interview with award-winning scientist and advocate for BA 's new communism , Ardea Skybreak , Science and Revolution : On the Importance of Science and the Application of Science to Society , the New Synthesis of Communism and the Leadership of Bob Avakian . They are available on this website , revcom.us . BA leads the revolution in the U.S. , theoretically and practically . And Why Clinton and the Democrats Are No Answer , and -LRB- b -RRB- the compilation of excerpts in The Coming Civil War and Re-polarization for Revolution in the Present Era . And theocratic Christian fascism is a critical dimension of this . In a large section of the world , U.S. imperialism is bogged down in wars for empire , locked in struggle with the historically outmoded forces of Islamic jihadism , even while they mutually reinforce each other in a dynamic that is deadly and oppressive to hundreds of millions . The U.S. faces challenges from China as a rising economic and military power , and inter-imperialist rivalry with Russia and Europe . The warming of the planet has growing and long-term implications , including mass migration from the oppressed nations which are disproportionately affected . In this society , the oppression of Black , Latino , and other oppressed nationality people , of women , and of immigrants intensifies , even while the traditional social fabric is strained by changes in demographics , the role of women , and gender and sexuality norms . Imposing this fascist program on society requires going after and replacing the norms and institutions of bourgeois democracy , especially those that pose obstacles to them like the press , the judiciary , and other sections of the ruling class . This is the dynamic of the fascist juggernaut . The imposition of different and more oppressive cohering norms in society , the escalated , violent , and viciously cruel attacks on sections of people , the trampling of civil and legal rights , the mobilization of violent fascist social bases , require , contribute to and are part of this dynamic and momentum of the fascist juggernaut . II . Resistance , protest , and outrage among the people have been and continue to be a feature from the very beginning of this regime . We have to learn from these , to lead what is needed . In assessing and understanding this moment , it is similar to the time period between Hitler being appointed chancellor and the consolidation of fascist rule where the Nazis had crushed the opposition . At this moment the former is principal and the latter fundamental . This is integral to everything we need to be doing and to actually even succeed in this crucial political battle ... in line with what is ultimately needed to get to a radically different and far better society through revolution . III . It needs to be replaced and superseded , however , not by an even more grotesque and more openly murderous form of the same system , but by a radically new society , and a radically different kind of state , that will open the way and lead finally to the abolition of all forms of oppressive and repressive rule and all relations of domination and exploitation , throughout the world . First , this orientation highlights the even greater import of projecting a radically different and far better society that is represented in concrete and visionary form in the Constitution for the New Socialist Republic in North America -LRB- CNSRNA -RRB- , authored by Bob Avakian . Particularly at a time when the question of how society should be organized , and on what principles , is much closer to the surface , this needs to be much more widely known . Second , this orientation stands in contrast to a position or orientation , historically characterized as United Front against Fascism -LRB- UFAF -RRB- , which was dominant in the international communist movement in the 1930s in response to the rise of Nazi Germany . This line fundamentally divorced fascism from the capitalist-imperialist system , ultimately drawing too sharp a distinction between the democratic , antifascist section of the bourgeoisie and the reactionary section of the bourgeoisie for whom fascism was a response to and resolution of underlying contradictions . All this stands in opposition to leading the masses of people in independent historical action to achieve a crucial objective short of socialist revolution , with the overall strategic perspective and goal of working towards a radically different future embodied in that revolution . In this , there is an aspect common with UFAF , but this aspect in common is very secondary to the fundamental differences in approach , orientation , and goals . This is therefore relative , and contingent on an objective situation in flux . IV . This is first and foremost . When people understand this and become convinced , all sorts of things become possible with people doing all kinds of things , taking initiative , with creativity and defiance . This is what is needed , on a growing mass scale . Living , compelling agitation on this is critical , in person and even more on social media and online . The more this case is made and becomes a reality , the more people will grasp the necessity and feel compelled to act to do so . With the right orientation of unity-struggle-unity , we need to make the case to drive out this regime because fighting rearguard actions against the fascist juggernaut are incommensurate with its dynamics , not only because -LRB- a -RRB- the horrors qualitatively accentuate and accelerate but -LRB- b -RRB- there is a weakening basis to fight . To fundamentally win this on a societal basis , there is a need for , and openings for , ideological struggle . articles , related memes , etc. that expose all this . The more this is out there , the more it sets favorable terms for the struggle that is needed . This is strategically very , very favorable ground , including provoking big questions on , in short , the 5 Stops and the 3 Things4 , to which we have thoroughly scientific answers . In this context , especially on campuses , among the intelligentsia and artists , and in the middle strata overall , grappling with and even sharply struggling around the questions of epistemology to make a breakthrough is critical . Obstacles are approached differently in this context , bullshit included . This has to be the orientation , setting and re-setting terms , not letting the terms get set by answering every question posed , questions that objectively represent a bourgeois or petite bourgeois outlook . The best of what is done is far from enough . We need an impatience grounded in science ... - Training people to be strategic commanders of the revolution . 2 -RRB- People have to dig seriously and scientifically into how this system of capitalism-imperialism actually works , and what this actually causes in the world . 3 -RRB- People have to look deeply into the solution to all this . What people think is part of objective reality , but objective reality is not determined by what people think . These two guidelines are gone into during the opening chapter of THE NEW COMMUNISM by Bob Avakian and refer to the need for communists to root themselves both in the objective need of the seven billion people on the planet for a whole new world , coming from those interests in everything , and to proceed from and apply the scientific method , and nothing less , in making revolution . and Revolution Send us your comments .
