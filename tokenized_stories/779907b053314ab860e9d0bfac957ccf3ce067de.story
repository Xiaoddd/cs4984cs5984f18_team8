Tonight Some clouds this evening will give way to mainly clear skies overnight . Areas of patchy fog . Low around 65F . Winds light and variable . Following a series of public meetings and input from a host of state and federal regulators , environmental groups and forest users , developers of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline opted in February 2016 to re-route 12 miles of the proposed natural gas line out of the Monongahela National Forest . While that decision left only 5.1 miles of the pipeline still within the Monongahela , the detour added about 30 miles to its overall length , most of which will be absorbed by private landowners in Pocahontas County . While nearly all recreational amenities inside the forest will be bypassed by the ACP , the pipeline will follow , and obliterate , the route of the Allegheny Trail for a little less than a mile , forcing a re-routing of the 330-mile cross-state pathway through the Seneca . The trail realignment also includes a new trailhead parking area at Laurel Run , he added . Plans call for existing forest roads to be used as temporary haul roads for pipeline materials and equipment , though several miles of new roads apparently will be cut to reach more remote construction sites . Scenic vistas will be diminished at several locations due to the presence of the pipeline and new access roads , according to viewshed studies . An absence of prompt public disclosure on a related matter also troubled members of the Pocahontas County Commission . Months later , county commissioners learned that the Dominion Conservation Fund , a charitable arm of Dominion Energy Transmission , the lead developer of the ACP , had paid for the purchase , apparently to donate to Seneca State Forest to mitigate for pipeline construction activity . State officials would not comment on whether the former BSA land had been transferred to Seneca State Forest . But earlier this month , Ann Simonelli of The Conservation Fund said in an email that the 1,200 acres had been transferred to the State of West Virginia in May 2018 . Created in 1924 , Seneca is the oldest state forest in West Virginia . A right-of-way cut can be seen ascending the hills to the east , where the Virginia border lies a few miles distant . Since trees were felled along a section of right-of-way at the edge of the forest early this year , work has yet to resume in the Seneca . But since the ruling , right-of-way clearing work has resumed in areas along the pipeline route where the five species of concern are not known to live . Seneca State Forest is known to be home to three of the species . It is not known when the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals will make a more comprehensive ruling on the incidental take matter , as announced in May . Meanwhile , pipeline construction activity is expected to ramp up . Your notification has been saved . There was a problem saving your notification .
