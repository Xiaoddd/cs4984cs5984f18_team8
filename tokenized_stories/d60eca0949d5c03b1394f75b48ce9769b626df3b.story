The 178-mile Pilgrim Pipeline would run through dozens of New Jersey municipalities , including several in Bergen County . It would deliver up to 200,000 barrels of Bakken crude oil a day from Albany , New York to the Bayway Refinery in Linden . Gasoline and heating oil would be sent back up to New York . Bakken crude oil is highly flammable and toxic to the environment . The Army also wants to see a full environmental impact statement regarding the project . The Army Corps of Engineers may allow the project to continue , but could order the pipeline be re-routed to another location . Members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and supporters protested , and sometimes clashed , with government personnel and law enforcement for weeks regarding the Dakota pipeline . New Jersey Water Watch , the Ramapough Lenape Indian Tribe , the Sierra Club 's New Jersey chapter , and other groups and organizations have already spoken out against the pipeline . The leaders of two-dozen Bergen County municipalities where the pipeline would run through have passed resolutions opposing it .
