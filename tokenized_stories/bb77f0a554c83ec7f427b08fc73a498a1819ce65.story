On December 4 , the Army Corps of Engineers did the right thing by refusing to give Energy Transfer Partners permission to build a portion of the nearly 1,200-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe in North Dakota . It was a big win for the tribe and its supporters . Soon after , the corps withdrew its call for the environmental study , and Energy Transfer Partners began drilling the next day . The reversal was a slap in the face of the tribe and its treaty rights with the United States . Quickly , the Standing Rock Sioux asked the courts to intervene and stop the pipeline so its impact on the environment could be assessed . Energy Transfer Partners , however , claims that the chance of a rupture in the river is low , but there are three responses to that claim . In July 2015 , the Michigan Petroleum Pipeline Task Force issued a comprehensive report of pipeline failures . The report cites many examples of ruptures over the last few years . In May 2015 , a pipeline failed off the coast of Santa Barbara , California , releasing 105,000 gallons of oil into the Pacific Ocean . A few months earlier , another pipeline spill released 42,000 gallons of oil underneath the Yellowstone River . Two years earlier , a pipeline ruptured in Mayflower , Arkansas , releasing 134,000 gallons . In July 2010 , a pipeline break released 840,000 gallons of oil , fouling 38 miles of the Kalamazoo River in Michigan . The immediate victims of a rupture of the pipeline would be the members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , now that the pipeline has been moved into their watershed . But the degradation of the water would also impact some 18 million people downstream who depend on water from the Missouri River . Under treaties the Standing Rock Sioux made with the U.S. government as well as under federal statutes , the tribe has the right to protect its land , its heritage , and its water from contamination by a possible pipeline rupture . The treatment of the Standing Rock Sioux by Energy Transfer Partners and all levels of government compel us to help the tribe as they fight to stop the pipeline construction from proceeding so that a simple environmental impact assessment can be conducted . The federal government has once again betrayed the Standing Rock Sioux and made a mockery of its obligations to the tribe while jeopardizing the drinking water of over 18 million Americans .

The very land you stand on is land stolen from the American Indian . Your ancestors invaded their country , and claimed it as theirs . Your ancestors taught children that Columbus discovered America . American Indians have a reverence and respect for this land that you can never understand or appreciate . Which is why you kick them aside , then invade , pollute , and destroy their sacred land for profit . Again , I question your welfare comment . Anything that America gives to Native American Indians , is not enough . In parts of West Virginia , Kentucky , and Virginia , mining companies get to coal seams by blowing up our beautiful mountains . Trump signed an EPO to allow the coal companies to then dump the toxic metal waste into the precious streams . Why , because the coal companies complained that the Obama regulations preventing such reckless poisoning of was costing them too much money . In Oklahoma , there is a human-made earthquake epidemic caused by fracking , oil companies forcing massive amounts of salt-water deep unto the ground in order to extract oil . The then attorney general did nothing to protect the people or address the massive amount of property damage . Instead , he allowed himself to be used by the oil companies to fight the EPA . Trump has made it easy for big business to rape and destroy America with impunity , and Americans paying the price for their recklessness , and having little recourse . You can continue to try to defend this deplorable behavior , but I hope you never find yourself or your neighborhood in the path of anything big business eyes as profit . You 're trying to stir the pot and lack the backbone to do so by using your name . February 25 , 2017 2:04 PM Akecheta Shipshewano I find your comment ignorant , selfish and heartless . Technically , Congress has no more power over Indian nations than it does over individual states . In the 1970s Native American self-determination replaced Indian termination policy as the official United States policy towards Native Americans . Self-determination promoted the ability of tribes to self-govern and make decisions concerning their people . The Bismarck route would also have been more than 10 miles longer and would have made it difficult to meet PSC requirements to keep the pipeline 500 feet or more away from homes , the Tribune reported . Not to mention that violating their sacred burial grounds is akin to allowing ETP to dig beneath a graveyard . February 25 , 2017 2:39 PM Mary Williams Wow , Anonymous , that was a mouthful but just think that if the people just stand by quietly and let their future be stuffed out due to undrinkable water , water that waters land , living animals , plants and of course you and your descendants . Not withstanding all of the treaties set with the Real Americans from the start , I hope that they win this battle . This battle is like fighting for the right to breathe , eat and drink as God-given blessing on this earth . I do disagree and I stand for my children 's children ever how long the earth last to be able to at least have water to drink . February 26 , 2017 6:46 AM Christopher Busby This outpouring is a consequence of failure to concede the rights of indigenous people enshrined in all Human Rights legislation including the UN Declaration of Human Rights . It is this way of seeing the world , creating bogus laws on the basis of majority domination , that the USA has been famous for and universally hated throught the civilized world since at least the time when the 1924 Act which Anonymous refers to . No doubt he or she would support the arrogant attempts by the USA to dominate and impose its system of thought and its toxic contamination on the whole of the world , for example the US antics in the Middle East which resulted in millions of dead and maimed and the poisoning of vast territories with associated increases in genetic diseases in whole populations . Indigenous people have rights to the land which they posessed before it was torn from them by invaders . The Indians were squeezed into small enclaves . Now they are to be further attacked to make money . February 27 , 2017 5:04 AM Anonymous Standing Rock is anything but a welfare state in need of defense from the ACLU .
