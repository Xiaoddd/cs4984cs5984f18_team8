Thousands of others have received training from Israeli officials here in the U.S. . Many of these trips are taxpayer funded while others are privately funded . These trainings put Baltimore police and other U.S. law enforcement employees in the hands of military , security and police systems that have racked up documented human rights violations for years . Public or private funds spent to train our domestic police in Israel should concern all of us . Many of the abuses documented , parallels violations by Israeli military , security and police officials . This leads , the report said , to use of unreasonable force during interactions for minor infractions , such as quality of life matters . For years , Amnesty International has found Israeli military , security and police forces responsible for the same behavior . In one case , a 28-year-old Palestinian man , not suspected of any crime except being present during a raid , was killed in what appears to have been an extrajudicial execution by Israeli forces , including an undercover police unit , during a raid on al-Ahli hospital in Hebron November 2015 . Eyewitnesses report that when Israeli forces entered the hospital room where the suspect was recuperating , they immediately shot his cousin . There was no attempt to arrest him or to use non-lethal alternatives before shooting him dead . This is one example among many . There are also documented incidents of suppression of freedom of expression by Israeli police . For instance , journalists covering protests have been assaulted or shot . Individuals are also arrested for social media posts or for gathering to peacefully discuss the occupation . Police have harassed and arrested Israeli whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu repeatedly since he served his full sentence in 2004 . Just this past July , Vanunu was in court for giving a news interview , moving -LRB- in the same building -RRB- without notifying police and for meeting with foreign nationals . Lack of accountability for human rights violations by Israeli forces and the environment of impunity that exists has been a long-standing concern with human rights organizations . It is beyond dispute that there are some very serious human rights problems in U.S. policing , including in relation to the use of force and respect for equality of all before the law . The people of Baltimore deserve better . The American public deserves better . Israel is not such a partner .

Danny on May 4 , 2017 at 6:35 PM said : Edith , you and Amnesty has done a tremendous job covering Israel and its actions . The video you link to is very powerful . A question is raised in this piece that I am very curious about . You say , and this has been repeated in many places , that Israeli police are teaching American police crowd control . However in the links you provide this is not corroborated . The links only talk about training in dealing with terrorism .
