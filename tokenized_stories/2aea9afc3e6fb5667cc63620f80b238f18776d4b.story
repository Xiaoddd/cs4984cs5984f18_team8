Transcript This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form . The War and Peace Report . Well , in recent months , the repression against the water protectors and journalists covering the movement has continued to intensify . North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple has also activated the National Guard . Water protectors also report near-constant surveillance from police planes and helicopters . Over 400 people have been arrested so far , and many report being subjected to strip searches while in the Morton County jail in North Dakota . Well , on October 31st , we spoke with Dakota and Dine Nation activist Dallas Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environmental Network about a violent police raid on a frontline camp established at the site of the same sacred tribal burial ground where unlicensed Dakota Access security guards attacked Native Americans with dogs and pepper spray on September 3rd . Dallas Goldtooth began by telling us about shocking video footage that emerged from the day of the raid of a man who worked with the Dakota Access pipeline . He was a pipeline guard . But he was wearing a bandana covering his face , carrying a rifle , apparently attempting to infiltrate a group of water protectors . DALLAS GOLDTOOTH : Thanks for having me on , Amy . And it was a very terrifying moment for a lot of us watching , I mean , to see this man pointing an assault rifle at our water protectors . You know , your description is accurate . And they did their very best to incapacitate the vehicle and did their very best to de-escalate the situation , which they were successful in doing . And so , it was pretty straightforward . And it just clearly paints that Dakota Access has no regard for common decency or any kind of corporate responsibility . DALLAS GOLDTOOTH : From what I understand , the initial response from Dakota Access is that they state that this individual does not work for Dakota Access , even though he had clear identification as a Dakota Access worker . It says Kyle Thompson . DALLAS GOLDTOOTH : Yes , yes . His name is on it . You know , he has an ID card with DAPL written on it . AMY GOODMAN : Right . DALLAS GOLDTOOTH : No , this happened last night . It was just to the immediate west of the Oceti Sakowin camp across Highway 1806 . And immediately after that , flames were seen on top of the hill to the west . I mean , it was very , very clear that that brush fire that happened was an act of arson by unknown individuals . And thank God that the wind was pushing away from the camp . The fire spread pretty large . They asked . Morton County never gave them the permission to fight that fire . They just let it burn . And that collusion is causing a very , very dangerous situation for our water protectors and for the main camp , that houses women , children , elders and just people that care and love for the land and are there for one sole purpose : to protect the water . AMY GOODMAN : Dallas , we got word that a horse had to be put down after being shot with rubber bullets by police . DALLAS GOLDTOOTH : This is true . And we were being pushed back , and batons are being swung , cracking over the heads and arms of our water protectors . And then we looked to the east , and over the hills to the east comes a herd of a couple hundred buffalo , bison , roaming , like stampeding towards the police line . And immediately behind them came some horseback riders , some young riders , men and women , who were actually guiding these buffalo towards the police line in an act of resistance and defiance . They were like flying like 30 feet off the ground to scare the buffalo off . And then they deployed ATVs to attack the horseback riders . They were shot with rubber bullets . One of the horseback riders was pulled off their horse . And sadly , one horse was injured so badly by the police that it had to be put down . Like , the pipeline is literally within miles of the Missouri River . But we need to do everything in our power to keep it from getting to that place . We enacted a form of eminent domain , claiming the land back for ourselves as Oceti Sakowin folks . And we set up a beautiful encampment on that piece of property , which severely threatened Dakota Access , and , obviously , Morton County sheriff , for their intents to build this pipeline . And so they came in with a large force . And you described , you know , a lot of the equipment that was there . And it was terrifying . I mean , we had elders , women and children who were put at severe risk because of the actions of law enforcement . A lot of folks know the Ponca leader Casey Camp . She stood in defiance , in peaceful prayer , in front of an armored personnel carrier , because she loved the land and wanted to protect the Missouri River , not just for the Standing Rock Sioux Nation , but for all nations and all people and the millions of people who depend on the Missouri River for drinking water . So this movement is not founded out of hate for the police officers or for the workers themselves , but out of love for the land and for all of us as human beings . Our enemy is not the police . He works with the Indigenous Environmental Network . Special thanks to Laura Gottesdiener , John Hamilton and Denis Moynihan .
