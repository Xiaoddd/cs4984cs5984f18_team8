In spite of long-standing concerns that the pipeline could threaten the safety of drinking water for 17 million people , a federal judge has now given Energy Transfer Partners legal permission to hide information about which areas of the pipeline are at risk for spills . Last Friday , U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled that information regarding these risks should be shielded from public view , but added that Energy Transfer Partners must make public certain details related to spill response measures , as well as the names of waterways that could be affected . The Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux indigenous American tribes , whose primary water sources are directly threatened by the pipeline , have argued that the disclosure of such information is essential , as it would strengthen their call for a more extensive environmental review of the project . This latest court case mirrors the back-and-forth that took place between Energy Transfer Partners and indigenous tribes last year , resulting in an intense public protest where indigenous people were supported by environmental and social justice groups . These camps united the tribes , military veterans and foreign activists , but were met with opposition by private security officers hired by Energy Transfer Partners , as well as state police . By the time this latest court hearing was under way , 750 anti-pipeline protesters had been arrested . Trump did , however , divest his stake in the company before becoming president . Despite the words of politicians and assurances from Energy Transfer Partners , oil spills in North Dakota are commonplace , with the Center for Biological Diversity estimating that the state has averaged around four major pipeline spills annually since 1996 . This latest ruling is set to create even more risks for those who stand to lose the most in the event of more spills .
