The progressive movement and the fight to defend the American Way depend on the grassroots engagement of everyday Americans . When we speak en masse with petitions , phone calls , rallies , and other actions , our individual voices are amplified , and decision makers from elected officials to CEOs take notice . DONATE NOW Get Updates Stay up to date on ways to engage with the fight for progressive values . Trump has nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court . Kavanaugh is a narrow-minded elitist who would drag the Court far , far to the Right and take a sledge hammer to the fundamental rights of countless Americans . The solution to the child care crisis in America is the Child Care for Working Families Act -- a bold new bill that not only provides direct financial assistance for child care and early learning expenses , on a sliding scale based on household income , but takes a comprehensive approach -- addressing child care challenges like the quality , availability , and flexibility of care . And the example he has set has trickled down throughout his administration . Sign the petition and demand Congress immediately investigate Trump administration officials for repeated ethics violations . The Department of Homeland Security has warned the government about future hacking attempts , but have done little to actually safeguard our elections -- and our democracy -- from Russian hackers . Scott Lloyd is woefully unqualified to direct ORR and has unethically used his position to advance the right-wing anti-choice agenda to prevent young people from accessing the care they need . Tell Speaker Ryan : REMOVE Devin Nunes from the Intel Committee The Republican majority on the House Intelligence Committee , led by Chair Devin Nunes , is out of control and Speaker Ryan has the authority -- and responsibility -- to rein it in . Rep. Nunes has shown that he can not be trusted with sensitive classified information and must be removed not only as Chair but as a member of the Intelligence Committee without delay . But your help can turn the tide . Farr is scheduled to be voted on in the Judiciary Committee TOMORROW . Farr is much more than just a run-of-the-mill advocate of voter suppression -- his history of disenfranchising voters of color is long . Oppose Trump Nominee Howard Nielson Howard Nielson is a Trump nominee for the federal district court in Utah , and is beyond the pale in terms of his unfitness for a lifetime appointment . His record is beyond flawed , and it is shocking that he was not only nominated , but re-nominated for the federal bench . Senate Republicans , led by Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley , are trying to ram through the confirmations of as many extreme Trump judicial nominees as they can before the end of the year . Two Trump nominees , Steven Grasz and Mark Norris , with very troubling anti-LGBTQ backgrounds are scheduled for a vote TOMORROW and senators must do everything in their power to stop them . And Mark Norris has a similarly anti-LGBTQ background when he served as a state legislator in Tennessee . And he tried to stop Syrian refugees fleeing violence and war from resettling in Tennessee . All of these actions make it clear that he would not be an unbiased judge that would protect the rights of everyone in Tennessee . Obliterating more than 100 years of Senate traditions , and in the face of his own promises not to do so , he has now scheduled the hearing for judicial nominee David Stras for next Wednesday . As a state Supreme Court justice , David Stras has ruled against the rights of children with disabilities , sexual assault survivors , and workers discriminated against on the job . He is absolutely the wrong choice for a lifetime seat on a federal court of appeals . Stop the GOP Tax Scam Both the House and Senate tax bills are a terrible deal for working families . Talley also omitted that his wife is the chief of staff for the White House counsel and who was recently questioned in the Mueller investigation when asked about potential conflicts of interest . And Talley is also remarkably partisan for a judicial nominee . Members of Congress of both parties and both chambers need to support this kind of vital legislation -- so necessary to preserving checks and balances -- in the face of a president with clear authoritarian leanings who is willing to lay waste to our democratic institutions . Tell the FEC : Subject social media ads to the same disclosure standards as TV and radio ads Social media ads remain a gray area in our elections . In 2011 , Facebook requested an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission on the issue , and to this day , the FEC remains deadlocked . Now , the FEC has opened up a public comment period , requesting feedback on how to address paid online advertising , including on Facebook and Twitter . Sign the petition below to submit an official comment to the FEC and demand that social media advertising relating to elections and advocacy disclose the same information as other forms of political advertising . Full Senate votes on four partisan , far-right Trump nominees will be happening SOON . Senators need to hear from the grassroots now that they should strongly oppose these unacceptable Trump appeals court nominees . Citizens United allowed an uncontrolled flood of dark money to enter and influence US elections . Since that decision , billions of dollars from unknown sources have shaped electoral outcomes across the country , damaging our democracy . The DISCLOSE Act of 2017 addresses these issues by closing loopholes that allow foreign nationals and corporations to engage in election activities including making donations . This bill will safeguard our democracy and put it back in the hands of everyday Americans -- so it needs to pass NOW . Blue slips allow senators to be consulted about lifetime appointments to the federal bench in their home state , and act as a safeguard against extreme appointees who are unfit to serve . And that threat was buttressed by his Twitter threat that their license to broadcast should be challenged . We need all of our members and supporters with us in this fight .
