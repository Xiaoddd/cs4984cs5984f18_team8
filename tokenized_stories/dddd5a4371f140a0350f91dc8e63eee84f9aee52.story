While Divest Dartmouth members built the pipeline , they also circulated a petition for onlookers to express their support for the cause . Afterward , several members of Divest Dartmouth gave short speeches detailing the purpose of the rally before departing and walking across the Green with the pipeline . Shortly after his inauguration earlier this year , President Donald Trump signed legislation that would enable construction of the controversial project to continue . According to Rocchi , Divest Dartmouth not only aims to raise awareness for the Keystone pipeline , but also wants to bring attention to fossil fuel divestment in general . Since its inception in 2012 , Divest Dartmouth has had an active presence on campus . Gundrum added that this meeting was inconsequential .
