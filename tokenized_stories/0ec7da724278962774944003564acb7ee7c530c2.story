The thousands of people that have arrived in support of the Standing Rock Sioux against the Dakota Access oil pipeline are still sleeping soundly , dreams dancing with victory . The sacred fire is still alive after a night of ceremony and celebration in temperatures well below zero . For a day that many thought might never come has arrived : the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has denied the easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross the Missouri River at Lake Oahe , and ordered a full Environmental Impact Statement . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had chosen today as the deadline for the Standing Rock Sioux Lakota and allies to abandon their resistance camps . Governor Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota had echoed the call with an immediate evacuation order . They declared those that remain will be considered trespassers , and face arrest on their own ancestral lands . Having faced deceit from the U.S. government for hundreds of years , Native leaders are cautious in their celebration . Never trust these crooks we have already seen what they will do to our people . Make them accountable , we need everyone on the ground until every pipe is removed . Allard is a co-founder of the Sacred Stone Camp , located on her land along the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline route . With more than 200 tribes present , now in multiple camps , this is the largest gathering of nations in a century . They are keeping prayerful water protesters from this and other sacred burial sites with razor wire , sound cannons , water hoses , rubber bullets and attack dogs . The evacuation orders from the Army Corps and Governor still stand , despite the temporary respite for the Missouri River and the Standing Rock Sioux people . We know how to live in winter . The 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty designates the currently disputed land as territory of the Standing Rock Sioux nation , though it was later illegally taken into federal control for dam construction by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1948 . The easement that was denied yesterday means that Energy Transfer Partners , the company building the Dakota Access Pipeline , will face significant fines if they continue to bore beneath Lake Oahe on this disputed territory . The majority of the 1,178 mile pipeline has already been built , stretching from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to terminals in Illinois . Barclays , HSBC and the Royal Bank of Scotland -LRB- RBS -RRB- all have had dealings with the company and its subsidiaries . The connections between European colonisation of the Americas and the struggle at Standing Rock were drawn out further in five UK actions on 1 December , the first day of a month of global solidarity actions . And it is this history that brings me to speak to you today . Genocide and colonisation is still taking place in different forms . The financial institutions of the UK are partners in funding the Dakota Access Pipeline . With your money these banks are complicit in the same old methods of ignoring and harming the indigenous people . Following the action , two RBS employees followed organisers to a nearby cafe . RBS provided financial support to the parent company of Dakota Access LLC but exited the relationship a year ago . While welcoming the news , activists demanded that the bank make a public commitment to funding no further fossil fuel infrastructure . Also on 1 December , activists gathered in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux at the Radcliffe Camera in Oxford , at Barclays Bank in Bristol and in Parliament Square in London . Some supporters also chose to sit in meditation for the 45 minutes before the action , in temperatures two degrees above freezing . This dedication to prayer , honouring of the ancestors and ceremonial action echoes what has been called for by elders and organisers at Standing Rock . We stand by our rights to self-determination and justice . We stand by our territorial treaty rights . So I say , do n't panic relatives , we got this . Hard times may be ahead , but we got this .
