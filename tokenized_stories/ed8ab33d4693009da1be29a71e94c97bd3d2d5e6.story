Here 's an alternative viewing list of great films . And please add any additional suggestions in our comments section . He begins massive public works programs to give jobs to the unemployed , repeals Prohibition , fights racketeers with military tribunals and firing squads and warns other nations to pay off their war debts or face destruction . And when Congress fights his stimulus package , President Hammond declares martial law . Citizen Kane -LRB- 1941 -RRB- The greatest movie of them all , according to many critics and lists of the best . And it tells an amazing tale , directed by and starring Orson Welles -LRB- his first movie -RRB- , chronicling the rise and fall of a media tycoon whose political aspirations are dashed by scandal . He did everything he could to keep the movie from being seen . Stark begins as an idealistic populist , an unknowing stooge of the local machine . Soon he sees the light , but the unbridled power he ultimately attains brings nothing but corruption and tragedy . She builds him into a national media sensation and falls in love with her creation , a mistake that almost ruins her life . Hubris does him in , but A Face in the Crowd is prescient in its depiction of how mass media and charisma can manipulate public opinion . Gantry is a two-bit salesman turned tent revivalist , preying on the gullible of small towns with a slick mix of hucksterism and evangelical Christianity . In the original , Laurence Harvey plays Raymond Shaw , decorated Korean War hero , son of mommy-from-hell Eleanor -LRB- Angela Lansbury -RRB- and stepson of Sen. Johnny Iselin -LRB- James Gregory -RRB- , a demagogic Joe McCarthy sound-alike being groomed by Eleanor for greater things . John Frankenheimer directs a clever and , believe it or not , often very funny script by George Axelrod , based on the novel by Richard Condon . Frank Sinatra plays the troubled army major trying to get to the bottom of things ; Janet Leigh is the woman who redeems him . and wonders what would happen if a foreign government tried to control American politics . The president of the United States is signing an unpopular nuclear disarmament treaty and one of its leading opponents is Gen. James Mattoon Scott -LRB- Burt Lancaster -RRB- , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . A powerful case for civilian control of the military . Anchorman Beale -LRB- Peter Finch -RRB- has had a major psychotic break and scheming TV executive Diana Christensen -LRB- Faye Dunaway -RRB- sees it as a way to build ratings for the faltering UBS television network . They rein him in , ratings collapse and the only solution is a drastic one . Directed by Sidney Lumet and written by the legendary Paddy Chayefsky , the screenplay whirls with smart , fast dialogue and skewers the TV industry , eerily forecasting an angry electorate , reality TV and so-called fake news . Nonetheless , his pseudopopulist campaign catches fire and a faked assassination attempt only boosts his poll numbers as his incumbent opponent Sen. Brickley Paiste , played by Gore Vidal , is brought down by scandal . We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty . We must remember always , that accusation is not proof , and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law . We will not walk in fear , one of another .
