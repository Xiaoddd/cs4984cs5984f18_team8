A recent decision by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg likely clears the way for construction to continue on the pipeline project as early as next week . But the court battle is n't over . The Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux have asked Judge Boasberg to overturn federal permission for the pipeline to cross underneath Lake Oahe . City officials have already expressed their disapproval of the pipeline . After that letter went out , Cisneros said he would consider divesting from such companies , but made no promises . But making that move could be difficult . The city has an obligation to make sure its investments are secure and yield a profit . In total , about three dozen banks , including Bank of America , U.S. Bank , and Goldman Sachs , are financing Energy Transfer , the company building the pipeline .
