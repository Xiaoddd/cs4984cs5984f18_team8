Army Corps denied DAPL permit on Sunday , but DAPL owners said that nothing has changed and it will proceed as planned . The Army Corps of Engineers denied the Dakota Access Permit on Sunday . Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault made the announcement at Oceti Sakowin Camp , which was broadcast live on Standing Rock Spirit Resistance Radio . DAPL owners responded late Sunday night and said nothing has changed . When the announcement was made in the live broadcast water protectors were urged by speakers at Oceti Sakowin Camp not to leave . They expected DAPL to ignore the Army Corps decision and proceed as DAPL has done before . The question now is whether President Obama will send in law enforcement or the military to halt DAPL from drilling without a permit . Otherwise , today 's announcement will have no enforcement . It will be seen as another US and corporate ploy to send home water protectors , and thousands of veterans , now at Standing Rock Camp , where more than 10,000 are camped . Jo-Ellen Darcy said she based her decision on a need to explore alternate routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing . Her office had announced on November 14 , 2016 that it was delaying the decision on the easement to allow for discussions with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , whose reservation lies 0.5 miles south of the proposed crossing . Tribal officials have expressed repeated concerns over the risk that a pipeline rupture or spill could pose to its water supply and treaty rights . Darcy said that the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an Environmental Impact Statement with full public input and analysis . The Dakota Access Pipeline is an approximately 1,172 mile pipeline that would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Pakota , Illinois . The pipeline is 30 inches in diameter and is projected to transport approximately 470,000 barrels of oil per day , with a capacity as high as 570,000 barrels .

Yet I would not begin to entertain any thought that the struggle is yet over . History instructs us so . But do carry on . This is a huge win . But there are still many ways open for the slimy bastards to sneak around the edge . This is so utterly untrue on so many levels , and that he said it shows a still entrenched , old paradigm mindset . That said , this would seem to be a step in the right direction . It will take Obama and the military to make them stop . I was out there . They are vicious and could care less about the native americans , their supporters , clean water , the environment , or anything else . I am against this pipeline but want to make sure what I am reading is true . Further , the wet dream of a politician is to manage to be on both sides of an issue and get away with it - whisper in one ear , and broadcast to the other . If he was smart , and able to make exceptions to his agenda , it could actually become the defining issue of his time in office - and a chance to be a truly different non-politician , and a lot less scary for a lot of people .

Also , Twitter has censored Censored News links for more than a month . Sometimes you can post our links by using a Tiny URL . That is DAPL if it succeeds . The Native Americans have little land left as it is . These lands are sacred to them . This shows what our government and big oil companies truly think of the Native people of this country . I share the joy and continue sending prayers .

So Dakota Access Pipeline Company can request an appeal . Trump is for DAPL . Moving the route isnt really great . When the earthquakes happen the pipelines will be compromised .

ReplyDelete Jules December 4 , 2016 at 3:17 PM I wish I could be more optimistic but am worried they will keep drilling and just pay the fines . They 're evil .

Delete Rutybear December 5 , 2016 at 6:19 PM Agreed . Unfortunately the protests STILL have n't succeeded in awareness through understanding either . What I have n't heard about this is the obvious reach out : imagine if a rich corpoation took over your home without your consent and locked you out with all your posessions and momentos still inside . Imagine if , after randsacking and damaging your home and the things in it they let you back in , but when you fixed everything up your water was poisoned and your family and your neighbours got sick and the corporation did n't care and no one else would help you . That is DAPL if it succeeds . This is not over .

Delete Reply Lloyd Vivola December 4 , 2016 at 4:00 PM Much gratitude and well wishes to the Water Protectors who have endured so long and sacrificed so much for Mother Earth and all our relations . Yet I would not begin to entertain any thought that the struggle is yet over . History instructs us so . But do carry on . Courage and clarity to Water Protectors and supporters everywhere . This is one positive step , keep progress moving forward . This also gives Obama a face saving measure , while potentially cutting backroom deals with the banks , while suggesting they wait for Trump .

ReplyDelete deonne December 4 , 2016 at 6:59 PM Obama Admin is directing the Army Corp of Engineers and is requiring they perform a full and complete Environmental Impact Statement , which was never done , and is just ONE of the laws DAPL has broken . Water protectors wo n't leave until their mission is accomplished . I am against this pipeline but want to make sure what I am reading is true . I want to share this with more people but they are saying they checked all of mainstream media and do n't see that fact being reported . Thanks . ReplyDelete Replies Sarah Ray December 5 , 2016 at 2:54 PM They said it themselves , in a statement to their investors . It 's on Businesswire.com . I have the link on my iPad , but I 'm on my laptop at the moment . December 4 , 2016 at 10:36 PM I will stand with you at Standing Rock or wherever it is that human rights are violated . I pray that the injured heroes get their lives and health back as soon as possible with the help of funds collected . Posturing , but while also effectively kicking the can down the road to the next administration . Politicians prefer to nurture and let ferment issues , and grow them into constituencies , and ultimately voter blocks rather than actually quickly and decisively solving them-which indeed is our current Washington D.C. gridlock system . At the end of the day activists and protestors are nothing more than little pawns in the larger chess moves of the power brokers . It always has more to do with accumulating power than it does actually solving a given issue , and I definitely suspect some of the same logic in play here . Further , the wet dream of a politician is to manage to be on both sides of an issue and get away with it - whisper in one ear , and broadcast to the other . This win-win really has nothing to do with what 's good for Mother Earth - it 's for what 's good for a politician and a political party , and a much larger world agenda of people like George Soros trying to capitalize . I just hope thru all of the noise - that the wisdom of the elders can be heard by a good number of people around the world , because it 's rare that they are truly offered the pulpit like this opportunity arises - and I hope that they are n't drowned out by Politicals , and that the issue is n't hijacked by the Occupy crowd and the Alinskyites . It would be nice to see and hear from the elders , who are larger than all of these games , right and left . If he was smart , and able to make exceptions to his agenda , it could actually become the defining issue of his time in office - and a chance to be a truly different non-politician , and a lot less scary for a lot of people . But maybe I should n't write too much here , to enable another hollow symbolic populist move that leaves him looking like a genius with an end run around the system as we know it . I do n't think I 'm going to vote again until a full blooded traditional American Indian is at the top of the ticket -LRB- ... and not the 2nd fiddle to Larry Flynt sorta thing that was such a shame -RRB- . The world desperately needs to learn , and have it 's collective consciousness moved forward from the centuries ignored universal truths and the laws of nature from the wisdom of the only sustainable culture this land has ever known . From where I sit , it 's the only proven thing tangible that really holds hope for the future of this planet - and opportunities likes this just do n't come around often , if ever , and for that matter - a direct showdown , and war of words between PEOTUS and the wisest American Indian Elders , may be the long awaited opportunity for this .
