President Obama had scaled back the 1990s-era program in 2015 , following the heavily armed police response to protests against the killing of black men in Ferguson , Missouri and elsewhere . The name of the bill , introduced by Republican Rep. Daniel Donovan and supported by Reps. Peter King , Ted Budd , and Paul Gosar , refers to the leftist anti-Fascist movement , some members of which have worn masks during protests . -LRB- See full text of bill here -RRB- Status : pending Introduced 8 Jun 2018 . Accordingly , a protester who disrupts a public speech while committing another infraction -LRB- e.g. trespassing -RRB- could be charged with a Class B felony , punishable by up to 20 years in prison . Critics argue that the bill provides for disproportionately harsh penalties , and that its broad language would enable authorities to enforce it selectively . Under the bill , conviction for unlawful assembly -LRB- a Class 1 misdemeanor -RRB- would become a Class 6 felony if committed while wearing a mask , punishable by up to two years in prison . Conviction for riot -LRB- a Class 5 felony -RRB- would become a Class 4 felony if committed while wearing a mask and subject to up to four years in prison . As originally introduced in the House , the bill made it a felony to wear any kind of disguise at a protest . Under the introduced bill , police would have had authority to detain any individual wearing a disguise in order to verify his or her identity and determine if the person had committed a crime ; violation of the disguise ban would have been a Class 6 felony , subject to one year in prison . The sponsor of the bill said it was inspired by clashes between police and protesters , some of whom were masked , outside a 2017 rally for President Trump . Following widespread criticism , the bill was comprehensively revised to a single provision that would allow courts to consider it an aggravating factor , for sentencing purposes , if an individual wore a mask or other disguise to hide their face while committing a criminal offense . Under the bill , organizers and protesters could be charged as conspirators , and bystanders could be held liable if they witness someone declare an intention to start a riot . The bill provides that prosecutors may seize a person 's assets under civil forfeiture laws in addition to filing enhanced felony criminal charges . Under the bill , picketing or demonstrating near a private establishment , business , or school would be illegal if it obstructs the entrance to a place of employment or blocks use of roads , railways , or airports . Lawmakers introduced the bill as teachers across the state threatened to go on strike for higher wages and increased education funding . After the bill received immediate , widespread criticism in the days following its introduction , a Senate committee voted to postpone it indefinitely , and its sponsors said they would withdraw it .

The order establishes a state of emergency in Alachua County for seven days , until October 23 , 2017 . The bill also eliminates civil liability for a driver who unintentionally injures or kills a protestor interfering with traffic during an unpermitted protest or demonstration . As originally introduced , Senate Bill 339 would have created mandatory disciplinary sanctions that could be applied to peaceful protesters on college and university campuses . Amendments to the bill removed the provisions related to specific sanctions , prior to the bill 's passage by the Senate . These provisions were removed , however , in the version of the bill approved by the House of Representatives and sent to the Governor on April 10 , 2017 . Commission of domestic terrorism as defined by the bill would be a felony punishable by prison sentences ranging from five years to life .
