TOM STROMME , TRIBUNE Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Buffalo from the David Meyer ranches in North Dakota and South Dakota remain under quarantine following the illegal use of a poison used to kill prairie dogs . The adult buffalo are under quarantine until September , though yearlings were released from the no-sale hold on Jan. 1 . The situation dates to April , when six dead bald eagles and dead bison were discovered at the former Wilder Ranch . An Environmental Protection Agency-led investigation found that 40,000 pounds of Rozol poison had been illegally distributed across more than 5,400 acres on both ranches , according to EPA documents . As recently as November , the Fischers told authorities 14 bison were missing or dead at the Cannonball Ranch , near where an anti-Dakota Access pipeline protest has been active since August . Bay said he believes all 14 were most likely butchered and their remains were found in the Cannonball Ranch pastures adjacent to the protest area west of N.D. Highway 1806 . He said the dead bison belonged to both the Fischers and Meyer . Meyer did not return two calls for comment on this story . Beverly Fischer said all the bison sold at the recent auction belonged to them , or to their cosigners , not to Meyer . Fischers have no animals at Cannonball Ranch . David Meyer owns all buffalo at the ranch . We have no interest there anymore . The company bought the ranch to facilitate construction of the pipeline . Hundreds and at times thousands of protesters have demonstrated against the pipeline and have occupied nearby encampments . Documents show that only one 80-acre pasture was illegally laced with the Rozol on the Cannonball Ranch out of a bigger spread of about 7,000 acres . Nearly all was spread around various pastures at the former Wilder Ranch , where the dead eagles were documented . Instead of being applied into the prairie dog burrows , the bright blue poison pellets were broadcast on the ground , according to EPA findings . Dead prairie dogs were left where they died instead of being regularly removed to protect other wildlife . Dead bison were also found as recently as August , documents said . The poison causes animals to bleed to death . The documents also note that Meyer did not have proper pesticide certification to apply the Rozol . Meanwhile , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service awaits lab results of whether the eagles definitively died of Rozol ingestion and federal charges could be brought in the matter , says agency investigator Rich Grosz . The EPA ordered Meyer to till the Rozol into the soil and to monitor the area for dead animals . Because of concerns of human consumption of Rozol-infected meat , the order prevents Meyer from selling the adult bison until Sept. 1 and then only after consulting a veterinarian and the EPA .
