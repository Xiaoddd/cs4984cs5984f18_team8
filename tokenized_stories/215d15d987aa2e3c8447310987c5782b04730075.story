By Jordan Darville Photographer Sara Lafleur-Vetter February 10 , 2017 Share Tweet A drum circle at Standing Rock in December 2016 . The Federal Bureau of Investigation has directed agents handling terrorism prevention to investigate a number of activists involved in the Dakota Access Pipeline protests at Standing Rock , The Guardian writes in an extensive new report . Their line of inquiries and the scope of the investigation is not yet known , and the F.B.I. declined comment to The Guardian . Each protector refused to do so . All of the visits were conducted after President Donald Trump 's inauguration , Regan said . Last week , Trump signed an executive order resuming construction the Dakota Access Pipeline after protests forced the Obama administration to halt construction in 2016 . On Wednesday , drilling beneath the Missouri river resumed . Regan believes that allegations of protestor violence by the Dakota police led to the F.B.I. 's investigation , which may have began in November 2016 when F.B.I. officers visited Sophia Wilansky , an environmental activist who was severely injured at the Standing Rock protests by what witnesses claim was a police concussion grenade -LRB- police say activists set off the explosion -RRB- . The F.B.I. has a long history of persecuting civil rights and activists groups . COINTELPRO was launched in 1956 by F.B.I. director J. Edgar Hoover to target domestic political groups . Martin Luther King Jr. was a prolific target , and Black Panther leader Fred Hampton was assassinated in a COINTELPRO-sponsored raid . The agency was condemned after the program 's dissolution in 1971 in a report from the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations .
