The Native Nations Rise movement will bring a teepee encampment along with speakers and cultural workshops to the National Mall next to the Washington Monument . The march , which is being led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe , the Indigenous Environmental Network and the Native Organizers Alliance , follows a years-long battle by the Standing Rock Sioux and environmentalists against construction of the Dakota Access pipeline . Protests against the pipeline last year drew Indians from hundreds of tribes to the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota and sparked a resurgence of the indigenous rights movement . But President Trump greenlighted its completion with an executive order soon after taking office in January . Standing Rock Sioux chairman David Archambault II traveled to Washington last month expecting to meet with a White House official to make his case for stopping the pipeline but learned that a final decision to go ahead with it had been made while he was en route . While construction on the final phase of the pipeline continues , tribes remain hopeful they can stop it in court . On Tuesday , a federal judge denied a preliminary injunction request by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe to halt construction on religious grounds . That ruling is expected in April .
