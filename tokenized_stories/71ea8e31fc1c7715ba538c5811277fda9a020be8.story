In an early sign of things to come , the president showed his faith in big oil when he signed documents Tuesday pressuring federal agencies to support construction of the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines . Each of these projects faced enormous protests and was put on hold by the Obama administration because of legitimate environmental and due process concerns . Congressional Republicans frequently howled at far less heavy-handed exercises of executive power under the previous administration . Keystone XL would run on top of the Ogallala Aquifer , a vast multi-state underground reservoir that provides water to millions of Americans , including many Native American tribes , across the midwest . Part of the Dakota Access pipeline would run under Lake Oahe , a major water source for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota . Consultation with Native American tribes in the construction of both pipelines has been feeble . Instead , they were subjected to an excessive law enforcement crackdown in North Dakota in late October . Water hoses and pepper spray were turned on civilians in freezing temperatures . Police in riot gear fired beanbag rounds into crowds . These civil rights abuses contributed to the decision by Obama officials to halt Dakota Access construction , until a complete environmental and legal review could be conducted . This review represented the greatest hope in years for a return to the principle that Native American tribes must be consulted , not merely notified , before major federal actions affecting them are undertaken . That principle is now being scrapped by the Trump administration in the name of temporary job creation . This is self-defeating . These actions are part and parcel of a larger delusion . We simply can not hope to keep building oil pipelines , opening dirty factories and digging coal mines in perpetuity . The George W Bush years offered a direct , real-world refutation of the idea that we can pollute our way to prosperity . Indeed , the Obama job market far outpaced the Bush years despite Republican alarms about environmental regulations .
