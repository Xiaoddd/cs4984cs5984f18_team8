I have been called to join my brothers and sisters and fellow veterans at Standing Rock the week of December 4th . I will be traveling with two of my Muckleshoot warrior sisters . Our goal is to draw global attention to the peaceable efforts to protect the sacred water and land against the Dakota Access Pipeline . Our goal is also to give support and protection to our relatives who have given so much of themselves for this cause . We must stand together in prayer and ceremony . I have generously been offered a place among the Fort Peck Assiniboine Veterans , thanks to cousin Lance Elliot FourStar who organized thier deployment and has alrady raised funds for tents and stoves . I want to be sure I am prepared for what lies ahead of me so that I can give as much of myself as possible to the cause . I will use the funds to purchase the necessary sub-zero clothing , sleeping gear and other necessities for our tents . We 'll also be bringing an SUV full of firewood , traditional medicines , down & wool clothing & blankets and other needed items all of which I will donate before I leave . All excess funds will be used to purchase the most needed supplies for the camp . Those who know me understand how much this means to me , and what this means for all of us . Not everyone can be there in person , but your prayers and support go a long long way . Anything you can spare is greatly appreciated and adds strength to the cause . Thank you , thank you , thank you . We arrived safe and sound the day the easement was denied and got to celebrate with the rest of camp , while passing out several of the donation items you sent . The next day we attended the Veterans forgiveness ceremony at the Casino Pavilion , where we ended up snowed in by the blizzard for three days . Luckily we had the rest of your generous gifts and the much needed items we 'd purchased with your donations which were used to provide warmth , food and medicine to the elders , children and veterans that were rescued from the elements at camp and brought to the Pavilion . I know the ancestors were looking over all of us in those moments . Each and every item and prayer you sent was received with gratitude and a sense of unity . We learned a lot and made lasting connections with people from all over the world . You all helped me see just how true it is that , together , we are strong . Together we can do anything . I 'll be posting more of the story with photos on my Facebook page since I am limited here , but I just want to finish by saying how amazing you all are and that I hope you felt the love , gratitude and connection being returned to you . I am proud to be connected to each of you . Together we are strong . We are preparing to leave on Saturday and your contributions will bring much needed warmth to our Veterans .
