The news from the natural world these days is mostly about water , and understandably so . We hear about the record-setting amounts of water that Hurricane Harvey dumped on Houston and other Gulf cities and towns , mixing with petrochemicals to pollute and poison on an unfathomable scale . Yet for large parts of North America , Europe , and Africa , this summer has not been about water at all . For millions of people from California to Greenland , Oregon to Portugal , British Columbia to Montana , Siberia to South Africa , the summer of 2017 has been the summer of fire . For years , climate scientists have warned us that a warming world is an extreme world , in which humanity is buffeted by both brutalizing excesses and stifling absences of the core elements that have kept fragile life in equilibrium for millennia . Reachable only by ferry or floatplane , this is the part of the world where my parents live , where my son was born , and where my grandparents died . Though it still feels like home , we now only get here for a few weeks a year . The government of Canada weather site predicted that the next week would be glorious : an uninterrupted block of sun , clear skies , and higher than average temperatures . I pictured hot afternoons paddling in the Pacific and still , starry nights . But when we arrive in early August , a murky blanket of white has engulfed the coast and the temperature is cool enough for a sweater . Forecasts are often wrong , but this is more complicated . Somewhere up there , above the muck , the sky is clear of clouds . The sun is particularly hot . Enough smoke to transform the sun itself into an angry pinpoint of red fire surrounded by a strange halo , unable to burn through the relentless haze . Enough smoke to blot out the stars . Enough smoke to absorb any possible sunsets . At the end of the day , the red ball abruptly disappears , only to be replaced by a strange burnt-orange moon . The smoke has created its own weather system , powerful enough to transform the climate not just where we are , but in a stretch of territory that appears to cover roughly 100,000 square miles . And the smoke , a giant smudge on the satellite images , respects no borders : not only is about a third of British Columbia choked , but so are large parts of the Pacific Northwest , including Seattle , Bellingham , and Portland , Oregon . Up and down the coast , the government has issued air quality warnings , urging people to avoid strenuous activity . Beyond a certain threshold , fine particulate matter in the air is officially unsafe , bad enough to cause health problems . The air in parts of Vancouver is three times above that safe threshold , with some smaller communities on the coast significantly worse off . One local official recommends a trip to the mall . Smoke from wildfires burning in central British Columbia shrouds the north shore of Kamloops on Monday July 10 , 2017 . Anything over 25 micrograms of fine particulates per cubic meter is considered unsafe . Kamloops , the city currently housing many of the evacuees , averages 684.5 micrograms per cubic meter . That rivals Beijing on some of its very worst days . Airlines cancel flights , and people suffering from breathing problems reportedly pack emergency rooms . Since this disaster began , some 840 separate fires have ignited , forcing , at this point , some 50,000 people to evacuate their homes , according to the Red Cross . In early July , the government declared a rare state of emergency and by the time we arrive , it has already been extended twice . Hundreds of structures have been razed , some whole communities , including indigenous reserves , have been mostly reduced to ash . So far , roughly 1,800 square miles of forest , farm , and grassland have burned . I call a friend in Kamloops . Which puts things into perspective for us on the coast . I wrote a book in a blur , then toured with it . And my husband Avi and I helped start a new political organization . It was the finish line -LRB- albeit a temporary one -RRB- , and we fully planned to collapse on it . It was also the way we kept our 5-year-old son Toma in the game . On cold nights in the east , we mapped out the forested walks we would take , the canoe trips , the swims . We imagined the blackberries we would pick , the crumbles we would bake ; we listed the grandparents , aunts , uncles , cousins , and old friends we would visit . By evening , I announce that it will blow over by morning , revealing at least a glimpse of actual sky . For the first week , I greet each day hopefully , convinced that the drab light peeking through the curtains is just morning mist . Every day I am wrong . The placid weather forecast that seemed so promising before we traveled turns out to be a curse . Sunny , windless days mean that the smoke , once it is upon us , parks over our heads like an unmoveable outdoor ceiling . Day after day after day . My allergies are going nuts . I bath my eyes in drops and pop antihistamines well beyond the recommended dosage . Toma breaks out in hives so severe he needs steroids . I keep taking my glasses off and cleaning them , rubbing them first with my shirt , then a microfiber cloth , then proper glass cleaner . Nothing helps . Nothing makes the smudge disappear . Smoke obscures the sun as a helicopter carrying a bucket battles the Gustafsen wildfire near 100 Mile House , British Columbia , on Saturday July 8 , 2017 . Life beyond the smoke starts to seem like a rumor . I learned to love the steely beauty , the infinite shades of grey chiseled in the mountains . The low sky and the movement of the mist . But this is different . Smoke is a little different . In part because you know that you are not breathing pollution from power plants or exhaust from cars but rather trees that were very recently alive . You are breathing in forest . I decide that the animals are depressed . The seals seem to pop their heads up in a purely utilitarian fashion , just to take a breath and then disappear again beneath the gray surface . They do not play . The eagles , I am convinced , are flying for function , not fun , no soaring or wind surfing . I email a friend in Seattle , a prominent environmentalist , to ask him how he is faring in the smoke . He reports that the birds have stopped singing , and he is mad all the time . Old Forest in Spipyus Provincial Park , Sechelt Peninsula , Sunshine Coast , British Columbia . It begins to strike me how precarious it all is , this business of not being on fire . This part of British Columbia , technically a temperate rainforest , is a tinderbox . So far this summer , less than half an inch of rain has fallen . The forest groundcover , usually moist and squishy , is yellow and desiccated and crunches underfoot . You can smell the flammability . The roads are lined with yellow signs announcing a total ban on open fires . Every time we turn on the radio , we hear warnings , increasingly frantic , about open fires , cigarettes tossed out of cars , and fireworks . Two years ago , a serious blaze threatened part of the coast about 20 minutes from here , taking the life of a local man who was helping to fight the flames . The Sunshine Coast has a year-round population of 30,000 people served by a single highway that ends in a ferry dock . I ask local friends . They look worried and talk about who has which kind of boat . Honesto Silva Ibarra came to the U.S. from Mexico on a temporary H-2A visa to work through the harvest season . He was 28 years old and had been picking blueberries at Sarbanand Farms , owned by California-based Munger Farms , when he started feeling sick . Some workers had fainted on the job , they told reporters . The company also claims it did all it could to save him . Investigations are ongoing . After Silva was hospitalized , workers staged a one-day strike to demand answers and better conditions . Sixty-six of them were immediately fired for insubordination . They found themselves without means to get home to Mexico and without payment for their final days of work . But they did not get their much-needed jobs back . Munger supplies Walmart , Whole Foods , Safeway , and Costco . North of the border , there are similar reports of temporary farmworkers fainting and becoming sick on the job , with smoke apparently playing a role . And advocates point out that , rather than being looked after , their sponsoring employers often send sick workers home like defective goods . A wildfire burns south of Fort McMurray , Alberta , near Highway 63 on Saturday , May 7 , 2016 . They take pre-existing divides and deepen them further , so the people who were already getting most screwed over before the disaster get extra doses of pain during and after . We know a fair bit about how that looks during storms , such as Katrina , Sandy , Harvey , and Irma . We understand less about fire . They were promptly sent home . We also know , as with floods , that our media gives far more coverage to house pets rescued from wildfires in the U.S. and Canada than it does to the human lives lost because of infernos in , say , Indonesia and Chile . A global 2012 study estimated that more than 300,000 people die annually as a result of smoke and the air pollution from wildfires , mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia . And in British Columbia this summer , we learned still more about the way inequalities play out against a burning backdrop . Several indigenous leaders raised concerns that during fire emergencies , their communities do not receive the same level of urgent response as non-indigenous communities , whether for fighting the flames or for rebuilding afterward . In at least one case , the police responded by threatening to come in and remove children from their families , words with traumatic reverberations in a country that not so long ago systematically took indigenous children from their homes as a matter of policy . In the end , no First Nations homes were raided and many were saved because of self-organized firefighting . The moon sets at dawn behind clouds of smoke over charred hills after strong winds fed the Harris Fire on October 25 , 2007 , near the U.S.-Mexico border south of Portrero , California . Around here , people take full moons seriously ; there are drug-fueled dance parties in the forest , and late-night kayak excursions , taking advantage of the extra light . We set out to collect them . With so little rain and such a weak sun to warm them , even the ripest berries are sour . Toma quickly loses interest and refuses to try any more . We come home with shin scratches and an empty bucket . In fact , we spend at least an hour or two a day walking through the stands of moss-covered cedars and Douglas firs , breathing in the super-oxygenated air . I love these forests and have never taken their primordial beauty for granted . For not joining their burning brethren . For sticking with us , despite our failings . At least so far . Tourists to Banff National Park in Alberta take photos of Mt. Rundle and the Vermillion lakes as smoke from a forest fire in Kootenay National Park in British Columbia blankets the area , Sunday July 16 , 2017 . Not these precise airborne particles , of course , but smoke from many of the same wildfires . And the odd thing is , I breathed it in some 570 miles east of here , in another province entirely . I spent mid-July in Alberta , helping teach a course on environmental reporting at the Banff Centre for the Arts . This time , too , the forecast had looked perfect : sunny , clear , warm . This time , too , the forecast was usurped from the first day by a smoke-cast , a haze that obscured the spectacular mountains in Banff National Park and provoked air quality warnings , headaches , and a catch in the throat . Back in July , the winds were blowing east , which is why the Rockies were getting a face-full of smoke . It kept traveling eastward , reaching well into the center of the continent , to Saskatchewan and Manitoba and down to North Dakota and Montana -LRB- NASA released a striking picture of the 500-mile long plume -RRB- . Then , just as my family was heading to coastal British Columbia , the winds abruptly shifted and started blowing the plume westward , with the Rocky Mountains now acting like a giant tennis racket , lobbing the smoke to the Pacific . A wider satellite view of two large forest fires on July 7 , 2015 , in North Vancouver , British Columbia . Even devastating hurricanes like Harvey tend to concentrate their impacts in a contained geography . And the event -LRB- though not the aftermath -RRB- is relatively brief . These fires , which rage for months , are of a different order entirely . There are the direct impacts of the fires . The huge swath of land charred . The tens of thousands of lives overturned by evacuation orders . The lost homes and farms and cattle . And then there are the less direct impacts of all that wandering smoke . Over July and August , the smoke from this conflagration covered an area spanning roughly 700,000 square miles . All touched by this one fast-moving disaster . And this is just one snapshot of a much larger season of fire . The fire in Los Angeles was the largest ever recorded within city limits ; a fire-related state of emergency was declared for every single county in Washington state . In Montana , a wildfire named the Lodgepole Complex burned some 425 square miles of territory , making it the third-largest blaze in the settled history of the region . This is part of a broader increase in both the numbers of fires and the months during which they burn : Since the 1970s , fire season in the United States has lengthened by 105 days , according to an analysis by Climate Central . Hundreds of homes have burned in Siberia . In June in South Africa , the same storm caused flooding in Cape Town and fanned the flames of unprecedented deadly wildfires in nearby towns . Even Greenland , that icy place , saw large and unusual wildfires this summer . Burned vehicles sit in the glow of the full moon on Highway 138 in Phelan as the Blue Cut fire continues to ravage San Bernardino County , Calif. , on Aug. 18 , 2016 . Another is the perennially hubristic attempt to re-engineer natural forces far more powerful than we are . Many indigenous cultures have long used fire as a key part of land care . But in North America , modern forest management has systematically supressed cyclical fires in order to protect profitable trees that were headed for sawmills , as well as out of fear that small fires could spread to inhabited areas -LRB- and there are more and more inhabited areas -RRB- . Without regular natural burns , forests are chock-full of fuel , provoking fires to burn out of control . There is compelling evidence that the bark beetle epidemic has been exacerbated by climate change-related heat and drought . Indeed , these forces have conspired to turn forests into perfectly laid campfires , with the dry earth acting like balled-up newspaper , the dead trees serving as kindling , and the added heat providing the match . Mike Flannigan , a University of Alberta wildfire expert , is blunt . And according to a 2010 study , fire occurrence in Canada is projected to increase by 75 percent by the end of the century . Ever since we left Alberta , his 5-year-old mind has been struggling to understand the smoke that has marked his summer . Trying to make sense of my chronic cough and his raging skin rash . Struggling , most of all , with the soundtrack of worried chatter among the grown-ups in his life . His response goes through phases : Nightmares wake him up at night . Then his grandfather explained that the sun had turned into that weird , glowing dot because the forest itself was on fire . He was stricken . A coyote walks across U.S. Highway 120 , shut down due to the Rim Fire on August 23 , 2013 near Groveland , Calif. . We have developed techniques for controlling worry . They begin with taking deep breaths , and we do it several times a day . But it occurs to me that breathing extra amounts of this particular air is probably not great , especially for small lungs already prone to infection . What we do talk about is pollution , though on a scale he can understand . Like plastic , and why we have to pick it up and use less of it because it makes the animals sick . Or we look at the exhaust coming out of cars and trucks , and talk about how you can get power from the sun and the wind and store it in batteries . A little kid can grasp concepts like these and know exactly what should happen -LRB- better than plenty of adults -RRB- . This summer marks the end of his protection . He just heard too many adults obsessing over the strange sky , and the real reasons behind the fires , and he finally put it all together . At a playground in the haze , I meet a young mother who offers advice on how to reassure worried kids . I nod , feeling like a failed mom . Many are so hot and intransigent that they are leaving scorched earth behind . And just as my son fears , animals are losing their forested homes . The biggest danger , however , is the carbon being released as the forests burn . This dramatic increase of emissions is part of what climate scientists mean when they warn about feedback loops : burning carbon leads to warmer temperatures and long periods without rain , which leads to more fires , which release more carbon into the atmosphere , which leads to even warmer and drier conditions , and even more fires . Darkened ice absorbs more heat than reflective white ice , which makes the ice melt faster , which leads to sea level rise and the release of huge amounts of methane , which causes more warming and more fires , which in turn create more blackened ice and more melting . We settle for half-truths and fudging to make the nightmare subside . We talk about how we need to plant more trees for the animals to come home to . It helps , a little . Protesters attend a rally protesting against the approval of Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion in Vancouver , British Columbia , Nov. 29 , 2016 . The late Arthur Manuel , a former Secwepemc chief , was a dear friend and hosted me several times . The expanded network of pipes would pass through dozens of waterways on Secwepemc land , and is forcefully opposed by many traditional landholders . A statement was issued by the Secwepemc Working Group on Indigenous Food Sovereignty opposing the pipeline expansion project and demanding that the existing , smaller pipeline be shut down immediately to reduce the risk of a catastrophic accident should fire and oil meet . Worse , in true shock doctrine form , some extractive industries are actively using the fiery state of emergency to get stuff done that was impossible during normal times . For instance , Taseko Mines has been fighting for years to build a highly contentious , open pit gold and copper mine in one of the parts of British Columbia hit hardest by the fires . In its last week in office after suffering a humiliating election defeat , the government handed Taseko a raft of permits to move ahead with exploration . There is also a new provincial government , created through an unprecedented agreement between the center-left New Democratic Party and the Greens . In a rare piece of good climate news , it is actively challenging the legality of the Kinder Morgan pipeline project on several fronts . Yet anyone holding out hope that the fires might jolt Trudeau into serious climate action has been gravely disappointed . Never mind that Houston has since flooded and a third of his country is on fire . Trudeau is on fossil fuel autopilot and nothing , it seems , will make him swerve . Then there is President Donald Trump , whose climate crimes are too comprehensive and too layered to delineate here . Home foundations and skeletons of possesions are all that remain in parts of a residential neighborhood destroyed by a wildfire on May 7 , 2016 in Fort McMurray , Alberta . Wildfires , which are still burning out of control , have forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 residents from the town . Two homes , two fires , same guy . In both cases , only the fireplace and chimney remain . But there is no mention of climate change . This is notable because Schurman works as a site supervisor in the Alberta tar sands . Still , the reporter did not ask Schurman if losing two homes and nearly losing his son raised any questions for him about the industry in which he works -LRB- one of the only sectors in Canada or the U.S. still paying salaries that afford middle-class lives -RRB- . When Vice picked up the irresistible story , the reporter did raise climate change with Schurman , which he acknowledged could be one of the factors contributing to these infernos . People walk near dark brown stains of beached oil in Gulf Shores , Ala. , Saturday , June 5 , 2010 . The soft-focus quality the smoke casts over life here seems to make this collective denial more acute . Smoke , after all , is not fire . You can live with it , if less well . You get used to it . We bring beers and ciders to the beach and remark that , on the upside , you barely need sunscreen at all . Sitting on the beach under that fake , milky sky , I suddenly flash to those images of families sunning themselves on oil-soaked beaches in the midst of the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster . And it hits me : They are us . Refusing to let a wildfire interfere with our family vacation . During disasters , you hear a lot of praise for human resilience . And we are a remarkably resilient species . It seems we can get used to almost anything , even the steady annihilation of our own habitat . A huge plume of smoke from wildfires burning rises over Fort McMurray in this aerial photograph taken in Alberta , Canada , on Friday , May 6 , 2016 . The piece focuses on a method often referred to as solar radiation management , which would see sulfur dioxide sprayed into the stratosphere to create a barrier between the Earth and the sun , forcibly lowering temperatures . Yeah , that would be a bummer . Now imagine a scenario in which men , like Trump , Narendra Modi , and Kim Jong-un , were empowered to deploy these climate-altering technologies like unconventional weapons , hurtling us into an era of undeclared weather wars in which one country sacrifices the precipitation of another in order to save its crops , and the other retaliates by unleashing mega-floods . Some would-be planet hackers insist these worst-case risks can be managed . All concede to lesser downsides , however . Spraying sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere would almost certainly create a permanent milky-white haze , making clear blue skies a thing of the past for the entire planet . The haze might well prevent astronomers from seeing the stars and planets clearly , and weaker sunlight could reduce the capacity of solar power generators to produce energy . But it is something else entirely to read about the prospect of deliberately dimming the sky under a sky that is already artificially dimmed with omnipresent smoke casting a literal pall over daily life . Losing the sky is no small thing . We just saw ourselves , more detritus of our own broken system . I hear myself suggesting to Avi that we should just drive north until we hit clean air . We stay put . The Wind Changes Almost two full weeks into the smoke-out , something shifts . I hear it first , and then I see branches moving : wind . A sudden temperature drop . And by noon , actual patches of blue , separated by clouds . Crisp . I feel like that . The next day brings rain ; not a lot , but enough to hope for some relief for the 2,400 exhausted and overworked firefighters . My allergies clear up , and Toma starts sleeping through the night again . But the news from the interior is disastrous . The same wind that finally pried loose the blanket of smoke on the coast has been fanning the flames at the epicenter of the fires . The stillness that trapped the smoke here for so long turns out to have been the only bright spot for the fire brigades . Over the next week , British Columbia blazes through the record books . By mid-August , the fires break the provincial record for the most land burned in one year : 3,453 square miles . We have clear skies , a near-perfect viewing location , and I know , in theory , that what is about to happen is a natural wonder . We only just got it back . I spend the eclipse sitting outside alone , staring at the horizon , clinging to the dying light . A week after , neo-Nazis marched with torches in Charlottesville , Virginia , and with so much of the world engulfed in actual infernos , this sudden dimming of our world just feels too damn literal . Smoke from wildfires fills the air in this aerial view from a Canadian Forces Chinook helicopter as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau views areas affected by wildfire near Williams Lake , British Columbia , on Monday , July 31 , 2017 . Extremely hot , dry , and windy weather has conspired to create the conditions for a slew of large , new wildfires to ignite and for old ones to expand exponentially . Authorities announce new evacuations daily ; at last count , some 60,000 displaced people had registered as evacuees with Red Cross over the course of the summer . The state of emergency has been extended for the fourth time . Then there are the headline-grabbing blazes in Los Angeles , the state of emergency in Washington state , and new evacuations ordered , from Glacier National Park to northern Manitoba . I do know this : Our collective house is on fire , with every alarm going off simultaneously , clanging desperately for our attention . Those are the questions still hanging in the air at the end of this summer of smoke . Research : Sharon J. Riley Top photo : Smoke rises in front of the sun as a wildfire burns near Little Fort , British Columbia . Tuesday , July 11 , 2017 .

The expanded network of pipes would pass through dozens of waterways on Secwepemc land , and is forcefully opposed by many traditional landholders . For instance , Taseko Mines has been fighting for years to build a highly contentious , open pit gold and copper mine in one of the parts of British Columbia hit hardest by the fires . to move ahead with exploration . and the company has already been forced to suspend its drilling plans in the face of legal troubles . anyone holding out hope that the fires might jolt Trudeau into serious climate action has been gravely disappointed . Never mind that Houston has since flooded and a third of his country is on fire . there is President Donald Trump , whose climate crimes are too comprehensive and too layered to delineate here . Wildfires , which are still burning out of control , have forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 residents from the town . Two homes , two fires , same guy . a lot of moving detail in the story about the human wreckage these disasters leave behind : the endless paperwork , traumatic memories , and family stress . But there is no mention of climate change . This is notable because Schurman works as a site supervisor in the Alberta tar sands . Still , the reporter did not ask Schurman if losing two homes and nearly losing his son raised any questions for him about the industry in which he works -LRB- one of the only sectors in Canada or the U.S. still paying salaries that afford middle-class lives -RRB- . picked up the irresistible story , the reporter did raise climate change with Schurman , which he acknowledged could be one of the factors contributing to these infernos . Oil from the Deepwater Horizon disaster has started washing ashore on the Alabama and Florida coast beaches . The soft-focus quality the smoke casts over life here seems to make this collective denial more acute . after all , is not fire . You can live with it , if less well . And it hits me : They are us . disasters , you hear a lot of praise for human resilience . And we are a remarkably resilient species . The wildfires ravaging Canada 's oil hub in northern Alberta have rapidly spread to an area bigger than New York city , prompting the air lift of more than 8,000 evacuees as firefighters seek to salvage critical infrastructure . Yeah , that would be a bummer . would-be planet hackers insist these worst-case risks can be managed . All concede to lesser downsides , however . Spraying sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere would almost certainly create a permanent milky-white haze , making clear blue skies a thing of the past for the entire planet . We just saw ourselves , more detritus of our own broken system . hear myself suggesting to Avi that we should just drive north until we hit clean air . I hear it first , and then I see branches moving : wind . A sudden temperature drop . And by noon , actual patches of blue , separated by clouds . Crisp . The same wind that finally pried loose the blanket of smoke on the coast has been fanning the flames at the epicenter of the fires . The stillness that trapped the smoke here for so long turns out to have been the only bright spot for the fire brigades . We have clear skies , a near-perfect viewing location , and I know , in theory , that what is about to happen is a natural wonder . spend the eclipse sitting outside alone , staring at the horizon , clinging to the dying light . wildfires to ignite and for old ones to expand exponentially . Authorities announce new evacuations daily ; at last count , some 60,000 displaced people had registered as evacuees with Red Cross over the course of the summer . I do know this : Our collective house is on fire , with every alarm going off simultaneously , clanging desperately for our attention . Tuesday , July 11 , 2017 .
