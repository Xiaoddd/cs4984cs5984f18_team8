Story TOpics Environment Law enforcement enters the Oceti Sakowin camp to begin arresting Dakota Access Pipeline protesters in Morton County , Thursday , Feb. 23 , 2017 , near Cannon Ball , N.D. Trinity Analysis & Development Corp. , a waste-management company hired by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , has been working at the site since Thursday , when the last of the anti-pipeline protesters was evacuated from the camp on a federal floodplain . The Standing Rock Sioux had been leading a cleanup effort for several weeks before Trinity arrived at the site near Cannon Ball , North Dakota . The contractor based in Shalimar , Florida , also is expected to clear the Rosebud and Sacred Stone camps . The Sacred Stone is located on private land within the Standing Rock reservation . Crews are racing to clear the camps before the snowmelt washes trash , waste and debris into the Cannonball River . Activists have argued that the trash left behind pales by comparison to the threat of an oil pipeline running below Lake Oahe , but the protesters also have been accused of hypocrisy for failing to live by their environmentalist credo . Foes of the pipeline have cited concerns about the potential damage to water quality from the threat of a rupture , while Energy Transfer Partners has insisted that the state-of-the-art oil pipeline is safe and has received all necessary state and federal permits .
