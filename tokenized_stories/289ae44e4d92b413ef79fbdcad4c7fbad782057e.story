Indian Treaties and the Removal Act of 1830 The U.S. Government used treaties as one means to displace Indians from their tribal lands , a mechanism that was strengthened with the Removal Act of 1830 . In cases where this failed , the government sometimes violated both treaties and Supreme Court rulings to facilitate the spread of European Americans westward across the continent . Andrew Jackson As the 19th century began , land-hungry Americans poured into the backcountry of the coastal South and began moving toward and into what would later become the states of Alabama and Mississippi . Since Indian tribes living there appeared to be the main obstacle to westward expansion , white settlers petitioned the federal government to remove them . Although Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe argued that the Indian tribes in the Southeast should exchange their land for lands west of the Mississippi River , they did not take steps to make this happen . Indeed , the first major transfer of land occurred only as the result of war . Over the next decade , Jackson led the way in the Indian removal campaign , helping to negotiate nine of the eleven major treaties to remove Indians . The appetite of the settlers for land would not abate , so the Indians adopted a strategy of appeasement . They hoped that if they gave up a good deal of their land , they could keep at least some a part of it . To achieve his purpose , Jackson encouraged Congress to adopt the Removal Act of 1830 . The Act established a process whereby the President could grant land west of the Mississippi River to Indian tribes that agreed to give up their homelands . As incentives , the law allowed the Indians financial and material assistance to travel to their new locations and start new lives and guaranteed that the Indians would live on their new property under the protection of the United States Government forever . With the Act in place , Jackson and his followers were free to persuade , bribe , and threaten tribes into signing removal treaties and leaving the Southeast . The Trail of Tears -LRB- Robert Lindneux , 1942 -RRB- The Cherokee Nation resisted , however , challenging in court the Georgia laws that restricted their freedoms on tribal lands . However , the following year the Supreme Court reversed itself and ruled that Indian tribes were indeed sovereign and immune from Georgia laws . He obtained the signature of a Cherokee chief agreeing to relocation in the Treaty of New Echota , which Congress ratified against the protests of Daniel Webster and Henry Clay in 1835 . The Cherokee signing party represented only a faction of the Cherokee , and the majority followed Principal Chief John Ross in a desperate attempt to hold onto their land . This attempt faltered in 1838 , when , under the guns of federal troops and Georgia state militia , the Cherokee tribe were forced to the dry plains across the Mississippi . With the exception of a small number of Seminoles still resisting removal in Florida , by the 1840s , from the Atlantic to the Mississippi , no Indian tribes resided in the American South . Through a combination of coerced treaties and the contravention of treaties and judicial determination , the United States Government succeeded in paving the way for the westward expansion and the incorporation of new territories as part of the United States .
