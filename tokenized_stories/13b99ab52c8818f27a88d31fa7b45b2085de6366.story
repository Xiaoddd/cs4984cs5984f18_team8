Many of those campaigns accepted money without necessarily offering accountability , either to their donors or to the causes they claimed to represent . In the case of Veterans Stand , chaos and disarray become the hallmarks of a campaign that initially galvanized thousands of veterans and inspired more than 26,000 people from around the world to donate . That money was , at best , squandered and at worst , egregiously misspent . Last month , the hedge fund ordered 30 jobs trimmed from a news-gathering operation that already had fewer than 100 journalists . Mr. Weiss said several wealthy Coloradans had emerged as potential investors , including Perry Sanders , a hotel owner , and John Street , a technology entrepreneur . It was unclear how much money would be needed to buy the newspaper or whether Alden Global Capital would consider selling it . My study makes it clear that newspapers can both perform the watchdog role and turn a profit . Numerous papers I studied for my book actually saw their circulation increase and their financial fortunes improve after they re-dedicated themselves to the watchdog role . But this takes a certain level of funding and staffing to ensure reporters get the time and resources they need to dig out information . Alden Global Capital , the owner of The Denver Post and 96 other newspapers , should take note . While newspapers have to watch the bottom line , there is much more at stake here . Nothing newspapers do is more important than keeping the powerful in check . The new research , published in a pair of studies in the journal Earth Interactionslate last month , found the divide is created by three factors : the Rocky Mountains stopping moisture from the Pacific Ocean reaching farther inland , Atlantic winter storms bringing moisture to the eastern half of the U.S. , and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico moving north and curving eastward during the summer months . The only other clear , straight divide between humid and arid areas on the globe is the one separating the Sahara Desert from the rest of Africa , climate scientist Richard Seager of Columbia University , lead author of the new papers , said in a statement . Reveal has obtained new drafts of the report that show a higher-ranking NPS official deleted references to the human causes of climate change . Meanwhile , House Democrats grilled Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on the matter this week . Hoffman , a career Park Service manager , is listed as an author of the report . For example , in the executive summary , Hoffman removed a phrase that explains that humans are causing the sea level rise and storm surge that imperils parks . Some veterans of the National Park Service were disappointed to hear about the edits . Mike Soukup was a scientist at the National Park Service for three decades and rose to be the associate director with responsibility for science and natural resources from 1995 to 2007 . He recalled having to stand up to political appointees who wanted to change scientific reports . Wyo. . The reason managers missed the mark , Wyoming Game and Fish Department wolf biologist Ken Mills said , is that there were more wolves than expected . Hunters would have been allowed to target more wolves , he said , if those animals were identified ahead of an annual report that informs hunting seasons . The most significant changes came in areas where Wyoming authorizes hunting , where the population fell from 285 to 238 . Another 40 of the large canines roamed the remainder of Wyoming , where wolves are managed as pests and can be killed indiscriminately . In both areas combined , 77 wolves were killed last year . Wildlife mangers counted 347 wolves running in 53 packs in Wyoming at the end of 2017 . At the same time , the global climate movement has put increasing pressure on national governments and corporations to begin cutting their emissions and moving away from fossil fuels . But as the report by RBN Energy and another by Deloitte show , the two factors are becoming intertwined . Canadian oil trades at a lower price than most American crude , adding to costs for oil sands producers , and that discount has surged in recent months , driven in part by tight pipeline capacity . The cancellation of Trans Mountain would likely continue that trend . Supreme Court case tests weight of old Native American treaties in 21st century On April 18 , the United States Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Washington v. Wyoming 's first large solar farm edges forward Wyoming 's first large solar farm may come to Green River soon .
