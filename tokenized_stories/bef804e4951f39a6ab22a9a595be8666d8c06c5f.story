While the 176,400-gallon leak is nothing to sneeze at , it is only the sixth worst spill of the year . The Missouri River is a major source of drinking water . The Belle Fourche Pipeline is operated by True Companies . But critics have been quick to point out that this spill is not the worst of 2016 . Oil prices in the Southeast surged and motorists endured long lines and shortages after the leak resulted in disruption and left the pipeline out of service until late September . The disaster was largely contained , as gasoline was released into a retention pond . There were no deaths or injuries related to the leak . However , the refined gas did head dangerously close to the Peel Creek , a tributary of the Cahaba River , according to the Weather Channel . However , this would be the last time Shelby County caught a break in 2016 , as the Colonial Pipeline would later catch a literal one . There were no deaths or injuries resulting from the leak or fire , and as a result , it occurred quietly with little incident or coverage . Six workers were on the pipeline when a dirt-moving track hoe struck and created a massive fire that left one worker dead at the scene . Another later died of his injuries . The four other workers were hospitalized , and none of the names of people involved have been released , per the Occupational Health and Safety Administration -LRB- OSHA -RRB- . But in October , a pipeline ruptured and sprayed the area with crude oil , a known cause of chemical pneumonia . There were no injuries or evacuations , so the spill was quietly cleaned up after it leaked some 307,734 gallons of crude oil . The pipeline had experienced problems less than a month earlier , according to United Press International and Plains All American Pipeline had reported infrastructure based problems in early October . The pipeline was just over a year old at the time and numerous news outlets reported only 33,000 gallons of crude oil spilling as a result . However , the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration reported an initial release of 8,600 barrels of crude oil with only 1,560 barrels being recovered . The company had already been fined for violating welding practices on the line , and federal regulations issued a Corrective Action Order to Sunoco to fix the pipeline , Reuters reported . Editor 's Note : A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- ETP -RRB- is the owner of the North Dakota pipeline . It is in fact owned by True Companies .
