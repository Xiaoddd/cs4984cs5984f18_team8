Posted on September 5 , 2016 by Bonnie Walker 5 Comments September 4 , 2016 until all is rectified or you leave office Dear President Obama -LRB- and Others who should be concerned -RRB- , First I would like to sincerely THANK YOU for commuting prison sentences to Federal Inmates who received unreasonable and wrongful sentencing for drug convictions . There are still so many who should have their sentences commuted . I started at day 167 , today is day 137 . Today as I write to you about Leonard I must include another very deep concern ; The Dakota Access Pipeline . As you may recall Joanie and I were among many others who pushed you on Twitter to deny the Keystone Pipeline ; which you very ThankFully did . I feel strongly that Joanie wants me to speak out for her on this topic as well . -LRB- other links are within this article -RRB- . As you are well aware one small breach in a pipeline can and has caused devastation to both land and water resulting in illnesses and deaths for all sorts of life forms . Leading up to 1975 , Pine Ridge Reservation , South Dakota . Mining Companies working for the U.S. Government find what they suspect to be rich pockets of uranium ore . Some Tribal Members are working with Government agents to force other Tribal Members to give up their land . There is violence against Traditional Elders , and others who refuse . Individuals are killed . Leonard Peltier comes to the aide of his People . You know the rest of the story . You all saw the community , You all met the people . I urge you to keep working for Native Americans and the rest of us by intervening and putting a stop to The Dakota Access Pipeline . I urge you to keep on track with supporting Positive Endeavors to minimize the devastating effects of Climate Change . As always I respectfully Thank You for Your Time and Consideration . In Peace . His application for clemency was submitted to President Obama dated February 17 , 2016 . I also believe that going against the FBI may not be an easy thing to do . They do not readily admit to wrong-doings . In January of this year , it was discovered that Leonard has an enlarged Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm ; these are potentially deadly . Treatment for this condition is surgery to correct the defect . Individuals who have an enlarged Aneurysm are in need of very close monitoring . This is not something that can happen while Leonard is in Prison . An Aneurysm can burst spontaneously at any time . When this happens the individual bleeds out . Literally every second counts . I also hope Leonard does not die before the time of clemency happens . You can see it here . Prayers with Action work best together if you can .
