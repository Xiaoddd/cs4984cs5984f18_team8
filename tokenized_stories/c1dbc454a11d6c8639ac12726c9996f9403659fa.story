Life-threatening wind chills and towering snow drifts could mean the greatest challenge is simple survival . The pipeline is largely complete except for a short segment that is planned to pass beneath a Missouri River reservoir . The company doing the building says it is unwilling to reroute the project . For several months , the government permitted the gathering , allowing its population to swell . The Seven Council Fires camp began growing in August as it took in the overflow crowd from smaller protest sites nearby . It now covers a half square mile , with living quarters that include old school buses , fancy motorhomes and domelike yurts . Hale bales are piled around some teepees to keep out the wind . The number of inhabitants has ranged from several hundred to several thousand . It has been called the largest gathering of Native American tribes in a century . Increasingly , more permanent wooden structures are being erected , even though the Army Corps of Engineers considers them illegal on government property . The Standing Rock Sioux insist the land still belongs to their tribe under a nearly 150-year-old treaty . He said he intends to stay indefinitely , a prospect that may cause him to lose his house in Nevada . Camp morale is high , he added , despite the onset of winter . People are taking the shirts off their own backs for other people . On Thursday , the camp near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers was shrouded in snow , much of it compacted by foot and vehicle traffic . Temperatures hovered in the 20s . Camp dwellers are getting ready for the hardships of a long stay . Mountains of donated food and water are being stockpiled , as is firewood , much of which has come from outside of North Dakota , the least-forested state in the nation . A collection of Army surplus tents with heating stoves serve as kitchen , dining hall , medical clinic and a camp-run school . Many of the smaller tents have become tattered by the wind . Tribes from the Great Plains states are adept at surviving brutal winters , he said . Others from warmer climes are being taught how to endure the frostbite-inducing temperatures that are sure to come . Reddog said she has confidence in the camp community . Maxwell put out a call on social media for more donations , seeking four-wheel drive trucks and foul-weather clothing . He also asked for gas masks and protective baseball and hockey gear to shield protesters from any future skirmishes with police . More than 525 people from across the country have been arrested since August . In a recent clash between police and protesters near the path of the pipeline , officers used tear gas , rubber bullets and large water hoses in sub-freezing temperatures . Organizers said at least 17 protesters were taken to the hospital , some for hypothermia and one for an arm injury . One officer was hurt . North Dakota has often conjured images of a wind-swept , treeless wasteland . Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier , who is heading the law enforcement effort around the pipeline , said he hopes the harsh conditions force people to leave the encampment , something the state and federal governments have so far been unable to do . But he said Wednesday that the state has no intention of blocking food and supplies from coming into the camp . The federal deadline probably will not have any immediate effect on the camp either . Soon after it was set , the Army Corps of Engineers explained that the agency had no plans to forcibly remove anyone , although violators could be charged with trespassing . Back at the camp , about 75 people lined up Thursday to draw propane for heating and cooking from a fuel truck . The driver , Rodney Grant , said it was his seventh trip in a week . The propane was free to campers . Grant said he did not know who was paying for it . Dani Jo McKing , a member of the Standing Rock Sioux , was among those in line . She and her husband have been sharing cold-weather tips with people who are not from North Dakota . She said people with out-of-state license plates , including California and Nevada , have been seen driving away from the camp . The cruel winter is bound to induce others to head home , she said . The cold weather has never bothered her . Summer Moore arrived last week from Paintsville , Kentucky , and quickly learned the power of the whipping North Dakota wind . When a snowstorm rolled in Monday , it ripped her tent to shreds . She hitched a ride to the casino on the Standing Rock reservation and rode out the storm in a hotel room .
