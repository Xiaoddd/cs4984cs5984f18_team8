CreditCreditChristopher Miller for The New York Times By Peter Kujawinski Feb. 7 , 2017 Thousands of years ago , every lake was like Great Bear Lake . So pure you could lower a cup into the water and drink it . So beautiful that people composed love songs to it . So mysterious that many believed it was alive . Today , of the 10 largest lakes in the world , it is the last one that remains essentially primeval . Great Bear Lake straddles the Arctic Circle in the remote Northwest Territories of Canada . At just over 12,000 square miles , the lake is the eighth largest in the world . It is bigger than Belgium and deeper than Lake Superior , and it is covered in ice and snow most of the year . The only human settlement on its shores is the town of Deline , population 503 . They are as connected to the lake as the name implies , and for practical , cultural , historic and even prophetic reasons , they are determined to keep it pristine . Their efforts paid off in 2016 . In March , the Great Bear Lake watershed was declared a Unesco Biosphere Reserve . Several months later , the Canadian government granted Deline self-government , ensuring local control in areas like language and education . It is the first time that an aboriginal government in Canada will represent everyone in the community , aboriginal and nonaboriginal alike . Great Bear Lake is important to Mr. Livingstone as well . I had spent an hour or two in Deline back in 2014 , as an American diplomat posted to Canada . It was July and the lake was ice-free , endless and flat to the horizon . During my three-year tour , it was the sole time I needed a translator , because many Deline elders speak only their own language , North Slavey . It was a short drive from the airport to the hotel where I was staying , the community-owned Grey Goose Lodge .

Mr. Neyelle , 65 , tall and soft-spoken , switches easily between English and North Slavey . He said self-government allowed the residents of Deline to preserve their way of life and to use these traditions to tackle modern problems . In the past , Mr. Gaudet added , people would look only to the national and provincial government for help . Now , Deline would decide what was best for its people . This included making their own decisions about economic development , such as elevating cultural tourism through the community-run Destination Deline program . Protecting the lake , however , is not just about self-preservation and increased tourism . Mr. Ayah foretold that in the future , people from the south would come to Great Bear Lake because it would be one of the few places left with water to drink and fish to eat . He said so many boats would come that you could walk from one to another without entering the water . Simply put , Great Bear Lake would be a last refuge for humanity . Mr. Gaudet said the predictions were a big reason the new government pushed to have authority over everyone in the area , aboriginal and nonaboriginal alike . People in Deline told me that the weather had been changing in recent years , and that the summer season was getting longer . Mr. Neyelle said climate change added a note of urgency to the prophecies ; they may come true sooner than expected . It was hard to do . The night sky was overcast , and the temperature had dipped to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit -LRB- minus 23 Celsius -RRB- . Specks of ice from the freezing-up of Great Bear Lake filled the air . The flecks caused outdoor lights to reflect upward , creating optical illusions called light pillars that made it seem as if each light had become a searchlight aimed at the sky . I walked off the road and into a thicket of boreal forest . Hoarfrost from the lake clung to every surface of the trees and bushes . It covered even the undersides of spruce needles .

CreditChristopher Miller for The New York Times At 8 the next morning , I awoke to darkness . From November until January , Deline gets less than five hours of sun each day , although it makes up for that between May and July , when it gets over 22 hours daily . Eventually , I saw a glimmer of predawn on the horizon , but it was not until 10:30 a.m. that the first rays of sun peeked out . I walked outside and headed toward the church for Sunday Mass. . The round , yurt-shaped structure was in town , on the shore of Great Bear Lake . Chunks and shards of ice lay heaped on the shoreline , while farther out , the surface of the lake was pancake-flat , alternately skimmed white with snow or glistening with ice that froze overnight . A wedge of open water was visible just offshore . It looked turbulent , straining and frothing where it encountered the surface ice , as if it were determined not to freeze . Deline is predominantly Roman Catholic . An elder was leading the congregation in the rosary . His call was in North Slavey , and the response was in a mix of Slavey and English . During the Mass , the Gospel and the homily were in English , followed by an on-the-spot translation into North Slavey . The 2011 Canadian census counted only 225 people who identified the language as their mother tongue . For the moment , North Slavey is not on the verge of extinction . It belongs to a family of North American indigenous languages that includes Apache and Navajo . Mr. Neyelle said the new government wanted to make acquiring and passing on the language a priority because it believed speaking North Slavey was crucial to preserving the culture . He said his descriptions in Slavey had more depth and color than those in English , even though he was fluent in both . Teenagers I spoke to echoed this thought . They said jokes were funnier in Slavey . Image Young villagers , from left , Amber Modeste , Adam Malgokak Inuktalik and Whitney Andre . CreditChristopher Miller for The New York Times After Mass , I walked over to Great Bear Lake , curious about the little skein of open water I had seen hours earlier . To my surprise , it had disappeared . Thinking I was turned around , I kept searching , but saw only the reflective surface of new ice and beyond that , a large field of older , snow-covered ice . Mr. Neyelle confirmed that the water had frozen over during the time I was in church . He was not surprised it had happened so quickly . Sometimes , he said , you could actually see ice creeping across open water . His description made it seem like a fox or wolf stalking its prey . We drove to Ski Hill , a gathering place for the community perched on top of a cleared rise near town . The sun had been up for three hours , but already it was getting dark . Several pickup trucks were parked close together , next to a recently built hut with a blazing fire pit in the middle . Children were sledding -LRB- despite the name of the hill , no one actually skis there -RRB- , and some of the adults were test-driving a new snowmobile with a powerful engine . Strips of lake trout along with moose meat and hot dogs cooked on top of barrel grills . The atmosphere was festive , perhaps because it seemed as if Great Bear Lake was finally freezing over . This meant access to the entire lake , better fishing and , eventually , an ice road that would temporarily connect Deline to the outside world . Or perhaps it was festive because these were friends gathering on a Sunday to enjoy the sunset , grilled food and conversation in North Slavey and in English . The type of town where the phone directory is a piece of paper taped to the wall . Charlie Neyelle is a spiritual and mental health guide for the community , and pushed for self-government and preservation of Great Bear Lake . One day the fisherman set out four hooks . When the fisherman returned to check on them , a lake trout had broken one of the lines and taken the hook . This bothered the fisherman , because in those days , hooks were extremely valuable . So that night , he transformed himself into a losch , also known as burbot , a freshwater version of cod . The fisherman swam down to the middle of the lake to look for the hook and heard a booming sound . There , at the bottom , he saw a gigantic beating heart . He swam back to shore after seeing this , and the following morning when he went to check on his three hooks , he found three trout . One of them had the hook he had lost the day before dangling from its mouth . When the fisherman saw the water-heart , he realized Great Bear Lake was alive , Mr. Neyelle said . Some in Deline believe that the water-heart at the bottom of the lake gives life to all of the lakes , oceans and rivers in the world . The regular evocation of this prophecy reminded me of what happened on the other side of the lake in the 1940s , in Port Radium . During World War II , uranium from Port Radium was sent to the United States for the war effort , where it provided much of the material for the Manhattan Project and the atomic bombs that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Although it stopped producing uranium in 1960 and is now abandoned , Port Radium was at its peak larger than Deline . Image Snow - and ice-covered bushes along the shore of Great Bear Lake . CreditChristopher Miller for The New York Times Irene Kodakin was born near Port Radium in 1952 , when the mine was still in operation . Now living in Deline , she describes Port Radium as a thriving community of aboriginal and nonaboriginal workers brought to work in the mines . Ms. Kodakin has happy memories of her childhood , in stark contrast to her experience in a residential school in Inuvik , a town more than 400 miles away . For much of the 20th century , the Canadian government forced many aboriginal children into these schools , with the goal of assimilating them into Canadian culture . When she returned home , she could no longer speak North Slavey . Her older sister had to translate when Ms. Kodakin spoke to her own father . Although it was known at the time that exposure to uranium was dangerous , this warning did not reach them . While researching links between cancer and Port Radium , Ms. Beyha and others discovered that uranium taken from the sacred Great Bear Lake was most likely used in the bombs that detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Many people , especially the elders , were aghast , Ms. Beyha said . In 1998 , Deline sent a delegation to Japan for the annual Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony . It was a gesture of atonement as well as a way to start healing , particularly for the widows of men who had worked at Port Radium , who made traditional gifts that the delegation presented to the Japanese .

CreditChristopher Miller for The New York Times During my time in Deline , the legacies of Port Radium and the residential schools were among many reasons people gave for protecting Great Bear Lake and for negotiating self-government . Those not living on Great Bear Lake , however , gave another reason that was perhaps the simplest of all . The lake , like the Mona Lisa , is magnificent . It draws the gaze as an ocean does . The slate blue ice and white snow merge seamlessly into the sky so that when you leave the shoreline , with brittle tiles of ice cracking underfoot , it feels like stepping into a cloud . And in the brief moments when the wind dies down , the silence is as deep and enormous as the lake itself . During my last days in the area , I went exploring with a Deline resident , Leeroy Andre , his wife , Diane , and his 18-year-old daughter , Whitney . We would leave at sunrise and plunge into the boreal forest , following trails and old seismic lines . In the distance lay the frozen sheet of Great Bear Lake , and beyond , thick rolls of mist rose toward the sun , evidence of open water at the edge of the horizon . In North Slavey , this mist is called tah-tzeleh . It is a land of ptarmigan and marten , musk ox , caribou , moose , wolf and bear . One day , after we had been out four hours , we came across a huge abandoned beaver lodge at least six feet high and twice as long . Around then , despite my wearing several layers , a parka and other gear , the cold started after me . It crept up from the ground onto my snowmobile . It cracked the rubber of my boots and shouldered inside . If I concentrated , I could feel ice crystals forming in my toes . When we started moving again , the cold took on the shape of a blanket and patiently tried to cover my shoulders and back . At sunset , the moon appeared like a slender comma above the trees , glowing in the blue-black sky . We drove through marshmallow mounds : berry bushes covered in snow and hoarfrost for most of the year before they emerge in the summer and grow leaves and berries as fast as they can . Dark came quickly , and we sped across yet another small lake connected to Great Bear Lake . The northern lights appeared like a hallucination across the star-filled sky . For hours they moved in slow motion above me , as the land seemed to recede and I faced the cosmos . This connected with something I was told when I first arrived in Deline . They are part of it and it is part of them . The water from Great Bear Lake flows in our veins , too . Peter Kujawinski is a novelist and freelance journalist .
