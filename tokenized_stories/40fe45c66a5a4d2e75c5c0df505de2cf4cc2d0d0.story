The press conference was organized to show support for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe affected by the Dakota Access Pipeline -LRB- DAPL -RRB- , and to reinforce the call to stand with all indigenous people across the globe . Global Ministries invited guests to speak on their experiences at Standing Rock as part of the press conference . Watch highlights from the Press Conference . For the past several months , water protectors have held prayer vigils and direct actions on the Standing Rock reservation , calling other people of faith to stand in solidarity with Native Americans to demonstrate love and respect for all members of creation . Tribal towns have always been located near water . The DAPL would create an unhealthy and unsafe environment not only for the indigenous people who rely on the Missouri River for water , but for approximately 18 million people who live downstream as well .

To make a change , we must all come together for future generations and indigenous people around the world . Imam Imad Enchassi , senior imam of the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City , O.K. , explained his reason for going to Standing Rock . He also described a moment years later when he visited his father 's childhood home with his wife , a member of the Cheyenne Tribe , and was forbidden to take a photograph because his home had been resettled . There is no such thing as Muslim water , Christian air , or a Jewish environment . On Dec. 5 , 2016 , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied a permit for the DAPL to cross the Missouri River near the reservation . The fight is not over . Not only with the issue of the DAPL but with indigenous people everywhere fighting to keep their way of life and protecting their land from being desecrated . Mary Lyons .

A landowner discovered it the same day the permit was denied . The leak from the Belle Fourche Pipeline flowed into the Ash Coulee Creek near Belfield , N.D. , and into U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway . Some of the oil remains frozen over since the spill , but could potentially flow into the Little Missouri River . According to Wendy Owen , spokeswoman for the Wyoming-based True Companies , they have yet to determine the cause of the break . The oil cleanup is set to go on until spring . This is a reminder that the DAPL could potentially affect anyone who drinks and uses water . As in any fight for justice , there is a continued call to stand for basic human rights .
