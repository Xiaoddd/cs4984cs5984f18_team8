The legal challenge to the Mountain Valley Pipeline was brought by the Sierra Club and five other mostly local or regional groups , while the case against the Atlantic Coast Pipeline was argued by the Southern Environmental Law Center on behalf of the Sierra Club and two other organizations . Grassroots pressure was also brought to bear over the last several months by Sierra Club volunteers and staff in North Carolina and Virginia , through which the planned pipelines would run . Above and below , Sierra Club volunteers talk with local residents in Burlington , N.C. Back in March , volunteers with the Sierra Club and partner groups met with U.S. Representative David Price , who represents most of Raleigh , Durham , and Chapel Hill , asking him to send a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -LRB- FERC -RRB- requesting a re-hearing on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline , jointly proposed to be built by Duke Energy and Dominion Power . Among those lobbying Price were constituents Jane Flowers Finch -LRB- at left , above -RRB- and her mother Pearl Finch -LRB- standing next to the congressman -RRB- . The elder Finch penned this op-ed , which ran in the Raleigh News & Observer . The Sierra Club and its coalition partners argued that because the agencies issuing the permits might decide that the pipeline crossings of the forest and parkway might need to be rerouted , the project should be halted along the entirety of the ACP 's route . On August 3 , FERC ordered the Mountain Valley Pipeline to halt all construction except for stabilizing the soil to prevent erosion . MVP responded by proposing to immediately complete 45 miles of new construction . One week later , on August 10 , FERC ordered a halt to all work on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline . The Sierra Club and its partners immediately announced they would seek relief in both the D.C. Circuit and the Fourth Circuit . The court threw out ACP permits needed to cross the Blue Ridge Parkway , and ordered MVP to cease all pipeline-related activity in the Jefferson National Forest . Partnering with the Sierra Club in making the legal case against the Mountain Valley Pipeline are Wild Virginia , Appalachian Voices , The Wilderness Society , Preserve Craig , and Save Monroe . The legal case against the Atlantic Coast Pipeline was made by the Southern Environmental Law Center on behalf of the Sierra Club , Defenders of Wildlife , and the Virginia Wilderness Committee .
