Several hundred activists protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline are under a court order to leave by Wednesday the construction site they 've occupied since last year . Protesters at the North Dakota camp , which is near the Missouri River , seemed unfazed by threats of arrest . Faced with the prospect of spring flooding , some protesters are considering a move to higher ground , though not necessarily off the federal land . Some may move to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation . The leader of the tribe has urged protesters to leave . Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners -LRB- ETP -RRB- began work on the last major section of the pipeline this month following Army Corps of Engineers permission to lay pipe under a reservoir near the Missouri River . The protests have been led by Native American tribes , particularly the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux , whose reservations are downstream from the construction site . They say the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites , an accusation ETP disputes . There have been more than 700 arrests . The camp 's population has dwindled as the pipeline battle has moved into the courts . The area has become strewn with garbage , and local police fear that the debris and snow may be covering the bodies of protesters who succumbed to the harsh conditions . Over the last several days authorities have searched the camp for human remains . More than 200 truckloads of debris have been hauled out of the campsite since Monday , according to the office of North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum . The cleanup will occur after 2 p.m. , local time , Wednesday , when the remaining protesters will be moved from the camp . Burgum has said he would rather there would be no arrests .
