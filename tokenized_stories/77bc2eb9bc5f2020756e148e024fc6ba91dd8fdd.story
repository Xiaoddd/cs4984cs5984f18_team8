But those swamp critters are the very ones who are buying favors from the president-to-be by putting up tens of millions of dollars to pay for his inaugural extravaganza and his transition operation . The transition team itself , which is literally shaping and staffing our next national government , is a viper 's nest of pay-to-play corporate interests . The teams setting up the various agencies and writing their agendas are dominated by top operatives from anti-worker corporations and from the same Wall Streeters whose casino-style speculation crashed our economy in 2007 and crushed the middle class . Now they are on the inside , deciding who will fill more than 4,000 executive positions and run our government . The room was filled with moneyed elites , such as Paul Singer , the hedge-fund billionaire and extremist laissez-faire ideologue . These are not people who are going to finance any sort of working-class populism ; they instead intend to use The Donald 's victory to impose a plutocracy over America . Pay-to-play is already in full effect , and Trump has n't even spent his first day in office . His inauguration is just another opportunity for the plutocrats to buy their way into Donnie 's favor . Of course , Trump had to bring in one of his longtime pals to help him plan such an elite affair . Few Americans have ever heard of Tom Barrack , but he 's going to be a big , behind-the-scenes player in Trump 's Washington . Indeed , Barrack 's literally in charge of parading The Donald into the White House . He chairs the presidential inaugural committee , overseeing everything from numerous balls to the swearing-in . The four-day affair will , of course , be a Trumpian Spectacular , yet Barrack insists it wo n't be outlandishly tacky . Barrack is a speculator who runs a myriad of Wall Street funds , real estate ventures , luxury resorts and casinos . Some of the other billionaires who serve on the committee are coal baron Joe Craft , fracking pioneer Harold Hamm , Gail Icahn -LRB- wife to investor Carl Icahn -RRB- and casino moguls Steve Wynn , Phil Ruffin , Sheldon Adelson and Adelson 's wife , Miriam . But that only gets you into the bleacher seats out in right field . For the platinum seats up in the luxurious owners ' suites , the price is a cool million bucks . -- To find out more about Jim Hightower , and read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists , visit the Creators webpage at www.creators.com .
