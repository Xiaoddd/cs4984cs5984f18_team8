Now , a group of advisors to President-elect Donald Trump on Native American issues wants to free those resources from what they call a suffocating federal bureaucracy that holds title to 56 million acres of tribal lands , two chairmen of the coalition told Reuters in exclusive interviews . The tribes have rights to use the land , but they do not own it . They can drill it and reap the profits , but only under regulations that are far more burdensome than those applied to private property . It could deeply divide Native American leaders , who hold a range of opinions on the proper balance between development and conservation . Many Native Americans view such efforts as a violation of tribal self-determination and culture . Reservations governed by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs are intended in part to keep Native American lands off the private real estate market , preventing sales to non-Indians . An official at the Bureau of Indian Affairs did not respond to a request for comment . The legal underpinnings for reservations date to treaties made between 1778 and 1871 to end wars between indigenous Indians and European settlers . Tribal governments decide how land and resources are allotted among tribe members . On Sunday , amid rising opposition , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday said it had denied a permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline project , citing a need to explore alternate routes . The Trump transition team has expressed support for the pipeline , however , and his administration could revisit the decision once it takes office in January . Tribes and their members could potentially reap vast wealth from more easily tapping resources beneath reservations . Those companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment . At least three of four chair-level members have links to the oil industry . ETP did not immediately respond to a request for comment . The fourth co-chair , Eddie Tullis , a former chairman of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians in Alabama , is involved in casino gaming , a major industry on reservations . Clahchischilliage and Tullis did not respond to requests for comment . Bureaucratic Thicket Several tribes , including the Crow Nation in Montana and the Southern Ute in Colorado , have entered into mining and drilling deals that generate much-needed revenue for tribe members and finance health , education and infrastructure projects on their reservations . As U.S. oil and gas drilling boomed over the past decade , tribes struggled to capitalize . A 2015 report from the Government Accountability Office found that poor management by the Bureau of Indian Affairs hindered energy development and resulted in lost revenue for tribes . Over the next decade , some 2.5 million acres of land were removed from tribal control , and 12,000 Native Americans lost their tribal affiliation . Mullin and Swimmer said the coalition does not want to repeat past mistakes and will work to preserve tribal control of reservations . Mullin said the finalized proposal could result in Congressional legislation as early as next year . Washburn said he doubted such a bill could pass , but Gabe Galanda , a Seattle-based lawyer specializing in Indian law , said it could be possible with Republican control of the White House and the U.S. House and Senate . Legal challenges to such a law could also face less favorable treatment from a U.S. Supreme Court with a conservative majority , he said . Trump will soon have the chance to nominate a Supreme Court justice to replace Antonin Scalia , a conservative member who died earlier this year .
