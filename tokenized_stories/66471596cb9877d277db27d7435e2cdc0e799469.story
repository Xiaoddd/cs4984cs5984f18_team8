Feb. 7 2017 6:00 PM Trump Administration Breaks Out Fifth-Grade Math Skills to Weaken Obamacare Regulations By Jordan Weissmann Trump , handing over his executive order on Obamacare . According to the Huffington Post 's Jonathan Cohn , Trump 's Department of Health and Human Services has already submitted a list of rule changes to the Office of Management and Budget , which has to approve them before the lengthy public process required to rewrite a regulation can start . Advertisement Under Obamacare 's current rules , insurers are only allowed to charge seniors up to three times more than younger adults . This is called the age-rating band , and it generally makes coverage cheaper for the older customers and more expensive for the young . They also claim that would lead to a better functioning insurance market overall . Trump ca n't expand the age band that far without legislation . But he 's going to try to widen it a bit . Here 's Cohn -LRB- bolding mine -RRB- : Insurers would have more leeway to vary prices by age , so that premiums for the oldest customers could be 3.49 times as large as those for younger customers . Today , premiums for the old can be only three times as high as premiums for the young , which is what the Affordable Care Act stipulates . Top Comment Funny . I am a pretty big fan of the Chevron principle , which says courts should generally defer to executive agencies when it comes to statutory interpretation . But man does this stretch credulity . I 'm not even saying it 's necessarily bad policy ; insurers have had trouble enrolling enough young folks to stabilize the Obamacare markets in many states and , who knows , maybe a more flexible band would help a little . But the legal justification is just priceless . Anyway , to whomever came up with this : Your fifth grade math teacher should be beaming . All rights reserved . example .
