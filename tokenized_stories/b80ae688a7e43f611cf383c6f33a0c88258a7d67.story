FAIRNESS & ACCURACY IN REPORTING FAIR Studies Media Activism Internship Program Store Challenging media bias since 1986 . This is a lightly edited transcript . The announcement that the Army Corps of Engineers would withhold an easement permit for the last part of the Dakota Access Pipeline , pending an environmental impact study , is a significant moment that should nonetheless not be mistaken for the end of either that environmental or that historical story . She joins us by phone from Chicago . Welcome to CounterSpin , Kelly Hayes . Kelly Hayes : Thank you so much for having me . KH : Well , I was saying to some folks in a direct action workshop just the other day that we have to understand victory as coming in stages , always . But as storytellers , we have to recognize that our victories are not just climactic , in the way that an outside view might understand them . Our people have been throwing down for eight months now . A number of my friends have been staying out there , and have made a home there for more than five months on , and some of my friends are actually day one individuals . So missing that deadline creates a point of weakness that can be exploited , that can be dug into deeper , by those of us who want to make sure this pipeline never happens . If anything , the only thing that was maybe finitely accomplished here was that the Obama administration came up with a maneuver that will remove this as a stain from the legacy of an outgoing president . And we have heard from experts that it would be a matter of hours , if Trump were determined to do so , for him to dismantle these gains that we have recently made . But we are at a very critical time , and mischaracterizing this as the larger battle being won risks us falling from the headlines , risks this entire story being pushed out of public view . It took a whole lot of fighting , it took a whole lot of people getting hurt and really living this struggle , in order for this to be seen . The truth is , they are more vulnerable now than they have ever been , in terms of money getting shut off . We have millions of dollars that have been moved already through move-your-money campaigns , to get people to divest from banks that are supporting the pipeline . We need to hit on that front harder than ever . We need people to disrupt their banks , we need people to shut down banks that are funding this pipeline . There is a front line waiting to be created outside of every Wells Fargo , outside of every Chase bank , and we can all be doing this . So we need to see this as a moment of expansion in this struggle , and not a moment of resolution . KH : Oh , absolutely . Here in Chicago , we have gone after banks a few times now , and a coalition that has formed around doing so involves my group , Lifted Voices , which is a direct action-oriented group , but also largely we do a lot of direct action education . So , folks who are already kind of on that radical tip . We have the American Indian Center , which has been largely a cultural hub and direct services hub in this city , working hand in hand with us , people like the Autonomous Tenants Association . I want a movement , not a clubhouse of people who think they know how it works . I want people to understand that organizing means messing up .
