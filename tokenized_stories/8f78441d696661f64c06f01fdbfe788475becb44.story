I have established Crystal Water Camp for the purpose of teaching how to identify , document , and report the numerous environmental violations during the construction of the Sabal Trail Gas pipelines in Florida . For the past six months we have documented and reported hundreds of violations including spills of diesel fluids in Ft. Drum Creek . Until now we have only been able to report what we can see from the road and public areas while the pipeline goes miles into forests and wetlands and places we can not see . Having a drone is critical to our cause of protecting these sensitive areas . While government agencies are extremely understaffed it 's critical that we be the eyes and ears on the ground to protect our water and all life . If our goal is not met for the drone the funds will be used to keep Crystal Water Camp running and will be put to great use . Please try again . I contacted several clubs about drones a while back - Gainesville , Tampa and Orlando have active groups . Also Kissimmee Fly-in . Got ta support our water protectors , especially in our own backyards . Thank you for All You do Ronald Reedy .
