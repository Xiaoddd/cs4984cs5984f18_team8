However , one donation from a small community in Oregon has grabbed attention in recent days for its ingenuity and thoughtfulness . Matt Musselwhite , a carpenter , arrived at the camps just a few days ago with the components for several tiny houses in tow , along with several other sorely-needed items . Musselwhite , along with a volunteer Teamster trucker , spent three days traveling from Oregon to North Dakota in a 5-ton flatbed truck transporting the tiny houses among other goods . The generous and much-needed donation also included solar energy systems , wood stoves , 100 loaves of organic bread , and 1,000 pounds of organic pork , salmon , hamburger , and produce . Upon arriving at the encampment , Musselwhite was unsure of how to unload all of his cargo , though he was soon greeted by several volunteers who have been helping him unload and reassemble the houses . One of the houses will soon become home to Mni Wiconi , the first baby born at the encampment since the protests began back in April . If more people showed the kind of solidarity put forth by Musselwhite and his neighbors , the situation in North Dakota could change drastically and for the better .
