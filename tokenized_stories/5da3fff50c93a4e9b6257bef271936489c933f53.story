He is in possession of German and Norwegian blood too . I go back every summer guaranteed . I 've been up seven or eight times since this whole thing began . I 've seen the cycles of boom and bust . Protesters hold mirror shields devised by artist Cannupa Hanska Luger . But we are the mirrors . Cannupa Hanska Luger , artist Share quote & link A lot of artists I 've spoken with have described their journeys to the Standing Rock encampment as transformative . They ask you if you have weapons or drugs . This is an exclusive country . It 's all about fences and borders . You set up camp and someone gives you firewood . The whole thing of guarding your stuff goes away . As you walk through the world , you are not yourself . You are not a singularity . You are not an American individualist bootstrapping bull ... . You are only borrowing this place from children you will never meet . And the only reason you have an opportunity to do that is because elders took care of it for you . Everybody came in hoping to experience something new , something profound . But when they got there , they realized they 're not a part of something new , they 've just been absorbed into something that is much older than the entire country . That 's incredibly humbling . This is our culture . It 's a part of our society . Our original bible , that comes down from on high , it is the land . We have an oral tradition and we tell stories about magical characters that are bound to the landscape , that are bound to geology . There is a story . Artist Cannupa Hanska Luger on the Standing Rock protests Share quote & link The battle for the pipeline is n't over , but having the Army Corps of Engineers deny the permit certainly stands as an important victory . It was so grass roots . Native people have never been subject to that amount of solidarity . It left everybody awestruck . And the number of Native people coming together , nothing like this has been seen since the 19th century . It 's far too profound . I was inspired by these activists in the Ukraine . From the photos I saw , it seemed profoundly effective . I wanted to bring that same level of recognition to the front lines there . But Standing Rock is in the middle of nowhere . So what we needed was a mirrored shield . From one sheet of Masonite , you could make six shields . I started making them after that Sunday that they were hitting people with hoses . I personally made close to 100 of them . But then another group out of Minneapolis made 500 . I have no idea how many are in circulation . But I keep seeing them here and there . Being an artist , it is a way to weaponize privilege . Artists , we live on the periphery . But we are the mirrors . We are the reflective points that break through a barrier . You do n't have to be in the same economic place that I am to relate to the work that I make . That is the power of art . We are not rich people . We have ideas .
