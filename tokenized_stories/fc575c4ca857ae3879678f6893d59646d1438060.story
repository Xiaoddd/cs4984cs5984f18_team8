The violation notice in Nicholas County lists Price Gregory , a Houston-based company , as site operator . Precision Pipeline , a Wisconsin-based construction company , is listed as the operator for the violation in Harrison County and in Wetzel County . Trinity Energy Services , a Texas company , was the operator on construction in Monroe County . None of the three companies , nor a spokesman for the DEP , responded to requests for comment Monday . Natalie Cox , a spokeswoman for Mountain Valley Pipeline , said the project welcomed the oversight , and that crews were fixing the problems .
