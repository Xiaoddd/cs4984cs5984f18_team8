The decision came just in time : after weeks of confrontation between law enforcement and protesters , tensions had been expected to rise on Monday , when two thousand military veterans were to join the demonstrations , and when a mandatory evacuation order , issued by Governor Jack Dalrymple , was to take effect .

Goldman would get in big trouble for its dodging . nine years later , it confessed that it knew about the problems with toxic mortgage products , avoided them itself , and sold them to investors anyway . And it would . men in the e-mail have fared particularly well . Van Praag ended up at Teneo Holdings , an advisory firm co-founded by Doug Band , a longtime consigliere to Bill and Hillary Clinton . the most telling thing that the e-mail foretold was how finance would , in the coming years , use giving to protect its right to keep taking . But I will tell you , having spent the past few years reporting a book on wealthy givers and their attempts to change the world -LRB- without changing their own elevated positions in it -RRB- , that there is seldom a smoking gun connecting the giving to the taking . Rich people stand atop a system they are clearly reluctant to change in any major way , even as they throw scraps down from on high . The next day , they donated twenty-seven thousand dollars to the Valerie Fund , in Maplewood , New Jersey , which supports children with cancer and blood disorders . donation , in Goldman stock , to the University of Chicago ; a five-hundred-dollar gift to Friends of Nantucket Public Schools ; and a hundred-thousand-dollar donation to a Teach for America benefit dinner . There is also a Lloyd & Laura Blankfein Foundation , which reported giving away a total of twenty thousand dollars , in 2016 , to Bronx Baseball Dreams , Inc. . David Viniar , another carbon-copied recipient , has the Viniar Family Foundation in his name . And still another , John F. W. Rogers , is the chairman of GS Gives and the Goldman Sachs Foundation . JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay thirteen billion dollars for similar shenanigans . The stark fact about the financial crisis ten years on is that , in retrospect , it was a good deal for many of the people who caused it . Imagine what might have been : a recovery in which homeowners and indebted students had won relief from their loans , in which banks had agreed to pay a fairer share of taxes in exchange for the bailout help , in which they had been required to pump more of their capital into the real economy instead of swilling it around Wall Street . But none of that was to be , because , as the e-mail shows , a little bit of generosity could be put forward as a plausible substitute for justice . Giving in millions has a way of erasing harm done in billions . To be sure , any rise is welcome . And last year was the third year in a row in which median household incomes increased , with a particularly strong jump coming in 2015 , the penultimate year of the Obama Administration . Compared with its 2014 figure , median household income in 2017 was about ten per cent higher . In fact , they fell slightly , as a pickup in prices bit into inflation-adjusted pay . This decrease in wages came during a year in which the official unemployment rate fell from 4.8 per cent to 4.1 per cent , which is a low level by historic standards . The answer is by working longer hours : the number of people working part time fell markedly last year . To generate a significant and lasting improvement in the living standards of middle-class Americans , we need to see a significant and lasting increase in hourly and weekly wages . point to note is that , despite the pickup in incomes since 2014 , many middle-class American households are only now making up for the large losses they suffered in previous years . For its 2013 report , the Bureau changed one of the surveys that it uses to measure median household income , and the changes raised the estimates by about three per cent . If you do the adjustments for the changes made in 2013 , and omit from the comparison elderly households , which tend to rely on Social Security and other forms of retirement income , the picture is even more disturbing . noted . a remarkable development , and it has occurred while the richest households in the country were enjoying sizable income gains . back to 2000 , the differences are even more glaring . over-all picture is clear , then . It was ordinary , non-rich Americans who bore the greatest costs of the Great Recession and its lengthy aftermath . Giridharadas on the 2008 financial crisis , charitable giving , and the ways in which those on Wall Street who caused it have also gained from it . former campaign manager , pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice . Manafort will lose several properties , the money in several bank accounts , and a life-insurance policy , which appear to have value well in excess of ten million dollars . blog , told me . Even if Mueller already knows everything that Manafort has to offer , it would be helpful to have another voice confirming details at some future criminal trial for some other defendant . It is one of the more explicit moments in which senior members of the Trump campaign met with people close to the Kremlin to discuss working together to help elect Trump . Among the Trump team , Manafort would be , by far , the most experienced in dealing with emissaries from Russia and its allies , and the one most likely to understand the various agendas of those present . He surely knows what he told Trump , Jr. , Trump himself , Kushner , and others about the significance of the meeting . And , because Manafort has deep ties to many business and political associates of Vladimir Putin , he could well know about other possible connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government . Manafort can also potentially shed light on several key people and a number of events that the public still knows too little about . Rather than merely informing on others , this theory holds that he would be able to lay out the full story of collusion -LRB- if , indeed , there was any -RRB- . However , this plea agreement is not overly generous . It strips Manafort of much of his wealth and means that the man , who is sixty-nine years old , will likely spend a decade in prison . That seems unlikely . No doubt he can help Mueller find even more . If the answer is yes , then Trump will almost certainly be impeached and removed from office . He would have been in a position to hold out for something far better . Manafort has already deepened our knowledge of blatant corruption and illegality among those close to Trump . No doubt he can help Robert Mueller find even more . Manafort has already deepened our knowledge of blatant corruption and illegality among those close to Trump . No doubt he can help Robert Mueller find even more . Manafort has already deepened our knowledge of blatant corruption and illegality among those close to Trump . No doubt he can help Robert Mueller find even more . during the years before Trump ran for President . The door was always open , with people streaming in and out . This was an anomaly at the Trump Organization . He was cutting off the flow of constant distraction ; he was choosing to focus on something important . If Trump was discussing a deal , he liked to be able to call someone into his office and share how great the deal was . If he was meeting with someone especially rich or famous , he would make introductions . the public face of the Genovese crime family , for example . Ivanka personally handled many of the most problematic deals . for more than sixty million dollars in unpaid tax liabilities . My source told me that this was nonsense : of course Trump knew when he was breaking the law . She was the interface between Trump and the rest of the world : she answered and made his phone calls , read and wrote his e-mails , ushered people into his office , and scheduled his out-of-office interactions . They each independently described a similar vetting process . If the lawyer pushed back at all , Trump would categorize the person as a stickler and never ask them to do anything untoward again . Greenblatt , several Trump Organization lawyers told me , was responsible for conducting due diligence on partners . There were a large group of people who brought potential deals to Trump and then managed the deal-making process . Some were longtime employees ; others , as noted above , simply walked in the door and proposed some scheme or another . We know many of their names , but not all of them . And , since shell companies obscured the identities of the participants in most Trump deals , only those with subpoena power can unearth the entire list . This large group of dealmakers includes people who live in other countries , and a number with ties to the Kremlin . George Sorial , a Trump Organization executive vice-president , might be first among these dealmakers as a person of interest who , like Cohen , is also a lawyer . Long before he ran for President , Trump travelled with men who served as bodyguards and sometimes also handled unpleasant tasks . described a pattern in which the campaign would pay precisely fifteen thousand dollars a month to people whom it wanted to silence and prevent from revealing disturbing information about the President . Calamari is now the chief operating officer of the Trump Organization ; his son is a director of security . Trump , his eldest children , and Weisselberg are in the center . Together , they know and actively participated in almost everything . They are likely the central focus of any investigation . Many of the people and deals represented by these spokes are , surely , innocent of any crime and know nothing . Davidson on potential persons and areas of interests in the ongoing investigations into President Donald Trump , his inner circle , and Trump Organization dealings . A former Trump Organization employee told me that this was nonsense . The room is filled with overstuffed armchairs , oversized ash trays , and the persistent haze of smoke . Thick velvet drapes , many the worse for wear , block out the view of the city , and ventilation machines wheeze from the ceiling . At seventy-four , Giuliani often seems weary . He limps . He has surrendered his comb-over to full-on baldness , and , as his torso has thickened , his neck has disappeared . When he joined the Grand Havana , the club was struggling to find members . banned smoking in restaurants and bars . Giuliani met his third wife , Judith Nathan , at another cigar venue , Club Macanudo . On the afternoon I met Giuliani there , members stopped by periodically to pay respects . He reflected on the tumultuous six months he has spent thus far representing Trump in the investigation led by Robert Mueller , the special counsel . In all , he had a favorable estimation of his own performance . Their public comments were courteous , even respectful . Trump wanted a more combative approach . has come at considerable cost to his reputation . As a prosecutor , Giuliani was the sheriff of Wall Street and the bane of organized crime . Trump learned about law and politics from his mentor Roy Cohn , the notorious sidekick to Joseph McCarthy who , as a lawyer in New York , became a legendary brawler and used the media to bash adversaries . Ed Koch was mayor , and Giuliani , who was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York , in Manhattan , was planning his own mayoral run . For years , the city had been trying , without success , to renovate the Wollman skating rink , in Central Park . Trump volunteered to complete the project in just four months , at a lower price than the city was proposing to pay . Koch goes nuts . Koch must have felt he was blindsided , thought it was arrogant , and he said no . As U.S. Attorney , he won plaudits for prosecuting insider trading on Wall Street and for his relentless pursuit of the Mafia . He racked up more than four thousand convictions , including those of Ivan Boesky and of four of the five heads of the New York Mafia families . He sometimes arrested people in their workplaces and then dropped the charges , seemingly as a way to intimidate them and send a message to associates . He defiantly stood up for New York cops accused of killing unarmed black men . In a city that values free expression , he seemed to have little appreciation for the First Amendment , and courts repeatedly slapped him down . was unpopular , even discredited , before September 11 , 2001 , but his resolute leadership in the aftermath of the attacks made him a worldwide symbol of resistance to terrorism . He arrived at the World Trade Center just after the second plane hit , and was nearly trapped at the site . He soon parlayed this fame into prosperity . In 2001 , he claimed that he had just seven thousand dollars in assets . In 2002 , he set up a security-consulting business and began giving speeches internationally . parallels between Giuliani and Trump are temperamental as much as they are political . The same things that led him to success led him to being criticized . behavior has provoked disgust among some of his former fellow-prosecutors . In 2014 , some seven hundred current and former prosecutors for the Southern District met for a gala dinner to celebrate the two-hundred-and-twenty-fifth anniversary of the office . Andrew , who once aspired to be a professional golfer , bonded with Trump at his golf clubs . Andrew estimates that he has played about two hundred rounds with the President . This was evident in 2015 , when Trump was thinking about declaring his candidacy for President . Giuliani began including Trump on his list . But Giuliani was also friends with Jeb Bush and Rick Perry , and he withheld his endorsement , a slight that Trump has not forgotten . Rudy was becoming the guy that Donald would sit with on the plane and get reviews and critiques . He was generationally the guy Donald was closest to as well . Other campaign insiders , including Reince Priebus , told Trump that he had suffered a fatal political blow , but Giuliani immediately began trying to salvage the situation . On Election Night , when Trump declared victory , Giuliani was on the stage . One of them is that Trump was penalizing him for his closeness to Christie , who had been placed in charge of the transition and then was quickly fired . Yet another theory is that Kushner and Bannon wanted a weak Secretary of State so that they could run foreign policy out of the White House . returned to his law firm and , as the Mueller investigation got under way , he kept in touch with the President and his legal team . In March of 2018 , Jay Sekulow told Giuliani that the relationship between the President and John Dowd , his lead defense attorney , had deteriorated . He asked whether Giuliani would consider replacing him , and Giuliani was receptive . investigations surrounding Donald Trump have become sprawling enterprises , with multiple strands that are increasingly intertwined . Giuliani is in charge of the over-all defense effort , and Sekulow , the chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice , a conservative public-interest group founded by Pat Robertson , is his second-in-command . Last month , Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign-finance laws by engineering these payments , which he said he had done at the direction of Trump . California , Trump is facing lawsuits and an arbitration proceeding related to his nondisclosure agreement with Clifford . His lawyer there is Charles Harder , who is best known for representing the professional wrestler Hulk Hogan in the lawsuit that led to the dissolution of the Web site Gawker . To date , Mueller has obtained the indictments of thirty-two individuals and three corporations , as well as five guilty pleas . Giuliani has deputized the husband-and-wife team of Martin and Jane Raskin , former federal prosecutors based in Florida , to deal with routine contacts with the Mueller team . Neither Sekulow nor Giuliani is working full time ; Sekulow is also representing other clients , including Andrew Brunson , the Christian pastor whose detention in Turkey has set off a crisis in U.S.-Turkish relations , and Giuliani is still running his security consulting business . He was on vacation , attending a wedding and playing golf in Scotland , the week that Cohen pleaded guilty and Manafort was convicted . The President also takes an active role in his own defense , especially when it comes to media strategy . During one of my conversations with Giuliani at the Grand Havana , he excused himself to take a call from Trump . spring , Giuliani met with Mueller and his staff , and Giuliani pressed the special counsel about whether he believed that a sitting President could be criminally indicted . He was endorsing Edwards , an African-American Navy veteran and former police chief , for one main reason : Edwards backs Trump . In New Hampshire , at a brief news conference , Giuliani explained that , contrary to appearances , the tweet was not incriminating . At the time , Trump was denying any knowledge of the payment to Stephanie Clifford , and Michael Cohen was claiming that he had not been reimbursed for making it . In the interview , Giuliani contradicted both men . The President took a more indulgent stance . With no evidence , he accused Mueller of leaking to the press . More recently , he has tweeted that Sessions should appoint a special counsel to investigate Mueller . One of the key questions in the obstruction-of-justice inquiry is whether Trump encouraged Comey to go easy on Michael Flynn , then the national-security adviser , who was under investigation for lying to the F.B.I. . In more recent statements , Giuliani has denied that Trump even discussed Flynn with Comey . His comments about the notorious Trump Tower meeting in June of 2016 , between campaign officials and the Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya , have similarly devolved into falsehoods . In mid-August , he told reporters at Bloomberg that Mueller should complete the investigation by September so as not to interfere with the midterm elections . So there are good flippers and bad flippers . advocates say that critics may be measuring his performance by the wrong standards . In May of 2017 , when Mueller was appointed , public-opinion polls showed strong bipartisan support for the special counsel . Now , after months of verbal assaults from Giuliani and Trump , Republicans overwhelmingly disapprove of Mueller . The investigation has become one more issue dividing red and blue America . In Giuliani , he said , Trump had found a like-minded advocate . This is a totally different animal . This is the defense of the President of the United States in a very public arena , where there are former prosecutors on TV every night prosecuting an imaginary case against the guy . Rudy has always been a passionate advocate , and he was not a shrinking violet when he was the mayor . faces one central conundrum : when , or whether , to allow Mueller to interview the President . As with many issues , Giuliani has addressed the question with a farrago of bumbling confusion and sly misstatement . Trump has repeatedly said that he wants to talk with Mueller because he has nothing to hide . Before Giuliani joined the defense , Dowd and Mueller came close to an agreement for the President to voluntarily testify . They even scheduled a date and a location : January 27 , 2018 , at Camp David . Trump has always hedged by saying that his attorneys have to sign off on any deal . He now says that Mueller is too biased , too fanatical , to interview the President . This is a contrived objection , since any reasonable prosecutor would look at a range of evidence , especially corroborating witnesses and documents . the negotiations over a voluntary interview fail , as now seems likely , Mueller may decide to subpoena the President . Giuliani has weighed in on the legality of Presidential subpoenas in the past . The courts had determined that a President could be required to testify in civil cases such as the Jones case and would likely come to the same conclusion about criminal investigations , which are generally viewed as having greater societal import . Mueller will file a concluding report with Rod Rosenstein , the Deputy Attorney General , at the end of the investigation , and , in theory , Rosenstein has the option of releasing the report to Congress and to the public . I asked Giuliani if he thought the White House would raise objections . After Trump revoked the security clearance of John Brennan , a former C.I.A. director who has been critical of his Presidency , Brennan said that he was considering suing . In his appearances during the 2016 campaign , Giuliani often seemed angry , grim-faced , and ferocious . In 1968 , he married his second cousin Regina Peruggi , whom he divorced fourteen years later . In 1984 , he married Hanover , a television journalist . When we began speaking this summer , Giuliani seemed to have moved on . He was dating Jennifer LeBlanc , a Republican fund-raiser from Louisiana whom he met during his 2008 Presidential race . defense of Trump reflects much about his personality . problem for Giuliani is that his loyalty may not be reciprocated . Since Trump became President , his closest advisers have been humiliated -LRB- Tillerson , Priebus -RRB- , disgraced -LRB- Sean Spicer , Bannon -RRB- , prosecuted -LRB- Flynn , Rick Gates -RRB- , or all of the above -LRB- Manafort -RRB- . For the magazine , he has written Profiles of the Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer , Anthony Kennedy , Clarence Thomas , and Chief Justice John G. Roberts , as well as articles on nearly every major legal controversy and trial of the past two decades . But a fourth candidate who , for much of her time in New York politics , has been known as a progressive , made history . running for city council , in 2003 , James , a former assistant attorney general , became a member of the Working Families Party , a minor political party that aims to push Democratic candidates further left . She won , becoming the first member of the W.F.P. to win a race in the state . Hundreds of volunteers , reporters , campaign staffers , and progressive voters crammed into the multi-roomed lounge , heaping their plates high with free Caribbean food and sipping on bottles of Red Stripe and sorrel-flavored Shandy Carib . McLaughlin was skeptical of James , who had aligned herself so strongly with the incumbent governor . When Alessandra Biaggi , another State Senate candidate , in the Bronx , took the lead , a woman screamed . For a brief time , Jumaane Williams pulled ahead of Kathy Hochul , the sitting lieutenant governor . In 2009 , Brown pleaded guilty to assaulting his girlfriend at the time , Rihanna . at Milk River Lounge , a two-story bar and restaurant on the border of Prospect Heights and Clinton Hill , supporters of Tish James danced . crowd was looser , rowdier , happier . It was also more diverse . was mobbed after her speech . One man dropped his wine glass in the commotion , and glass shards scattered everywhere . spelled out in rhinestones . Holgate , a trial attorney , stood with her daughter outside Milk River Lounge , looking in at the party . who had short curly hair and seemed excited by the chaos of the party , said she attended the Howard University School of Law with James . Three hours after the publication of this story , Schneiderman resigned from his position . Schneiderman is facing a reckoning of his own . As his prominence as a voice against sexual misconduct has risen , so , too , has the distress of four women with whom he has had romantic relationships or encounters . They accuse Schneiderman of having subjected them to nonconsensual physical violence . All have been reluctant to speak out , fearing reprisal . They allege that he repeatedly hit them , often after drinking , frequently in bed and never with their consent . They did not report their allegations to the police at the time , but both say that they eventually sought medical attention after having been slapped hard across the ear and face , and also choked . Selvaratnam says that Schneiderman warned her he could have her followed and her phones tapped , and both say that he threatened to kill them if they broke up with him . A fourth woman , an attorney who has held prominent positions in the New York legal community , says that Schneiderman made an advance toward her ; when she rebuffed him , he slapped her across the face with such force that it left a mark that lingered the next day . She recalls screaming in surprise and pain , and beginning to cry , and says that she felt frightened . I have not assaulted anyone . Selvaratnam was with him from the summer of 2016 until the fall of 2017 . Both are articulate , progressive Democratic feminists in their forties who live in Manhattan . Over the past year , both watched with admiration as other women spoke out about sexual misconduct . February , four months after the first stories about Weinstein broke , Schneiderman announced that his office was filing a civil-rights suit against him . On May 2nd , at the direction of Governor Andrew Cuomo , Schneiderman launched an investigation into the past handling of criminal complaints against Weinstein by the Manhattan District Attorney , Cyrus Vance , Jr. , and the New York City Police Department . The expanding investigation of the Weinstein case puts Schneiderman at the center of one of the most significant sexual-misconduct cases in recent history . But he abuses them privately . Manning Barish includes herself among them . She says that she met Schneiderman in July , 2013 , through mutual friends . Amicably divorced from Chris Barish , a hospitality-industry executive , she was a single mother with a young daughter and socially prominent friends . Schneiderman , who was rising in Democratic politics after being elected attorney general , in 2010 , was also divorced . His ex-wife , Jennifer Cunningham , a lobbyist and political strategist at the firm SKDKnickerbocker , currently serves as one of his political consultants . Barish says that she fell quickly for Schneiderman and was happy to be involved with someone who seemed to share her progressive idealism and enjoy her feistiness . Manning Barish began to see signs of controlling and abusive behavior . The process of having it removed was painful and expensive . In retrospect , she says , it was the first step in trying to control her body . four weeks after they became physically involved , she says , Schneiderman grew violent . One night , they were in the bedroom of his Upper West Side apartment , still clothed but getting ready for bed , and lightly baiting each other . They had both been drinking , and her recollection of their conversation is blurry , but what happened next remains vivid . Schneiderman , she says , backed her up to the edge of his bed . It just came out of nowhere . My ear was ringing . I lost my balance and fell backward onto the bed . I sprang up , but at this point there was very little room between the bed and him . I got up to try to shove him back , or take a swing , and he pushed me back down . He then used his body weight to hold me down , and he began to choke me . The choking was very hard . It was really bad . I kicked . finally freed herself and got back on her feet . To her astonishment , Schneiderman accused her of scratching him . This did not happen while we were having sex . I was fully dressed and remained that way . It was completely unexpected and shocking . He clocked her ear . novelist Salman Rushdie , who dated Manning Barish before Schneiderman did , and who has been her close friend for nearly fifteen years , says that she confided in him as well . Manning Barish went back to him , a decision that she regrets . A few days later , on a weekday afternoon , his security detail drove him to her apartment , and he showed up at her door with an armload of flowers and a case of wine . She found the wine surprising , given the fact that alcohol had fuelled his violent behavior . Barish says that her ear bothered her for months . It often felt painful and clogged , and she kept hearing odd gurgling sounds . Once , blood trickled out , reaching her collarbone . Eventually , Manning Barish sought medical help from Dr. Gwen Korovin , an ear , nose , and throat specialist . Manning Barish thought that the slap might have caused the injury , but when Korovin asked her what had happened she said that she might have injured herself with a Q-tip . For victims , shame plays a huge role in most of these stories . Barish and Schneiderman were together , off and on , for nearly two years . Manning Barish , who is five feet seven , lost thirty pounds , falling to a hundred and three . In a photograph from the period , she looks emaciated ; her hair , she recalls , started to fall out . Barish says that Schneiderman pressed her to consume huge amounts of alcohol . An already half-empty bottle of red wine would be on the counter . He had had a head start . Manning Barish says that Schneiderman often mocked her political activism . Manning Barish broke up with Schneiderman a second time , and then got back together with him . In January , 2015 , she ended the relationship a third time , feeling degraded . Once , she made an oblique reference to Schneiderman on social media , in connection with a political issue . He wrote many laws , including one that created specific penalties for strangulation . He introduced the bill in 2010 , after chairing a committee that investigated domestic-violence charges against the former state senator Hiram Monserrate , a Democrat , who was expelled from the legislature after having been convicted of assaulting his girlfriend . During the hearings , the legislators learned that New York State imposed no specific criminal penalty for choking , even though it is a common prelude to domestic-violence homicides . An accomplished Ivy League-educated lawyer with government experience , she had worked closely with his office in the past , and supported him politically . But , when they arrived at the house , there was no party ; it was where Schneiderman was staying . lawyer and Schneiderman began making out , but he said things that repelled her . He told the woman , a divorced mother , that professional women with big jobs and children had so many decisions to make that , when it came to sex , they secretly wanted men to take charge . He became more sexually aggressive , but she was repulsed by his talk , and pulled away from him . hit her so hard , she says , that the blow left a red handprint . She notes that , in all her years of dating , she has never been in a situation like the one with Schneiderman . She again demanded to be taken home . They got into his car , and it quickly became apparent how intoxicated he was . next day , she told two friends , and sent them a photograph of the mark on her face . Another photograph of the lawyer , taken later that day at a family birthday party , shows faint raised marks splayed on her cheek . Yet she took no official action against him . She notes that he did not hit her again , after she protested . She , too , is divorced . In 2016 , she attended the Democratic National Convention , in Philadelphia , where Schneiderman introduced himself to her . They had both gone to Harvard : she as an undergraduate and a graduate student , he as a law student . She was impressed when he expressed an interest in meditation and Buddhism . began dating , and appeared to be a happy couple . Selvaratnam all but lived in his apartment , attending political functions and dinners with his friends and donors , and brainstorming with him on speeches and projects . Although Schneiderman often doted on her , he demanded that she spend more and more time with him , and he began physically abusing her in bed . Schneiderman was violent , he often made sexual demands . Schneiderman not only slapped her across the face , often four or five times , back and forth , with his open hand ; he also spat at her and choked her . She says that she often asked him to stop hurting her , and tried to push him away . At other times , she gave in , rationalizing that she could tolerate the violence if it happened only once a week or so during sex . He told her to get plastic surgery to remove scars on her torso that had resulted from an operation to remove cancerous tumors . He criticized her hair and said that she should get breast implants and buy different clothes . In the middle of the night , he staggered through the apartment , as if in a trance . His emotional state seemed to worsen after the 2016 Presidential election . Selvaratnam rushed to the hospital . Schneiderman had several stitches above his left eye ; his face was puffy and bruised . He had her send his press secretary a photograph of the injury , and they agreed to cancel a public appearance . These allegations are completely inconsistent with the man I know , who has always been someone of the highest character , outstanding values , and a loving father . understands how incomprehensible it may seem that she stayed in such an abusive relationship for more than a year . She kept telling herself that she could help him change , and tried to get him to see a therapist . At times , she blamed herself for his behavior . unclear if Schneiderman was serious when he made such remarks , but Selvaratnam says that she felt intimidated . Jacquelyn Campbell , a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing , is the author of a danger-assessment checklist that helps authorities gauge the likelihood of homicide in domestic-violence situations . began to spend more time apart from Schneiderman , and last fall she ended the relationship . After the breakup , she , like Manning Barish , sought medical help from an ear , nose , and throat specialist . The doctor could find no specific cause for her ailments . Selvaratnam confided to Senna about the abuse , and Senna was so shocked that she wrote down the details and e-mailed the account to her husband , so that there would be a dated copy of it should any harm come to her friend . advised Selvaratnam to retrieve her belongings from his apartment . Gonnerman asked her who else he had dated . next day , Gonnerman happened to run into a male friend who had once worked with the former girlfriend . He said yes : a close friend of his had . told Selvaratnam about the other victim . In February , Selvaratnam recalls , they sat outside on a bench for ninety minutes , and their stories came flooding forth . According to these notes , the former girlfriend told Selvaratnam that she had been in love with Schneiderman , but that in bed he had routinely slapped her hard across the ear and the face , as tears rolled down her cheeks . He also choked her and spat at her . Not all the abuse had taken place in a sexual context . The blow left a handprint on her back ; the next day , the spot still hurt . A number of them advised her to keep the story to herself , arguing that Schneiderman was too valuable a politician for the Democrats to lose . She described this response as heartbreaking . The image resonated deeply among the women who had dated Schneiderman . I was a hypocrite . I can be silent , which is being complicit , and a betrayal of the other women .

The crowds skewed young , with few baby boomers in sight .

Friday morning , a source inside a South Carolina maximum-security prison who asked me to call him Albert said that the storm had not yet reached him . For the past several days , Albert has barely left his cell . Correctional officers are refusing to let prisoners store extra water , he said . He said the building seemed secure but warned that if heavy rains fell , they could be dangerous for men on the lowest level . reached by phone on Thursday evening , told me that a prison evacuation would have created logistical challenges and public-safety concerns . He confirmed that prisoners were not allowed to store water in bottles and said that even if prisons had been evacuated earlier this week , the storm might have changed course .

Hair is the director of Judge Family Care Home , a ten-resident , privately funded assisted-living facility situated about four miles from the ocean in Wilmington , North Carolina . Hair is responsible for evacuating the other eight , all of whom can walk but who suffer from conditions ranging from dementia to hypertension . Florence is currently a Category 3 hurricane , with maximum sustained winds of a hundred and twenty miles per hour . It could still become a Category 5 hurricane , with winds surpassing a hundred and fifty-seven miles per hour . The eastern tip of North Carolina could end up submerged under nine feet of water , according to some predictions . Nearly two million people living in the Carolinas and Virginia , where President Trump has declared states of emergency , have already been warned to evacuate .

All those branches are going to come down . so that the federal government can determine how much emergency funds Wilmington will get . Bock Clark captures an as-told-to account from Glenn Harbeck , the city director of development , planning , and transportation in Wilmington , North Carolina , about preparing his home and the city for Hurricane Florence . In April , seven men were killed in a bloody prison riot at Lee County Correctional Institution , an understaffed prison in Bishopville , South Carolina . The head of the prison system , Bryan Stirling , claimed that gangs , contraband , and cell phones were to blame . Organizers moved the strike up in response , setting a new start date on the anniversary of the day , in 1971 , that California prison guards shot George Jackson , a member of the Black Panther Party . Other times , you might not know something , and then it shows up on the news , and it sparks interest in everybody . One week into the strike , the union reported that actions seemed to have taken place in prisons , jails , and immigration detention facilities in ten states , and also in Nova Scotia . Accurate numbers were hard to come by , in part because some state-prison officials refused to confirm that a strike had occurred . strike participant spoke to me on August 31st and September 4th from inside a maximum-security prison in South Carolina . He said that the facility has been on lockdown for months , but that he had spread word of the strike on Facebook . brothers want to extend the strike . have us in cells designed for one man with two men . The top bunk is almost six feet from the ground . building is brick . The plumbing is bad , of course . So we save a little water to drink on the weekends . Like a tire shop , or rag plant , or floor crew . Even if we have to spend our own money to fix it . They only give us a bus ticket . So we have to fend for ourselves . director , Mr. Stirling , he mentioned that he wanted to get the cell phones out of prison , so the inmates can focus on rehabilitation . But there is no rehabilitation . The only thing that keeps an inmate sane in here is the cell phone . They dress in their own clothes . Carolina is very , very short on staff . We have , like , two hundred and fifty-two in a building , in one dorm . C.O.s here are not bad people . They live in our neighborhoods , they from around where we from . I have an officer that we talk to on the regular . Just do it in a peaceful manner . I have to say this with the most respect as I can . The complaint came from a woman who accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct when they were both in high school , more than thirty years ago . The allegation dates back to the early nineteen-eighties , when Kavanaugh was a high-school student at Georgetown Preparatory School , in Bethesda , Maryland , and the woman attended a nearby high school . In the letter , the woman alleged that , during an encounter at a party , Kavanaugh held her down , and that he attempted to force himself on her . She claimed in the letter that Kavanaugh and a classmate of his , both of whom had been drinking , turned up music that was playing in the room to conceal the sound of her protests , and that Kavanaugh covered her mouth with his hand . She was able to free herself . Although the alleged incident took place decades ago and the three individuals involved were minors , the woman said that the memory had been a source of ongoing distress for her , and that she had sought psychological treatment as a result . She contacted her congresswoman , Anna Eshoo , a Democrat , sending her a letter describing her allegation . letter was also sent to the office of Senator Dianne Feinstein . weeks later . She had repeatedly reported the allegation to members of Congress and , watching Kavanaugh move toward what looked like an increasingly assured confirmation , she decided to end her effort to come forward , a source close to the woman said . On Wednesday , after media inquiries to the Democratic members multiplied , and concern among congressional colleagues increased , Feinstein agreed to brief the other Democrats on the committee , with no staff present . Feinstein also acted out of a sense that Democrats would be better off focussing on legal , rather than personal , issues in their questioning of Kavanaugh . Farrow is a contributing writer to The New Yorker and a television anchor and investigative reporter whose work also appears on HBO . Cornyn asked , his face a mask of astonishment . justice under law . Kavanaugh said , and then he seemed to search for a clarification . Basically , military commissions , being military , are only supposed to try certain crimes . According to the statute , this would include anything defined as an international war crime before the date that it was enacted , in 2011 . The problem is that Congress was wrong : material support of terrorism was not , in fact , recognized as an international war crime . She wanted to know what he might think of that . Later the same day , CBS announced that Moonves had left the company and would not receive any of his exit compensation , pending the results of the independent investigation into the allegations . detailed allegations by six women that the media executive had sexually harassed them , and revealed complaints by dozens of others that the culture in some parts of the company tolerated sexual misconduct . accuse the board of failing to hold Moonves accountable , new allegations are emerging . Six additional women are now accusing Moonves of sexual harassment or assault in incidents that took place between the nineteen-eighties and the early two-thousands . They include claims that Moonves forced them to perform oral sex on him , that he exposed himself to them without their consent , and that he used physical violence and intimidation against them . A number of the women also said that Moonves retaliated after they rebuffed him , damaging their careers . The two worked together in the late nineteen-eighties . Early this year , Moonves informed a portion of the CBS board about the criminal investigation . Several of the women expressed outrage that Moonves might be enriched by his departure from the company . What is true is that I had consensual relations with three of the women some 25 years ago before I came to CBS . And I have never used my position to hinder the advancement or careers of women . In my 40 years of work , I have never before heard of such disturbing accusations . I can only surmise they are surfacing now for the first time , decades later , as part of a concerted effort by others to destroy my name , my reputation , and my career . Moonves declined to specify which three encounters he considered consensual . worked with Moonves at the television production company Lorimar-Telepictures in the nineteen-eighties . She was already an industry veteran who had held senior positions at NBC , MGM , and Disney . Golden-Gottlieb , who is now in her early eighties and retired , told me that the first incident in which Moonves assaulted her occurred in 1986 , when he was in charge of movies and miniseries at Lorimar and she was the head of comedy development there . Moonves , she recalled , came into her office in the middle of a workday and suggested the two of them go out for lunch . Instead of taking her to a nearby restaurant , she said , Moonves drove her to a secluded area . She said he held her head in place forcibly . When she got there , she said , she vomited . continued to work with Moonves , who was later promoted to more senior positions within Lorimar . She said that she had avoided being alone with Moonves whenever possible in the period after the first assault . He left briefly and , when he returned , she said , he was not wearing pants , and was aroused . She turned away , embarrassed , and ran out of the room . The following day , Moonves approached her in her office and berated her for not sending a memo to another executive . Golden-Gottlieb said that , even years later , she is still frightened of Moonves . He did not disclose the existence of the criminal investigation to a number of CBS board members until several months later . The full board was not informed , and Moonves was allowed to continue running the company . A description of the assignment noted that Moonves , then the president of Warner Bros. . Television , would work out of his hotel room . Pallingston , who was thirty-four at the time , had studied writing at Oberlin College and hoped to break into the industry . Moonves began asking about her career ambitions , and she told him about her writing . Moonves began asking personal questions , including questions about whether she was single and her sexual orientation . He offered her wine , which Pallingston accepted , and poured himself a glass , which he drank quickly . Then Moonves asked her for a massage . Pallingston crossed the room , and Moonves placed her hands on his neck and shoulders , briefly instructing her on how to do it before telling her to sit back down . She recalled him asking if she was afraid of men , and then if she liked powerful men . Frightened and beginning to shake , she said that she did , and Moonves told her to come to him . He had Calvin Klein underpants . Eventually , she said , he told her to lie down on the couch . She tried to leave the room , and he told her to sit down . She collected herself and , after her panic attack subsided , Moonves departed for a meeting . The following spring , however , after she was assigned to work with Moonves again when he made a similar trip to New York , he immediately offered her wine and began groping her breasts . Moonves , sounding skeptical , asked whom she was marrying , and she gave a false name . During the remainder of their time working together , she said , Moonves would bark orders at her , sometimes using obscenities . At one point , he threw a pillow at her to get her attention . On another occasion , he had loud phone sex in front of her . Pallingston told me that her experiences with Moonves worsened a decades-long struggle with anxiety , depression , and controlling her anger . She continued to pursue writing , eventually publishing several books , but abandoned her ambitions of working full-time in television . She said that Pallingston stopped short of disclosing whether she complied . Deborah Green was a freelance makeup artist regularly working for CBS in the early aughts when she says an encounter with Moonves reduced her work at the network . Green had worked with Moonves once before without incident . When she returned with Moonves to his office to remove his makeup , he pointed to his shoulders and asked for a massage . Moonves had complimented a ring on her finger , and she had mentioned that it was a gift from her boyfriend . Green told me that she assumed she had made clear to Moonves that she was not interested in any sort of overture . She was further assured , she said , when Moonves began asking about her boyfriend . Green recalled shoving Moonves back , shocked . He appeared dismayed and abruptly turned and left , shutting himself in an adjoining bathroom . Green said she held back tears as she left the building , then cried as she drove from the CBS offices to her home . For several days , Green said , she struggled with whether to report the incident . Shortly after , she spoke to her father , who confirmed to me that the two discussed the incident and the risks of filing a complaint . Green decided to remain silent . weeks later , Green said , she called the CBS employee who usually assigned her work for the company . One evening , she told me , Moonves asked her to come to his office to discuss several projects . He mentioned televisions and cars as examples . She declined but he insisted . As Moonves began to drink , Morris , growing nervous , excused herself to get a cigarette from her office . Walking back , she noticed a security guard and thought she could call for help if necessary . I said no . He knew how to win people over . One night , Morris said , Moonves offered to drive her to her car as they walked out of the office after dark . Holding Morris by both shoulders , Moonves pulled her toward him in what she took to be an attempt to force a kiss . Moonves stopped , appearing momentarily shocked . Morris scrambled out of the car and ran . that encounter , Morris said , Moonves refused to speak to her , and she was frozen out of meetings at Lorimar . Both discouraged her . Morris left the entertainment industry and moved to the Bay Area , later taking jobs in technology and health care . She had told Moonves no numerous times , but said he continued his advances . Absolutely incredible . Six years earlier , when she was an assistant , and he was a vice-president at Twentieth Century Fox , Moonves had propositioned her , offering to help her career , and the two had consensual sexual encounters in his office over the course of about a month . After he discussed his wife and children during one liaison , Silverthorn said , she stopped the encounters . The two had friendly interactions at industry events in the intervening years , and Silverthorn believed that she could turn to Moonves as a professional contact . told me that Moonves shut the door , took several swigs of coffee , grabbed her , and pulled her up from the chair where she was seated . Silverthorn , who was in a long-term , committed relationship at the time , said she was in shock . She departed the meeting and never contacted Moonves again . She told several people over the years and discussed with her daughter the possibility of speaking publicly . new allegations against Moonves relate to women who worked with him as massage therapists . Two former senior members of the staff at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington , D.C. , told me that , in the late nineties and early aughts , massage therapists at its spa repeatedly complained of sexual misconduct by Moonves . Kitay , who formerly worked as a massage therapist in Los Angeles , told me that Moonves harassed her when she gave him massages at his office and home in the late nineties . On another , Moonves threw off the sheet covering him and exposed himself to her . She said that Moonves continued to proposition her , until she told him that she was attracted to women . Kitay told her romantic partner at the time , Jael Greenleaf , who remembered Kitay raising the issue repeatedly over the course of several months . Kitay also called her brother David , a film composer , about the situation . Years later , she was convicted of a count of wire fraud for participating in a deceptive real-estate scheme . At CBS News , the situation has been particularly fraught , with employees being asked to speak to law-firm investigators as their superiors , accused of misconduct , continue to work at the company . Others said that Fager protected men accused of misconduct , including men who reported to him . CBS announced that Fager would remain in his current position until an investigation by an outside law firm was completed . In a speech to staff last month after returning from vacation , Fager addressed the allegations . She said that , upon arriving at the program , she was thrilled by the work but troubled by the culture . The first , she said , was at a work party at a bar near the CBS News offices in Manhattan . But she was troubled enough by the incident that , shortly afterward , she told a male producer , who corroborated her story . On the one other occasion when Johansen interacted with Fager directly , she and a fellow-intern invited him to lunch . She was excited that he accepted . she asked . initial allegations also included claims by nineteen current and former employees that Fager had tolerated harassment in the division . accusing Fager of tolerating abusive behavior by other male producers . But the contract also allows him to depart of his own volition , with generous compensation , for a range of reasons , including any diminishment of his responsibilities , or , if , at any time , a majority of the CBS board members change . The vast majority of board members are allied with Moonves in an ongoing legal battle between Shari Redstone , the president of the holding company that controls Viacom and CBS , who has sought to merge the companies , and Moonves , who has resisted that effort . A number of individuals whom the firms have asked to interview said that they were concerned about the independence of the two firms , given the large amount of legal work they do for CBS . Golden-Gottlieb , one of several women in this story who has volunteered to speak to investigators , said that she had little faith that Moonves would face meaningful consequences . Now , a month and a half after the last of those deadlines has passed , more than four hundred children remain separated from their parents . advocates have argued that the government is making eligibility determinations based on nebulous evidence . But , for a number of reasons , lawyers have not yet had a chance to raise their specific concerns with the judge . Monday , I spoke with one of the parents , a thirty-one-year-old asylum seeker from El Salvador who asked to be identified by her middle name , Ivette . She is in a detention center in Laredo , Texas . Her lawyers , from the National Immigrant Justice Center , a group based in Chicago , put money on her phone card so that she could talk to me . Every fifteen minutes , an automated voice interrupted us , in Spanish , to tell us our time was up . Ivette called back twice , speaking in a soft but unwavering voice . Three days after they were apprehended while crossing the border near McAllen , Texas , Border Patrol agents separated them . It was a month before they spoke by phone , she told me , and their first call lasted less than ten minutes . Since then , Ivette said , the government has arranged five phone calls between her and her son , each about seven minutes long . The first few times they spoke , he was more animated , she said , calling out to her and occasionally singing songs . Sabraw had set a deadline for the government to reunite parents with children under the age of five by July 10th . More than a week passed before Ivette was told that she was not considered eligible , which she only discovered after lawyers took up her case and pressed the government for an explanation . That spring , she rented a room in a house in a small municipality along the western coast of El Salvador . She was selling beauty products at the time and lived alone with her infant son . One night , in July , she was in her room , a small space with a window at the back of the house , when she heard a commotion outside . Then I heard the sounds of cars pulling up . I heard the voices of the police . When she emerged , she told me , one of the policemen pointed a gun at her and demanded to know where the people outside had gone . few nights later , as she was returning home from a local market , a group of young men accosted her . They beat her , and threatened to kill her for having talked to the police . Eventually , a car pulled up , and the group scattered , leaving her bleeding and vomiting on the street . The next day , she left town to stay with her mother , in San Salvador , where she immediately faced another problem . Gangsters frequently stop residents to examine their identity documents , and they sometimes kill those whose home addresses correspond to neighborhoods controlled by a rival outfit . Ivette , who hid her documents and rarely went out , eventually decided to flee north with her son . law , the U.S. government is responsible for insuring that the children in its custody are reunited with parents who will not cause them harm . But serious questions remain as to whether the Trump Administration is going too far in denying these parents the right to see their children , particularly since the government separated the families in the first place . At the end of last month , the Trump Administration listed thirty-five cases in which parents had disqualifying criminal histories . According to the A.C.L.U. , the number is closer to fifty . Some separated parents have been accused of belonging to the very gangs they insist they were fleeing . Central American migrants as gang members and rarely have to substantiate their allegations in court . The reality on the ground in Central America can make it impossible for a migrant to shed associations with the gangs even after being victimized by them . This is what happens if you want to survive . The language is vague , and the information is riddled with inconsistencies . officials have visited Ivette and the other detainees in her cell block to bring legal documents and field questions . past week , Ivette got sick . He has twice been a finalist for a Livingston Award . At first , all seemed to be going according to plan . He made it to El Paso , Texas , where an immigration officer told him that he had a strong case . Soon after , he moved to Little Rock , Arkansas , and started working to send remittances back to his family , including his one-year-old daughter . He was relieved to walk around his new neighborhood without having to look over his shoulder . He was in shock . He insisted that he had done things by the book : presenting himself at a port of entry , providing documentation of his plight , never missing a hearing . Last April , he was deported back to El Salvador . In 2017 , immigration judges rejected sixty-one per cent of all asylum cases , the highest denial rate in a decade . But he is still living in a state of uncertainty . Twenty-five years had passed since President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 , drawing hundreds of thousands of Koreans to the United States . New York City , and Queens in particular , was a prime destination . Today , there are as many Korean-Americans in Queens as there were in the entire U.S. in 1970 . Morning and night , dozens of mostly middle-aged Korean and Chinese immigrants pay a small fee for a bus ticket . Once at the casino , they receive free vouchers for food and gaming , which they then sell for forty dollars or so on the black market . A few thought that they recognized him . The search for his brother continues . Hair is responsible for evacuating the other eight , all of whom can walk but who suffer from conditions ranging from dementia to hypertension . Florence is currently a Category 3 hurricane , with maximum sustained winds of a hundred and twenty miles per hour . It could still become a Category 5 hurricane , with winds surpassing a hundred and fifty-seven miles per hour .

Nearly two million people living in the Carolinas and Virginia , where President Trump has declared states of emergency , have already been warned to evacuate .

Honnold hid his Candlewood Suites room key and his flip-flops under a fence . boyish thirty-three-year-old Berkeley dropout who often sleeps in a Sprinter van , Honnold had donned brand-new climbing shoes and applied chalk to his large hands . Climbing this way , without safety gear , is called free soloing . Honnold is the greatest climber of this kind in history . perhaps the most famous and beautiful rock face in the world , in less than four hours . Afterward , Honnold hiked back down a trail and executed a few rounds of finger pull-ups in his van . The building , constructed two years ago , is a cantilevered tower that resembles a series of hastily stacked blocks . He spent ten minutes there , watched people smoking below , and further assessed the building . fall to their deaths . Honnold has voluntarily had his brain examined , curious whether his ability to hold himself together perched thousands of feet off the ground on marble-size nubs and flakes of rock is indicative of some neurological abnormality . His emotion-processing amygdala is intact , it seems . Most of his climbing is roped . He re-chalked his hands with a pouch tied to his waist and kept moving . His foot slipped at one point . passed people sleeping a few feet from him and tried not to bang his feet against their windows . He quickly scurried past a man who might have been undressed . He saw people watching television , staring at their computers , and doing other mundane things . It was kind of a weird deal . stopped at the twenty-fourth floor , about an hour into the climb , where a balcony jutted out far enough to give him room to recline . So he took out his phone and texted Barry to ask if someone would let him inside whenever convenient . He removed his shoes . Then he called his girlfriend , on the West Coast . He tried to stay out of sporadic rain for the next three hours . He caught up on news . Lightning struck in the distance . To stay warm , he huddled near the exhaust coming out of an air-conditioning vent . compared the climb to his alpine adventures . In at least one respect , his urban free-solo adventure was more hardcore . ten minutes before five on Friday morning , Sandro Braga , a maintenance man at the Urby , took the elevator up to a vacant unit on the twenty-fourth floor , went inside , and flipped on a light . Braga usually responds to toilet clogs , fire alarms , and leaks of various kinds . Braga had unscrewed the window to let Honnold in . Honnold exclaimed , before heading back to his hotel to get some rest . Then he paused . He had no idea where to go . Honnold climbing a building . It also accused P.L.O. I reached Zomlot by phone on Monday , in Ramallah , the West Bank capital , in between crisis meetings with the Palestinian leadership . He had been notified of the closure in a telephone call from the State Department , followed by a formal letter . On Monday , the State Department warned Palestinians against responding to the latest U.S. ruling with violent protests . U.S. diplomats reacted with skepticism . for the Trump peace plan were already bleak . A joint survey of Palestinians and Israelis released last month found that only forty-three per cent on both sides of the conflict still support a two-state solution . More than a thousand Palestinians died in the violence during that time . The second intifada erupted in 2000 and lasted more than four years . Trump Administration also tried to link its decision to close the P.L.O. unarmed civilians with live ammunition during the Great Return March in Gaza . A statement issued on Monday by the P.L.O. . The prospects , however , look grim . Bashir is an unlikely peace-builder at one of the darkest times in the elusive effort to end the conflict in the Middle East . He was eleven when the second intifada erupted , in 2000 , and the Israel Defense Forces took over the family farm in Gaza . During the next five years their home was turned into a military post , with twenty to a hundred soldiers occupying the second and third floors at any given time . The I.D.F. . The family began keeping buckets in the living room , just in case . Khalil took this as a good omen . Despite the humiliation , Khalil gracefully complied when the soldiers asked him to strip in front of his family after returning from work , to insure that he had no weapons . In 2004 , a week after he turned fifteen , Bashir returned from school to find three U.N. officials visiting his father . The Israelis , ensconced in a nearby tower , soon ordered the U.N. team to leave . As Bashir and his father walked the officials to their car , a single gunshot from an M-16 automatic rifle rang out . The bullet went so deep into his back that the doctors could see through to his spine . cycle of surgeries and therapy went on for months . Israeli patients and their families offered encouragement . Jewish student volunteers came to play games . Hasidic groups even serenaded him with Passover songs . He particularly admired his nurse , Seema , an Iraqi Jew . Once he learned to walk again , he was determined to cross the social and political abyss . His journey has included a Seeds of Peace camp with Israeli kids in Maine , a Quaker school in the West Bank , a boarding school in heavily Mormon Utah , and a graduate degree in conflict and coexistence from Brandeis University . He won a Scoville Peace Fellowship and worked with Partnership for a Secure America on Capitol Hill . with the Virginia Democrat Gerald Connolly , who suggested that Bashir , who is now twenty-nine , may someday be President of the Palestinian people . While on the Hill , Bashir went with a group of Israeli students to meet Senator Bernie Sanders . The book ends with its own peace offering : a letter to the anonymous shooter who disabled him . You have the same humanity as I have . You are part of the same family as I am . chemical weapons , outlawed by international treaty , against his own people , including children . by firing Tomahawk missiles at the airbase used by the Syrian warplanes that dropped the toxic bombs .

The order has stuck . The one exception is if a foreign leader presents an immediate national-security threat to the U.S. during wartime . The same applies to the Syrian leader . for now , Trump has no legal authority to target Assad . Later the same day , CBS announced that Moonves had left the company and would not receive any of his exit compensation , pending the results of the independent investigation into the allegations . detailed allegations by six women that the media executive had sexually harassed them , and revealed complaints by dozens of others that the culture in some parts of the company tolerated sexual misconduct . accuse the board of failing to hold Moonves accountable , new allegations are emerging . Six additional women are now accusing Moonves of sexual harassment or assault in incidents that took place between the nineteen-eighties and the early two-thousands . They include claims that Moonves forced them to perform oral sex on him , that he exposed himself to them without their consent , and that he used physical violence and intimidation against them . A number of the women also said that Moonves retaliated after they rebuffed him , damaging their careers . The two worked together in the late nineteen-eighties . Early this year , Moonves informed a portion of the CBS board about the criminal investigation . Several of the women expressed outrage that Moonves might be enriched by his departure from the company . What is true is that I had consensual relations with three of the women some 25 years ago before I came to CBS . And I have never used my position to hinder the advancement or careers of women . In my 40 years of work , I have never before heard of such disturbing accusations . I can only surmise they are surfacing now for the first time , decades later , as part of a concerted effort by others to destroy my name , my reputation , and my career . Moonves declined to specify which three encounters he considered consensual . worked with Moonves at the television production company Lorimar-Telepictures in the nineteen-eighties . She was already an industry veteran who had held senior positions at NBC , MGM , and Disney . Golden-Gottlieb , who is now in her early eighties and retired , told me that the first incident in which Moonves assaulted her occurred in 1986 , when he was in charge of movies and miniseries at Lorimar and she was the head of comedy development there . Moonves , she recalled , came into her office in the middle of a workday and suggested the two of them go out for lunch . Instead of taking her to a nearby restaurant , she said , Moonves drove her to a secluded area . She said he held her head in place forcibly . When she got there , she said , she vomited . continued to work with Moonves , who was later promoted to more senior positions within Lorimar . She said that she had avoided being alone with Moonves whenever possible in the period after the first assault . He left briefly and , when he returned , she said , he was not wearing pants , and was aroused . She turned away , embarrassed , and ran out of the room . The following day , Moonves approached her in her office and berated her for not sending a memo to another executive . Golden-Gottlieb said that , even years later , she is still frightened of Moonves . He did not disclose the existence of the criminal investigation to a number of CBS board members until several months later . The full board was not informed , and Moonves was allowed to continue running the company . A description of the assignment noted that Moonves , then the president of Warner Bros. . Television , would work out of his hotel room . Pallingston , who was thirty-four at the time , had studied writing at Oberlin College and hoped to break into the industry . Moonves began asking about her career ambitions , and she told him about her writing . Moonves began asking personal questions , including questions about whether she was single and her sexual orientation . He offered her wine , which Pallingston accepted , and poured himself a glass , which he drank quickly . Then Moonves asked her for a massage . Pallingston crossed the room , and Moonves placed her hands on his neck and shoulders , briefly instructing her on how to do it before telling her to sit back down . She recalled him asking if she was afraid of men , and then if she liked powerful men . Frightened and beginning to shake , she said that she did , and Moonves told her to come to him . He had Calvin Klein underpants . Eventually , she said , he told her to lie down on the couch . She tried to leave the room , and he told her to sit down . She collected herself and , after her panic attack subsided , Moonves departed for a meeting . The following spring , however , after she was assigned to work with Moonves again when he made a similar trip to New York , he immediately offered her wine and began groping her breasts . Moonves , sounding skeptical , asked whom she was marrying , and she gave a false name . During the remainder of their time working together , she said , Moonves would bark orders at her , sometimes using obscenities . At one point , he threw a pillow at her to get her attention . On another occasion , he had loud phone sex in front of her . Pallingston told me that her experiences with Moonves worsened a decades-long struggle with anxiety , depression , and controlling her anger . She continued to pursue writing , eventually publishing several books , but abandoned her ambitions of working full-time in television . She said that Pallingston stopped short of disclosing whether she complied . Deborah Green was a freelance makeup artist regularly working for CBS in the early aughts when she says an encounter with Moonves reduced her work at the network . Green had worked with Moonves once before without incident . When she returned with Moonves to his office to remove his makeup , he pointed to his shoulders and asked for a massage . Moonves had complimented a ring on her finger , and she had mentioned that it was a gift from her boyfriend . Green told me that she assumed she had made clear to Moonves that she was not interested in any sort of overture . She was further assured , she said , when Moonves began asking about her boyfriend . Green recalled shoving Moonves back , shocked . He appeared dismayed and abruptly turned and left , shutting himself in an adjoining bathroom . Green said she held back tears as she left the building , then cried as she drove from the CBS offices to her home . For several days , Green said , she struggled with whether to report the incident . Shortly after , she spoke to her father , who confirmed to me that the two discussed the incident and the risks of filing a complaint . Green decided to remain silent . weeks later , Green said , she called the CBS employee who usually assigned her work for the company . One evening , she told me , Moonves asked her to come to his office to discuss several projects . He mentioned televisions and cars as examples . She declined but he insisted . As Moonves began to drink , Morris , growing nervous , excused herself to get a cigarette from her office . Walking back , she noticed a security guard and thought she could call for help if necessary . I said no . He knew how to win people over . One night , Morris said , Moonves offered to drive her to her car as they walked out of the office after dark . Holding Morris by both shoulders , Moonves pulled her toward him in what she took to be an attempt to force a kiss . Moonves stopped , appearing momentarily shocked . Morris scrambled out of the car and ran . that encounter , Morris said , Moonves refused to speak to her , and she was frozen out of meetings at Lorimar . Both discouraged her . Morris left the entertainment industry and moved to the Bay Area , later taking jobs in technology and health care . She had told Moonves no numerous times , but said he continued his advances . Absolutely incredible . Six years earlier , when she was an assistant , and he was a vice-president at Twentieth Century Fox , Moonves had propositioned her , offering to help her career , and the two had consensual sexual encounters in his office over the course of about a month . After he discussed his wife and children during one liaison , Silverthorn said , she stopped the encounters . The two had friendly interactions at industry events in the intervening years , and Silverthorn believed that she could turn to Moonves as a professional contact . told me that Moonves shut the door , took several swigs of coffee , grabbed her , and pulled her up from the chair where she was seated . Silverthorn , who was in a long-term , committed relationship at the time , said she was in shock . She departed the meeting and never contacted Moonves again . She told several people over the years and discussed with her daughter the possibility of speaking publicly . new allegations against Moonves relate to women who worked with him as massage therapists . Two former senior members of the staff at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington , D.C. , told me that , in the late nineties and early aughts , massage therapists at its spa repeatedly complained of sexual misconduct by Moonves . Kitay , who formerly worked as a massage therapist in Los Angeles , told me that Moonves harassed her when she gave him massages at his office and home in the late nineties . On another , Moonves threw off the sheet covering him and exposed himself to her . She said that Moonves continued to proposition her , until she told him that she was attracted to women . Kitay told her romantic partner at the time , Jael Greenleaf , who remembered Kitay raising the issue repeatedly over the course of several months . Kitay also called her brother David , a film composer , about the situation . Years later , she was convicted of a count of wire fraud for participating in a deceptive real-estate scheme . At CBS News , the situation has been particularly fraught , with employees being asked to speak to law-firm investigators as their superiors , accused of misconduct , continue to work at the company . Others said that Fager protected men accused of misconduct , including men who reported to him . CBS announced that Fager would remain in his current position until an investigation by an outside law firm was completed . In a speech to staff last month after returning from vacation , Fager addressed the allegations . She said that , upon arriving at the program , she was thrilled by the work but troubled by the culture . The first , she said , was at a work party at a bar near the CBS News offices in Manhattan . But she was troubled enough by the incident that , shortly afterward , she told a male producer , who corroborated her story . On the one other occasion when Johansen interacted with Fager directly , she and a fellow-intern invited him to lunch . She was excited that he accepted . she asked . initial allegations also included claims by nineteen current and former employees that Fager had tolerated harassment in the division . accusing Fager of tolerating abusive behavior by other male producers . But the contract also allows him to depart of his own volition , with generous compensation , for a range of reasons , including any diminishment of his responsibilities , or , if , at any time , a majority of the CBS board members change . The vast majority of board members are allied with Moonves in an ongoing legal battle between Shari Redstone , the president of the holding company that controls Viacom and CBS , who has sought to merge the companies , and Moonves , who has resisted that effort . A number of individuals whom the firms have asked to interview said that they were concerned about the independence of the two firms , given the large amount of legal work they do for CBS . Golden-Gottlieb , one of several women in this story who has volunteered to speak to investigators , said that she had little faith that Moonves would face meaningful consequences . Farrow is a contributing writer to The New Yorker and a television anchor and investigative reporter whose work also appears on HBO . His portfolio includes the premium cable channel Showtime , the publishing house Simon & Schuster , and a streaming service , CBS All Access . Moonves , who is sixty-eight , has a reputation for canny hiring and project selection . In the tumultuous field of network television , he has enjoyed rare longevity as a leader . movement . In December , he helped found the Commission on Eliminating Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality in the Workplace , which is chaired by Anita Hill . Six women who had professional dealings with him told me that , between the nineteen-eighties and the late aughts , Moonves sexually harassed them . Four described forcible touching or kissing during business meetings , in what they said appeared to be a practiced routine . Two told me that Moonves physically intimidated them or threatened to derail their careers . All said that he became cold or hostile after they rejected his advances , and that they believed their careers suffered as a result . All the women said they still feared that speaking out would lead to retaliation from Moonves , who is known in the industry for his ability to make or break careers . Other claims are being reported here for the first time . I recognize that there were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances . Those were mistakes , and I regret them immensely . According to CBS , there have been no misconduct claims and no settlements against Moonves during his twenty-four years at the network . allegations are surfacing at a time when CBS is engaged in an increasingly acrimonious fight with its former parent company , Viacom , which acquired CBS in 1999 and spun it off as a separate entity seven years later . All of the women making allegations against Moonves began speaking to me before the current lawsuits , in independent interviews carried out during the past eight months . All said that they were not motivated by any allegiance in the corporate battle . At the time , she was meeting with networks , looking for a deal to write and perform for television . Moonves , who was then the president of CBS Entertainment , seemed to take a personal interest in her . Prophet relayed the concern to Douglas , who was surprised and confused : the reading , in front of a group of CBS executives , had elicited uproarious laughter . Moonves , she said , had taken her by the shoulders and congratulated her . Moonves had told Prophet that he wanted to meet with Douglas , alone , to insure that they were creatively aligned . By then , Douglas had worked closely with Moonves for months . Douglas , whose nearly decade-long relationship with Scorsese was coming to an end , was caught off guard . She recalled lying limp and unresponsive beneath him . I was just looking at this nice picture of his family and his kids . She said it was only when Moonves , aroused , pulled up her skirt and began to thrust against her that her fear overcame her paralysis . She told herself that she had to do something to stop him . Moonves frowned and got up . She scrambled to find her briefcase . she said , followed her to the door and blocked her path . He backed her up to the wall , pressing against her , with his face close to hers . Moonves released her and , without looking at her , walked away . Prophet , her manager , called and , as Douglas worked up the nerve to tell her what had happened , Prophet said that she had just got off the phone with Moonves . Later that day , Douglas returned to the house she was renting and told a friend who was staying with her , the actor Craig Chester , about the incident . Everything came back to me . Her distress was evident to her co-stars . the second rehearsal , Moonves took Douglas aside . She took it as a reference to her failure to comply with his advances and to maintain her composure afterward . days into rehearsals , Moonves called Douglas at home . told me that Moonves and CBS Business Affairs called her to say that Douglas would be replaced on the show and that her deal would be cancelled . Douglas said that her agent , Patrick Whitesell , who was then at Creative Artists Agency , later called to say that the agency wished her well in future endeavors of her own . Scorsese said that he remembers Douglas calling him about the allegation and being shocked by it . Scorsese urged her to be cautious about taking legal action against such a powerful person , but agreed to refer her to his law firm ; there , Douglas began working with an attorney named Bill Sobel . Sobel confirmed that Douglas had described the encounter with Moonves at the time , and his contemporaneous notes back up her account . Sobel , who said that he had a frank conversation with Douglas about the risks of suing , ultimately called CBS to attempt to recoup some of her lost wages . After a junior staff member at CBS Business Affairs told Sobel that Douglas had been fired because of her poor performance in rehearsals , and that the network intended to withhold her pay , Sobel suggested that he ask Moonves about the meeting he had had alone with Douglas . after the offer came , Douglas received a call from Moonves . Although she wanted accountability , she was still frightened , and said that she would do it . I was an executive producer . She also performed the story before audiences . In two instances , years later , personal connections helped her secure acting roles on shows that aired on the network , and a Web series of hers appeared on a CBS streaming service . She told me that she was doing so because she wanted to protect other women , and that she wished she had been warned before her meeting . The producer Mike Marvin liked an idea that Jones had for a screenplay , and helped broker a meeting between her and Moonves , who at the time was a vice-president at Twentieth Century Fox . Moonves surprised her by asking if she wanted a glass of wine . She declined , sat down on the couch , and began pitching her screenplay . Moonves , she said , began trying to kiss her . Moonves , appearing startled , got up . Jones began to leave . She was terrified . She remembered Moonves walking to his desk or to a nearby bureau to unlock the door , rather than doing so directly . She fled , noticing on her way out that the assistant had left . drove to the house of a friend , the artist Linda Salzman Sagan . Sagan told me that she remembers the visit clearly , and that Jones described the incident in detail at the time . I was really astounded by what she told me . Marvin told me that he remembers introducing Jones to Moonves , and that she was troubled by the meeting . Moonves , Marvin said , became furious . I will ruin your career . You will never get a writing job . No one will hire you . told me that she found the threats more scarring than the original incident . other women described Moonves forcibly touching or kissing them during business meetings . The producer Christine Peters was an industry veteran when she first encountered Moonves , in the early aughts . She became a close friend and confidante of Sumner Redstone , the owner of Viacom , to whom she was at times romantically linked in the press . After Viacom acquired CBS , Redstone enlisted Peters to help build a rapport with Moonves , who was the president and C.E.O. of CBS Television at the time . In 2006 , Moonves , who had become the chairman of CBS , had dinner with Peters and Redstone to discuss his plans to launch a film studio , CBS Films , which was founded the next year . Moonves was considering executives to oversee the endeavor , and Redstone suggested Peters . Moonves and Peters met at his office to discuss the prospect , Peters told me , she came with a detailed presentation on her business model , which focussed on female audiences . She was sitting on a couch and , as she continued her pitch , he sat down uncomfortably close . Immediately , she worried about how Moonves would react to a rejection . Fearing further advances , Peters said that she had a driver outside . She had come to the meeting with a colleague , who was waiting in the lobby . The colleague told me that Peters emerged earlier than anticipated , appearing shaken , and said that they had to leave quickly . Last year , Peters told him that the executive was Moonves . She said that she was surprised in part because she thought her relationship with Redstone would have put Moonves on guard . In the end , she decided not to tell Redstone , because she worried about what the fallout might be . prominent actress who played a police officer on a long-running CBS program , who was too frightened of reprisals to use her name , said that she also attended a business meeting with Moonves that ended in unwanted advances . The actress had known Moonves for years . There , Moonves told the actress that he had long had a crush on her but had not said anything to her because she had been in a relationship with a mutual friend . She declined his advance but thanked him for lunch . In 1995 , when Moonves became president of CBS Entertainment , the actress called to congratulate him . afterward , CBS Business Affairs informed the actress that her series deal with CBS was being terminated . She called Moonves and expressed shock . He requested a lunch meeting in his private dining room at the office . At the lunch , Moonves told her that he intended to focus on younger talent , and that she was too old . She did so , pushing food around her plate until she had to leave . she pushed him away . As she left , she began to cry . Douglas , the actress said that she never worked for CBS again . Almost two decades later , an executive at CBS contacted her about coming back to the network . It turned out that the executive wanted her to sign a book deal with Simon & Schuster , which is owned by CBS . At an event not long afterward , she encountered a showrunner who has overseen multiple programs at CBS , and told her the story . She and her sister and producing partner , Julie Kirgo , met with Moonves and others about a television deal . Kirgo replied that she and Julie would be happy to have dinner with him . and her sister never heard from Moonves again . Kirgo told me that she had never heard complaints before , and that she believed saying no to Moonves had hurt her career . She was shocked . She said that the turn from business meeting to sexual overture seemed to be well practiced . is a multibillion-dollar corporation , with dozens of divisions , and Moonves is only indirectly involved with many of them . However , experts on sexual harassment told me that misconduct by a chief executive can reverberate across aspects of even the largest companies . current and former CBS employees described harassment , gender discrimination , or retaliation at the network . Many said that men accused of misconduct were promoted , even after the company was made aware of those allegations . Their stories match several that have already emerged in public reports . Earlier this year , Leslie Isaacs , a vice-president at Pop , the cable channel jointly operated by CBS and the film studio Lionsgate , filed a lawsuit alleging that CBS was aware of a hostile workplace at the channel . -LRB- Isaacs has entered into a private mediation process with CBS . He had retained his position for more than a year after the company was made aware of the claims . -LRB- This season , Kern stepped down from his position as showrunner , but he remains a consulting producer . allegations have centered on CBS News . -LRB- The network has since reached a settlement with Gee , and her attorney declined to comment . In 2015 , a CBS reporter , Kenneth Lombardi , alleged in a lawsuit that a CBS News supervisor texted him links to pornography , and that a senior producer had grabbed his crotch . Six former employees told me that Fager , while inebriated at company parties , would touch employees in ways that made them uncomfortable . According to several people who were told about the incident at the time , a senior producer named Vicki Gordon alleged that another senior producer , Michael Radutzky , threatened to throw furniture at her and twisted her arm behind her back , causing her to scream . The sources told me that Fager said he would address the matter with Radutzky directly , and instructed Gordon not to inform the CBS office of human resources . Later , Fager asked her to apologize to Radutzky , to mitigate conflict in the office . All of them worked their way up the ranks and are now managers of our broadcast . Half of our producers and a majority of our associate producers are women . Former employees told me that there were few avenues for them to register confidential complaints about discrimination and misconduct . Some said that they had witnessed retaliation against those who did attempt to speak out . Two other women told me that they had experienced similar conduct from Rosen . Days after she made her complaint to Fager , he and two of his deputies called Nosheen into a meeting to go over criticisms of her work performance which she found specious . One involved a tense exchange with a co-worker that had happened a year earlier . The format of the meeting , she said , was highly unusual . June , 2016 , Nosheen filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . She resigned a month later . An e-mail from a CBS lawyer shows that , after Nosheen left the network , CBS threatened to enforce a non-compete clause in her contract , which would prevent her from seeking employment elsewhere , unless she withdrew her E.E.O.C. complaint and signed a nondisclosure agreement . The woman told me that she eventually left the network because of the atmosphere . The women who received those payments were required to sign nondisclosure agreements that prevented them from speaking about their experiences , with penalties for any breach . Several other women who have made allegations against CBS News declined to speak with me on the record , citing nondisclosure agreements . In the end , the paper published a story that included complaints of harassment against Charlie Rose from dozens of women , but not allegations about Fager or Rosen . Nothing that met our longstanding standards for publication was left out . CBS employees told me that they were alarmed by the attempts to kill the reporting . The system has lawyers and a good reputation . Some more than others . It was a message to all CBS employees , from Moonves . is not the only network to face complaints of sexual harassment in recent years . both resigned after allegations were made against them . told me that addressing patterns of harassment at a company as large as CBS generally depends on reform at the highest levels . The commission is made up of , and funded by , industry leaders , and its members are not vetted . Illeana Douglas knew people who were associated with the commission , and considered telling them her story , until she saw that Moonves was also a member . Instead of being about enemies in a distant war zone , however , the network described in the memo consisted of former aides to President Barack Obama . memo is unsigned and undated , and Trump Administration officials familiar with it offered conflicting accounts of who authored it and whether it originated inside or outside the White House . The officials said that it was circulated within the National Security Council and other parts of the Trump White House in early 2017 . They said the memo may have had additional pages . provided its operatives with instructions and other briefing materials that included the same ideas and names discussed in the memo . Black Cube has declined to answer questions about who hired it to collect damaging information on Rhodes and Kahl , citing client confidentiality . Briefing people . Operatives approached targeted individuals to elicit potentially damaging statements about Rhodes and Kahl . At least one of those conversations , with a commentator on the list , Trita Parsi , was secretly recorded . Responsible for higher-level strategy and higher-level fundraising . - Ben Rhodes . - Jake Sullivan . These are the ones who are likely reaching out to reporters to plant stories and then using a comms infrastructure to amplify those stories on listservs and in social media . These are the people who would be behind coordinated attacks such as the one against Seb Gorka . These people have also had very close working and personal relationships going back to the Obama campaign of 2007-2008 . - Colin Kahl -LRB- likely ops chief -RRB- . Former NSA to VP Biden . Now on the faculty at Georgetown . - Jon Finer , former senior advisor to Sec Kerry and former Director of Policy Planning at State Dept. In 2017 , Adam was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in feature writing for a story about an American diplomat wrongly accused of spying . chemical weapons , outlawed by international treaty , against his own people , including children . by firing Tomahawk missiles at the airbase used by the Syrian warplanes that dropped the toxic bombs .

The same applies to the Syrian leader . for now , Trump has no legal authority to target Assad . have been forgotten . Merely dismissing it as fiction was never going to work . Amazingly , it is no longer big news when the occupant of the Oval Office is shown to be callous , ignorant , nasty , and untruthful . Many of those grownups are now gone , fired by Trump or pushed out by scandal , and for months they have been telling people how bad it was , or how much they did to stop the President , or how much worse it could have been . We fully recognize what is happening . Reading the Op-Ed , I immediately thought of an amazing passage in the book , which quoted a summary of a national-security meeting written by a White House official -LRB- and which never even made it into the news accounts about the book -RRB- . That is , for now , what passes for the Republican wing of the resistance . The Republicans who control Capitol Hill have not joined , or even made token moves toward addressing these significant concerns raised by members of their own party . Such objections to the nascent Republican resistance are understandable ; this is not the principled public combat of a democratic system as envisaged by the Founders . It is secretive and uncomfortable , the stuff of office backstabbing and private betrayals . It is not enough for those who have staked out public opposition to Trump , and it likely never will be . It is about ego and vanity as much as patriotism and principle . Most of all , it is a reminder of the terrible dilemma that Trump has posed for Republicans since the moment he announced his campaign for President , and will pose as long as he is in office . The news seemed very much consistent with what both of us had been hearing since the beginning of the Administration . I spoke with suggested less well-known names in the senior ranks of various foreign-policy and national-security jobs , or in top economic posts . One prominent Washingtonian sent me a long e-mail laying out the case for John Bolton , the national-security adviser whose hawkish views on such subjects as North Korea and Russia have been repeatedly undercut by Trump . denials seemed like some of those pointless , if required , Washington rituals . another book that Sarah Huckabee Sanders presumably did not read but should have : at the center of the tale is the story of how the F.B.I. , outraged by the flagrant lawlessness of the President , decided to use its powers to take Nixon on . It was plaintive and pathetic and , yes , more than a little bit crazy . The Trump Presidency , to those closely watching it , and to many of those participating in it , has always seemed unsustainable . Every day since January 20 , 2017 , has been the crisis . added to the ever-accumulating picture of chaos , mendacity , fear , embattlement , and contempt for the President even within his senior staff . But having this state of affairs described in print further establishes that an unelected body , or bodies , are overruling and actively undermining the elected leader . An anonymous person or persons can not govern for the people , because the people do not know who is governing . The Op-Ed section is separate from the news operation , but , in protecting the identity of the person who wrote the Op-Ed , the paper forfeits the job of holding power to account . An anonymous Op-Ed is a very rare thing . They evidently concluded that the information contained in the piece was important enough to justify sidestepping normal journalistic practices and principles . The thing about autocracies , or budding autocracies , is that they present citizens with only bad choices . At a certain point , one has to stop trying to find the right solution and has to look , instead , for a course of action that avoids complicity . The media are being corrupted every time they engage with a nonsensical , false , or hateful Trump tweet -LRB- although not engaging with these tweets is not an option -RRB- . They are being corrupted every time journalists act polite while the President , his press secretary , or other Administration officials lie to them . They are being corrupted every time journalists allow the Administration to frame an issue , like when they engage in a discussion about whether the separation of children from their parents at the border is an effective deterrent against illegal immigration . A lack of transparency in government is a constitutional crisis in the making , not an unrecognized feat of heroism . Also , one must note that the author of the Op-Ed is very much singing his own praises , albeit anonymously . -LRB- For now , anyway . This is unarguably true , but , as it appears in this Op-Ed , it is also a lie . There is a meaningful distinction between those who have actually resisted , or at least not aided , this Administration and those who work for it . This familiar sentiment seems utterly unrelated to the rest of the piece , but it is serving a purpose here . He is also inveighing against politics . In doing this , he is lying twice . A person who works for probably the most aggressively partisan Administration in American history has no business asking anyone to reach across the aisle , and his implied claim of common cause with bipartisanship is a lie . Politics is not the opposite of common ground ; politics is the very process of finding common ground and making it inhabitable . Trump has been waging war on politics itself for more than two years . The anonymous member of his Administration who is bragging about his membership in a secret government has just opened a second front in this war . Gessen is a visiting professor at Amherst College and the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship , an Andrew Carnegie Fellowship , a Nieman Fellowship , and the Overseas Press Club Award for Best Commentary . It was just smug , drab stuff .
