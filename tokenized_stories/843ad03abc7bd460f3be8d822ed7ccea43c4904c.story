In a press conference , Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters outlined the damage caused near Gatlinburg , Tennessee , including the 14 deaths , the evacuation of 14,000 people , and damage to 2,400 structures . The wildfire was initially started on November 28 , spreading violently because of dry conditions , a heavy volume of leaves , and strong winds . The situation was made worse was a breakdown of communication between officials because of damage to local cellphone towers , not allowing the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency to act quickly . The fires near Gatlinburg were eventually put out , but not before extensive damage and a partial closure of Great Smoky Mountains National Park . Last week , two teenage boys were arrested and charged with arson for their role in the fire . It was unclear how the wildfires were exactly started .

The bill , called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act , was one of two abortion measures passed by Ohio lawmakers last week . Neither bill made exceptions for cases of rape or incest .

Yasmeen Serhan Dec. 13 , 2016 , 1:29 p.m. Tweet Share Assad Has Full Control of Aleppo ; Evacuation Deal Approved People carry their belongings as they flee deeper into the remaining rebel-held areas of Aleppo on December 13 , 2016 . The announcement came shortly after Syrian rebels and Russian officials confirmed an agreement to evacuate those remaining in the last rebel-held districts of eastern Aleppo . The deal comes amid reports of heightened violence in four neighborhoods of eastern Aleppo , where the UN estimates at least 82 civilians , including 11 women and 13 children , have been killed by Syrian government forces . The Syrian government has denied the claim . J. Weston Phippen Dec. 13 , 2016 , 10:27 a.m. . The news was widely expected , but the formal announcement came with little interest from state-owned Russian news agencies , which are widely regarded to be pro-Kremlin . Navalny has no political background , but he gained national attention during the anti-Putin demonstrations in 2011 , and has published many critical reports about corrupt Russian politicians . He has been charged with fraud , though he has called it a political attack . If he is re-convicted , he will most likely be banned from the election .

The leak is about 150 miles west of Cannon Ball , where protesters successfully fought the construction of the North Dakota Access Pipeline . The spill began earlier this month , in a segment of the Belle Fourche Pipeline near Belfied , North Dakota . Instead , a private landowner discovered the spill after it had already dumped more than 46,000 gallons onto a hillside , and 130,000 gallons into the river , contaminating the water for up to six miles . Crews are working to clean up the spill , but since the pipelines burst the river has frozen over so it may take until the spring until all the crude is cleaned . True Companies has a history of oil spills in the region , with three reported since 2006 , including one that leaked 30,000 gallons into the Yellowstone River . This pipeline was built in the 1980s and carried 1,000 barrels of oil each day . Krishnadev Calamur Dec. 13 , 2016 , 7:50 a.m. . The killings occurred in Bustan al-Qasr , al-Ferdous , al-Kallaseh , and al-Saleheen neighborhoods , he said . The rebels are on the brink of defeat in eastern Aleppo , their last major stronghold . Human-rights groups say the Syrian troops are committing atrocities on civilians and rebels ; the Syrian government denies the charge . The absence of international monitors makes the assessments difficult to gauge , but accounts on social media present a bleak picture . Tillerson , a longtime Exxon executive , has no political or diplomatic experience , but he is known to be close to Russia , where President Vladimir Putin awarded him the Order of Friendship , an award given to foreign nationals who work to improve relations with Russia . Conspiracy theories . Attacks on the free press . An obsession with loyalty . Recent events in the United States follow a pattern Europeans know all too well . On December 31 , 1999 , we threw a party . It was the end of one millennium and the start of a new one ; people very much wanted to celebrate , preferably somewhere exotic . Our party fulfilled that criterion . We held it at Chobielin , the manor house in northwest Poland that my husband and his parents had purchased a decade earlier , when it was a mildewed ruin . We had restored the house , very slowly . It was not exactly finished in 1999 , but it did have a new roof . To hear more feature stories , see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app . The guests were various : journalist friends from London and Berlin , a few diplomats based in Warsaw , two friends who flew in from New York . But most of them were Poles , friends of ours and colleagues of my husband , who was then a deputy foreign minister in the Polish government .

New York City may be the logical extreme of this . Now her outspokenness on sexism could cost her everything . When Beth Moore arrived in Houston in the 1980s , she found few models for young women who wanted to teach scripture . Many conservative Christian denominations believed that women should not hold authority over men , whether in church or at home ; many denominations still believe this . In some congregations , women could not speak from the lectern on a Sunday or even read the Bible in front of men . But Moore was resolute : God , she felt , had called her to serve . In tiny church social halls , she laid the cornerstone of an evangelical empire . Really , the blame rests totally on my shoulders . He was headed to a prestigious college . I was headed to a small , obscure liberal-arts college , which was a tremendous achievement , not just because I was a terrible student , but also because I had nearly killed myself as a response to what he apologized for in my yearbook . We need to do everything we can to fight back . I hoped that my fears for our future were overblown . They were not . In the roughly 21 months since he took the oath of office , Trump has sunk far below the already-low bar he set for himself in his ugly campaign . Exhibit A is the unspeakable cruelty that his administration has inflicted on undocumented families arriving at the border , including separating children , some as young as eight months , from their parents . According to The New York Times , the administration continues to detain 12,800 children right now , despite all the outcry and court orders . Some 3,000 Americans died . Now Trump flatly denies those deaths were caused by the storm . The dubious notion that philosophy is a guide to calmer living is as old as the field itself . He shows off a few steps from his dance routine to a small group of acquaintances once he arrives at the Four Seasons hotel . The year was 2015 . She was 15 at the time . That he groped her , grinding his body against hers . That he tried to remove her clothes , and then the bathing suit she wore underneath them . That he put his hand over her mouth , to muffle her screams . Watch Video Meet Thousands of Twins in Twinsburg Emily Buder Identical twins convene for an annual festival in Ohio .
