After months of courageously and peacefully working to prevent the laying of the Dakota Access Pipeline , which posed potential danger to the water supply of the people of the Sioux Nation and transgressed their sacred burial grounds , the water protectors on Standing Rock have won a notable victory . On behalf of the Episcopal Church , I offer my gratitude to President Barack Obama and his Administration for championing the rights of the indigenous peoples of the United States . We applaud the decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to deny the pipeline permit under Lake Oahe . I personally offer thanks to all those who have worked to amplify the voices of the people at Standing Rock , calling our attention to historic wrongs and injustices , and urging us all to consider a new vision for how we might love God , love each other and love creation . I am equally appreciative of the sacrifice and example of the military veterans , interfaith clergy and trauma chaplains who accompanied the Water Protectors during critical moments of the struggle . Even as our Church celebrates this historic announcement , we must also look to the mighty tasks that lay ahead . In the next eighteen months , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will conduct an Environmental Impact Statement to explore alternative routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline . We ask that the assessment involve extensive consultation with affected populations , and that any plan going forward honor treaty obligations with the Standing Rock Sioux . We will also continue to urge the current and incoming presidential administration to launch a thorough Department of Justice investigation into the use of brutal force by law enforcement on Standing Rock . Our work is not over , and the Episcopal Church has a critical role to play in ensuring a just and humane outcome is fully realized . We recognize that this struggle for the protection of water and of the basic human rights of indigenous people is one moment in a wider movement for social and environmental justice . He is a clergyman , not a scientist . I rather doubt that . He is ultimately just weighing in politically . Ronald Davin says : December 7 , 2016 at 7:57 pm Probably make coffee for the police who were brought out there . He never lead a disobedience campaign against Rome . M. Shelton says : December 5 , 2016 at 8:26 pm Recognizing the holiness in all peoples ; may we never ask anything less of our faith leaders . What bold leadership . Michael Gillulm says : December 5 , 2016 at 5:24 pm Obviously not political . If the energy company had wanted to build a pipeline thru the middle of a white cemetary , there would be HELL to pay . Beth Ramsay says : December 5 , 2016 at 5:42 pm Please refer to him with politeness using a proper title . You may not agree with him , but this gentle man is the leader of a church denomination and deserves to referred to by Bishop Curry . Katharine Flowers says : December 5 , 2016 at 9:04 pm And thank God for Michael Curry and the Episcopal Church . We stand above ignorance . Wanda Valentine says : December 6 , 2016 at 12:33 am Amen Jo Carson says : December 5 , 2016 at 9:27 pm Well , as our Advent season has begun , our Episcopal priest has been very clear in the message of love for all . Just this second Sunday of Advent -LRB- Peace -RRB- , we were challenged to reach out to all and support them as fellow humans . We feed the hungry and work to house the homeless . Social justice is about how much love for our fellow man we can muster . Politics is a worthy endeavor . Our church has been involved in the very foundations of this country . Mary Hennessy says : December 5 , 2016 at 10:47 pm Defense of basic human rights is not political . It is a moral obligation . Jean Paveglio says : December 5 , 2016 at 11:55 pm Water is sacred , and whether you are atheist , Roman Catholic , Jewish , Indian you should speak out about clean water for every living person . This is not a political issue nor is it a religious issue , it is an issue of the survival of the human race and of the planet . Jane Maslanka says : December 6 , 2016 at 8:01 pm Sir , by your logic , Dr. Martin Luther King , Bishop Desmond Tutu , and Dietrich Bonhoeffer had no business getting involved in politics . That position is , frankly , ludicrous . Jean Dowell says : December 7 , 2016 at 2:42 am Speaking out to save all of creation is a solemn responsibility of religious leaders . Alan Justice says : December 5 , 2016 at 5:05 pm As a citizen , PB Curry has every right to speak his mind . As the leader of the Episcopal Church , he has the duty to advocate for justice , economic and otherwise . That is entirely within the realm of the Episcopal mission . M. J. Wise says : December 5 , 2016 at 5:09 pm Someone should let the PB know that there is a major administration change not even 2 months away . I refuse to believe he is so naive . For a church that pride itself as holding scripture , tradition , and reason with equal regard , this PB appears to only have two colors of crayons to work with . M. J. Wise says : December 5 , 2016 at 5:42 pm No , good and evil . One side he has declared good , and the other side he has declared to be evil . This is a human justice issue . This is Moses telling Pharaoh let my people go . This is those in power speaking for those without power . This is about a nation which continues to commit crimes against the indigenous people of this land and saying no more . This is the job of all Christians to stand up for the oppressed and as the leader of the Episcopal Church in this country this is very much his role . Speaking out against greed is what the one whom we follow did and this is an issue of greed . Jack Hanstein says : December 5 , 2016 at 5:16 pm Thank you Bishop , and we stand with you as this process unfolds . He pointed out that there are , as he put it , mighty tasks that lie ahead . I stand with him in celebration , and with a vigilant eye to the future . To the police seeing that vandalism be kept to a minimum , the P.B. does not see the damaged expensive vehicles . Tough luck To the people of the area communities who had to pay in their taxes for the law enforcement deployment Tough luck To the World War 2 veterans whose Monument in Washington DC was defaced by supporters of this movement . Our Episcopal Church Anything but fair or balanced . Finally for the deputy sheriff who was fired on 3 times with a 38 pistol , Tough luck Rob Neville says : December 5 , 2016 at 10:06 pm To the people of Illinois : If you think this pipeline was for your benefit you are sorely mistaken . This is so the companies that want to refine the oil can bring it to market and the refineries cheaper so they can make more profit . Oil prices are global not local . This is a power play by those who already have more than they could ever need or want taking more and getting the poor to fight the poor to protect their profits . They get tax write offs too in the way of oil depletion allowances . The electricity has to be generated from some source , most likely coal or natural gas or hydroelectric power . Rebecca C. Cawley says : December 5 , 2016 at 7:11 pm i believe we are called to be good stewards of the earth . Thank you Bishop Curry for showing us the way . Cn . Your advocacy and support is appreciated . I too stand and celebrate for Standing Rock . Margaret Lesh says : December 5 , 2016 at 7:21 pm Thank you , Bishop Curry . Nancy Studebaker says : December 5 , 2016 at 7:25 pm Proud to be Episcopalian . Thank you , Bishop Curry . Thank you . Priscilla Johnstone says : December 5 , 2016 at 7:32 pm Proud of our church and our PB that stood with Native Americans who have been and in this case clearly were disenfranchised by the powers of influence and money . Easy to overlook and ignore the people of Flint and the Standing Rock people : Not in my backyard , not my problem . Glad that we are following the Jesus movement by speaking out , supporting , praying , feeding the dispossessed and that we are also inviting a more peaceful and enlightened response by those in power . There is only the post-truth promulgated by social media , news media , and people who are jumping on the most recent bandwagon . Ignoring or distorting facts is widespread in this country . There is too much real injustice in the world that needs to be focused on and that is where we can truly make a positive difference . Thea Brown says : December 5 , 2016 at 8:43 pm Some of the negative comments here are both astounding and disappointing . I think this is the time when we all must stand up and be counted . I am glad that he is leading by example in this way . Marybeth Wright says : December 5 , 2016 at 8:50 pm Thank you so very much PB Curry . PB Curry is expressing his views and not those of us who do not agree . protecting water supplies and sacred ground are human issues that were politicized for the sake of profit . That book is a great help in understanding a sizable portion of our population and knowing how to respond to them . John Jennings says : December 5 , 2016 at 10:27 pm Proud of our faith and our Episcopal leadership . Thank you , Bishop Curry . Barbara Harber says : December 5 , 2016 at 10:28 pm Whether I agree or disagree with the position taken , the church must reclaim its rightful place as city , community , national voice on issues vital to the people . Maybe not from the Sunday pulpit , but on the Monday street corner . Sandy Cooke says : December 5 , 2016 at 11:11 pm Thank you , Bishop Curry , for all that you do . Linda Light says : December 6 , 2016 at 12:23 am Bishop Curry , You ask that there be extensive consultation and decisions made in the future for the pipeline be in keeping with the current Treaties . There were representatives from the court and the Corp of Engineers who even went to a meeting scheduled around tribal leadership meetings so as to be convenient for the tribal leaders to attend right at their own meeting location and the tribal leaders adjourned and would not even meet with the representatives . The Sioux blew off the whole issue when they might have stopped this using appropriate channels . The Sioux simply threw a giant tantrum when it was too late to go thru appropriate channels . It sure looks like they wanted a reason to cause a ruckus . I understand that you need to support the North Dakota Epicopalians who chose to side with protestors . There are Episcopalians in the Corp of Engineers , too . The Sioux Tribe failed in their responsibility to provide feed back . Your statements imply that the Corps of Engineers did not do an honest job in their impact study and that they allowed treaty violations and destruction of burial grounds . That is untrue . It would be nice if you could also demonstrate by what you say that you have actually looked at both sides of an issue rather than saying statements that make you sound like you did not educate yourself about both sides of this issue . It would also be nice if you refrained from praising people who endangered others because they would rather make a ruckus than even attempt to use the channels in place . Had they used the channels in place , perhaps all the time and effort they spent protesting could have been put to a constructive use . He lifts me up . Grateful to have his lead to follow . Vicki Gray says : December 6 , 2016 at 12:42 am With love and respect , thank you , Michael . Comments navigation Newer comments Comments are closed . You have reached our comment limit of 5 .
