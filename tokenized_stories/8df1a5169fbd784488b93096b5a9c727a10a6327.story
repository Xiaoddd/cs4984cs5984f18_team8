Obama , Hillary , and Trump have not said a word about the pillaging of land and water , or the fact that attack dogs have been unleashed on protesters just as they were during 1960s civil rights demonstrations . Hamm is the founder and CEO of Continental Resources , which is heavily involved in the fracking boom going on in the Bakken Shale basin . To secure their pipeline route , state and local governments granted eminent domain to Dakota Access for massive areas of land . Iowa farmers who did not want an oil pipeline with 50-foot easements running through their agricultural land had no choice as regulators , salivating at the millions in tax revenue , rubber-stamped the property seizures . The pipeline company and its subcontractors intimidated reluctant landowners by stacking pipe next to their property , acting as if construction were a foregone conclusion . Back in the Dakotas , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe attempted to get a federal court to stop construction crews from bulldozing through their ancient burial grounds . While waiting on government for help that will probably not come , the tribe rushed to defend their sacred ground . The Standing Rock tribe is awaiting a decision from a federal judge in their lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for granting fast-track authorization of DAPL , bypassing more stringent environmental and cultural review requirements . However , the revolving door of the Corps and corporate actors means there is little hope of a positive outcome for the tribe . Not only has the pipeline already ruined sacred burial sites , but it is set to threaten the water source of Standing Rock and millions of others by being bored underneath the Missouri River . Trump has proclaimed his intention to keep America chained to the toxic dinosaur of fossil fuels , promising to ramp up coal production and shun renewable energies .
